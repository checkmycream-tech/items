            <li>I didn&#x27;t use it to trim my hair, but I would recommend getting one for yourself and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll work great, as it does for beard trimming!  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s easy to hold, holds a charge for a substantial amount of time, and best of all, it cuts fantastically.</li>
            <li>Braun makes a good trimmer</li>
            <li>THis did not work good at all.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good for, too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclaimer: I got this for free from BZZ Campaigns but either way this is one awesome product either way</li>
            <li>, if you could call it a downside, is that the hair will stick to the handle, since its rubber, but all you have to do is run it under water and it should be good.</li>
            <li>the combs is not that good</li>
            <li>Good beard trimmer</li>

            <li>Maintaining a good looking beard is an art form.  </li>
            <li>The good and the bad:&lt;br /&gt;(Disclaimer)</li>
            <li>I recieved this awesome trimmer free via bzzagent and had the opportunity to test and review the product.</li>
            <li>I give this product a five star rating because it has a great design, it works well in the shower and is effective at shaving.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made by Braun, and I&#x27;ve had nothing but good experience with that brand.</li>
            <li>Works like a charm - good product.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is good and meets all of my needs however , cleaning it up is a pain and Power consumption is an issue</li>
            <li>then it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good trimmer didn&#x27;t used for my head yet but good with beard .</li>

            <li>Well built, looks good and, works well</li>
            <li>He said this trimmer works great and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To conclude this is an exceptional beard trimmer yet sub-par head trimmer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall he is very pleased.  </li>
            <li>This is a great trimmer, I am able to take it with me on road trips and when i go elsewhere for the weekend.</li>
            <li>I received this product for free as part of a Bzz Agent campaign, and truthfully, this thing is awesome.</li>
            <li>very strong with a good battery.  </li>
            <li>but it got better from there!</li>
            <li>I love this trimmer!</li>
            <li>and I love that its cordless!</li>
            <li>Probably the best beard trimmer I have ever owned and such good value!</li>
            <li>I love this grooming tool!</li>
            <li>I love it and will keep on using it!</li>
            <li>Many trim options without the hassle of changing heads!</li>
            <li>However, I do love how cleanly it cuts my beard and keeps it at my preferred perfect length.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and shaved great.</li>
            <li>The best one I have owned since I had a full beard, many years.</li>
            <li>Arrived fine and both work great.</li>
            <li>Rather light and may not survive a drop, but at the selling price, a great value nonetheless.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a great shaver, I recommend this shaver and you will enjoy using this at the sink or even in the shower because it is waterproof.</li>
            <li>Lets get to the Real important things.    </li>
            <li>Otherwise, this thing is amazing for the money.</li>

            <li>It is waterproof, it cuts beards, it is rechargeable, it fits the hand nicely.</li>

            <li>Very easy to use</li>

            <li>This product was sent to me for free by the kind people at BzzAgent to use, test and review!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon</li>
            <li>I knew I would love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It would work so much better if it had just a tad-bit more juice.</li>

            <li>I received this product for free through a promotional trial and was asked to write my honest opinion about it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Throw away all the times you were told not to stick electronics under water, it&#x27;s safe.</li>
            <li>yeah, I should probably mention I got it for free from BzzAgent!)</li>
            <li>I have only used this as a trimmer and had great results!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Other then that the trimmer is awesome because it has 2 detachable heads for different variable lengths.</li>
            <li>It functioned as it was designed with many options to choose from when changing the length of the clip.</li>
            <li>For the price this is ranked in my top 3.</li>

            <li>Definitely the best trimmer I have ever had.</li>
            <li>Why would you spend more or go anywhere else to get one.</li>
            <li>Does exactly as advertised, great battery life on a very quick charge.</li>
            <li>I was originally worried about the plastic used in this razor, however after repeated (ab)use, it is amazing.</li>
            <li>The product is amazing and extremely useful!</li>
            <li>There are better products available but this one is a great cheaper alternative very comparable to its competition.  </li>
            <li>Clearly, the second option won out, and I&#x27;m happy to say that it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>It is the best one I have ever used and holds its charge for an exceedingly long amount of time.</li>
            <li>keeps me looking  good with a clean cut when i need to for special occasions.</li>

            <li>I love it and its easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I am not particular impressed</li>
            <li>I shopped quite a bit on Amazon and found this odd-looking trimmer to be the best combination of high customer ratings and reasonable price.</li>
            <li>This is great or trimming your beard/hair and being fully washable you can take it near and around the shower without worrying about ruining it.</li>
            <li>This was the best money I spent on a shaving product, period.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First impressions of the Old Spice Beard trimmer were great.  </li>
            <li>nice and light - not the heaviest duty clippers I&#x27;ve owned but will serve its purpose for a quick trim.</li>
            <li>Otherwise the razor is waterproof, and its head comes apart for easy cleaning.</li>
            <li>i was surprise how easy the adjusting combs are to interchange and the level of precision it provides.</li>
            <li>Also quite easy with this trimmer.</li>
            <li>Its easy to pack and travel with and still sensible to use at home.</li>
            <li>The guides are also easy to use.</li>
            <li>and easy to change lengths.</li>
            <li>It is sleek and easy to handle and store.</li>
            <li>Easy cleanup</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll save hundreds of dollars in haircuts, easily.</li>
            <li>It was easy to take off and replace with another.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is easy to handle and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s washable so easy to keep tide</li>
            <li>Easy to use, shaped to be held in our hand.  </li>
            <li>Awsome product ...simple, easy to use and works as described</li>
            <li>Easy to rinse off, easy to charge.</li>
            <li>Still going strong.</li>
            <li>Charges fine.  </li>
            <li>But pay attention to the fine print: it is a NiCad battery from the hints in the writeup.</li>
            <li>ignore the name on it and enjoy the fine quality</li>
            <li>The Trimmers raw power easily shaved me bald in about 2 minutes which is extremely impressive.</li>
            <li>Charges well cuts well easy to clean.</li>
            <li>So lets start out that by the picture I thought this thing looks cheap.</li>
            <li>Smooth, sleek design</li>
            <li>is really nice but the power on this thing is really low.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its adjustable and rechargeable and those were two important factors I was looking for.</li>
            <li>so it has a bit of a cheap feel to it</li>
            <li>But I find this one easy to use and clean and it works.</li>
            <li>Really nice trimmer that holds its charge very well.</li>
            <li>Smooth cut and no pulling.</li>
            <li>Overall I think they did a great job with the design</li>
            <li>sure, now I have two trimmers, but the time I save, is worth the problem of keeping the two devices charged.</li>
            <li>Its just an overall great shaver</li>
            <li>Really easy to clean and use.  </li>
            <li>The sound stops once it&#x27;s fully charged.</li>
            <li>I got this item free to try, I am a Bzz Agent.  </li>
            <li>I received the product for free, to try and review, from Braun.</li>
            <li>I received this trimmer for free from being a BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like to spend alot but get the same great product this is the one to get.</li>
            <li>Then again it was cheap</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really smooth and is just really handy to have for someone who likes to keep their personal hygiene with their hair nice.</li>
            <li>The trim was even and comfortable.</li>
            <li>I thoroughly enjoy using this trimmer.</li>
            <li>I got this trimmer for free from Bzzagent, which sent me a retail version of the product for me to review.</li>
            <li>Different length settings are great.  </li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:mo2WPCJQD1MEKGB]]The Old Spice Beard &amp; Head Trimmer (powered by Braun) will provide a good trim for those looking to trim their beards or cut their hair.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t operate as strongly as I thought it would, even on a full charge.</li>
            <li>and I can have a very nice, clean and short beard.</li>
            <li>For the price that is.....&lt;br /&gt;Pros-price, adjustable lengths, GREAT battery life, sleek, trims close(but not really close), easy to use and clean&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because it had one of the longest length cuts I could find originally...</li>
            <li>and when i received it i was excited to use it.</li>
            <li>I was really excited about using it to trim my beard.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So far, I am very pleased with this beard and head trimmer.</li>
            <li>I use it even when I don&#x27;t need to really, because it&#x27;s kind of fun.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind however, that this will not give you a clean shave.</li>
            <li>it weakening WHILE USING IT thus, not getting a clean trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A pro is that the trimmer is light to the feel and it charges somewhat quickly.</li>
            <li>After the head shave, I had a some clean up to do.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is powerful, precise, holds a good charge, is quiet and doesn&#x27;t vibrate too much, is easy to hold/grip.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer had a good weight to it, the plastics felt like high quality, and the color scheme was manly and modern.  </li>
            <li>Pros: Easy to use, charges quickly, works well on beard and head hair, easy to clean, and really cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Love this product first timer and its worth your money...</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this item if you are looking for a good and reliable trimmer.</li>
            <li>Overall it is good trimmer and hair clipper based on price.</li>
            <li>This does a good job and makes short work of it.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone that needs full management of any length of hair.</li>
            <li>The battery has a good life span, have never had it run out of charge mid shave.  </li>
            <li>I do charge it after every use to keep full power though</li>
            <li>It hold a good charge for multiple uses.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However it charges fast and keeps a charge well, is fully water proof (I&#x27;ve used it in the shower many times under full water running).</li>
            <li>Not a bad trimmer, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>You are one click away from changing the size and giving a very effective, less noisy, and easy trim to anyone&#x27;s hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>I used it on my beard yesterday and love it just as much as I did the first time I used it!</li>
            <li>Width is nice and short for accurate beard trimming but takes a while if you want to shave your head with it.</li>
            <li>It works well cordless or plugged in, and recharges quickly.</li>
            <li>Simple yet very appealing and professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I RECIEVED THIS PRODUCT TO TRY FROM BUZZ AGENT FOR FREE, UPON USING IT FOR THE FIRST TIME</li>
            <li>Multiple adjustable trim lengths are great for many different options.</li>
            <li>First and formost , I would like to thank bzzagent for givng me this free product to try.</li>
            <li>Still using this trimmer, it&#x27;s bean a long time and a good trimmer.</li>
            <li>The cutting and trimming is great and the smaller size of this trimmer is a perfect fit in your hand.  </li>
            <li>Overall this is a great product that i would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use and works very well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and very versatile.</li>
            <li>This is so much better than my old beard trimmer!</li>
            <li>I was able to easily take the comb off so that I could trim around my upper lip.</li>
            <li>It works okay, but if I could do it over again I&#x27;d buy another cheap Wahl that works much better and is half the price.</li>
            <li>I received this product for free from Braun to test and review by thanks of [...]  </li>
            <li>So far I love this trimmer</li>
            <li>Did they have this kind of thing back then?  </li>
            <li>This trimmer not only feels good in your hands but also cuts very smoothly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love Old Spice products and wanted this one to be just as awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it once or twice a week to keep myself looking fresh.</li>
            <li>I felt it was worth the cost.</li>
            <li>This product was a cool trimmer and a pretty neat concept.</li>
            <li>I researched the price and it&#x27;s costly but worth it.  </li>
            <li>Sized right and fits my hand well.  </li>
            <li>Turned on without needing charged right away.</li>
            <li>and it still never got it right.</li>
            <li>I like my beard grown out just the right amount and with a trimmer, its all or nothing.</li>
            <li>the job done and the price is right.</li>
            <li>Balance in the hand is &#x27;just right&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>They are &#x27;older&#x27; and my Father in Law gave his review &amp;#34;light weight, precise, gets the job done&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Not bad for what most people will only classify as a beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s comfortable to use, the length settings are easy enough to adjust and stay locked into place.  </li>
            <li>Excellent quality for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the same 8 years old Conair Beard Trimmer all this time but the battery was finally failing so</li>
            <li>so I would shave it off regularly because I did not have a suitable way to keep it trimmed.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;it feels good in your hands with its rubber handle and the battery lasts pretty long, i haven&#x27;t really had to charge it in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, easy to charge and the battery lasts a long time(yes</li>
            <li>normally trim my beard pretty low leaving just a &amp;#34;shadow&amp;#34; on my face that looks pretty good.</li>
            <li>After using it for a month or so, it still runs just as smooth as if new.</li>
            <li>Not only do the attachments allow for easy use but the cut is so clean with no pulling and tugging that my face isn&#x27;t irritated and rashed out afterwards.</li>
            <li>A quick rinse under running water (no dis-assembly required!!) was enough to do the job, and any additional hairs could be swept off with the included brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lastly, I would like to conclude with a very important point.</li>
            <li>/&gt;would not switch soo fast!</li>
            <li>Thank you Old Spice (and BZZ), for a Fantastic Product and the Chance to Try it out for</li>
            <li>i got this free courtesy of bzzagent and old spice beard and head trimmer, powered by braun</li>
            <li>I more electronics to last me a week</li>
            <li>Although I will say the adjustable all-in one guard is nothing short of ingenious.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Many rechargeables don&#x27;t do that; my last one (Remington) didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Trims my beard evenly and the charge lasts for more than enough time.</li>
            <li>she told me it helped her get a better shave before she used her traditional razor.</li>
            <li>This Old Spice version is nearly identical, but this one is much more powerful and gives a better cut without having to run over one area multiple times.</li>
            <li>I do like the idea of being able to charge and use the trimmer at the same time but either way its under powered and pulls hair rather than cut.</li>
            <li>He says it&#x27;s comfortable in his hand and feels substantial but not heavy.</li>
            <li>Some of the credit goes to Julian Payne, owner, founder, and world record holder from The Original Mobile Barbershop Co. in Los Angeles, and some of the credit goes to my cool new Old Spice razor!</li>
            <li>Altough, having a manly beard as I usually do is not that simply to find a good set up for the high of the razors.</li>
            <li>It mgith do better on thinner and less filled beards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Trims hair with no pull or catching (Sharp and Fast!).</li>
            <li>Blades do not pull hairs and are sharp and effective.  </li>
            <li>It actually has two different attachments which appear to stay on well so far...one for the shorter to medium lengths and one for the medium to longer cuts...and it also trims fairly close with no attachments.</li>
            <li>Old Spice product was free thanks to bzzagent</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and got here fast</li>
            <li>A great value for the price especially when compared to other trimmers on the market.</li>
            <li>Works ok on long beards.</li>
            <li>The Old Spice Braun Beard and head trimmer will help keep you looking more like Tony Stark and your wife will love you for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would suggest this product to anyone who wants a quick cut anywhere even those sensitive areas at anytime!</li>
            <li>: needs frequent cleaning , may not be suitable for coarse hair .</li>
            <li>I like that its easily adjustable for different lengths</li>
            <li>it was easy to open.</li>
            <li>The trimmer was fairly quiet when turned on (quiter than the Schick easily).</li>
            <li>Pure garbage.  </li>
            <li>The red and black looked great together and it added to the \\&quot;sporty\\&quot; feel</li>
            <li>it trims very well easy to use with the two different heads.</li>
            <li>I would happily replace this trimmer with the exact same product, rather than seeking out something different in the future, should this product ever stop working.</li>
            <li>works well, battery lasts, and the guards (x2, ps) adjust easily and go from super long to super short, which makes it perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>recieved this one and was a little worried that the head would be too large to trim my mustache effectively.</li>
            <li>i very high pitch noise.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Still works after six months, and trim cuts very well,&lt;br /&gt;I have had no problems with this unit.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>really works well</li>
            <li>/&gt;The two attachments really give you a lot of options on what you are trying to do with millimeter sizes (1,3,5,7,9,11mm and 10-20)</li>
            <li>choose to primarily use the trimmer on my beard and mustache, although the guards would definitely suit someone who also uses it to perform haircuts on themselves or others.</li>
            <li>look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a fantastic product, and will definitely be using it often!</li>
            <li>He hasn&#x27;t had any issues with it and it cuts really well.</li>
            <li>Does everything it&#x27;s supposed to and does these functions very well.</li>
            <li>-Does not do a really close shave</li>
            <li>, it helps, it really does.</li>
            <li>but now I would try to replace my defunct hair trimmer with &#x27;modern&#x27; technology.</li>
            <li>Looked promising from the specs and reviews.</li>
            <li>Seems to do the job really well.  </li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t used to a trimmer that cut so effortlessly.</li>
            <li>The battery light suddenly stopped lighting up couple of weeks ago when plugged-in to charge.</li>
            <li>It works very well</li>
            <li>Cuts well enough but cheaply made.</li>
            <li>It allows him to give himself that day-old beard look he wants.</li>
            <li>(was extremely drunk and still got a near perfect shave.</li>
            <li>Nice trimmer, however it does not have enough individual length settings.  </li>
            <li>To me it is very similar in quality to many others which may be at a  lower price point than the Old Spice Head &amp; Beard</li>
            <li>The trimming itself does a pretty good job keeping the facial hair at the same constant rate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seriously though, I haven&#x27;t had it jam or over heat on me so far and trims great.</li>
            <li>I also liked the idea of having two guides and tons of settings but none are long enough for a real beard.</li>
            <li>Original review: As others have pointed out, the motor is a little anemic but it cuts great, you just have to do about 10 passes if you&#x27;re trimming down your beard from 11mm to 5mm like I did (old trimmer broke).</li>
            <li>Used on short hair on my head and had to clean the hair from the cutter almost with each pass.</li>
            <li>It easily trimmed my not very thick or coarse mustache.</li>
            <li>I can live with those times as I really won&#x27;t be using it all that much each week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To start, I do not have much of a beard, However what little I do have looks so much better than with most other trimmers!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works pretty well so far</li>
            <li>love the beard trimmer it has yet to let me down.</li>
            <li>Love it, cuts well, but has lost it&#x27;s ability to hold a charge after less than a month.</li>
            <li>Easily adjustable over a wide range.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never gotten a decent trim because of this</li>
            <li>My son wanted a beard trimmer to replace an older one that wasn&#x27;t working well at all.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li>Highly, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend giving this trimmer a shot.  </li>
            <li>Very good cutting blades - give good/clean cut.  </li>
            <li>The very first thing I noticed when I began to charge my new Old Spice Beard &amp; Head Trimmer was that the charger made a very high, low screeching noise from the charger.</li>
            <li>Instead of the buzz load enough to make me deaf, the calm, almost whisper-silent trimmer, started its work.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another note - my old Remington buzzer had about 3 feet of straight cord.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel like it would break under normal circumstances.</li>
            <li>I could go all the way from burly mountain man to sexy five-o-clock shadow with just a few clicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it would work okay on thin hair (like arm hair or something) but for thicker facial hair... not satisfactory.</li>
            <li>and I had rarely used it back then.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Build of product: When i start to hold on to this old spice product , it felt nice and slick.</li>
            <li>Granted you can&#x27;t hear it more than say a few feet</li>
            <li>Its a good concept but poorly made.</li>
            <li>it had a nice Sleek Black and Red color that just spoke \\&quot;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>What I like most about this is that it&#x27;s efficient , saves the environment from pollution of regular battery&#x27;s, and saves you money from not buying battery&#x27;s at the store every single week</li>
            <li>Personally I wouldn&#x27;t buy it with the product as it is right now</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done several beard trims and several haircuts (on myself) now ... and the unit works just fine.  </li>
            <li>When extended to certain lengths, there are gaps on the sides of the guide that would allow hair to accidentally come in contact with the blade and end up being cut much shorter than the actual guide length.  </li>
            <li>i had been looking for a new hair trimmer for some time now</li>
            <li>Was cheaper to buy new unit then to buy power cord.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments on my new haircut.</li>
            <li>Was hoping for better quality and functionality since I use Old Spice products, but I feel this product is one that relies heavily on name dropper reputation for its marketing model.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at just how smooth it ran, and how easily it shaved my rather thick facial hair.</li>
            <li>his older 4 year old brother.</li>
            <li>Safe enough for kid use with minimal advisement.    </li>
            <li>With the Old Spice trimmer, it is easy to keep my facial hair trimmed as short as I like it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not much more than the cheap throw away trimmers you can pickup at the local big box store, and it feels and performs much better.  </li>
            <li>What I love about this thing that not many cordless trimmers can do is it can be used with the cord or without</li>
            <li>Exactly the same model as the Braun Cruzer trimmer but cheaper.</li>
            <li>Ive used it daily since its arrival and it doesnt get hot like some do.</li>
            <li>My only criticism is labeling the head and beard more specifically, I made that mistale once on my head and the outcome was not petty but other than that it works well.</li>
            <li>I recommend this trimmer to anyone, even if you don&#x27;t wear Old Spice!</li>
            <li>This is basically a Braun Cruzer 5 Beard and Head Trimmer, This is branded as Old Spice Beard and Head Trimmer and is $10.00 cheaper!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t recommend this product if you like your facial hair very short, because you won&#x27;t be able to get it that short.</li>
            <li>First, The trimmer design and aesthetics are very slick and compact making it easy to grip.</li>
            <li>As soon as I started using my Old Spice trimmer, I knew they would be replacing my old trimmers!</li>
            <li>The little LED will light up indicating charge and when done, it&#x27;ll just turn off to let you know.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so you have to take it off a lot and clear it</li>
            <li>I only really ever noticed it when I was near it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can take the guard off and press it directly on my hairs and watch them bounce off, it can take 2-3 attempts to see it get cut.</li>
            <li>When placing it directly on my face to trim the edges of my beard</li>
            <li>My 10 year old trimmer (which I lost my beard guard for) has never had this issue or needed</li>
            <li>Feels professional.</li>
            <li>I use this about every two weeks to shave my head and with my old trimmer</li>
            <li>Overall, I really like this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I just try to be conscious of it.  </li>
            <li>i bought this to combine it with the old spice mens shaver since i am of a believe system that a product needs to do one thing and one thing</li>
            <li>un-boxing the trimmer, I was surprised at how well built</li>
            <li>one comes to expect from Old Spice</li>
            <li>/&gt;Straight from the box, it felt solid and very well made.</li>
            <li>The beard trimmer increments are 2 mm which is too far apart.  </li>
            <li>Eventually I had to take out my old trimmers to not look like I unleashed a wild animal on myself.</li>
            <li>I was use to fight with my old Conair</li>
            <li>like it so far does what it say</li>
            <li>My decision to move towards Old Spice was on account of price (Remington was $29</li>
            <li>so was old spice),</li>
            <li>And then came this Old Spice Beard and Head trimmer.</li>
            <li>Old Spice has got you covered.&lt;br</li>
            <li>used to have this old hair trimmer, It came in one of those \\&quot;As</li>
            <li>And then came the Old Spice Beard and Head trimmer.</li>
            <li>As far as the &amp;#34;Head Trimmer&amp;#34; aspect</li>
            <li>and this doesn&#x27;t pick it up very well, not as well as the similar Panasonic did,</li>
            <li>I broke my Braun Cruzer 5 and bought the Old Spice at the cheaper price</li>
            <li>B004WIUNCG Braun Cruzer 6 Beard and Head Trimmer]] that has been rebranded for Old Spice.</li>
            <li>Without them I would not have gave this review on how I feel about the Old Spice Beard and hair trimmer so that people would know about the product they are buying beforehand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Usage: When using the Old Spice Beard and Hair Trimmer, it seems that it trims all of the hair on my face with no problems whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I have used it for around 2 months now and it has helped keep my bear trimmed and professional.</li>
            <li>Within moments i was sitting there having my hair shaved off by a 2 year old and</li>
            <li>Gentle on all skin even the personal areas.  </li>
            <li>My old trimmers are already in the garbage, because I will not be needing them again.</li>
            <li>Like it so far.</li>
            <li>This is not the fault of Old Spice or Braun.</li>
            <li>Mine last one was always self adjusting - probably because my cave man arms used too much pressure.  </li>
            <li>He loves this Old Spice trimmer.</li>
            <li>To be fair, I was careless with it, banging it on the sink to clear the hair clippings from the guard.</li>
            <li>Battery life is long and strong, adjustable head for both facial hair and head hair, very solid construction.</li>
            <li>It comes with a charger and a little brush to clean away the cut hair that may stack up in the guard.</li>
            <li>Right now I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this trimmer over any other trimmer that is already out there.</li>
            <li>As soon as the package came i was a bit worried it would be a piece of junk like every other Trimmer i&#x27;ve encountered but right out of the box</li>
            <li>The only problem was probably one that would be true with any trimmer: when pushing the trimmer against my nearly bare head, it left my head slightly red from irritation of having plastic rubbed against it.    </li>
            <li>This small thing packs a huge punch, when I got it from BzzAgent</li>
            <li>The product is made of hard , durable plastic that really feels like its worth the msrp that the product is priced (50 dollars ).</li>
            <li>It is very quiet, cuts the hair well, and it is really convenient to clean due to the fact it can get wet.  </li>
            <li>A feature I really like is that you do not have to change the combs for different settings, but simply dial the one you want.  </li>
            <li>tried to a different brand recently and cut my head and was very uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and yes the attachments are interchangeable right down to the blade head assembly.</li>
            <li>I cannot shave without getting major razor burn</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t want to loose that much beard.</li>
            <li>Most recently I tried the Philips Norelco All in One Grooming Kit Multigroom Pro QG3386 and sent it back because the parts were too flimsy and the motor was too weak to cut my beard decently.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer is a little powerful tool.</li>
            <li>I usually take the cover off such trimmers to give myself a fine trim, but the blades on this device are not designed for that.</li>
            <li>This trimmer replaced my old one that finally wore out.  </li>
            <li>it took me some time to get used to because the measurements were different from my old hair trimmer</li>
            <li>tried using it for that, but it barely trimmed any.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Summary: I have been using the Old Spice beard and Hair Trimmer for awhile now by using it as a needed helper for me to have the cleanest shave as I can possibly make it ( use both a razor and the trimmer ).</li>
            <li>Not sure I&#x27;ll keep it that long even, though, because the battery life is so short I have to plug it in most nights to keep it charged.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It came pre-charged out of the box and worked as well or better than other similarly-priced products I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>As one other reviewer mentioned, either the buzzer or the charger emits a very high pitched squeal when plugged in.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning: Cleaning the Old Spice Trimmer was pretty easy when taking the guard off and cleaning out the outside areas of this Old Spice product, but even with the tools that the product seem to gave me I still find it difficult to get inside of the machine where there are hard to reach areas that are difficult/impossible to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: The Old Spice Hair and Beard Trimmer has some issues that I think a Trimmer / shaver enthusiast would not be eyeballing over/freak out about , but would not care as much to the regular joe buying it in a store like Walmart or target.</li>
            <li>thing that could have made it better would have been if you could get a little bit closer of a \\&quot;shave\\&quot; with it but that unfortunately would ruin its ability to cut other hair more durably.</li>
            <li>Fine for a beard, no good for haircuts</li>
            <li>If Old Spices Trimmer  battery is also NiCad then it will run into similar problems and only time will tell.</li>
            <li>The only thing I regret is not throwing away my old one several years ago and buying this.</li>
            <li>It worked well enough at first, but after the battery ran down and I had to recharge it</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it&#x27;s not so good for very close trimming on the back of the neck, but the guards work very well for trimming my beard and cutting my son&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>: small , light , very long battery life .&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>/&gt;- same as the more expensive Braun, except color and second tiny trimmer (which isn&#x27;t particularly useful)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not much else to say about a shaver, but this thing is sweet none the less.</li>
            <li>, if you have thick hair it can jam up easy, no old spice oils or scents with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun-</li>
            <li>It does what it is intended to do, but really the blades are not that sharp enough to make an even cut.</li>
            <li>Two stars since it does technically cut beard hair, but only barely.</li>
            <li>The main reason is, I love the adjustable cutting length without having to go through several different attachments!</li>
            <li>With only one button hidden in the rear of the trimmer, it was easy to use and incredibly quiet (closer to a loud hum, rather than a mechanical grind common with trimmers).</li>
            <li>Although you must read carefully, this is a trimmer and not a shaver, so don&#x27;t expect it to get right down to your skin.</li>
            <li>The way I saw it, my options were to go to a barber and pay to have it cleaned up, which seemed stupid since I barely had any hair at all, or go home and use my new Old Spice trimmer to even out my newly shaven head for FREE.</li>
            <li>would place this trimmer in an average class placing lower price point than other trimmers on the market right now.</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it to trim my hair, but I would recommend getting one for yourself and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll work great, as it does for beard trimming!  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s easy to hold, holds a charge for a substantial amount of time, and best of all, it cuts fantastically.</li>
            <li> Braun makes a good trimmer</li>
            <li> THis did not work good at all.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good for, too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disclaimer: I got this for free from BZZ Campaigns but either way this is one awesome product either way</li>
            <li> , if you could call it a downside, is that the hair will stick to the handle, since its rubber, but all you have to do is run it under water and it should be good.</li>
            <li> the combs is not that good</li>
            <li> Good beard trimmer</li>

            <li> Maintaining a good looking beard is an art form.  </li>
            <li> The good and the bad:&lt;br /&gt;(Disclaimer)</li>
            <li> I recieved this awesome trimmer free via bzzagent and had the opportunity to test and review the product.</li>
            <li> I give this product a five star rating because it has a great design, it works well in the shower and is effective at shaving.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made by Braun, and I&#x27;ve had nothing but good experience with that brand.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm - good product.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is good and meets all of my needs however , cleaning it up is a pain and Power consumption is an issue</li>
            <li> then it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good trimmer didn&#x27;t used for my head yet but good with beard .</li>
            <li> I have had nothing but good luck with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> The guards provided give a really good finished job.  </li>
            <li> works good..</li>
            <li> Well built, looks good and, works well</li>
            <li> He said this trimmer works great and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To conclude this is an exceptional beard trimmer yet sub-par head trimmer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall he is very pleased.  </li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer, I am able to take it with me on road trips and when i go elsewhere for the weekend.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free as part of a Bzz Agent campaign, and truthfully, this thing is awesome.</li>
            <li> very strong with a good battery.  </li>
            <li> but it got better from there!</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer!</li>
            <li> and I love that its cordless!</li>
            <li> Probably the best beard trimmer I have ever owned and such good value!</li>
            <li> I love this grooming tool!</li>
            <li> I love it and will keep on using it!</li>
            <li> Many trim options without the hassle of changing heads!</li>
            <li> However, I do love how cleanly it cuts my beard and keeps it at my preferred perfect length.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and shaved great.</li>
            <li> The best one I have owned since I had a full beard, many years.</li>
            <li> Arrived fine and both work great.</li>
            <li> Rather light and may not survive a drop, but at the selling price, a great value nonetheless.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a great shaver, I recommend this shaver and you will enjoy using this at the sink or even in the shower because it is waterproof.</li>
            <li> Lets get to the Real important things.    </li>
            <li> Otherwise, this thing is amazing for the money.</li>
            <li> I have had cheap trimmers and this was a great deal.  </li>
            <li> Nice quality trimmer.  </li>
            <li> The look of the trimmer is nice as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that it has the one comb that can be adjusted.  </li>
            <li> Most clippers this good are found in salons and barber shops that run around 100 dollars.</li>
            <li> Nice running trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Nice design</li>
            <li> It was kind of a joke...</li>
            <li> The battery is awesome and is really easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice trimmer.  </li>
            <li> It is waterproof, it cuts beards, it is rechargeable, it fits the hand nicely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s especially nice in my opinion that it doesn&#x27;t give a perfectly clean shave, rather a light shadow.</li>
            <li> It does not tug the skin and it so new that I feel that it has the best technology in it.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use</li>
            <li> Very easy to understand and operate.  </li>
            <li> very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It was very easy and self explanatory changing between the beard and head guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is light in weight, has a good feel in your hand and can be washed under running water.  </li>
            <li> The Old Spice Beard &amp; Head Trimmer is awesome!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good and cheap shaver, I can say I found it.</li>
            <li> Oh and the best is that you can run it directly from the power out of the wall, thereforeiff the battery ever permanently dies</li>
            <li> Everything about this trimmer is just so awesome, I can use out straight out of the shower or give my beard a quick trim on a night out!</li>

            <li> I love this thing...</li>
            <li> Cuts stuff, mostly hair&lt;</li>
            <li> While the plastic feels like, well, plastic, it is significantly more study than I anticipated.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love the trimmer and would recommend it to anyone who keeps a beard, goatee or mustache.</li>

            <li> So just make sure</li>
            <li> This product was sent to me for free by the kind people at BzzAgent to use, test and review!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon</li>
            <li> I knew I would love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It would work so much better if it had just a tad-bit more juice.</li>
            <li> There are so many options with this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> You should pass it many times to cut the hair.</li>
            <li> He looks a lot better now.</li>
            <li> , I find it seems to perform better this way.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received this product for free through a promotional trial and was asked to write my honest opinion about it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Throw away all the times you were told not to stick electronics under water, it&#x27;s safe.</li>
            <li> yeah, I should probably mention I got it for free from BzzAgent!)</li>
            <li> I have only used this as a trimmer and had great results!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Other then that the trimmer is awesome because it has 2 detachable heads for different variable lengths.</li>
            <li> It functioned as it was designed with many options to choose from when changing the length of the clip.</li>
            <li> For the price this is ranked in my top 3.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I will</li>
            <li> plus more (no cuts).</li>
            <li> Entertainment break a world record for most heads shaved in one hour by letting them shave my head [...].</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Best facial shaver I&#x27;ve found yet!</li>
            <li> Definitely the best trimmer I have ever had.</li>
            <li> Why would you spend more or go anywhere else to get one.</li>
            <li> Does exactly as advertised, great battery life on a very quick charge.</li>
            <li> I was originally worried about the plastic used in this razor, however after repeated (ab)use, it is amazing.</li>
            <li> The product is amazing and extremely useful!</li>
            <li> There are better products available but this one is a great cheaper alternative very comparable to its competition.  </li>
            <li> Clearly, the second option won out, and I&#x27;m happy to say that it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> It is the best one I have ever used and holds its charge for an exceedingly long amount of time.</li>
            <li> keeps me looking  good with a clean cut when i need to for special occasions.</li>
            <li> This sure makes it easy to keep it trim and evened up.  </li>
            <li> I love it and its easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I am not particular impressed</li>
            <li> I shopped quite a bit on Amazon and found this odd-looking trimmer to be the best combination of high customer ratings and reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This is great or trimming your beard/hair and being fully washable you can take it near and around the shower without worrying about ruining it.</li>
            <li> This was the best money I spent on a shaving product, period.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First impressions of the Old Spice Beard trimmer were great.  </li>
            <li> nice and light - not the heaviest duty clippers I&#x27;ve owned but will serve its purpose for a quick trim.</li>
            <li> Otherwise the razor is waterproof, and its head comes apart for easy cleaning.</li>
            <li> i was surprise how easy the adjusting combs are to interchange and the level of precision it provides.</li>
            <li> Also quite easy with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Its easy to pack and travel with and still sensible to use at home.</li>
            <li> The guides are also easy to use.</li>
            <li> and easy to change lengths.</li>
            <li> It is sleek and easy to handle and store.</li>
            <li> Easy cleanup</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll save hundreds of dollars in haircuts, easily.</li>
            <li> It was easy to take off and replace with another.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is easy to handle and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s washable so easy to keep tide</li>
            <li> Easy to use, shaped to be held in our hand.  </li>
            <li> Awsome product ...simple, easy to use and works as described</li>
            <li> Easy to rinse off, easy to charge.</li>
            <li> Still going strong.</li>
            <li> Charges fine.  </li>
            <li> But pay attention to the fine print: it is a NiCad battery from the hints in the writeup.</li>
            <li> ignore the name on it and enjoy the fine quality</li>
            <li> The Trimmers raw power easily shaved me bald in about 2 minutes which is extremely impressive.</li>
            <li> Charges well cuts well easy to clean.</li>
            <li> So lets start out that by the picture I thought this thing looks cheap.</li>
            <li> Smooth, sleek design</li>
            <li> is really nice but the power on this thing is really low.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its adjustable and rechargeable and those were two important factors I was looking for.</li>
            <li> so it has a bit of a cheap feel to it</li>
            <li> But I find this one easy to use and clean and it works.</li>
            <li> Really nice trimmer that holds its charge very well.</li>
            <li> Smooth cut and no pulling.</li>
            <li> Overall I think they did a great job with the design</li>
            <li> sure, now I have two trimmers, but the time I save, is worth the problem of keeping the two devices charged.</li>
            <li> Its just an overall great shaver</li>
            <li> Really easy to clean and use.  </li>
            <li> The sound stops once it&#x27;s fully charged.</li>
            <li> I got this item free to try, I am a Bzz Agent.  </li>
            <li> I received the product for free, to try and review, from Braun.</li>
            <li> I received this trimmer for free from being a BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like to spend alot but get the same great product this is the one to get.</li>
            <li> Then again it was cheap</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really smooth and is just really handy to have for someone who likes to keep their personal hygiene with their hair nice.</li>
            <li> The trim was even and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I thoroughly enjoy using this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I got this trimmer for free from Bzzagent, which sent me a retail version of the product for me to review.</li>
            <li> Different length settings are great.  </li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2WPCJQD1MEKGB]]The Old Spice Beard &amp; Head Trimmer (powered by Braun) will provide a good trim for those looking to trim their beards or cut their hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t operate as strongly as I thought it would, even on a full charge.</li>
            <li> and I can have a very nice, clean and short beard.</li>
            <li> For the price that is.....&lt;br /&gt;Pros-price, adjustable lengths, GREAT battery life, sleek, trims close(but not really close), easy to use and clean&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because it had one of the longest length cuts I could find originally...</li>
            <li> and when i received it i was excited to use it.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about using it to trim my beard.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So far, I am very pleased with this beard and head trimmer.</li>
            <li> I use it even when I don&#x27;t need to really, because it&#x27;s kind of fun.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind however, that this will not give you a clean shave.</li>
            <li> it weakening WHILE USING IT thus, not getting a clean trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A pro is that the trimmer is light to the feel and it charges somewhat quickly.</li>
            <li> After the head shave, I had a some clean up to do.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is powerful, precise, holds a good charge, is quiet and doesn&#x27;t vibrate too much, is easy to hold/grip.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer had a good weight to it, the plastics felt like high quality, and the color scheme was manly and modern.  </li>
            <li> Pros: Easy to use, charges quickly, works well on beard and head hair, easy to clean, and really cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Love this product first timer and its worth your money...</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this item if you are looking for a good and reliable trimmer.</li>
            <li> Overall it is good trimmer and hair clipper based on price.</li>
            <li> This does a good job and makes short work of it.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone that needs full management of any length of hair.</li>
            <li> The battery has a good life span, have never had it run out of charge mid shave.  </li>
            <li> I do charge it after every use to keep full power though</li>
            <li> It hold a good charge for multiple uses.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However it charges fast and keeps a charge well, is fully water proof (I&#x27;ve used it in the shower many times under full water running).</li>
            <li> Not a bad trimmer, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> You are one click away from changing the size and giving a very effective, less noisy, and easy trim to anyone&#x27;s hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I used it on my beard yesterday and love it just as much as I did the first time I used it!</li>
            <li> Width is nice and short for accurate beard trimming but takes a while if you want to shave your head with it.</li>
            <li> It works well cordless or plugged in, and recharges quickly.</li>
            <li> Simple yet very appealing and professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I RECIEVED THIS PRODUCT TO TRY FROM BUZZ AGENT FOR FREE, UPON USING IT FOR THE FIRST TIME</li>
            <li> Multiple adjustable trim lengths are great for many different options.</li>
            <li> First and formost , I would like to thank bzzagent for givng me this free product to try.</li>
            <li> Still using this trimmer, it&#x27;s bean a long time and a good trimmer.</li>
            <li> The cutting and trimming is great and the smaller size of this trimmer is a perfect fit in your hand.  </li>
            <li> Overall this is a great product that i would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use and works very well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and very versatile.</li>
            <li> This is so much better than my old beard trimmer!</li>
            <li> I was able to easily take the comb off so that I could trim around my upper lip.</li>
            <li> It works okay, but if I could do it over again I&#x27;d buy another cheap Wahl that works much better and is half the price.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free from Braun to test and review by thanks of [...]  </li>
            <li> So far I love this trimmer</li>
            <li> Did they have this kind of thing back then?  </li>
            <li> This trimmer not only feels good in your hands but also cuts very smoothly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love Old Spice products and wanted this one to be just as awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it once or twice a week to keep myself looking fresh.</li>
            <li> I felt it was worth the cost.</li>
            <li> This product was a cool trimmer and a pretty neat concept.</li>
            <li> I researched the price and it&#x27;s costly but worth it.  </li>
            <li> Sized right and fits my hand well.  </li>
            <li> Turned on without needing charged right away.</li>
            <li> and it still never got it right.</li>
            <li> I like my beard grown out just the right amount and with a trimmer, its all or nothing.</li>
            <li> the job done and the price is right.</li>
            <li> Balance in the hand is &#x27;just right&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> They are &#x27;older&#x27; and my Father in Law gave his review &amp;#34;light weight, precise, gets the job done&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Not bad for what most people will only classify as a beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s comfortable to use, the length settings are easy enough to adjust and stay locked into place.  </li>
            <li> Excellent quality for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the same 8 years old Conair Beard Trimmer all this time but the battery was finally failing so</li>
            <li> so I would shave it off regularly because I did not have a suitable way to keep it trimmed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;it feels good in your hands with its rubber handle and the battery lasts pretty long, i haven&#x27;t really had to charge it in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, easy to charge and the battery lasts a long time(yes</li>
            <li> normally trim my beard pretty low leaving just a &amp;#34;shadow&amp;#34; on my face that looks pretty good.</li>
            <li> After using it for a month or so, it still runs just as smooth as if new.</li>
            <li> Not only do the attachments allow for easy use but the cut is so clean with no pulling and tugging that my face isn&#x27;t irritated and rashed out afterwards.</li>
            <li> A quick rinse under running water (no dis-assembly required!!) was enough to do the job, and any additional hairs could be swept off with the included brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lastly, I would like to conclude with a very important point.</li>
            <li> /&gt;would not switch soo fast!</li>
            <li> Thank you Old Spice (and BZZ), for a Fantastic Product and the Chance to Try it out for</li>
            <li> i got this free courtesy of bzzagent and old spice beard and head trimmer, powered by braun</li>
            <li> I more electronics to last me a week</li>
            <li> Although I will say the adjustable all-in one guard is nothing short of ingenious.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> Many rechargeables don&#x27;t do that; my last one (Remington) didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Trims my beard evenly and the charge lasts for more than enough time.</li>
            <li> she told me it helped her get a better shave before she used her traditional razor.</li>
            <li> This Old Spice version is nearly identical, but this one is much more powerful and gives a better cut without having to run over one area multiple times.</li>
            <li> I do like the idea of being able to charge and use the trimmer at the same time but either way its under powered and pulls hair rather than cut.</li>
            <li> He says it&#x27;s comfortable in his hand and feels substantial but not heavy.</li>
            <li> Some of the credit goes to Julian Payne, owner, founder, and world record holder from The Original Mobile Barbershop Co. in Los Angeles, and some of the credit goes to my cool new Old Spice razor!</li>
            <li> Altough, having a manly beard as I usually do is not that simply to find a good set up for the high of the razors.</li>
            <li> It mgith do better on thinner and less filled beards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Trims hair with no pull or catching (Sharp and Fast!).</li>
            <li> Blades do not pull hairs and are sharp and effective.  </li>
            <li> It actually has two different attachments which appear to stay on well so far...one for the shorter to medium lengths and one for the medium to longer cuts...and it also trims fairly close with no attachments.</li>
            <li> Old Spice product was free thanks to bzzagent</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and got here fast</li>
            <li> A great value for the price especially when compared to other trimmers on the market.</li>
            <li> Works ok on long beards.</li>
            <li> The Old Spice Braun Beard and head trimmer will help keep you looking more like Tony Stark and your wife will love you for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would suggest this product to anyone who wants a quick cut anywhere even those sensitive areas at anytime!</li>
            <li> : needs frequent cleaning , may not be suitable for coarse hair .</li>
            <li> I like that its easily adjustable for different lengths</li>
            <li> it was easy to open.</li>
            <li> The trimmer was fairly quiet when turned on (quiter than the Schick easily).</li>
            <li> Pure garbage.  </li>
            <li> The red and black looked great together and it added to the \\&quot;sporty\\&quot; feel</li>
            <li> it trims very well easy to use with the two different heads.</li>
            <li> I would happily replace this trimmer with the exact same product, rather than seeking out something different in the future, should this product ever stop working.</li>
            <li> works well, battery lasts, and the guards (x2, ps) adjust easily and go from super long to super short, which makes it perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> recieved this one and was a little worried that the head would be too large to trim my mustache effectively.</li>
            <li> i very high pitch noise.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Still works after six months, and trim cuts very well,&lt;br /&gt;I have had no problems with this unit.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> really works well</li>
            <li> /&gt;The two attachments really give you a lot of options on what you are trying to do with millimeter sizes (1,3,5,7,9,11mm and 10-20)</li>
            <li> choose to primarily use the trimmer on my beard and mustache, although the guards would definitely suit someone who also uses it to perform haircuts on themselves or others.</li>
            <li> look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a fantastic product, and will definitely be using it often!</li>
            <li> He hasn&#x27;t had any issues with it and it cuts really well.</li>
            <li> Does everything it&#x27;s supposed to and does these functions very well.</li>
            <li> -Does not do a really close shave</li>
            <li> , it helps, it really does.</li>
            <li> but now I would try to replace my defunct hair trimmer with &#x27;modern&#x27; technology.</li>
            <li> Looked promising from the specs and reviews.</li>
            <li> Seems to do the job really well.  </li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t used to a trimmer that cut so effortlessly.</li>
            <li> The battery light suddenly stopped lighting up couple of weeks ago when plugged-in to charge.</li>
            <li> It works very well</li>
            <li> Cuts well enough but cheaply made.</li>
            <li> It allows him to give himself that day-old beard look he wants.</li>
            <li> (was extremely drunk and still got a near perfect shave.</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer, however it does not have enough individual length settings.  </li>
            <li> To me it is very similar in quality to many others which may be at a  lower price point than the Old Spice Head &amp; Beard</li>
            <li> The trimming itself does a pretty good job keeping the facial hair at the same constant rate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seriously though, I haven&#x27;t had it jam or over heat on me so far and trims great.</li>
            <li> I also liked the idea of having two guides and tons of settings but none are long enough for a real beard.</li>
            <li> Original review: As others have pointed out, the motor is a little anemic but it cuts great, you just have to do about 10 passes if you&#x27;re trimming down your beard from 11mm to 5mm like I did (old trimmer broke).</li>
            <li> Used on short hair on my head and had to clean the hair from the cutter almost with each pass.</li>
            <li> It easily trimmed my not very thick or coarse mustache.</li>
            <li> I can live with those times as I really won&#x27;t be using it all that much each week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To start, I do not have much of a beard, However what little I do have looks so much better than with most other trimmers!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works pretty well so far</li>
            <li> love the beard trimmer it has yet to let me down.</li>
            <li> Love it, cuts well, but has lost it&#x27;s ability to hold a charge after less than a month.</li>
            <li> Easily adjustable over a wide range.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never gotten a decent trim because of this</li>
            <li> My son wanted a beard trimmer to replace an older one that wasn&#x27;t working well at all.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Highly, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend giving this trimmer a shot.  </li>
            <li> Very good cutting blades - give good/clean cut.  </li>
            <li> The very first thing I noticed when I began to charge my new Old Spice Beard &amp; Head Trimmer was that the charger made a very high, low screeching noise from the charger.</li>
            <li> Instead of the buzz load enough to make me deaf, the calm, almost whisper-silent trimmer, started its work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another note - my old Remington buzzer had about 3 feet of straight cord.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel like it would break under normal circumstances.</li>
            <li> I could go all the way from burly mountain man to sexy five-o-clock shadow with just a few clicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it would work okay on thin hair (like arm hair or something) but for thicker facial hair... not satisfactory.</li>
            <li> and I had rarely used it back then.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Build of product: When i start to hold on to this old spice product , it felt nice and slick.</li>
            <li> Granted you can&#x27;t hear it more than say a few feet</li>
            <li> Its a good concept but poorly made.</li>
            <li> it had a nice Sleek Black and Red color that just spoke \\&quot;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> What I like most about this is that it&#x27;s efficient , saves the environment from pollution of regular battery&#x27;s, and saves you money from not buying battery&#x27;s at the store every single week</li>
            <li> Personally I wouldn&#x27;t buy it with the product as it is right now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done several beard trims and several haircuts (on myself) now ... and the unit works just fine.  </li>
            <li> When extended to certain lengths, there are gaps on the sides of the guide that would allow hair to accidentally come in contact with the blade and end up being cut much shorter than the actual guide length.  </li>
            <li> i had been looking for a new hair trimmer for some time now</li>
            <li> Was cheaper to buy new unit then to buy power cord.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments on my new haircut.</li>
            <li> Was hoping for better quality and functionality since I use Old Spice products, but I feel this product is one that relies heavily on name dropper reputation for its marketing model.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at just how smooth it ran, and how easily it shaved my rather thick facial hair.</li>
            <li> his older 4 year old brother.</li>
            <li> Safe enough for kid use with minimal advisement.    </li>
            <li> With the Old Spice trimmer, it is easy to keep my facial hair trimmed as short as I like it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not much more than the cheap throw away trimmers you can pickup at the local big box store, and it feels and performs much better.  </li>
            <li> What I love about this thing that not many cordless trimmers can do is it can be used with the cord or without</li>
            <li> Exactly the same model as the Braun Cruzer trimmer but cheaper.</li>
            <li> Ive used it daily since its arrival and it doesnt get hot like some do.</li>
            <li> My only criticism is labeling the head and beard more specifically, I made that mistale once on my head and the outcome was not petty but other than that it works well.</li>
            <li> I recommend this trimmer to anyone, even if you don&#x27;t wear Old Spice!</li>
            <li> This is basically a Braun Cruzer 5 Beard and Head Trimmer, This is branded as Old Spice Beard and Head Trimmer and is $10.00 cheaper!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t recommend this product if you like your facial hair very short, because you won&#x27;t be able to get it that short.</li>
            <li> First, The trimmer design and aesthetics are very slick and compact making it easy to grip.</li>
            <li> As soon as I started using my Old Spice trimmer, I knew they would be replacing my old trimmers!</li>
            <li> The little LED will light up indicating charge and when done, it&#x27;ll just turn off to let you know.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so you have to take it off a lot and clear it</li>
            <li> I only really ever noticed it when I was near it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can take the guard off and press it directly on my hairs and watch them bounce off, it can take 2-3 attempts to see it get cut.</li>
            <li> When placing it directly on my face to trim the edges of my beard</li>
            <li> My 10 year old trimmer (which I lost my beard guard for) has never had this issue or needed</li>
            <li> Feels professional.</li>
            <li> I use this about every two weeks to shave my head and with my old trimmer</li>
            <li> Overall, I really like this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I just try to be conscious of it.  </li>
            <li> i bought this to combine it with the old spice mens shaver since i am of a believe system that a product needs to do one thing and one thing</li>
            <li> un-boxing the trimmer, I was surprised at how well built</li>
            <li> one comes to expect from Old Spice</li>
            <li> /&gt;Straight from the box, it felt solid and very well made.</li>
            <li> The beard trimmer increments are 2 mm which is too far apart.  </li>
            <li> Eventually I had to take out my old trimmers to not look like I unleashed a wild animal on myself.</li>
            <li> I was use to fight with my old Conair</li>
            <li> like it so far does what it say</li>
            <li> My decision to move towards Old Spice was on account of price (Remington was $29</li>
            <li> so was old spice),</li>
            <li> And then came this Old Spice Beard and Head trimmer.</li>
            <li> Old Spice has got you covered.&lt;br</li>
            <li> used to have this old hair trimmer, It came in one of those \\&quot;As</li>
            <li> And then came the Old Spice Beard and Head trimmer.</li>
            <li> As far as the &amp;#34;Head Trimmer&amp;#34; aspect</li>
            <li> and this doesn&#x27;t pick it up very well, not as well as the similar Panasonic did,</li>
            <li> I broke my Braun Cruzer 5 and bought the Old Spice at the cheaper price</li>
            <li> B004WIUNCG Braun Cruzer 6 Beard and Head Trimmer]] that has been rebranded for Old Spice.</li>
            <li> Without them I would not have gave this review on how I feel about the Old Spice Beard and hair trimmer so that people would know about the product they are buying beforehand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Usage: When using the Old Spice Beard and Hair Trimmer, it seems that it trims all of the hair on my face with no problems whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I have used it for around 2 months now and it has helped keep my bear trimmed and professional.</li>
            <li> Within moments i was sitting there having my hair shaved off by a 2 year old and</li>
            <li> Gentle on all skin even the personal areas.  </li>
            <li> My old trimmers are already in the garbage, because I will not be needing them again.</li>
            <li> Like it so far.</li>
            <li> This is not the fault of Old Spice or Braun.</li>
            <li> Mine last one was always self adjusting - probably because my cave man arms used too much pressure.  </li>
            <li> He loves this Old Spice trimmer.</li>
            <li> To be fair, I was careless with it, banging it on the sink to clear the hair clippings from the guard.</li>
            <li> Battery life is long and strong, adjustable head for both facial hair and head hair, very solid construction.</li>
            <li> It comes with a charger and a little brush to clean away the cut hair that may stack up in the guard.</li>
            <li> Right now I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this trimmer over any other trimmer that is already out there.</li>
            <li> As soon as the package came i was a bit worried it would be a piece of junk like every other Trimmer i&#x27;ve encountered but right out of the box</li>
            <li> The only problem was probably one that would be true with any trimmer: when pushing the trimmer against my nearly bare head, it left my head slightly red from irritation of having plastic rubbed against it.    </li>
            <li> This small thing packs a huge punch, when I got it from BzzAgent</li>
            <li> The product is made of hard , durable plastic that really feels like its worth the msrp that the product is priced (50 dollars ).</li>
            <li> It is very quiet, cuts the hair well, and it is really convenient to clean due to the fact it can get wet.  </li>
            <li> A feature I really like is that you do not have to change the combs for different settings, but simply dial the one you want.  </li>
            <li> tried to a different brand recently and cut my head and was very uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and yes the attachments are interchangeable right down to the blade head assembly.</li>
            <li> I cannot shave without getting major razor burn</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want to loose that much beard.</li>
            <li> Most recently I tried the Philips Norelco All in One Grooming Kit Multigroom Pro QG3386 and sent it back because the parts were too flimsy and the motor was too weak to cut my beard decently.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is a little powerful tool.</li>
            <li> I usually take the cover off such trimmers to give myself a fine trim, but the blades on this device are not designed for that.</li>
            <li> This trimmer replaced my old one that finally wore out.  </li>
            <li> it took me some time to get used to because the measurements were different from my old hair trimmer</li>
            <li> tried using it for that, but it barely trimmed any.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Summary: I have been using the Old Spice beard and Hair Trimmer for awhile now by using it as a needed helper for me to have the cleanest shave as I can possibly make it ( use both a razor and the trimmer ).</li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;ll keep it that long even, though, because the battery life is so short I have to plug it in most nights to keep it charged.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It came pre-charged out of the box and worked as well or better than other similarly-priced products I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> As one other reviewer mentioned, either the buzzer or the charger emits a very high pitched squeal when plugged in.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning: Cleaning the Old Spice Trimmer was pretty easy when taking the guard off and cleaning out the outside areas of this Old Spice product, but even with the tools that the product seem to gave me I still find it difficult to get inside of the machine where there are hard to reach areas that are difficult/impossible to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: The Old Spice Hair and Beard Trimmer has some issues that I think a Trimmer / shaver enthusiast would not be eyeballing over/freak out about , but would not care as much to the regular joe buying it in a store like Walmart or target.</li>
            <li> thing that could have made it better would have been if you could get a little bit closer of a \\&quot;shave\\&quot; with it but that unfortunately would ruin its ability to cut other hair more durably.</li>
            <li> Fine for a beard, no good for haircuts</li>
            <li> If Old Spices Trimmer  battery is also NiCad then it will run into similar problems and only time will tell.</li>
            <li> The only thing I regret is not throwing away my old one several years ago and buying this.</li>
            <li> It worked well enough at first, but after the battery ran down and I had to recharge it</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s not so good for very close trimming on the back of the neck, but the guards work very well for trimming my beard and cutting my son&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> : small , light , very long battery life .&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> /&gt;- same as the more expensive Braun, except color and second tiny trimmer (which isn&#x27;t particularly useful)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not much else to say about a shaver, but this thing is sweet none the less.</li>
            <li> , if you have thick hair it can jam up easy, no old spice oils or scents with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun-</li>
            <li> It does what it is intended to do, but really the blades are not that sharp enough to make an even cut.</li>
            <li> Two stars since it does technically cut beard hair, but only barely.</li>
            <li> The main reason is, I love the adjustable cutting length without having to go through several different attachments!</li>
            <li> With only one button hidden in the rear of the trimmer, it was easy to use and incredibly quiet (closer to a loud hum, rather than a mechanical grind common with trimmers).</li>
            <li> Although you must read carefully, this is a trimmer and not a shaver, so don&#x27;t expect it to get right down to your skin.</li>
            <li> The way I saw it, my options were to go to a barber and pay to have it cleaned up, which seemed stupid since I barely had any hair at all, or go home and use my new Old Spice trimmer to even out my newly shaven head for FREE.</li>
            <li> would place this trimmer in an average class placing lower price point than other trimmers on the market right now.</li>
            <li> I have a very thick beard and this performs better than any other trimmer I have owned.</li>
            <li> , hair gets all over the place during haircut (I gave up trying and just let it go and vacuum up afterward), does not cut some hairs</li>
            <li> Why I would not recommend trying to accomplish a full haircut with this device, If you have a few extra minutes in the morning and you feel that your hair could use a little flattening, just give it a shot.</li>
            <li> Due to functionality and the fact it didn&#x27;t really stand out over other Braun powered products.</li>
            <li> so a long lasting battery is necessary).</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only downfall would be that sometimes the trimmer doesn&#x27;t pull up some of their hairs (leaving long pieces in places) which means I have to go over the same spot</li>
            <li> Work decent on facial and head hair, motion is not as fast as it should be, the motor runs a little too slow for my liking.</li>
            <li> It made trimming my beard a breeze, much easier than trying to do it by hand as I had in the past.</li>
            <li> No better, no worse than competitors</li>
            <li> Options for beard trimming are all that you need for short - fairly long beards.</li>
            <li> lasted long enough and it didn&#x27;t have a cord, so I&#x27;ll keep this one.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not powerful enough to really cut my beard down without a lot of work.  </li>
            <li> I still have a cheap little Wahl one that still works, but the battery sucks</li>
            <li> I do not like for my facial hair to be very long</li>
            <li> Overall in my honest opinion , I think the goods outweigh the bad and seems to work at what it was advertised to do.</li>
            <li> It also is able to keep every hair that length that you want without having to worry about it accidentally cutting a section too short.</li>
            <li> And it costs half of what I paid for my old trimmer.</li>
            <li> Personally, I don&#x27;t use the head trimming function, however I don&#x27;t think it would work for how thick my hair is very well.</li>
            <li> Also sometimes the guards are sometimes difficult to get on the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Batterys: With the Old Spice Hair and Beard Trimmer, you do not need to use regular battery&#x27;s cause this product has a built in chargeable battery ( with the charger included of course ).</li>
            <li> Sure it was not meant for controlling other hair growth (mustaches, sorry, this is not your time) and</li>
            <li> In the box was The Trimmer, 2 attachments that would cut at all lengths, a little brush to clear the hair off the trimmer, lubrication oil for the blades and an instruction booklet with of course the battery charger.</li>
            <li> And I have dealt with those stupid electric razors which cause my skin more irritation than a normal razor.</li>
            <li> Charging causes weird high-pitched whining sound - not from the trimmer but the plug in itself.</li>
            <li> Also, since this is made by Braun, which I prefer for razors, I expect a long life.  </li>
            <li> the 5 mm setting is tool long for my liking.  </li>
            <li> Works well and holds charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> The charge lasts a long time, perhaps over thirty minutes.</li>
            <li> Starting your morning using a quality product that performs consistently as expected is something I&#x27;ve come to value and appreciate.</li>
            <li> No more hair-tugging, the trimmer performed its task with the skill of a fully licensed surgeon and barely 5 minutes later, my head was no longer covered by enough hair to cause my parents to rush me to the nearest barber shop.</li>
            <li> Also used it on my beard which was about one inch long.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li> The strange thing is that my wife also enjoys this razor.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how long it lasts........</li>
            <li> Long battery</li>
            <li> The only problem with this product is that I wish the on/off button would be alittle bit softer to push due to minor injury&#x27;s ( like soreness).</li>
            <li> I got this trimmer as I needed to tame my somewhat busy beard for a job interview.</li>
            <li> If this product doesn&#x27;t match what you are looking for and you find qualities in other trimmers that this one does not have, I suggest you select a different one as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Battery stays charged a very long time.</li>
            <li> Very strange.</li>
            <li> Battery lasts very long time before a charge is required.</li>
            <li> It also comes with a small brush to clear out the clippings.</li>
            <li> Instead of 4 different combs to clean, I now just have the one, adjustable, cutting attachment.</li>
            <li> e trim beard with only down side of rechargeable battery longevity which died after 2 years.</li>
            <li> the only down fall i see</li>
            <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t like the charger because it makes a faint high pitch whine when it is plugged in just like his old one did.</li>
            <li> has has an adjustable guard so you don&#x27;t have to keep track of a bunch of different guards/plates that will invariably get lost under your sink in less than a year.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Includes several small accessories that definitely come in handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend, who had previously been trying to trim his beard with tiny scissors.</li>
            <li> I felt a sense of nostalgia as I plugged in the trimmer and got ready to lose a few excessive locks of hair.</li>
            <li> Efficient, and 1mm really does mean 1mm!</li>
            <li> Works well as expected just wish it could gonin the shower.</li>
            <li> Minus one star for wobbly guards.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dealt with regular clippers that are too heavy and still rough on my face.</li>
            <li> The charger is abnormally long in an odd way at the plug.</li>
            <li> Getting my head shaved in less than 45 seconds, left my haircut slightly imperfect.</li>
            <li> Need to go over the same spots a few times to get the trim down.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Unlike other Braun products I have used before.</li>
            <li> It has two alternative cutting guides, so whether you want a very close trim or a longer beard, it&#x27;ll handle 20 different lengths.</li>
            <li> Very surprised that something using the Braun name is so poorly made.</li>
            <li> This one will last a while as I have the spare parts and learned a valuable lesson about dropping my shaver on a hard floor.</li>
            <li> Now the unit does not even charge up, or hardly charges, even when left plugged in overnight.</li>
            <li> I have about a medium-light beard with average stubble thickness/coarseness.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll look like you were too lazy to shave that morning, too long</li>
            <li> The waterproof design makes cleanup much easier, but it is still difficult to get some of the nooks and cranny&#x27;s fully cleaned out,</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I don&#x27;t qualify the product as not worth buying</li>
            <li> /&gt;To summarize my opinion on the product I conclude that this product yields average results with average quality.</li>
            <li> This might work for someone but not worth the money to me.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I have a thick full beard and it did not work that well on it.</li>
            <li> It has jammed a few times</li>
            <li> Blades cut extremely well and cleanly; no frayed ends.</li>
            <li> WHILE SHAVING DOWN MY HEAD.i WOULD RECOMEND</li>
            <li> AND IT WONT LET YOU DOWN</li>
            <li> Also like the fact that if the battery runs down, it will operate while being plugged in.</li>
            <li> The motor kept bogging down and stalling out even though it had been charging for over 24 hours.</li>
            <li> The less devices</li>
            <li> did say that it didn&#x27;t give him as close of a shave on his face as his previous ones did.  </li>
            <li> I took a chance and bought this after my previous hair/beard trimmer, the Cruzer (also by Braun) cracked and fell apart on me.</li>
            <li> I previously had two Norelco trimmers which were junk.</li>
            <li> Making it difficult to keep plugged in to older sockets.</li>
            <li> Makes a weird high pitch noise when charging but no fires yet.</li>
            <li> It is not easy to trim my thick hair, The actual blade on the trimmer is a bit blunt and does not shape my beard like I would want it too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not true to name</li>
            <li> The battery seems to charge for a few cuts; we have not let it run down yet.  </li>
            <li> Would give it 5 stars if it was just a little bit faster.</li>
            <li> I like this shaver, but I wish the blades were a little sharper.</li>
            <li> As part of the newer generation, I started out with an electric trimmer, and though it kept my mustache down (except for Movember!)</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m stubborn and don&#x27;t want to admit I wasted money.</li>
            <li> Cuts unevenly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few others over the years.  </li>
            <li> no cheap parts and attachment isn&#x27;t flimsy.</li>
            <li> Now I can get a wear heavy stubble or grow my beard out and keep it looking managed.  </li>
            <li> I expect the charge time to get longer after a few cycles.</li>
            <li> I have never really used a manual razor, well at least it has been a while since I used one</li>
            <li> It creates an uneven cut on my beard depending on the amount of pressure I place on an area of skin.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m very disappointed it&#x27;s to small to effectively function as a head trimmer.</li>
            <li> It works slick and does so even after having it for the little while that I have had it.</li>
            <li> It was annoying enough for me that I&#x27;ll be looking elsewhere for a new buzzer.</li>
            <li> The odd shape makes a difficult time for the back of the head and under the chin.</li>
            <li> Fast-forward two years ahead, now the trimmer is mostly dead, the blades are dull, there is hair  stuck to the device, it simply is a mess.</li>
            <li> Washing of blades feature with oil seems to be an excessive &amp; messy feature and wasn&#x27;t required in Remington.</li>
            <li> I make pass after pass and very little gets trimmed.</li>
            <li> Usually I run my fingers through my beard afterwards to break the left-over hairs off.</li>
            <li> it usually does nothing.</li>
            <li> Have used Remington MB-200 Titanium Mustache and Beard Trimmer in past which is at gr8 product and does what it is supposed to do i..</li>
            <li> Not sure what else would be needed.</li>
            <li> It never stopped and I&#x27;m not sure if all chargers do this</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t give five stars unless the quality blows me away.</li>
            <li> My beard is very thin (3-5mm) and should not have caused it such problems.</li>
            <li> I suspect, however, that the minimum length setting might be a little long for &amp;#34;stubble,&amp;#34; but I am not using it for stubble cutting.</li>
            <li> and I still find it hard getting the beard even.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is hard to cut the hair ....</li>
            <li> 5 stars is because it had the bad taste of putting the name Old Spice on</li>
            <li> /&gt;Included with the trimmer are two adjustable cutting guides (a beard trimmer adjustable from 1 to 11mm and a hair trimmer from 10 to 20mm), cleaning brush, oil, starting guide and charger.</li>
            <li> In common sense, the length supposed to be adjusted in 1mm, 2mm, 3mm...etc.</li>
            <li> I spent money on this crap and can&#x27;t take it back.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It may do decently at cutting facial hair but it gets clogged up when doing head hair.</li>
            <li> Amazon says it&#x27;s too late to return it.</li>
            <li> If I could give it a negative star I would do so.</li>
            <li> No snagging on my thick manly beard.</li>
            <li> I have a fairly thick beard</li>
            <li> I mean, it works</li>
            <li> I  mean it doesn&#x27;t pull the hair out of your face or anything.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, it was far from it :(</li>
            <li> I hate to have the device on one side of my bathroom connected to the charging cable instead of having a nice charging base.</li>
            <li> I WAS QUITE IMPRESSED,WITH ITS COMPACT SIZE I THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE A HARD TIME CUTTING DOWN MY THICK HAIR, IT WORKED LIKE A CHAMP</li>
            <li> This is not good at all.</li>
            <li> cons of this product vs my 8 years old Conair Beard Trimmer is the lack of a charging base.</li>
            <li> will try to modify the old Conair base to see if I can create one for this one.</li>
            <li> Weak motor.</li>
            <li> Motor way too weak to be usable.</li>
            <li> product did a fairly average job at cutting hair and did not jam for me.</li>
            <li> The blades out of the box are very very dull and leave half-cut hairs on my face (either that or mine is not aligned correctly).</li>
            <li> You can be very clumsy with this thing&#x27;s application/use and it wont cut up your face.</li>
            <li> No flexing or sloppy mold lines/paint slips.</li>
            <li> As far as I&#x27;m concerned this is a horrible product and it does not work as advertised.</li>
            <li> Not ideal.</li>
            <li> Made cutting my hair a long annoying ordeal.</li>
            <li> If you drop the razor with the plastic equipped it&#x27;s unlikely to crack or break.</li>
            <li> Trying to use it after growing my beard out over the winter was useless.  </li>
            <li> Heads can be adjusted to suit the cutting length that you want (in millimeters).</li>
            <li> This has saved me time in both cutting my hair and cleaning up afterwards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll break it.</li>
            <li> This lightweight clipper does a barber-like job cutting my hair and trimming my goatee and moustache</li>
            <li> I wanted so badly for this product to work for me.</li>
            <li> I was afraid that somehow I would change the setting as I was using the trimmers, but that was not the case!</li>
            <li> Even without the charging base this item deserve 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re anything like me the reason you got this is because you hate shaving.</li>
            <li> but I found it highly annoying.</li>
            <li> However, very disappointed in hair length adjustment.</li>
            <li> No exaggeration, this is probably the worst product I have ever bought in my life.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> UPDATE -- I have had this now for about six months. It is actually in the trunk of my car as I haven&#x27;t bothered bringing it in from my last trip. Two stars since it does technically cut beard hair, but only barely. I&#x27;ve switched back to my $10 Whal beard trimmer which works flawlessly. [[ASIN:B0015KHMRS Wahl 5537-1801 Cordless Battery Operated Beard Trimmer with Bonus Ear, Nose and Brow Trimmer]] I just don&#x27;t have time in the morning to go over my beard literally - literally 10 times every morning. I just don&#x27;t. The Wald is just hit it and quit it, wham bam thank you ma&#x27;am and you&#x27;re off to do whatever. If you like to stare at yourself in the mirror for an hour every morning maybe the Braun is for you. They cut about the same. I have about a medium-light beard with average stubble thickness/coarseness. I gave it six months and a trip to europe, but would not buy again.  Original review: As others have pointed out, the motor is a little anemic but it cuts great, you just have to do about 10 passes if you&#x27;re trimming down your beard from 11mm to 5mm like I did (old trimmer broke). Whatever, it&#x27;s a Braun so it&#x27;ll last forever has has an adjustable guard so you don&#x27;t have to keep track of a bunch of different guards/plates that will invariably get lost under your sink in less than a year.</li>
            <li> Was hoping for better quality and functionality since I use Old Spice products, but I feel this product is one that relies heavily on name dropper reputation for its marketing model. I would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Just as advertised. Very happy with it.  Do not use on a beard.</li>
            <li> Very good hair clipper&lt;br /&gt;Pros : small , light , very long battery life .&lt;br /&gt;Cons: needs frequent cleaning , may not be suitable for coarse hair .</li>
            <li> Still going strong. I recommend it</li>
            <li> Braun makes a good trimmer</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. THis did not work good at all.</li>
            <li> nice and light - not the heaviest duty clippers I&#x27;ve owned but will serve its purpose for a quick trim. Would give it 5 stars if it was just a little bit faster.</li>
            <li> I love this thing...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because it had one of the longest length cuts I could find originally...but it got better from there! What I love about this thing that not many cordless trimmers can do is it can be used with the cord or without...many trimmers will not run while plugged in. And as I said I wanted it because of the longer cut ability. It actually has two different attachments which appear to stay on well so far...one for the shorter to medium lengths and one for the medium to longer cuts...and it also trims fairly close with no attachments.</li>
            <li> Jazzed up version of the Braun Cruzer 6 trimmer, but cheaper, and red-er. works well, battery lasts, and the guards (x2, ps) adjust easily and go from super long to super short, which makes it perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Cuts stuff, mostly hair&lt;br /&gt;- same as the more expensive Braun, except color and second tiny trimmer (which isn&#x27;t particularly useful)&lt;br /&gt;- battery lasts longish</li>
            <li> This trimmer replaced my old one that finally wore out.  The cutting and trimming is great and the smaller size of this trimmer is a perfect fit in your hand.  A feature I really like is that you do not have to change the combs for different settings, but simply dial the one you want.  Also, since this is made by Braun, which I prefer for razors, I expect a long life.  Very easy to use and I highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Sized right and fits my hand well.  Trims mustache well</li>
            <li> Exactly the same model as the Braun Cruzer trimmer but cheaper. My husband doesn&#x27;t like the charger because it makes a faint high pitch whine when it is plugged in just like his old one did.</li>
            <li> It works okay, but if I could do it over again I&#x27;d buy another cheap Wahl that works much better and is half the price.</li>
            <li> I was originally worried about the plastic used in this razor, however after repeated (ab)use, it is amazing. While the plastic feels like, well, plastic, it is significantly more study than I anticipated. It doesn&#x27;t feel like it would break under normal circumstances. If you drop the razor with the plastic equipped it&#x27;s unlikely to crack or break. However, if you were to step on the plastic beard guard unequipped, it would likely break in two pieces - that should give you an idea of its durability. Otherwise the razor is waterproof, and its head comes apart for easy cleaning. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Love it. Whisper quiet. No snagging on my thick manly beard.</li>
            <li> Finally, I found a trimmer that actually cuts</li>
            <li> Fine for a beard, no good for haircuts</li>
            <li> This is the second one I have bought. It works great.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and shaved great. I use to to buzz my head and it works perfect</li>
            <li> Charges well cuts well easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Great razor.  The best one I have owned since I had a full beard, many years.</li>
            <li> This beard trimmer doesn&#x27;t trim beards. I make pass after pass and very little gets trimmed.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and got here fast</li>
            <li> Still works after six months, and trim cuts very well,&lt;br /&gt;I have had no problems with this unit.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and convenient, with no cord to plug in and unplug&lt;br /&gt;after use and wrap up cord to store.</li>
            <li> really works well and I like the idea of an adjustable comb.</li>
            <li> Bought it ~3 months ago from Target. The blades out of the box are very very dull and leave half-cut hairs on my face (either that or mine is not aligned correctly). Usually I run my fingers through my beard afterwards to break the left-over hairs off. I&#x27;ve never gotten a decent trim because of this but I&#x27;m stubborn and don&#x27;t want to admit I wasted money. I can take the guard off and press it directly on my hairs and watch them bounce off, it can take 2-3 attempts to see it get cut. When placing it directly on my face to trim the edges of my beard it usually does nothing. My 10 year old trimmer (which I lost my beard guard for) has never had this issue or needed sharpening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However it charges fast and keeps a charge well, is fully water proof (I&#x27;ve used it in the shower many times under full water running). Maybe mine is defective but keep in mind this could happen to you. If it actually did it&#x27;s job and cut my hair it would be a five star.</li>
            <li> Weak motor. Cuts unevenly.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Does the job with no hassles! Would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2WPCJQD1MEKGB]]The Old Spice Beard &amp; Head Trimmer (powered by Braun) will provide a good trim for those looking to trim their beards or cut their hair. The trimmer is very simple to use. Just put on the clipper head you need (beard or hair) or simply leave it off for a close trim. Heads can be adjusted to suit the cutting length that you want (in millimeters). When it comes time for a charge, just plug it in to the included charger and wait. The little LED will light up indicating charge and when done, it&#x27;ll just turn off to let you know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Included with the trimmer are two adjustable cutting guides (a beard trimmer adjustable from 1 to 11mm and a hair trimmer from 10 to 20mm), cleaning brush, oil, starting guide and charger.</li>
            <li> Nice quality trimmer.  Feels professional.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is one of the best trimmers on the market.  It will give you a close shave for the head and beard.  I use this about every two weeks to shave my head and with my old trimmer I was doing it every week.</li>
            <li> I love the trimmer and would recommend it to anyone who keeps a beard, goatee or mustache. It is easy to use, easy to charge and the battery lasts a long time(yes I might take forever to perfect my facial hair so a long lasting battery is necessary).</li>
            <li> What can I say? It shaves! In a variety of lengths, too. Plus, you can use it to shave your head/trim your hair if you don&#x27;t want to just use it for your face or... \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot;. Which it&#x27;s good for, too. Just sayin&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Oh yeah, I should probably mention I got it for free from BzzAgent!)</li>
            <li> So far I love this trimmer and I have had it now about 2 months. It is great for all of your &amp;#34;manscaping&amp;#34; lol. Seriously though, I haven&#x27;t had it jam or over heat on me so far and trims great. It comes with a charger and a little brush to clean away the cut hair that may stack up in the guard. I would definitely recommend this item if you are looking for a good and reliable trimmer. The look of the trimmer is nice as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A+ trimmer.</li>
            <li> Overall, I really like this trimmer.  I&#x27;ve tried a few others over the years.  I still have a cheap little Wahl one that still works, but the battery sucks and it&#x27;s not powerful enough to really cut my beard down without a lot of work.  Most recently I tried the Philips Norelco All in One Grooming Kit Multigroom Pro QG3386 and sent it back because the parts were too flimsy and the motor was too weak to cut my beard decently.  This trimmer is powerful, precise, holds a good charge, is quiet and doesn&#x27;t vibrate too much, is easy to hold/grip.  I think my only gripe is with the attachments.  When extended to certain lengths, there are gaps on the sides of the guide that would allow hair to accidentally come in contact with the blade and end up being cut much shorter than the actual guide length.  Could be a potential hazard, so I just try to be conscious of it.  Other than that, this thing is working great and I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> been using braun for a couple of years, i  cut by my self  my bald head and beard nice, comfortable, and clean!!&lt;br /&gt;. tried to a different brand recently and cut my head and was very uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;would not switch soo fast!</li>
            <li> Does a very good job.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had a beard for 40 years.  Did they have this kind of thing back then?  If they did, I didn&#x27;t know it.  This sure makes it easy to keep it trim and evened up.  I use it even when I don&#x27;t need to really, because it&#x27;s kind of fun.</li>
            <li> Still using this trimmer, it&#x27;s bean a long time and a good trimmer. Makes a weird high pitch noise when charging but no fires yet. Options for beard trimming are all that you need for short - fairly long beards. Width is nice and short for accurate beard trimming but takes a while if you want to shave your head with it.</li>
            <li> So lets start out that by the picture I thought this thing looks cheap. HOWEVER, upon opening you feel a very solid build plus you have to remember Braun would not make bade products! This trimmer not only feels good in your hands but also cuts very smoothly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two attachments really give you a lot of options on what you are trying to do with millimeter sizes (1,3,5,7,9,11mm and 10-20) also they stay on snug (no worry about them falling off). This is great or trimming your beard/hair and being fully washable you can take it near and around the shower without worrying about ruining it. Keep in mind however, that this will not give you a clean shave. This is trimmer not a shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have not had to charge it yet so also good on that part! Very happy with this trimmer and would definitely recommend it to friends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing that could have made it better would have been if you could get a little bit closer of a \\&quot;shave\\&quot; with it but that unfortunately would ruin its ability to cut other hair more durably. So just make sure you know what you are buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I got this for free from BZZ Campaigns but either way this is one awesome product either way and it would not change my opinion!</li>
            <li> This trimmer is a little powerful tool. i was surprise how easy the adjusting combs are to interchange and the level of precision it provides. i bought this to combine it with the old spice mens shaver since i am of a believe system that a product needs to do one thing and one thing only so i was not into buying the two in one.</li>
            <li> Very easy to understand and operate.  Simple sliding adjustments for either attachment.  Rather light and may not survive a drop, but at the selling price, a great value nonetheless.</li>
            <li> Motor way too weak to be usable.</li>
            <li> NOTE: This product was sent to me for free by the kind people at BzzAgent to use, test and review!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon un-boxing the trimmer, I was surprised at how well built it felt in my hands and how attractive of a machine it is. The red and black looked great together and it added to the \\&quot;sporty\\&quot; feel one comes to expect from Old Spice products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came pre-charged out of the box and worked as well or better than other similarly-priced products I have used in the past. I was amazed at just how smooth it ran, and how easily it shaved my rather thick facial hair. With only one button hidden in the rear of the trimmer, it was easy to use and incredibly quiet (closer to a loud hum, rather than a mechanical grind common with trimmers). Clean-up, you ask? Also quite easy with this trimmer. A quick rinse under running water (no dis-assembly required!!) was enough to do the job, and any additional hairs could be swept off with the included brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I choose to primarily use the trimmer on my beard and mustache, although the guards would definitely suit someone who also uses it to perform haircuts on themselves or others. I was also definitely impressed with the seemingly infinite amount of customization that the included shave guards allow. I could go all the way from burly mountain man to sexy five-o-clock shadow with just a few clicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all of my electric trimmers, this one will definitely be part of my morning routine. I would happily replace this trimmer with the exact same product, rather than seeking out something different in the future, should this product ever stop working.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free as part of a Bzz Agent campaign, and truthfully, this thing is awesome. Smooth, sleek design that&#x27;s easy to hold, holds a charge for a substantial amount of time, and best of all, it cuts fantastically. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month now and it&#x27;s not once pulled, tugged, or snagged my hair, and it&#x27;s the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten with a trimmer. Highly, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> To start, I do not have much of a beard, However what little I do have looks so much better than with most other trimmers!&lt;br /&gt;Products Packaging was great. Simple yet very appealing and professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Includes several small accessories that definitely come in handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Straight from the box, it felt solid and very well made. No flexing or sloppy mold lines/paint slips. Turned on without needing charged right away. After using it for a month or so, it still runs just as smooth as if new. Trims hair with no pull or catching (Sharp and Fast!). Keeps a very nice neat and groomed look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a fantastic product, and will definitely be using it often! Thank you Old Spice (and BZZ), for a Fantastic Product and the Chance to Try it out for my self!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knis2me2&lt;br /&gt;A BZZAgent!</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use and works very well.  A great value for the price especially when compared to other trimmers on the market.</li>
            <li> Very good, works fantastically and no problems so far. Does exactly as advertised, great battery life on a very quick charge. You can be very clumsy with this thing&#x27;s application/use and it wont cut up your face. (was extremely drunk and still got a near perfect shave.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I purchased one of these for my husband&#x27;s beard and hair.  The hair attachment does not cut close enough, so I wound up using the beard attachment for both.  So here&#x27;s the pros and cons:  PROS:  it is light in weight, has a good feel in your hand and can be washed under running water.  CONS: hair gets caught up in the attachment so you have to take it off a lot and clear it, hair gets all over the place during haircut (I gave up trying and just let it go and vacuum up afterward), does not cut some hairs especially the course ones on the eyebrows and beard.  The battery seems to charge for a few cuts; we have not let it run down yet.  We have used it about 4 times now and I still find it hard getting the beard even.</li>
            <li> Lasted a while, still have it. Good for a quick trim.</li>
            <li> Overall it is good trimmer and hair clipper based on price. However, very disappointed in hair length adjustment. In common sense, the length supposed to be adjusted in 1mm, 2mm, 3mm...etc. However, it has 1mm, 3mm, 5mm, 7mm...etc...something like this. This is not good at all.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer! I used it on my beard yesterday and love it just as much as I did the first time I used it! I like that its easily adjustable for different lengths and I love that its cordless! Its easy to pack and travel with and still sensible to use at home. Great product!</li>
            <li> This small thing packs a huge punch, when I got it from BzzAgent I knew I would love it. It&#x27;s easy to use and very versatile. You don&#x27;t have to worry about cords or loosing attachments, the trimmer is re-chargeable and there are two attachments that &#x27;slide&#x27; to change the length of your hair that is being cut. Although you must read carefully, this is a trimmer and not a shaver, so don&#x27;t expect it to get right down to your skin.</li>
            <li> I currently use one and i am prove to be a owner of one. It does get the job done and it is a trimmer so you get what you pay for. don&#x27;t expect it to be a shaver!</li>
            <li> i had been looking for a new hair trimmer for some time now and when i received it i was excited to use it. after using it a couple of times i was completely impressed with it. it took me some time to get used to because the measurements were different from my old hair trimmer but it works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it feels good in your hands with its rubber handle and the battery lasts pretty long, i haven&#x27;t really had to charge it in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only downside, if you could call it a downside, is that the hair will stick to the handle, since its rubber, but all you have to do is run it under water and it should be good.</li>
            <li> My husband wanted this so he could trim his facial hair and cut his hair with one razor.  The less devices the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great for the hair on his head.  It&#x27;s nice that it has the one comb that can be adjusted.  Having to put a different one on for different lengths could be a pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He did say that it didn&#x27;t give him as close of a shave on his face as his previous ones did.  This is using it without the comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall he is very pleased.  He hasn&#x27;t had any issues with it and it cuts really well.</li>
            <li> I mean, it works but I would not buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;The adjustments and everything about it is really nice but the power on this thing is really low.&lt;br /&gt;It would work so much better if it had just a tad-bit more juice. I&#x27;m sure it would work okay on thin hair (like arm hair or something) but for thicker facial hair... not satisfactory.</li>
            <li> Does not work.  Do not buy.</li>
            <li> Only giving one star because I have to.  No exaggeration, this is probably the worst product I have ever bought in my life.  It is horrible.  Doesn&#x27;t cut hair.  Doesn&#x27;t hold a charge.  I hope whoever designed this is on the street somewhere homeless.  Pure garbage.  Beyond upset I spent money on this crap and can&#x27;t take it back.</li>
            <li> I trim my beard every Sunday for the week ahead.  This does a good job and makes short work of it.  Battery stays charged a very long time.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I have used in a while. Multiple sizes makes life a lot easier. I recommend it, you will not regret.</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer, however it does not have enough individual length settings.  The beard trimmer increments are 2 mm which is too far apart.  The 3 mm setting is too short and the 5 mm setting is tool long for my liking.  Other than that I like the fact that you can use it on battery or AC power.</li>
            <li> the combs is not that good</li>
            <li> Feels great in your hand.  very strong with a good battery.  very easy to use.  no cheap parts and attachment isn&#x27;t flimsy.</li>
            <li> This was the best money I spent on a shaving product, period.  I cannot shave without getting major razor burn so I wanted something that could give me a trim and be portable.  A family member bought me a foil shaver which actually worked well, when my beard was still stubble.  Trying to use it after growing my beard out over the winter was useless.  There was no way to just trim up my beard.  I always knew about Braun but never wanted to spend the money on one.  Finally took the plunge and haven&#x27;t looked back.  There are so many options with this trimmer.  Two different guards give you adjustment from 1mm to 20mm.  Now I can get a wear heavy stubble or grow my beard out and keep it looking managed.  The charge on this is also very good.  I can squeeze 3 shaves out of a charge.  I would recommend this to anyone that needs full management of any length of hair.</li>
            <li> Was cheaper to buy new unit then to buy power cord. Arrived fine and both work great.</li>
            <li> Works well as expected just wish it could gonin the shower.</li>
            <li> Good beard trimmer but I don&#x27;t plan on using it for my hair. Its adjustable and rechargeable and those were two important factors I was looking for. Its all plastic so it has a bit of a cheap feel to it but what doesn&#x27;t anymore? For the price its a solid purchase.</li>
            <li> I have owned all kinds.  They don&#x27;t make them the way they used to (is anything?)  But I find this one easy to use and clean and it works.</li>
            <li> This was a birthday gift for my son and he thinks it&#x27;s terrific. Does everything it&#x27;s supposed to and does these functions very well.</li>
            <li> Efficient, and 1mm really does mean 1mm!</li>
            <li> After seeing this being advertising,using it now,what was advertised is what was sold.Good purchase</li>
            <li> I got this trimmer as I needed to tame my somewhat busy beard for a job interview. I picked it up at walmart for about the same price as amazon. The trimmer functioned flawlessly. It made trimming my beard a breeze, much easier than trying to do it by hand as I had in the past. One thing I will say is that I ended up using the &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; guard at 18mm for my beard as the others were too short and I didn&#x27;t want to loose that much beard. I&#x27;m happy with this and would buy again. Also I have not used it to trim my head so I can&#x27;t vouch for its usefulness in that area</li>
            <li> I wanted so badly for this product to work for me. I love Old Spice products and wanted this one to be just as awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it was far from it :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may do decently at cutting facial hair but it gets clogged up when doing head hair. I had to go over again and again and it still never got it right. Eventually I had to take out my old trimmers to not look like I unleashed a wild animal on myself.</li>
            <li> Really nice trimmer that holds its charge very well. Also looks good!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the same 8 years old Conair Beard Trimmer all this time but the battery was finally failing so I starting looking for a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally trim my beard pretty low leaving just a &amp;#34;shadow&amp;#34; on my face that looks pretty good. For this I have to remove any guide comb so I was worried to buy one trimmer that already have installed a adjustable guide but this one is perfect. I just need to adjust the guide to the minimum and I can have a very nice, clean and short beard. I was use to fight with my old Conair but now I can trim my beard in one minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One cons of this product vs my 8 years old Conair Beard Trimmer is the lack of a charging base. I hate to have the device on one side of my bathroom connected to the charging cable instead of having a nice charging base. Even without the charging base this item deserve 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try to modify the old Conair base to see if I can create one for this one.</li>
            <li> like it so far does what it say</li>
            <li> Works well and holds charge for a long time. The guides are also easy to use.</li>
            <li> One of the best beard trimmers I&#x27;ve owned. Smooth cut and no pulling.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t operate as strongly as I thought it would, even on a full charge. Need to go over the same spots a few times to get the trim down.</li>
            <li> I RECIEVED THIS PRODUCT TO TRY FROM BUZZ AGENT FOR FREE, UPON USING IT FOR THE FIRST TIME I WAS QUITE IMPRESSED,WITH ITS COMPACT SIZE I THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE A HARD TIME CUTTING DOWN MY THICK HAIR, IT WORKED LIKE A CHAMP IT NEVER STRUGGLED ONCE WHILE SHAVING DOWN MY HEAD.i WOULD RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT TO EVERYONE GIVE IT A TRY AND IT WONT LET YOU DOWN</li>
            <li> I found this to be a great trimmer. For the price that is.....&lt;br /&gt;Pros-price, adjustable lengths, GREAT battery life, sleek, trims close(but not really close), easy to use and clean&lt;br /&gt;Cons-Does not do a really close shave, if you have thick hair it can jam up easy, no old spice oils or scents with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun-Old Spice product was free thanks to bzzagent</li>
            <li> Good product. Minus one star for wobbly guards.</li>
            <li> I like this shaver, but I wish the blades were a little sharper.</li>
            <li> We bought this for my In-laws. They are &#x27;older&#x27; and my Father in Law gave his review &amp;#34;light weight, precise, gets the job done&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> . The trimmer is hard to cut the hair .... You should pass it many times to cut the hair.</li>
            <li> Good quality material, construction and functionally convenient. Visually very attractive as well unlike many others. Have used Remington MB-200 Titanium Mustache and Beard Trimmer in past which is at gr8 product and does what it is supposed to do i..e trim beard with only down side of rechargeable battery longevity which died after 2 years. If Old Spices Trimmer  battery is also NiCad then it will run into similar problems and only time will tell. Washing of blades feature with oil seems to be an excessive &amp; messy feature and wasn&#x27;t required in Remington. My decision to move towards Old Spice was on account of price (Remington was $29 n so was old spice), Voltage option from 110~240  and Battery Life which is not tested yet. Bottom line both are gr8 products and does what they are meant to do and price should be the deciding feature unless voltage option is required.</li>
            <li> Trimming great .....easy to adjust and use..</li>
            <li> Love it, cuts well, but has lost it&#x27;s ability to hold a charge after less than a month. Sigh.</li>
            <li> Son loves the trimer so does the rest of the family. He looks a lot better now.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected. I use to trim my beard and cut my hair. The charge lasts a long time, perhaps over thirty minutes. I expect the charge time to get longer after a few cycles.</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend, who had previously been trying to trim his beard with tiny scissors. He said this trimmer works great and is very easy to use. It does a really good job a getting his beard to just the perfect amount of scruffiness!</li>
            <li> It worked well enough at first, but after the battery ran down and I had to recharge it, it never worked as well again.  The battery would no longer hold a charge I would always have to use it while plugged in.  Even so, the trimmer didn&#x27;t seem to run as well as it had before.  Several times while trying to trim my beard it just stopped all together.  As far as I&#x27;m concerned this is a horrible product and it does not work as advertised.</li>
            <li> great for the beard and for the head is everything you have to know about this thing</li>
            <li> Maintaining a good looking beard is an art form.  Too short and you&#x27;ll look like you were too lazy to shave that morning, too long and you might be mistaken for a member of Duck Dynasty.  The Old Spice Braun Beard and head trimmer will help keep you looking more like Tony Stark and your wife will love you for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First impressions of the Old Spice Beard trimmer were great.  The trimmer had a good weight to it, the plastics felt like high quality, and the color scheme was manly and modern.  Overall I think they did a great job with the design, it&#x27;s comfortable to use, the length settings are easy enough to adjust and stay locked into place.  No issues with pulling or irritation.  The waterproof design makes cleanup much easier, but it is still difficult to get some of the nooks and cranny&#x27;s fully cleaned out, an issue I find with every trimmer.  The battery has a good life span, have never had it run out of charge mid shave.  I do charge it after every use to keep full power though, I find it seems to perform better this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend giving this trimmer a shot.  It&#x27;s not much more than the cheap throw away trimmers you can pickup at the local big box store, and it feels and performs much better.  Starting your morning using a quality product that performs consistently as expected is something I&#x27;ve come to value and appreciate.</li>
            <li> I received this trimmer part of a BzzAgent campaign. I was really excited about using it to trim my beard.&lt;br /&gt;I tried using it for that, but it barely trimmed any. Needless to say, I have a thick full beard and it did not work that well on it. It mgith do better on thinner and less filled beards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When used to cut my brother&#x27;s hair though, it was perfect. The fact that the plastic head cover is adjustable where you can change the trimming size without switching heads is ideal! You are one click away from changing the size and giving a very effective, less noisy, and easy trim to anyone&#x27;s hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this as a head trimmer  but not a beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> when i got the package. it was easy to open. it trims very well easy to use with the two different heads. and easy to change lengths. the only down fall i see or i should say hear is when i plugged it in too charge i can here i very high pitch noise. but if you leave the room you cant hear it anymore. i got this free courtesy of bzzagent and old spice beard and head trimmer, powered by braun</li>
            <li> The good and the bad:&lt;br /&gt;(Disclaimer) I received this product for free through a promotional trial and was asked to write my honest opinion about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beard:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me start out with that I have never really used a manual razor, well at least it has been a while since I used one and I had rarely used it back then. As part of the newer generation, I started out with an electric trimmer, and though it kept my mustache down (except for Movember!), I would end have having to revert to a scissor for my beard. I like my beard grown out just the right amount and with a trimmer, its all or nothing. I had to use a scissor to keep my beard in check, and while that may seem like not a problem, I more electronics to last me a week, I even use an electric razor, using scissors, is almost barbaric to me. And then came this Old Spice Beard and Head trimmer. Sure it was not meant for controlling other hair growth (mustaches, sorry, this is not your time) and sure, now I have two trimmers, but the time I save, is worth the problem of keeping the two devices charged. That being said, This trimmer is only for your head and beard. I usually take the cover off such trimmers to give myself a fine trim, but the blades on this device are not designed for that. Also, the trimmer comes with two attachments, keep one on, it helps, it really does. Lastly, I would like to conclude with a very important point. The trimmer advertises that you can wash the head by sticking it under a stream of water. Throw away all the times you were told not to stick electronics under water, it&#x27;s safe. Old Spice has got you covered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to have this old hair trimmer, It came in one of those \\&quot;As Seen On TV\\&quot; kits, and for a while it served me well. Fast-forward two years ahead, now the trimmer is mostly dead, the blades are dull, there is hair  stuck to the device, it simply is a mess. And then came the Old Spice Beard and Head trimmer. I have used if before for my beard but now I would try to replace my defunct hair trimmer with &#x27;modern&#x27; technology. I felt a sense of nostalgia as I plugged in the trimmer and got ready to lose a few excessive locks of hair. Instead of the buzz load enough to make me deaf, the calm, almost whisper-silent trimmer, started its work. No more hair-tugging, the trimmer performed its task with the skill of a fully licensed surgeon and barely 5 minutes later, my head was no longer covered by enough hair to cause my parents to rush me to the nearest barber shop. Not bad for what most people will only classify as a beard trimmer. Just remember, its both a beard AND hair trimmer. Why I would not recommend trying to accomplish a full haircut with this device, If you have a few extra minutes in the morning and you feel that your hair could use a little flattening, just give it a shot.</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you&#x27;re anything like me the reason you got this is because you hate shaving. I&#x27;ve dealt with regular clippers that are too heavy and still rough on my face. And I have dealt with those stupid electric razors which cause my skin more irritation than a normal razor. However, this product is the perfect thing I&#x27;ve been looking for. Not only do the attachments allow for easy use but the cut is so clean with no pulling and tugging that my face isn&#x27;t irritated and rashed out afterwards. Most clippers this good are found in salons and barber shops that run around 100 dollars. For the price and the performance nothing beats these. This is a review that people should and believe because they work.</li>
            <li> The Old Spice Beard &amp; Head Trimmer is awesome! I use it once or twice a week to keep myself looking fresh. I now have no need to go to the barbershop, this product gives me the perfect fade. No complaints here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Oh yeah, I should probably mention I got it for free from BzzAgent!)</li>
            <li> What cant this thing do??? THe adjustable sizes are very easy to use and the trimmer works awesome. Ive used it daily since its arrival and it doesnt get hot like some do. Its just an overall great shaver</li>
            <li> First, The trimmer design and aesthetics are very slick and compact making it easy to grip. The charger is abnormally long in an odd way at the plug. Making it difficult to keep plugged in to older sockets. The charger itself has a noise to it unlike I have heard before, it is a very low grinding noise while charging. I only really ever noticed it when I was near it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer functionality hasn&#x27;t really impressed me. Unlike other Braun products I have used before. It&#x27;s not true to name like I know Braun to have. Although I will say the adjustable all-in one guard is nothing short of ingenious. It was very easy and self explanatory changing between the beard and head guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the beard trimmer it has yet to let me down. It has jammed a few times but I have found that to happen across the board with any trimmer I have ever used. As far as the &amp;#34;Head Trimmer&amp;#34; aspect i&#x27;m very disappointed it&#x27;s to small to effectively function as a head trimmer. It also doesn&#x27;t perform well when trimming thicker hair. I experienced it to &amp;#34;bog down&amp;#34;, snag and pull hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would place this trimmer in an average class placing lower price point than other trimmers on the market right now. Due to functionality and the fact it didn&#x27;t really stand out over other Braun powered products. Personally I wouldn&#x27;t buy it with the product as it is right now, I would reconsider a purchase with some modifications to the head trimming aspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To conclude this is an exceptional beard trimmer yet sub-par head trimmer. Right now I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this trimmer over any other trimmer that is already out there. It does the job and depending on the price point may do well. I suggest anyone, as I would any product, look at what the trimmer has to offer and what would best suit your needs before you make a purchase.</li>
            <li> Everything it advertises, it does. My only criticism is labeling the head and beard more specifically, I made that mistale once on my head and the outcome was not petty but other than that it works well.</li>
            <li> I recieved this awesome trimmer free via bzzagent and had the opportunity to test and review the product. I have only used this as a trimmer and had great results!  It is sleek and easy to handle and store. Multiple adjustable trim lengths are great for many different options. I didn&#x27;t use it to trim my hair, but I would recommend getting one for yourself and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll work great, as it does for beard trimming!  I would definitely recommend this trimmer to anyone.</li>
            <li> I give this product a five star rating because it has a great design, it works well in the shower and is effective at shaving. It does not tug the skin and it so new that I feel that it has the best technology in it. If you are looking for a great shaver, I recommend this shaver and you will enjoy using this at the sink or even in the shower because it is waterproof.</li>
            <li> awesome seller, super fast postage, Definately Recommended A+++++</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not feeling all the great reviews. I have curly face hair and this doesn&#x27;t pick it up very well, not as well as the similar Panasonic did, but I didn&#x27;t think it&#x27;s battery lasted long enough and it didn&#x27;t have a cord, so I&#x27;ll keep this one.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  Nice running trimmer.  I&#x27;ve done several beard trims and several haircuts (on myself) now ... and the unit works just fine.  Comes with two attachments, one for beard and one for hair.  Also has a brush and oil to help with cleaning the clipper area.  Charges fine.  No problems.  I felt it was worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Holds a charge well and has a pretty great build quality.</li>
            <li> Does not shave as evenly as my last beard trimmer by Philips.  Leaves big patches of hair (i use the lowest setting).  Returning.</li>
            <li> Excellent beard trimmer. I shopped quite a bit on Amazon and found this odd-looking trimmer to be the best combination of high customer ratings and reasonable price. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my choice. The only thing I regret is not throwing away my old one several years ago and buying this. It has two alternative cutting guides, so whether you want a very close trim or a longer beard, it&#x27;ll handle 20 different lengths. Also like the fact that if the battery runs down, it will operate while being plugged in. Many rechargeables don&#x27;t do that; my last one (Remington) didn&#x27;t. Blades cut extremely well and cleanly; no frayed ends. I recommend this trimmer to anyone, even if you don&#x27;t wear Old Spice! It&#x27;s made by Braun, and I&#x27;ve had nothing but good experience with that brand.</li>
            <li> Used on short hair on my head and had to clean the hair from the cutter almost with each pass. Made cutting my hair a long annoying ordeal. Also used it on my beard which was about one inch long. The cutters grabbed and pulled on the hair hurting my face. I returned the trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is basically a Braun Cruzer 5 Beard and Head Trimmer, This is branded as Old Spice Beard and Head Trimmer and is $10.00 cheaper! It get&#x27;s the job done and the price is right. I broke my Braun Cruzer 5 and bought the Old Spice at the cheaper price and yes the attachments are interchangeable right down to the blade head assembly. This one will last a while as I have the spare parts and learned a valuable lesson about dropping my shaver on a hard floor.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well so far</li>
            <li> Looked promising from the specs and reviews. Once I got it, I plugged it in to charge. As one other reviewer mentioned, either the buzzer or the charger emits a very high pitched squeal when plugged in. It was annoying enough for me that I&#x27;ll be looking elsewhere for a new buzzer. Returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another note - my old Remington buzzer had about 3 feet of straight cord. This has about 1.5-2 feet of curly cord. Not ideal.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s not so good for very close trimming on the back of the neck, but the guards work very well for trimming my beard and cutting my son&#x27;s hair. Very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Used it once yesterday when it arrived and it works as advertised</li>
            <li> Seems to do the job really well.  A bit plastically but still sturdy enough for regular use.</li>
            <li> I am impressed with how this trimmer is put together. I have a very thick beard and this performs better than any other trimmer I have owned. Easy cleanup and the charge lasts forever it seems!</li>
            <li> very fast delivery with professional packaging.i am very happy with trimmer with this good price,will recommend.</li>
            <li> just what I had been looking for -perfect.</li>
            <li> Trims my beard evenly and the charge lasts for more than enough time. I can travel with it for up to a week without a charger!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, met my expectations.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm - good product. I would definitely buy from the seller again.</li>
            <li> Nice design ; works well</li>
            <li> I have been looking for some time for a trimmer to use to trim the mustache part of my goatee weekly and to trim the rest occasionally. I had previosly bought the [[ASIN:B001MIZMRK Schick Quattro Titanium Trimmer]] here. It was kind of a joke...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this one and was a little worried that the head would be too large to trim my mustache effectively. The combs adjusted easily to a size that I liked. The trimmer was fairly quiet when turned on (quiter than the Schick easily). It easily trimmed my not very thick or coarse mustache. I was able to easily take the comb off so that I could trim around my upper lip. I really wasn&#x27;t used to a trimmer that cut so effortlessly. I really am impressed with it so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initial charge time is supposed to be 4 hours and subsequent charges take 8 hours. It is supposed to last about 45 min for each charge. I can live with those times as I really won&#x27;t be using it all that much each week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I can recommend this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW this is essentially a [[ASIN:B004WIUNCG Braun Cruzer 6 Beard and Head Trimmer]] that has been rebranded for Old Spice.</li>
            <li> It works great and came charged... Not sure what else would be needed.</li>
            <li> The battery light suddenly stopped lighting up couple of weeks ago when plugged-in to charge. Now the unit does not even charge up, or hardly charges, even when left plugged in overnight. Terrible. Amazon says it&#x27;s too late to return it.</li>
            <li> Probably the best beard trimmer I have ever owned and such good value!</li>
            <li> First and formost , I would like to thank bzzagent for givng me this free product to try. Without them I would not have gave this review on how I feel about the Old Spice Beard and hair trimmer so that people would know about the product they are buying beforehand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: I have been using the Old Spice beard and Hair Trimmer for awhile now by using it as a needed helper for me to have the cleanest shave as I can possibly make it ( use both a razor and the trimmer ). This trimmer is good and meets all of my needs however , cleaning it up is a pain and Power consumption is an issue&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Build of product: When i start to hold on to this old spice product , it felt nice and slick. The product is made of hard , durable plastic that really feels like its worth the msrp that the product is priced (50 dollars ). The only problem with this product is that I wish the on/off button would be alittle bit softer to push due to minor injury&#x27;s ( like soreness). Also sometimes the guards are sometimes difficult to get on the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Batterys: With the Old Spice Hair and Beard Trimmer, you do not need to use regular battery&#x27;s cause this product has a built in chargeable battery ( with the charger included of course ). What I like most about this is that it&#x27;s efficient , saves the environment from pollution of regular battery&#x27;s, and saves you money from not buying battery&#x27;s at the store every single week&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usage: When using the Old Spice Beard and Hair Trimmer, it seems that it trims all of the hair on my face with no problems whatsoever. It is just that when the battery starts to die , the trimmer starts to under perform and that bothers me greatly . i would like a product to be fully operational until the battery dies out instead of it weakening WHILE USING IT thus, not getting a clean trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning: Cleaning the Old Spice Trimmer was pretty easy when taking the guard off and cleaning out the outside areas of this Old Spice product, but even with the tools that the product seem to gave me I still find it difficult to get inside of the machine where there are hard to reach areas that are difficult/impossible to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: The Old Spice Hair and Beard Trimmer has some issues that I think a Trimmer / shaver enthusiast would not be eyeballing over/freak out about , but would not care as much to the regular joe buying it in a store like Walmart or target. Overall in my honest opinion , I think the goods outweigh the bad and seems to work at what it was advertised to do.</li>
            <li> This product was a cool trimmer and a pretty neat concept. The battery lasts quite a long time. The trimming itself does a pretty good job keeping the facial hair at the same constant rate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downfall would be that sometimes the trimmer doesn&#x27;t pull up some of their hairs (leaving long pieces in places) which means I have to go over the same spot multiple times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other then that the trimmer is awesome because it has 2 detachable heads for different variable lengths.</li>
            <li> after getting this razor i was very impressed at the accessories that came with it and how well they worked. I have used it for around 2 months now and it has helped keep my bear trimmed and professional. The strange thing is that my wife also enjoys this razor. she told me it helped her get a better shave before she used her traditional razor. Overall this is a great product that i would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free from Braun to test and review by thanks of [...]  As soon as the package came i was a bit worried it would be a piece of junk like every other Trimmer i&#x27;ve encountered but right out of the box it had a nice Sleek Black and Red color that just spoke \\&quot;I&#x27;m the one\\&quot; to me. In the box was The Trimmer, 2 attachments that would cut at all lengths, a little brush to clear the hair off the trimmer, lubrication oil for the blades and an instruction booklet with of course the battery charger. I immediately wanted to try this thing out because i had been growing my hair for weeks in prep for it so i raced to the kids rooms and asked \\&quot;Hey wanna cut some hair?\\&quot; Within moments i was sitting there having my hair shaved off by a 2 year old and his older 4 year old brother. The Trimmers raw power easily shaved me bald in about 2 minutes which is extremely impressive. Lets get to the Real important things.    Pros-  Wireless for anywhere anytime.  Great battery life and charge time.  Gentle on all skin even the personal areas.  Really easy to clean and use.  Changing and removing attachments is a breeze.  Several attachments for every ones hair.  Safe enough for kid use with minimal advisement.    Cons-  It only cuts one way.  I researched the price and it&#x27;s costly but worth it.  Gets clogged if not cleaned after every cut.    Final Opinion- The product is amazing and extremely useful! I would suggest this product to anyone who wants a quick cut anywhere even those sensitive areas at anytime!</li>
            <li> I love this grooming tool! I took a chance and bought this after my previous hair/beard trimmer, the Cruzer (also by Braun) cracked and fell apart on me. To be fair, I was careless with it, banging it on the sink to clear the hair clippings from the guard. This Old Spice version is nearly identical, but this one is much more powerful and gives a better cut without having to run over one area multiple times. It also comes with a small brush to clear out the clippings. I only wish the guard pieces were made of stronger plastic, or even metal. Otherwise, this thing is amazing for the money. You&#x27;ll save hundreds of dollars in haircuts, easily.</li>
            <li> The charge on this portable trimmer will last about one session. It creates an uneven cut on my beard depending on the amount of pressure I place on an area of skin. It seems that the plastic cover that determines the depth of cut seems to move as I apply pressure. It is not easy to trim my thick hair, The actual blade on the trimmer is a bit blunt and does not shape my beard like I would want it too. I still have to use a razor to do the job. A pro is that the trimmer is light to the feel and it charges somewhat quickly. I am not particular impressed and I would return the item if I had remembered to return it within 30 days.</li>
            <li> best cordless not-close shaver yet</li>
            <li> I replaced a beard trimmer that would actually cut without applying pressure on bead hairs-This one won&#x27;t. It does trim but must be pushed into beard. We&#x27;ll see how long it lasts........</li>
            <li> The motor kept bogging down and stalling out even though it had been charging for over 24 hours. I tried using it while it was plugged in and it didn&#x27;t make any difference. My beard is very thin (3-5mm) and should not have caused it such problems. Took me forever to get through one beard trimming. Very surprised that something using the Braun name is so poorly made.</li>
            <li> I have had cheap trimmers and this was a great deal.  I have a fairly thick beard and I grow it out and trim it up and this works great.</li>
            <li> Charging causes weird high-pitched whining sound - not from the trimmer but the plug in itself. The sound stops once it&#x27;s fully charged. Very strange. Other than that, it&#x27;s great. Looks cool, is well thought out and has good battery life.</li>
            <li> 2 things. If you only want this for your beard then it&#x27;s a good product. Altough, having a manly beard as I usually do is not that simply to find a good set up for the high of the razors. The battery is awesome and is really easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The very first thing I noticed when I began to charge my new Old Spice Beard &amp; Head Trimmer was that the charger made a very high, low screeching noise from the charger. It never stopped and I&#x27;m not sure if all chargers do this but I found it highly annoying. Granted you can&#x27;t hear it more than say a few feet away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to the trimmer I wasn&#x27;t totally impressed. It functioned as it was designed with many options to choose from when changing the length of the clip. It was easy to take off and replace with another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product did a fairly average job at cutting hair and did not jam for me. To me it is very similar in quality to many others which may be at a  lower price point than the Old Spice Head &amp; Beard Trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I don&#x27;t qualify the product as not worth buying I believe you should research what you&#x27;re looking for in a head and beard trimmer. If this product matches what you are looking for, then I suggest it greatly. If this product doesn&#x27;t match what you are looking for and you find qualities in other trimmers that this one does not have, I suggest you select a different one as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To summarize my opinion on the product I conclude that this product yields average results with average quality. The buyer should look into their expectations of this product, and if this product does not meet those expectations they should look for an alternative.</li>
            <li> Work decent on facial and head hair, motion is not as fast as it should be, the motor runs a little too slow for my liking. There are better products available but this one is a great cheaper alternative very comparable to its competition.  I got this item free to try, I am a Bzz Agent.  For the price this is ranked in my top 3.</li>
            <li> I received the product for free, to try and review, from Braun. As soon as I started using my Old Spice trimmer, I knew they would be replacing my old trimmers! The main reason is, I love the adjustable cutting length without having to go through several different attachments! This has saved me time in both cutting my hair and cleaning up afterwards. Instead of 4 different combs to clean, I now just have the one, adjustable, cutting attachment. I was afraid that somehow I would change the setting as I was using the trimmers, but that was not the case! It comes with a charging cable and is also battery powered so there is not a cord always getting in the way. These trimmers cut just as well as when I get my hair cut done at a barber shop. My old trimmers are already in the garbage, because I will not be needing them again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not the biggest fan of this trimmer, because I couldn&#x27;t trim my facial hair very short, so I just had to end up shaving it all off.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this product if you like your facial hair very short, because you won&#x27;t be able to get it that short.</li>
            <li> I received this trimmer for free from being a BzzAgent. This is a really nice trimmer.  It is easy to handle and easy to use.  The head is adjustable so you don&#x27;t have to keep up with a bunch of head attachments for different lengths.  I can get multiple trims off of the same charge.  It doesn&#x27;t snag or pull my hair when I am trimming.  I do not like for my facial hair to be very long so I would shave it off regularly because I did not have a suitable way to keep it trimmed.  With the Old Spice trimmer, it is easy to keep my facial hair trimmed as short as I like it.  This is a great hair trimmer!!</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer, I am able to take it with me on road trips and when i go elsewhere for the weekend. It works very well keeps me looking  good with a clean cut when i need to for special occasions.</li>
            <li> Love this product first timer and its worth your money...If you don&#x27;t like to spend alot but get the same great product this is the one to get. I love it and its easy to use.</li>
            <li> Cuts well enough but cheaply made. Every time I adjust the guard I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll break it. I&#x27;m sure I will it&#x27;s just a matter of when. Not sure I&#x27;ll keep it that long even, though, because the battery life is so short I have to plug it in most nights to keep it charged. Then again it was cheap but when it breaks I&#x27;ll look for a different one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good trimmer didn&#x27;t used for my head yet but good with beard . Best thing it&#x27;s washable so easy to keep tide</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good and cheap shaver, I can say I found it. I recommend it to all those guys who want to conserve the beard with style.</li>
            <li> Everything about this trimmer is just so awesome, I can use out straight out of the shower or give my beard a quick trim on a night out! It&#x27;s really smooth and is just really handy to have for someone who likes to keep their personal hygiene with their hair nice.</li>
            <li> I have had nothing but good luck with this trimmer. It does everything that I want it to do (actually cut my hair) plus more (no cuts). I  mean it doesn&#x27;t pull the hair out of your face or anything. It works slick and does so even after having it for the little while that I have had it. It also is able to keep every hair that length that you want without having to worry about it accidentally cutting a section too short. I love it and will keep on using it!</li>
            <li> This review is for the head shave feature of this trimmer.    I was part of a group of people who helped E! Entertainment break a world record for most heads shaved in one hour by letting them shave my head [...]. After the head shave, I had a some clean up to do. Getting my head shaved in less than 45 seconds, left my haircut slightly imperfect. The way I saw it, my options were to go to a barber and pay to have it cleaned up, which seemed stupid since I barely had any hair at all, or go home and use my new Old Spice trimmer to even out my newly shaven head for FREE. Clearly, the second option won out, and I&#x27;m happy to say that it worked perfectly. The cordless feature was great so I didn&#x27;t have to be attached to the wall to shave my head. The trim was even and comfortable. The trimmer did not pull my hair. The only problem was probably one that would be true with any trimmer: when pushing the trimmer against my nearly bare head, it left my head slightly red from irritation of having plastic rubbed against it.    My head looks pretty great and I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments on my new haircut. Some of the credit goes to Julian Payne, owner, founder, and world record holder from The Original Mobile Barbershop Co. in Los Angeles, and some of the credit goes to my cool new Old Spice razor!</li>
            <li> I thoroughly enjoy using this trimmer. It is the best one I have ever used and holds its charge for an exceedingly long amount of time. I just had to recharge it after using it a bunch of times. It is very quiet, cuts the hair well, and it is really convenient to clean due to the fact it can get wet.  I got this trimmer for free from Bzzagent, which sent me a retail version of the product for me to review.</li>
            <li> Very good cutting blades - give good/clean cut.  The guards provided give a really good finished job.  Balance in the hand is &#x27;just right&#x27;.  Recommend *****</li>
            <li> Easy to use, shaped to be held in our hand.  Different length settings are great.  Long battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  I purchased this unit.  I did not get it as an &amp;#34;evaluation gift&amp;#34; from the distributor/manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Pros: Easy to use, charges quickly, works well on beard and head hair, easy to clean, and really cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: none&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other thoughts: I usually don&#x27;t give five stars unless the quality blows me away. This product did not blow me away with its quality (although it works great) it is a combination of price and quality that earned five stars in this case.</li>
            <li> So far, I am very pleased with this beard and head trimmer. Personally, I don&#x27;t use the head trimming function, however I don&#x27;t think it would work for how thick my hair is very well. However, I do love how cleanly it cuts my beard and keeps it at my preferred perfect length. It&#x27;s especially nice in my opinion that it doesn&#x27;t give a perfectly clean shave, rather a light shadow.</li>
            <li> Like it so far. Does what it says. It is waterproof, it cuts beards, it is rechargeable, it fits the hand nicely. It has a very handy trim gauge for setting the beard length. I suspect, however, that the minimum length setting might be a little long for &amp;#34;stubble,&amp;#34; but I am not using it for stubble cutting. But pay attention to the fine print: it is a NiCad battery from the hints in the writeup. The instructions say that you should periodically discharge all the way and recharge to keep the battery from degrading.</li>
            <li> Awsome product ...simple, easy to use and works as described</li>
            <li> This trimmer is neat in every way. I previously had two Norelco trimmers which were junk. Having used Braun shavers for years, I gave this trimmer a shot. I even like the color. I recommend this trimmer to everyone needing one.</li>
            <li> Well made and a pleasure to use.  Easily adjustable over a wide range.  Blades do not pull hairs and are sharp and effective.  Easy to rinse off, easy to charge.</li>
            <li> This is so much better than my old beard trimmer! It doesn&#x27;t jam or clog up with hair. It hold a good charge for multiple uses. The guide that controls the depth/length stays put. And it costs half of what I paid for my old trimmer. I even like the &amp;#34;Old Spice&amp;#34; red color!</li>
            <li> best trimmer I&#x27;ve owned in 41 years!</li>
            <li> No better, no worse than competitors</li>
            <li> If I could give it a negative star I would do so. This is not the fault of Old Spice or Braun. The package came two days later, even though we pay for Prime membership, and it was opened and used. It was used by someone else. The packaging was ripped already and when I removed the razor someone else&#x27;s hair fell on to my lap. It is disgusting. I don&#x27;t know who the hair belongs to or where it belongs to.</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m not giving this BRAUN trimmer 5 stars is because it had the bad taste of putting the name Old Spice on it.&lt;br /&gt;It really is an excellent trimmer that holds a charge and is VERY easy to adjust. Unlike my last trimmer, this one stays on the setting you choose. Mine last one was always self adjusting - probably because my cave man arms used too much pressure.  LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just ignore the name on it and enjoy the fine quality it is!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Denille</li>
            <li> Love it. it works like a charm!</li>
            <li> Best facial shaver I&#x27;ve found yet! Battery life is long and strong, adjustable head for both facial hair and head hair, very solid construction. Oh and the best is that you can run it directly from the power out of the wall, thereforeiff the battery ever permanently dies you can still use it when it is plugged in. Not much else to say about a shaver, but this thing is sweet none the less.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves it! Many trim options without the hassle of changing heads!</li>
            <li> This item did not cut hair well at all and the charge only lasted minutes. I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Definitely the best trimmer I have ever had.</li>
            <li> Very nice clipper. Works great on hair! Works ok on long beards.</li>
            <li> This beard trimmer is great.  Why would you spend more or go anywhere else to get one.</li>
            <li> This lightweight clipper does a barber-like job cutting my hair and trimming my goatee and moustache</li>
            <li> works good.. battery lasts for ever and you can adjust the trim to what you want</li>
            <li> Its a good concept but poorly made. The odd shape makes a difficult time for the back of the head and under the chin. I do like the idea of being able to charge and use the trimmer at the same time but either way its under powered and pulls hair rather than cut. I also liked the idea of having two guides and tons of settings but none are long enough for a real beard. This might work for someone but not worth the money to me.</li>
            <li> Well built, looks good and, works well once you get the hang of it. Battery lasts very long time before a charge is required.</li>
            <li> It does what it is intended to do, but really the blades are not that sharp enough to make an even cut. Not a bad trimmer, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> My son wanted a beard trimmer to replace an older one that wasn&#x27;t working well at all. He loves this Old Spice trimmer. It allows him to give himself that day-old beard look he wants. It works well cordless or plugged in, and recharges quickly. He says it&#x27;s comfortable in his hand and feels substantial but not heavy.</li>
