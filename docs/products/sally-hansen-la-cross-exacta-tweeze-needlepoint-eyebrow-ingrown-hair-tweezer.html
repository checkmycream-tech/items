            <li>I love these tweezers, by the far the best in the industry</li>
            <li>A favorite for splinters and</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found these tweezers on Amazon because they are hands down the best pair I have ever bought.</li>
            <li>These tweezers seem okay at first, but they don&#x27;t seem to be able to grab a hair like you would think tweezers should be able to.  </li>
            <li>I liked them so much that I ordered 3 more.</li>
            <li>Now I got some practice and I will strongly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>It has the exact kind of precision you would look for in a tweezer.</li>
            <li>They do not grab fine hair like the suppose to.</li>
            <li>They do a great job for fine facial hair removal and for splinters.</li>
            <li>Very very light weight-feels like aluminum, not heavy like the authentic ones.</li>
            <li>not rounded at all and super sturdy.</li>
            <li>The tip is not pointing straight so I cant pull the hairs, very easily specially the fine hairs (which is what the tweezer is supposed to be for. )</li>
            <li>They last a long time and are just the best tweezers to have.</li>
            <li>After I fell in love with these tweezers, I realised I was not using any other tweezer any more.</li>
            <li>They had both La Cross and Sally Hansen names on the packaging and (like these) were very inexpensive; however, they were the great original La Cross quality.</li>
            <li>We have found that only really sharp, needlepoint tweezers work well for this, and these were the best we could find for a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love these tweezers and this one was the only pair that I could find online anywhere.</li>
            <li>this is the first time i tried Lacross will not recommend</li>
            <li>However, the ones I received are okay but would have appreciated knowing I was getting a different one.  </li>
            <li>The most obvious things that I noticed when I got them, were that the design was very different from the original ones.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much Sally Hansen....</li>
            <li>I really should&#x27;ve read the reviews, but the packaging they show in the picture looks just like the real ones, however, this is not the package you will get in the mail</li>
            <li>You will receive tweezers, but they will NOT be what they&#x27;re advertising and they will NOT be the real ones from Sally Hansen.</li>
            <li>With that being said, the shipment was fast and arrived before the delivery date.  </li>
            <li>And this tweezer has the best grip to remove those stubborn and micro thin and tiny hairs.</li>
            <li>tight spots - high quality product - cheap price - very happy - Buy several for all loactions - not much more to say</li>
            <li>I have a pair of the original Sally Hansen La Cross Tweezers and these DON&#x27;T even come close to working like those do.</li>
            <li>The packaging it came in doesn&#x27;t look anything like the Amazon photo, but they are definitely the right tweezers.  </li>
            <li>I cant stress enough how much I like it.</li>
            <li>so I tend to lose it by keeping it by my bedside, in the bathroom, near the sink, in the kitchen sometimes.</li>
            <li>Also, I purchased this item by the item number on the old package of tweezers I had.  </li>
            <li>There was no item number on the package even though they show one in the picture and theses ones are longer, lighter and of lesser quality than the real ones.</li>
            <li>Tips were too blunt not sharp at all.</li>
            <li>but these are definitely not made to the same high quality specifications.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;La Cross&amp;#34; generally has good products but this purchase was a disappointment.</li>
            <li>Apparently something changed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m big on online reviews, as I shop online frequently.  </li>
            <li>These tweezers have a pretty sharp point that can solidly grab hairs and splinters.  </li>
            <li>It is pointed enough but not sharp to poke the skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used these tweezers; when I ordered the last time, like another reviewer noted the handle had holes, and the points were not sharp and would not grab hair.</li>
            <li>The points are just fine enough that I can do minor probing and opening of the skin to help take out small splinters.  </li>

            <li> I was greatly disappointed once I received these tweezers. They do not grab fine hair like the suppose to. The holes in the side of them makes them uncomfortable to hold. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again. Please spend your money on something better!!!</li>
            <li> good to keep using pointed tip safer method of removal even small items of hard to reach areas improves visable area using less tool tip point</li>
            <li> My only dissapointment is that i can&#x27;t get them anywhere but online now. I have been using these for years and they are perfect for every tweezing need i have. splinters, eyebrows, hangnails, etc. they are even sharp enough for me to tear the skin just a little to get the stubborn splinters that need it (we get a lot of them in our cabinet shop). not rounded at all and super sturdy. my parents and sister use them too. the only reason i have to replace them is because my kids take off with them so i try to keep at least two pair on hand.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found these tweezers on Amazon because they are hands down the best pair I have ever bought. My mom always borrowed them so when I found them I ordered a few for her and my sisters. They last a long time and are just the best tweezers to have.</li>
            <li> I have bought several tweezers from the department stores and have tried about 8-10 tweezers. Of my random purchases, this tweezer surprised me so much that I had to buy 10 of these online. I am not kidding. After I fell in love with these tweezers, I realised I was not using any other tweezer any more. Everytime I had to pluck, I was reaching out the for the same tweezer. It does a great job in removing ingrown hairs. I have pretty bad ingrowns. I try to wiggle the pointed tip over the ingrown untill a tiny hair pops out. And this tweezer has the best grip to remove those stubborn and micro thin and tiny hairs. It is pointed enough but not sharp to poke the skin. It has the exact kind of precision you would look for in a tweezer. I cant stress enough how much I like it. Unfortunately, I could not find it anymore in grocery store or department store once I discovered this treasure. And The only place I found it at was at harmons and it was selling for $21 there. I couldnt believe it. I then decided to search for it online. Now that I found it online here, I purchased 10 of these in one go because I kept loosing that one little tweezer i would reach for everyday. When you have only 1 of this thing, it is tiny so I tend to lose it by keeping it by my bedside, in the bathroom, near the sink, in the kitchen sometimes. And then I forget where it is. I was once travelling and someone asked me where they could find one and that they have been looking for it for a while too. Trust me on this one, this one is hard to find in stores. I also suffer from PCOS (a hormonal disease) and this is my life saver.  Good luck finding this treasure!! Now I have plenty, I dont have to worry about these anymore!! Love Love Love this tweezer!!   No tweezer in the world can beat this one. Thank you so much Sally Hansen.... without your LaCross Exacta..... OMG!! Cant even imagine my day!!  THANK YOU !!</li>
            <li> I love these tweezers and this one was the only pair that I could find online anywhere.</li>
            <li> It has no strength to remove hair.  I bought it to tweeze eyebrows but it does not grasp and or pull out hair the way I expected.</li>
            <li> Not the same as the ones I purchased before, for a 1/4 of the price.  Same brand, etc, just the quality is not there anymore.</li>
            <li> The product is not what I expected.  Because I could not see the tweezer from all angles, the one  I received had holes down the side of it; while the one pictured does not show whether it has holes. Also, I purchased this item by the item number on the old package of tweezers I had.  Apparently something changed.</li>
            <li> I have a pair of the original Sally Hansen La Cross Tweezers and these DON&#x27;T even come close to working like those do. The most obvious things that I noticed when I got them, were that the design was very different from the original ones. There was no item number on the package even though they show one in the picture and theses ones are longer, lighter and of lesser quality than the real ones. These are total KNOCK-OFFS. BUYER BE WARE! They do not grasp hair and the handle design makes them difficult to hold. Very very light weight-feels like aluminum, not heavy like the authentic ones. Total disappointment. I really should&#x27;ve read the reviews, but the packaging they show in the picture looks just like the real ones, however, this is not the package you will get in the mail and this is definatly not the item you will get in the mail. You will receive tweezers, but they will NOT be what they&#x27;re advertising and they will NOT be the real ones from Sally Hansen. Consider yourself warned and please don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> They can remove even the smallest hairs and they are of superior quality.  I ordered the Sally Hansen and the LaCross am very pleased with performance of both and would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used these tweezers; when I ordered the last time, like another reviewer noted the handle had holes, and the points were not sharp and would not grab hair. I was so disappointed. Whey do they always change something that is well priced and works?</li>
            <li> Not as pictured.  However, the ones I received are okay but would have appreciated knowing I was getting a different one.  Would I order this again.....probably not</li>
            <li> lost grip after 2 months use</li>
            <li> I love these tweezers, by the far the best in the industry</li>
            <li> We bought these for only one reason, to remove splinters.  We have found that only really sharp, needlepoint tweezers work well for this, and these were the best we could find for a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do the job well, could maybe be even sharper, but we are happy with them.</li>
            <li> I purchased some locally that were being discontinued. They had both La Cross and Sally Hansen names on the packaging and (like these) were very inexpensive; however, they were the great original La Cross quality. Thinking these would be the same I ordered quite a few but these are definitely not made to the same high quality specifications. The packaging is the only thing that is the same. It was impossible to tell online that they were so inferior. A total waste at any price.</li>
            <li> I like this tweeze, inasmuch it was not really easy to work with it at the beginning. Now I got some practice and I will strongly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> These tweezers seem okay at first, but they don&#x27;t seem to be able to grab a hair like you would think tweezers should be able to.  I still prefer the regular Sally Hansen tweezers for my ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a tweezer that can take out single hairs or remove small splinters.  It looks like my search is over.  These tweezers have a pretty sharp point that can solidly grab hairs and splinters.  The points are just fine enough that I can do minor probing and opening of the skin to help take out small splinters.  The packaging it came in doesn&#x27;t look anything like the Amazon photo, but they are definitely the right tweezers.  I liked them so much that I ordered 3 more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m big on online reviews, as I shop online frequently.  With that being said, the shipment was fast and arrived before the delivery date.  The tweezer are absolutely amazing.  They aren&#x27;t too sharp or too blunt. They do a great job for fine facial hair removal and for splinters. I love them and am very pleased.</li>
            <li> The quality of this purchase wasn&#x27;t the same as ones I have purchased in the past. &amp;#34;La Cross&amp;#34; generally has good products but this purchase was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> The design is a litle uncomfortable for the hand. I couldnt tell from the picture that it had holes on it. The tip is not pointing straight so I cant pull the hairs, very easily specially the fine hairs (which is what the tweezer is supposed to be for. )</li>
            <li> disappointed / expected better performance will not but this manufacturer again. this is the first time i tried Lacross will not recommend</li>
            <li> Tips were too blunt not sharp at all. I had to buy a different one  within a week I got it.</li>
            <li> Paint fell off and was poor quality</li>
            <li> A favorite for splinters and tight spots - high quality product - cheap price - very happy - Buy several for all loactions - not much more to say</li>
            <li> (Sally Hansen La Cross Exacta Tweeze Needlepoint Eyebrow, Ingrown Hair Tweezer.)These tweezers are not as pictured on Amazon. When you get them they are in a different package with a different name and when I contacted the company they had one thing to say \\&quot;this is what you ordered and this is what you got\\&quot;. In other words \\&quot;get lost\\&quot;.</li>
