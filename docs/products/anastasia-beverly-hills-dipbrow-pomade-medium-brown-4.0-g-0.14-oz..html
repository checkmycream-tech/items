    <ol>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>I bought this with the anastasia eyebrow brush duo and it is great!!!</li>
            <li>best ever...</li>
            <li>this color was perfect...</li>
            <li>The best product that I&#x27;ve found for shaping, filling in, and taming brows.</li>
            <li>Was using brow pencils but not always the best results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very impressed, and will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li>A perfect brow product.</li>
            <li>The medium brown is a perfect hue when used sparingly and lasts almost all day with no foundations or touch ups or any regard for how sweaty I get.</li>
            <li>it looks very beautiful on my eyebrows</li>
            <li>It is just the best you can buy for your money.</li>
            <li>But practice makes perfect.  </li>
            <li>Good product!</li>
            <li>blend beautifully.</li>
            <li>I loved, to me one of the best product that I purchased</li>
            <li>This brow dip is really great.</li>
            <li>Perfect and the Prime shipping made it even better.</li>
            <li>Waterproof and all day great eyebrows, love it!</li>
            <li>Even in very bright light, in person, the medium brown resembles the ash in the display photos.  </li>
            <li>This is a great invention and it gives my brows polish and dimension, giving me a more youthful look.  </li>
            <li>but I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Seriously amazing.</li>
            <li>Honestly don&#x27;t like to go out without having my brows done.</li>
            <li>verryy amazing love</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>finally I found the best product to use for my brows am thinking of lightining my brows</li>
            <li>Love love love.</li>
            <li>This product is a bit darker than &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34;, however I truly love it.</li>
            <li>Medium brown is a neutral mid range brown that is the perfect shade for me.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>The color is perfect for my dark brown hair, goes on easily, stays all day...</li>
            <li>Perfect color for dark brown hair.</li>
            <li>I use the Anastasia one and it works just fine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s usable but I have to be extremely light handed.</li>
            <li>I love it, thanks :)</li>
            <li>perfect eyebrows can now be done easily with Anastasia Dipbrow, everyday!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried different eyebrow regimens using powders and liners, and in my opinion, this product is by the far the best thing I&#x27;ve used on my brows.  </li>
            <li>Applying Dipbrow takes some practice and a steady hand, but once you get the hang of it, you&#x27;ll love it.  </li>
            <li>Then, without picking up any more product, I do the same outline on the top.  </li>
            <li>all rave reviews are totally worth it...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to get professional looking results myself.</li>
            <li>just right</li>
            <li>They send me dark brown, but it works just as good</li>
            <li>I have almost black hair and medium fair skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to create any shape, and it does last for the whole day.</li>
            <li>This colour is too dark for me, need more colours in the range, I have light brown hair,better to research colours before you buy online, suggest you buy lighter rather than darker.</li>
            <li>almost got the light brown because my hair is almost blonde, but from the comparison pictures I googled, the light brown seemed to have too much of a reddish/orange tone.</li>
            <li>and so glad I finally got it.</li>
            <li>It GLIDES on (I almost cried when I first applied it), and stays on all day, through whatever.</li>
            <li>Once applied this product doesn&#x27;t smear or smudge even in the hot summer months.  </li>
            <li>I use a very thin angled brush to apply and the results are just wonderful.</li>
            <li>, i&#x27;m sure this will be the product that i will use it for my long life</li>
            <li>Many of the reviews stated that despite the size it lasted a very long time.</li>
            <li>Much darker than pictured.  </li>
            <li>I do&#x27;nt usually paint my eyebrows very often but this definitely helps me to give you a better way daily, it is a good product, you do not run and stays on your skin all day.</li>
            <li>Dipbrow is best applied with a very narrow stiff angled brush.  </li>
            <li>the color is soft and blends very well</li>
            <li>I lightly trace the line underneath my brows, starting in middle and working out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so lightweight, easy to use, and it lasts a LONG time, if you know how to properly use it.</li>
            <li>This works well as long as you use the proper brush and apply a tiny amount with a very light touch</li>
            <li>It is very easy to accidentally add too much product but at least this will last forever.</li>
            <li>It might not look like much comes in the jar, but with the minuscule amount you need per application, it&#x27;ll last years.</li>
            <li>Old daughter&#x27;s birthday....</li>
            <li>Dipbrow can look a bit heavy if you don&#x27;t use an extremely light hand.  </li>
            <li>then it looks soft and natural.</li>
            <li>You also need to apply very little product,dab on the back of your hand or the cap, use a very light hand otherwise the look will appear unnatural.</li>
            <li>By this time there is barely any product on the brush</li>
            <li>I barely use any product on my brush.  </li>
            <li>it arrived on time, was exactly as pictured (although I was surprised at how small it is)</li>
            <li>I barely touch the brush to the product, and then wipe the excess off on the back of my hand.  </li>
            <li>I have fair skin with freckles, blue eyes, and naturally dirty blonde hair.</li>
            <li>If you do a little shopping around you can find a quality brush at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Some of the negative reviews mention its pasty consistency; if you have enough on that your brows feel pasty then you have applied far too much.</li>

            <li> A little goes a long way so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This little jar will last me years.  </li>
            <li> My current hair color is a medium brown and the Medium Brown color is VERY dark on me.</li>
            <li> a lot however the color is a bit darker then expected</li>
            <li> , My daughter said it was what she expected.</li>
            <li> I am always nervous about spending a few extra bucks, but there is a reason this is used by everyone.</li>
            <li> Plain and simple.</li>

            <li> Medium brown is way too dark, even when used sparingly (which is how to use the product).</li>

            <li> Great product! perfect eyebrows can now be done easily with Anastasia Dipbrow, everyday! Waterproof and all day great eyebrows, love it!</li>
            <li> I have fair skin with freckles, blue eyes, and naturally dirty blonde hair. My current hair color is a medium brown and the Medium Brown color is VERY dark on me. It&#x27;s usable but I have to be extremely light handed. I would suggest going a color lighter than what you think you need.</li>
            <li> This colour is too dark for me, need more colours in the range, I have light brown hair,better to research colours before you buy online, suggest you buy lighter rather than darker. You also need to apply very little product,dab on the back of your hand or the cap, use a very light hand otherwise the look will appear unnatural.</li>
            <li> Love this. A little goes a long way. Perfect color for dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this with the anastasia eyebrow brush duo and it is great!!! I love it, thanks :)</li>
            <li> I love this product. I got it in medium brown, and it has gray tones in it. Next time I&#x27;ll probably order the chocolate or a lighter shade of brown. Good product!</li>
            <li> Too dark for my dark brown eyebrows....looked black when I put it on.</li>
            <li> I do&#x27;nt usually paint my eyebrows very often but this definitely helps me to give you a better way daily, it is a good product, you do not run and stays on your skin all day.</li>
            <li> I love this! I have to use it with my brow wiz. It is very easy to accidentally add too much product but at least this will last forever. I use this with my medium brown brow wiz and I have also used it with the chocolate color brow wiz and both blend beautifully.</li>
            <li> I like it alot the color is soft and blends very well finally I found the best product to use for my brows am thinking of lightining my brows and I will see how it will looks ^^</li>
            <li> best ever...all rave reviews are totally worth it...i have dark brown hair, olive to tan skin and this color was perfect...after a couple weeks I have it mastered. Using the correct brush is key!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Plain and simple. The best product that I&#x27;ve found for shaping, filling in, and taming brows. It does it all. It might not look like much comes in the jar, but with the minuscule amount you need per application, it&#x27;ll last years. Once you get the hang of using it (hint: YouTube videos) you&#x27;ll never want to touch another product. To make a long review short: If you want brows on fleek- order ABH&#x27;s Dipbrow Pomade.</li>
            <li> holy grail of eyebrow products anastasia is queen</li>
            <li> Anastasia products are all that I&#x27;ll use on my eyebrows. The color is perfect for my dark brown hair, goes on easily, stays all day...</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot however the color is a bit darker then expected, I already used it or I would return it. Next time I will try out the colors in the store. Thankfully this can also be used as an eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Seriously amazing. I&#x27;m obsessed. I have nothing negative to say about it.</li>
            <li> They send me dark brown, but it works just as good</li>
            <li> Since I started using Anastasia Beverly Hills Dipbrow Pomade everyone has been complementing and asking what product I use for my eye brows. It&#x27;s very easy to create any shape, and it does last for the whole day. Ordered 2nd piece for my friend as I recommended it for her.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit of a make-up junkie. I like to try different products. Was using brow pencils but not always the best results. This brow dip is really great. I use a very thin angled brush to apply and the results are just wonderful. I use everyday. Honestly don&#x27;t like to go out without having my brows done. I&#x27;m able to get professional looking results myself. If you&#x27;re looking for a brow dip, I can&#x27;t see how you can go wrong with this one!</li>
            <li> For 3-4 years I&#x27;ve been looking for something that I could fill my eyebrows in with, with ease, and NOT have to worry about it smudging. This product is definitely what I&#x27;ve been waiting for. It&#x27;s so lightweight, easy to use, and it lasts a LONG time, if you know how to properly use it. I&#x27;m very impressed, and will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my 17yr. Old daughter&#x27;s birthday....it arrived on time, was exactly as pictured (although I was surprised at how small it is), My daughter said it was what she expected. Many of the reviews stated that despite the size it lasted a very long time. I purchased the small angled brow brush separately because it seems to be imperative for proper application. If you do a little shopping around you can find a quality brush at a reasonable price. She used it last night because she was going to a party....received A lot of compliments!! Needless to say, she Loves it! :)</li>
            <li> A perfect brow product. Some of the negative reviews mention its pasty consistency; if you have enough on that your brows feel pasty then you have applied far too much. You only need a tiny tiny bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I almost got the light brown because my hair is almost blonde, but from the comparison pictures I googled, the light brown seemed to have too much of a reddish/orange tone. The medium brown is a perfect hue when used sparingly and lasts almost all day with no foundations or touch ups or any regard for how sweaty I get.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I was using a pencil and the brow duo powder but this is all I ever needed!!!</li>
            <li> verryy amazing love it it looks very beautiful on my eyebrows, i&#x27;m sure this will be the product that i will use it for my long life</li>
            <li> Love love love. I&#x27;ve wanted this for a while and so glad I finally got it.</li>
            <li> This product is a bit darker than &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34;, however I truly love it. It GLIDES on (I almost cried when I first applied it), and stays on all day, through whatever. It doesn&#x27;t smudge unless you apply lotion or oil before you put it on. I am always nervous about spending a few extra bucks, but there is a reason this is used by everyone. It is just the best you can buy for your money.</li>
            <li> Perfect and the Prime shipping made it even better. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Much darker than pictured.  I ordered medium brown and it looks and applies like the ash.  Even in very bright light, in person, the medium brown resembles the ash in the display photos.  I have almost black hair and medium fair skin.  Medium brown is way too dark, even when used sparingly (which is how to use the product).</li>
            <li> Dipbrow is best applied with a very narrow stiff angled brush.  I use the Anastasia one and it works just fine.  Medium brown is a neutral mid range brown that is the perfect shade for me.  My brows are darker than my hair and have no red/gold undertones and I was looking for a truly neutral brown and finally found it.  Applying Dipbrow takes some practice and a steady hand, but once you get the hang of it, you&#x27;ll love it.  I barely touch the brush to the product, and then wipe the excess off on the back of my hand.  I lightly trace the line underneath my brows, starting in middle and working out.  Then, without picking up any more product, I do the same outline on the top.  Again, without picking up anymore pomade, I blend the two lines together in the middle.  By this time there is barely any product on the brush and then I do the front of my brow, ensuring that it&#x27;s a lighter color than the middle and end.  Like I say, it takes practice but there are tutorials on youtube that will show you how this is done in detail.  Once applied this product doesn&#x27;t smear or smudge even in the hot summer months.  My skin is slightly oily and I never have a problem.  I recommend this product for anyone who&#x27;s tired of smudgy powder.  Dipbrow can look a bit heavy if you don&#x27;t use an extremely light hand.  I barely use any product on my brush.  This little jar will last me years.  This is a great invention and it gives my brows polish and dimension, giving me a more youthful look.  But practice makes perfect.  I heartily recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I prefer the brow pencils and my spooly!</li>
            <li> Color in pic was not true to color in jar.  This med. Brown is darker than the chocolate.</li>
            <li> I loved, to me one of the best product that I purchased</li>
            <li> I have thin brows from picking at them all the time, so they are sparse. This works well as long as you use the proper brush and apply a tiny amount with a very light touch then it looks soft and natural. It takes a little practice to get it just right but I am very pleased. A little goes a long way so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I saw this product on Pinterest and decided to try it out and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  I&#x27;ve tried different eyebrow regimens using powders and liners, and in my opinion, this product is by the far the best thing I&#x27;ve used on my brows.  I&#x27;m a brunette and use the medium brown color.</li>
