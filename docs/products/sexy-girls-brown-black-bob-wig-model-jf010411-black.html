            <li>AWESOME!!!!</li>
            <li>Great purchase!</li>
            <li>Beautifully constructed at an incredible value.  </li>
            <li>the price, it is a good deal.</li>
            <li>Good for a play around wig not a wig for every day use.</li>
            <li>And the fact it looks good based on that</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the look and feel of this wig.</li>
            <li>Great for the rather cheap price!</li>
            <li>The customer service is top rate!  </li>
            <li>The wig itself is also very nice and can be easily styled.</li>
            <li>i do suggest pulling some of your own hair out at your hair line ..</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and it fits perfectly.  </li>
            <li>wig itself is nice for the price though.  </li>
            <li>The product was in great condition and it looks real!</li>
            <li>Some even asked if it was authentic hair.</li>
            <li>so I always have it.it looks so cute on</li>
            <li>I love this wig.  </li>
            <li>It cool but could have been cut better</li>
            <li>So stringy and light.</li>
            <li>I am truly in love with this wig, so much that I just bought 4 more</li>
            <li>The hair for the wig is good quality but the wig itself is kind of small fitting.</li>
            <li>A great buy for costume or other needs.  </li>
            <li>The last time I bought a wig in the same price range, it arrived in a nice package that had cardboard in it to hold the wig&#x27;s shape, and it arrived in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In my opinion ir wasn&#x27;t worth the time and effort to order this wig.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re thinking about getting it, do, but just remember what you&#x27;re paying, and it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>It looks so natural, and the hair is easy to maintain.  </li>
            <li>However, the hair is soft and easily styled into pigtails, braids etc.</li>
            <li>so just push the wig back in the front .. and blend your own hair in with it for a more natural look.. a definitely a major self esteem booster &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>This is my first short wig and I have never cut my own hair short because I was scared it wouldnt fit me now</li>
            <li>Item is ok quality but has not part so the hair is in your face and the only way to get it out is hair pins or headband which dramatically alters the wigs look.</li>
            <li>First of all, the wig I got is NOT the one I ordered..</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t look real like the picture!</li>
            <li>So in order for me to ship it back and be refunded the whole amount, it will cost me more than the wig itself did.</li>
            <li>People think that it&#x27;s my real</li>
            <li>It looks absolutely real</li>
            <li>Not only did it come with a wig but a wig cap as well and a free pair of socks.</li>
            <li>but the hair net fit well, and it parted well at the forehead.</li>
            <li>I had a whole clump of hair and I could tell that if I were to catch a snag in the wig, it would rip out instead of</li>
            <li>Love the shade of dark black and it looks cute on me.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look realistic at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I plan on buying a few more to put away</li>
            <li>Why doesn&#x27;t it come in a smaller size and the right color when you oreder it?</li>
            <li>I mean, yeah, it&#x27;s a super cheap wig and</li>
            <li>get a more expensive one that&#x27;s worth it ;)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft.  </li>
            <li>The hair on this wig is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Please do not waste your money on this one.</li>
            <li>Additionally, the other problem I had with it was that there was a lump at the top in the back, slightly to the left.  </li>
            <li>Second of all, like other reviewers have mentioned, the quality is REALLY really bad..it kinda felt apart within minutes.</li>

            <li> That part is not natural, you actually have to part it yourself.  </li>
            <li> And not just a few hairs, which is normal, but a lot.</li>
            <li> It was only small pieces, but I was dissapointed that they started falling out so early</li>
            <li> I have a long face like the model</li>
            <li> it is short/stacked in the back/tapered at the nape of the neck line .. and long on the sides</li>
            <li> reason why I rated this 4 out of 5 stars is that the hair started falling out, and I didn&#x27;t even wear it that long.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t even have it on for that long of a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are not you typical beauty supply wigs they are very very very very low quality.</li>
            <li> Similar to dollar store Halloween wigs for little kids</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast on this wig but for the money it has excessive, I repeat excessive sheading.</li>
            <li> that is to be expected, but this goes beyond that.</li>
            <li> so imagine my surprise when it was at my doorstep just a few days later!</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig because my hair is pink and my work doesn&#x27;t like that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I should have read the other reviews before making this purchase.</li>
            <li> 4 stars due to the price.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The wig I ordered was black.</li>
            <li> I order black</li>
            <li> I ordered the black color&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair</li>
            <li> I was a little worried when I ordered this wig as it said that it wouldn&#x27;t be coming for about three weeks</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it only fits the face of someone who is tall and/or thin.  </li>
            <li> So... A few things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This made the wig twisted, bent, and completely mashed up.</li>
            <li> This is a waste of time.</li>
            <li> This is the worse wig I have ever bought in my entire life, I cannot even describe it but trust me, it does not even look like hair in anyway.</li>
            <li> :/  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, the wig was mailed in a bag that was way too small for it.</li>
            <li> but I am a thick woman</li>
            <li> Seriously? ???</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not easy to make it look the way it does in the picture unfortunately.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Third, the wig looks fake.</li>
            <li> Seriously, don&#x27;t buy this piece of crap!!</li>
            <li> It sheds REALLY BAD.  </li>
            <li> TERRIBLE I HATED IT.</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Seriously? ???&lt;br /&gt;The wig I ordered was black. The one I received is brown. It sheds nonstop. Horrible. I should have read the other reviews before making this purchase.</li>
            <li> The hair on this wig is soft and shiny. Unfortunately, it only fits the face of someone who is tall and/or thin.  I have a long face like the model but I am a thick woman so I have a chubby face.  This wig does not hang on the sides on me like it does on the model.  That part is not natural, you actually have to part it yourself.  It also looks wiggy. The seller is the only reason I am keeping the wig.  The customer service is top rate!  I will try another wig with this seller but I would not buy another wig like this again.</li>
            <li> I used this wig as part of a Halloween costume, and received multiple compliments. Some even asked if it was authentic hair. I was very pleased with the look and feel of this wig.</li>
            <li> I am truly in love with this wig, so much that I just bought 4 more and I plan on buying a few more to put away so I always have it.it looks so cute on and I got so may complements on it. This is my first short wig and I have never cut my own hair short because I was scared it wouldnt fit me now I know how I look and I dont have to cut my hair. AWESOME!!!!</li>
            <li> like any wig you order online its a gamble. its from china so expect a couple of weeks wait. it looks like the picture of the model but doesnt come with a part line. youll have to do it yourself and train the wig where to set. Love the shade of dark black and it looks cute on me.</li>
            <li> This is the Cut/Style that I always wanted but I could never get  from the Hair Saloon /Stylist  .. so when i seen the wig on Amazon and I had already had my hair cut into a pixie :/  I was over joyed and FINALLY  can rock this look  it is short/stacked in the back/tapered at the nape of the neck line .. and long on the sides i do suggest pulling some of your own hair out at your hair line ..so just push the wig back in the front .. and blend your own hair in with it for a more natural look.. a definitely a major self esteem booster &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> These are not you typical beauty supply wigs they are very very very very low quality. Similar to dollar store Halloween wigs for little kids</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE I HATED IT. TOOK THE LONGEST TO FIGURE HOW TO ACTUALLY PUT IT ON..</li>
            <li> Item is ok quality but has not part so the hair is in your face and the only way to get it out is hair pins or headband which dramatically alters the wigs look.</li>
            <li> I love this wig.  It looks so natural, and the hair is easy to maintain.  It&#x27;s very soft.  People think that it&#x27;s my real hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason why I rated this 4 out of 5 stars is that the hair started falling out, and I didn&#x27;t even wear it that long.  It was only small pieces, but I was dissapointed that they started falling out so early and I didn&#x27;t even have it on for that long of a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, it is a good deal.</li>
            <li> Beautifully constructed at an incredible value.  Shipping was fast and it fits perfectly.  A great buy for costume or other needs.  It looks absolutely real</li>
            <li> The wig is to big for my head you can see the lumps from it when I put it on. Why doesn&#x27;t it come in a smaller size and the right color when you oreder it? I order black but I got a reddish /black.</li>
            <li> Okay..so I waited about 6 weeks to get this wig..since it came from China..go figure. First of all, the wig I got is NOT the one I ordered..the one in the picture here does not have any bangs and the hair looks shoulder-length. The one I got had lots of bangs, was way shorter..it looked like a mullet..blah. Second of all, like other reviewers have mentioned, the quality is REALLY really bad..it kinda felt apart within minutes. I mean, yeah, it&#x27;s a super cheap wig and that is to be expected, but this goes beyond that. Seriously, don&#x27;t buy this piece of crap!! get a more expensive one that&#x27;s worth it ;)</li>
            <li> The hair for the wig is good quality but the wig itself is kind of small fitting. Good for a play around wig not a wig for every day use.</li>
            <li> The product was in great condition and it looks real! My hair is up to my waist and friends thought I cut them short when I wore this wig.  Great purchase!</li>
            <li> I was a little worried when I ordered this wig as it said that it wouldn&#x27;t be coming for about three weeks so imagine my surprise when it was at my doorstep just a few days later! Not only did it come with a wig but a wig cap as well and a free pair of socks. The wig itself is also very nice and can be easily styled. Great for the rather cheap price!</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair so it didnt stay on well but the hair net fit well, and it parted well at the forehead.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not easy to make it look the way it does in the picture unfortunately. the hair is sewn in a position that blocks the face quite a bit. However, the hair is soft and easily styled into pigtails, braids etc.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast on this wig but for the money it has excessive, I repeat excessive sheading. I ordered the black color&lt;br /&gt;and it appeared brown in color. In my opinion ir wasn&#x27;t worth the time and effort to order this wig.</li>
            <li> So... A few things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the wig was mailed in a bag that was way too small for it. This made the wig twisted, bent, and completely mashed up. The last time I bought a wig in the same price range, it arrived in a nice package that had cardboard in it to hold the wig&#x27;s shape, and it arrived in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the wig and started to brush it, hair started falling out. And not just a few hairs, which is normal, but a lot. I had a whole clump of hair and I could tell that if I were to catch a snag in the wig, it would rip out instead of untangling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, the wig looks fake. It doesn&#x27;t look realistic at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the wig ships from China. So in order for me to ship it back and be refunded the whole amount, it will cost me more than the wig itself did. So. I&#x27;m out the money I paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most likely not buying anything from this seller again.</li>
            <li> 4 stars due to the price.  And the fact it looks good based on that price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly it sheds.  It sheds REALLY BAD.  You will lose clumps of hair out of it, and it will fall into your cleavage, and all over your shirts, and people will notice.  Additionally, the other problem I had with it was that there was a lump at the top in the back, slightly to the left.  It stuck up, and no matter what I did, I couldn&#x27;t get it to flatten, which made it look a bit strange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wig itself is nice for the price though.  If you&#x27;re thinking about getting it, do, but just remember what you&#x27;re paying, and it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a waste of time. I just threw it in the trash. Comes to big and straps break etc...</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig because my hair is pink and my work doesn&#x27;t like that.&lt;br /&gt;The wig doesn&#x27;t look like this. it has a \\&quot;cousin it\\&quot; look. You have to part it and when u do, u can see the damn under part! Doesn&#x27;t look real like the picture!</li>
            <li> It cool but could have been cut better</li>
            <li> This is the worse wig I have ever bought in my entire life, I cannot even describe it but trust me, it does not even look like hair in anyway. So stringy and light. Please do not waste your money on this one.</li>
