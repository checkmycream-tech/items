            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>so we were happy we could get it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Happy.</li>

            <li>It has a very nice texture and flavor ...</li>
            <li>Very happy that we were able to find it on-line.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s the best of their product line, because it&#x27;s quite gentle but still does an excellent job in both the maintenance and appearance departments.</li>
            <li>And good luck.</li>
            <li>but he never had any good suggestions.</li>

            <li>Good luck to all you fellow canker sore sufferers.</li>
            <li>I am delighted that we found this product online.  </li>
            <li>This arrived on time and in good condition.  </li>
            <li>taste is very good and my teeth feel very clean after using this.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with the toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>but I am glad to see it here!  </li>
            <li>are misery - it sure was for us!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Was thrilled to find  it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It is nice we got it in a pack because it will be longer before we have to order it again.</li>
            <li>Helps heal and make sure you don&#x27;t get canker but just buy cheapest toothpaste that does not have SLS and your good.</li>
            <li>This newer formulation doesn&#x27;t seem to be as effective at preventing the cankersore growth.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is definitely worth it!!!</li>
            <li>From diet to illness to stress, there are many triggers, and this product may not help everyone.  </li>
            <li>This is a warning because some may not be able to tolerate it.</li>
            <li>Like many reviewers I have suffered with canker sores since childhood.  </li>
            <li>We tried many things to prevent and treat them.  </li>
            <li>The creators of this formula for toothpaste were absolutely ingenious.  </li>
            <li>it is that it gets watery almost as soon as you start brushing with it, so sometimes I have to spit and add more to my toothbrush halfway through brushing.  </li>
            <li>Canker sores are often caused by sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), which is a foaming agent in most toothpastes.</li>
            <li>It irritates mouth tissue and makes it more susceptible to developing canker sores.</li>
            <li>Save yourself some money and buy canker cover or canker-rids instead, I haven&#x27;t tried the canker cover yet, though I have it, but for sure the canker-rids promotes faster recovery and eliminates the pain.</li>
            <li>Its also an ingredient in many shampoos, so be sure not to put them in your mouth either.  </li>
            <li>I always make sure to order more before I run out.    </li>
            <li>Explore the [...] site for more info..    </li>
            <li>\\&quot;Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS): is the foaming agent found in most toothpaste and mouthwash formulations..  </li>
            <li>Now I make sure I have this product at all times.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to eat and drink what I want, but just by changing toothpastes I was able to eliminate my canker sores altogether.</li>
            <li>It has two purposes, one functional, and one more aesthetic.</li>
            <li>I know that SLS sensitivity is not cause of canker sores for everyone, but for me it sure is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Squiggle toothpaste is much better in the non-sls category of toothpastes.</li>
            <li>I bought 3 tubes and will not be able to use them when the Date on them with expire.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste and no longer get canker sores since I have been using it (maybe 4-5 years).  </li>
            <li>I wish it came with a easy pop-up top than a screw off.</li>
            <li>Yes, the toothpaste is kind of pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it to me not to have canker sores any more.</li>
            <li>There are lots more SLS free pastes on Amazon, like Tom&#x27;s of Maine.</li>
            <li>This just happened to be the first one I tried, and I was thrilled to be able to scrub my teeth clean and grab my to-go mug of coffee and actually enjoy every sip!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to get it from them.</li>
            <li>It was easy to find,</li>
            <li>My local Walgreens stopped carrying this product and I am so happy to be able to buy it through Amazon.</li>
            <li>The minty flavor is STRONG.</li>
            <li>So, that was a good omen right away (and would be worth the price even if this product did not reduce the number/severity of the sores).    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great toothpaste in general too -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard on many occasions that there is no cure for canker sores, but after using this product for 4 months I realized that this just isn&#x27;t true.  </li>
            <li>It becomes much more liquidy given the lack of detergent, but you quickly get used to it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made a huge difference for us.  </li>
            <li>The great thing about this toothpaste is that it prevents the inevitable.  </li>
            <li>In all this time, amazingly - nobody really knew the cause of the canker sores or sensitivity to toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a toothpaste that was SLS free but had flouride.  </li>
            <li>I cannot stress enough how great this product is.  </li>
            <li>You will find this to be a great benefit when used regularly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great toothpaste, definitely would suggest it to sufferers of canker sores or even non-sufferers!</li>
            <li>If you floss every night and use this toothpaste then you will rarely get mouth sores!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product since March, and it has not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>It has made a significant reduction in the number and frequency of canker sores I get.</li>
            <li>This product was first recommended to me by a Dental Hygienist many years ago.</li>
            <li>so excited.</li>
            <li>So the big \\&quot;C\\&quot; is worth every penny - it is a great product that deserves 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Foaming agents fill the mouth with suds, sending a signal to users that their mouths are clean.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing and has finally, after many years of suffering, given me relief from my canker sores.</li>
            <li>I am so happy that I found this toothpaste as I can use it daily and get that fresh feeling without any discomfort.</li>
            <li>It &amp;#34;suds&amp;#34; up just enough and has a pleasant taste.</li>
            <li>The mint aroma gets stronger each time I used it, it gotten so strong that I had to rinse it out right away.</li>
            <li>I feel your pain, including right now!</li>
            <li>At most stores, it costs and arm and a leg, but the subscription service through Amazon really makes it affordable.</li>
            <li>I love the gentle mint flavor.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not so much what&#x27;s IN the toothpaste as what&#x27;s NOT in the toothpaste that is in most others.</li>
            <li>My wife loves it, prevents her from getting canker sores due to medications, I will keep ordering for her to keep her happy.</li>
            <li>When I do, they are mild.  </li>
            <li>It shipped quickly and was received within 5 workdays.  </li>
            <li>So, I tried to use more, squeezing more paste as I cover a different area of my teeth each time hoping that it will help.</li>
            <li>There are several on the market, but after trying most, I like the taste and feel of the Rembrandt the most.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad to have this brand choice in toothpaste (SLS free) as a canker sore sufferer, however with this packaging update it is not as clear anymore.</li>
            <li>what I ordered  with quick delivery</li>
            <li>We received quick delivery of this hard-to-find item.  </li>
            <li>The more aesthetic is the foaming, so you get a nice big lather going in your mouth and feel like you have really done your work.</li>
            <li>The mint flavor is also great, and like some of the other reviewers have already stated, drinking coffee or orange juice after brushing does not affect the tastes!  </li>
            <li>I was only able to brush my teeth with children&#x27;s toothpaste --- a grown woman using Sponge Bob Square Pants toothpaste!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it felt like nothing really got clean, my teeth doesn&#x27;t feel smooth</li>
            <li>Once you get the hang of keeping it all in your mouth (you might laugh, but I&#x27;m totally serious - the first couple times were interesting), it&#x27;s great stuff.</li>
            <li>I used to spend more time with canker sores than without them, and they&#x27;d get huge and last for two weeks at a time.</li>
            <li>I debated buying this because of the price but all I can say is that its worth it.</li>
            <li>it will take some time to become effective, but overall it will reduce your mouth sores.</li>
            <li>Not only does it prevent the sores from coming, but more importantly, it prevents them from staying.    </li>
            <li>This toothpaste was recommended by my dermatologist but it is no longer available at local drug stores in my area so this is the most convenient way for me to buy it.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>My 12 year old daughter had suffered with canker sores for many years.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>The one plus was that while having a canker sore, this toothpaste was nearly painless to brush with unlike many others.</li>
            <li>It is sodium laurel sulphate or SLS, which is an ingredient that enhances the foaming action of your toothpaste and is found in most pastes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Absolutely worth a try to see if SLS is contributing to your canker</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money to be out of pain.</li>
            <li>and it really did mean the end of canker sores for me and my family which is great!</li>
            <li>Other companies also make SLS-free toothpastes, but should probably wise up to the marketing smarts of Rembrandt and stamp \\&quot;Canker Sore\\&quot; on their tubes.    </li>
            <li>It used to be that when I switched to this stuff (first used it in ~2007), my cankersores would heal much more quickly and stop growing larger.  </li>
            <li>Aside from the fact that this is probably the only product on the internet that has no negative reviews, this stuff is truly amazing.  </li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t really prevent any canker sore at all!</li>
            <li>Let me say that the reviews are NOT exaggerated and this product delivers what it promises and reduces canker sores.</li>
            <li>;)    </li>
            <li>For more information, \\&quot;recurrent apthous ulcer\\&quot; is the technical name for canker sores - google away.  </li>
            <li>We tried many different toothpastes and even rinses from the doctor (that had a side effect of discoloring the teeth).</li>
            <li>but it is a sacrifice I am willing to make.</li>
            <li>But like some of the reviews say, please be aware that this stuff is very watery!</li>
            <li>I also use Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s, but this is my first choice of the two.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a lot more liquid than brushing with regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>exactly why.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be the first to admit that the causes of canker sores are very unique to each individual.  </li>
            <li>This is a product that is hard to find in local drugstores for some reason, but Amazon.com has the best prices</li>
            <li>Next day, I reused the regular Colgate, and my teeth felt fresh and clean once more.</li>
            <li>Quite a tide of positive comments on this.</li>
            <li>would pretty much do the trick.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say for sure if the toothpaste switch was the main thing that did the trick because I did try a lot of remedies, but I will say that this paste really does help prevent further outbreaks.</li>
            <li>While I doubt the toothpaste caused those additional sores, it certainly didn&#x27;t prevent them.</li>
            <li>Finally I ordered Squiggle toothpaste and am fine with it.  </li>
            <li>I think I had a sore or two when I first got this, and I could tell right away that brushing with this was not nearly so painful on the existing sores as it normally is with regular toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying this toothpaste if you suffer from canker sores!</li>
            <li>It is, indeed gentle - no sores or any problems reported.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>This toothpaste really seems to help with my canker sores.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for about 2 years now and it has become one of the products I absolutely swear by.</li>
            <li>(the packaging has changed from light blue to purple</li>
            <li>and he recommends it to his patients with braces and it really does work.  </li>
            <li>It really does work.  </li>
            <li>It was so embarassing and horrendous that I was home-stuck for the vast majority of my free time.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s gentle on your sores too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t develop a sensitivity to sulfates until I was in college, but when it arrived it was very severe.  </li>
            <li>I had a problem of not wanting to brush in the morning if I hadn&#x27;t finished my coffee yet because it ruined the experience so much.</li>
            <li>My wife and I are both susceptible to the SLS compound that makes toothpaste very sudsy.  </li>
            <li>It shouldn&#x27;t cost so much to exclude that ingredient.</li>
            <li>I have problems with Canker Sores and this worked very well.  </li>
            <li>This toothpaste really works.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;d think it&#x27;s a modern day miracle.  </li>
            <li>I like the whole &amp;#34;canker sore&amp;#34</li>
            <li>(I use that as a way to tell if it&#x27;s really working or not).</li>
            <li>It really makes a difference for me during the time I have an ulcer in my mouth..</li>
            <li>I have tried many things and this is definitely so much gentler than other toothpastes when brushing with canker sores in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>Rembrandt for Canker Sore Sufferers definitely reduces the flare ups significantly.</li>
            <li>Also I like the taste of this better than other SLS-free toothpastes.</li>
            <li>I just wish it feel a bit more like the other toothpaste where it burn a bit in your mouth</li>
            <li>To get the full benefit, you&#x27;ll want to *only</li>
            <li>I finally decided to give the Rembrandt Canker Sore toothpaste a try and while I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the lack of foam when I brushed, I was won over when my canker sores completely stopped.</li>
            <li>Huge relief after years of suffering from a near constant stream of them.</li>
            <li>I paid $8 for a tube of the Rembrandt Canker Sore toothpaste, which provides enough to last three weeks at most with twice a day brushing.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find that the ingredient list is very different from the stuff I used to be able to find at the local drugstores.</li>
            <li>but, it&#x27;s worth noting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who would like to try some casual tooth whitening, the Rembrandt can be a good toothpaste to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I not only suffered through the normal healing time of canker sores while using the Rembrandt Canker Sore toothpaste, but actually ended up getting more canker sores.</li>
            <li>And I know this toothpaste is responsible, because if I use a different toothpaste for whatever reason (I run out, I go on vacation and forget it, etc), I will immediately start getting canker sores 1-2 days right after.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I discovered the effects of Listerine in high school.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more expensive than most other toothpastes, but worth it!  </li>
            <li>For what its worth, I&#x27;ve also found that always washing my mouth with an antiseptic mouthwash like Listerine before/after bed, as well as after biting my cheek or tongue, and after eating anything that could be a trigger (citrus, red wine, tomato, and a few others) is helpful in preventing more of these buggers.  </li>
            <li>Whenever I don&#x27;t use it and use a normal toothpaste I get canker sores.</li>
            <li>Was delighted to find this online at Amazon, after our local grocery store stopped carrying it last year and then recently our local Walgreen&#x27;s stopped carrying it as well.  </li>
            <li>My local drug stores do not regularly carry this product, but its efficacy is undeniable and it is indispensable for preventing mouth irritation, so I order it on line now.  </li>
            <li>My husband used to get very frequent canker sores.  </li>
            <li>Here is why, usually with toothpaste, just a finger tips amount of it could easily cleans your whole mouth, but as for this product, once you applied it to your front teeth or anywhere on your teeth that&#x27;s the only spot you can actually clean, only very little of it would stay on the teeth and most of it would drips everywhere, leaving you with your teeth and toothbrush with no cleaning product on it.</li>
            <li>(well, ALL toothpaste brands - even Tom&#x27;s Natural Brand!).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty simple...</li>
            <li>People with canker sores have fewer outbreaks and less pain if they use SLS free products\\&quot;    Rubbing your gums and tongue with the \\&quot;filler\\&quot; ingredient for soaps and shampoos.  </li>
            <li>I have suffered from canker sores my whole life, and tried many different things short of prescriptions to get rid of them (topical ointments, not eating chocolate, not eating acidic things, different mouthwashes, baking soda, etc) and nothing worked, until now.</li>
            <li>I have suffered from canker sores throughout my life, and have never found any particular trigger or useful cure other than patience and pain-numbing Kanka medication.</li>
            <li>Apparently I got what I ordered, however, if you look at the image of the tube of toothpaste on the right of this screen, it is for the Rembrandt Canker Sore toothpaste &#x27;regular&#x27; flavor.  </li>
            <li>Although I didn&#x27;t see any quick results, over the weeks I noticed that the smaller of my sores would disappear faster than the bigger sores.</li>
            <li>It does appear to cause some modest whitening of teeth.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>G Rembrandt Premium Whitening Mint Toothpaste with Fluoride, Extra Gentle (For Canker Sore Sufferers) - 3 oz</li>
            <li>We did know exactly what we were getting since we&#x27;ve been using the toothpaste for a long time.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get them as frequently</li>
            <li>I have found that it is the only thing that really works to prevent and to heal cankers in the mouth.  </li>
            <li>After a week you become completely used to non-foaming toothpaste.&lt;br</li>
            <li>G Rembrandt Premium Whitening Mint Toothpaste with Fluoride, Extra Gentle (For Canker Sore Sufferers) - 3 oz (Pack of 3)]]&lt;br</li>
            <li>I needed a whitening tooth paste that was also sensitive.  </li>
            <li>Over a year ago I developed a reaction to the whitener in toothpaste.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty expensive compared to most other toothpaste, but if you get canker sores often, then I think it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>the product expiration dates show it is fresh enough that we will use it up long before the freshness expires.</li>
            <li>I have always had issues with mouth ulcers from things that are high in acid especially strawberries,peaches,etc, and I&lt;br /&gt;love fruits.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe that I suffered with canker sores as long as I did thanks to SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) in the major toothpaste brands</li>
            <li>years ago after I bought a tube as a last resort while on a trip to New York.  </li>
            <li>My dad has suffered from severe canker sores his whole life (he gets multiple canker sores the size of a dime at times), and I had also been having them regularly</li>
            <li>Its quite a bit more expensive than normal toothpastes, and isn&#x27;t in all stores, so Amazon&#x27;s three-pack helps out a lot!  </li>
            <li>I will use no other toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>first use, the only notable difference from regular toothpaste is that this type is \\&quot;flat\\&quot; because it is missing a foaming component - it is this missing component that seems to contribute to the mouth irritations.  </li>
            <li>The only problem is that I really can&#x27;t stand Listerine, but the canker sores do not occur as long as I routinely use it.</li>
            <li>Rembrandt Extra Gentle for Canker Score Sufferers, the box and tube with the big \\&quot;C\\&quot;, definitely reduces aphthous ulcers in the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>people are sensitive to SLS and it causes canker sores for them, so a toothpaste formulated for canker sore sufferers is likely to be SLS-free.</li>
            <li>They are now barely noticeable.    </li>
            <li>SLS - free toothpaste has brought down my (and my partner&#x27;s) incidence of canker sores from every few weeks to maybe once or twice a year (and they are then smaller and geal much faster).</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t overstate how much this product has made such a significant difference over the approximately five years that I&#x27;ve been using it.  </li>
            <li>And well worth the mess!  </li>
            <li>size is small for what you pay, but it is definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li>No more money spent on canker sore remedies (that seldom work) and no more days/weeks on bland soft diet to help reduce pain and heal more quickly.       </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much to say about this toothpaste other than it works!</li>
            <li>Tom&#x27;s of Maine isn&#x27;t bad either, but in the end I&#x27;ve decided this is pretty much my favorite toothpaste</li>
            <li>I suffer from frequent canker sores, and when I use Rembrandt C toothpaste, the canker sores are fewer and less intense than when I use other kinds of toothpaste.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is a great product.  </li>
            <li> so we were happy we could get it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Happy.</li>
            <li> This was a great product but was discontinued.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 5 years and it works great.</li>
            <li> Rembrandt&#x27;s done a great job with this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this about a month now, and my canker sore problem is greatly improved.  </li>
            <li> this is a great product for us sufferers</li>
            <li> It has a very nice texture and flavor ...</li>
            <li> Very happy that we were able to find it on-line.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s the best of their product line, because it&#x27;s quite gentle but still does an excellent job in both the maintenance and appearance departments.</li>
            <li> And good luck.</li>
            <li> but he never had any good suggestions.</li>
            <li> Good luck.</li>
            <li> Good luck to all you fellow canker sore sufferers.</li>
            <li> I am delighted that we found this product online.  </li>
            <li> This arrived on time and in good condition.  </li>
            <li> taste is very good and my teeth feel very clean after using this.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased with the toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> but I am glad to see it here!  </li>
            <li> are misery - it sure was for us!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Was thrilled to find  it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It is nice we got it in a pack because it will be longer before we have to order it again.</li>
            <li> Helps heal and make sure you don&#x27;t get canker but just buy cheapest toothpaste that does not have SLS and your good.</li>
            <li> This newer formulation doesn&#x27;t seem to be as effective at preventing the cankersore growth.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is definitely worth it!!!</li>
            <li> From diet to illness to stress, there are many triggers, and this product may not help everyone.  </li>
            <li> This is a warning because some may not be able to tolerate it.</li>
            <li> Like many reviewers I have suffered with canker sores since childhood.  </li>
            <li> We tried many things to prevent and treat them.  </li>
            <li> The creators of this formula for toothpaste were absolutely ingenious.  </li>
            <li> it is that it gets watery almost as soon as you start brushing with it, so sometimes I have to spit and add more to my toothbrush halfway through brushing.  </li>
            <li> Canker sores are often caused by sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), which is a foaming agent in most toothpastes.</li>
            <li> It irritates mouth tissue and makes it more susceptible to developing canker sores.</li>
            <li> Save yourself some money and buy canker cover or canker-rids instead, I haven&#x27;t tried the canker cover yet, though I have it, but for sure the canker-rids promotes faster recovery and eliminates the pain.</li>
            <li> Its also an ingredient in many shampoos, so be sure not to put them in your mouth either.  </li>
            <li> I always make sure to order more before I run out.    </li>
            <li> Explore the [...] site for more info..    </li>
            <li> \\&quot;Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS): is the foaming agent found in most toothpaste and mouthwash formulations..  </li>
            <li> Now I make sure I have this product at all times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to eat and drink what I want, but just by changing toothpastes I was able to eliminate my canker sores altogether.</li>
            <li> It has two purposes, one functional, and one more aesthetic.</li>
            <li> I know that SLS sensitivity is not cause of canker sores for everyone, but for me it sure is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Squiggle toothpaste is much better in the non-sls category of toothpastes.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 tubes and will not be able to use them when the Date on them with expire.  </li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste and no longer get canker sores since I have been using it (maybe 4-5 years).  </li>
            <li> I wish it came with a easy pop-up top than a screw off.</li>
            <li> Yes, the toothpaste is kind of pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it to me not to have canker sores any more.</li>
            <li> There are lots more SLS free pastes on Amazon, like Tom&#x27;s of Maine.</li>
            <li> This just happened to be the first one I tried, and I was thrilled to be able to scrub my teeth clean and grab my to-go mug of coffee and actually enjoy every sip!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to get it from them.</li>
            <li> It was easy to find,</li>
            <li> My local Walgreens stopped carrying this product and I am so happy to be able to buy it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> The minty flavor is STRONG.</li>
            <li> So, that was a good omen right away (and would be worth the price even if this product did not reduce the number/severity of the sores).    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great toothpaste in general too -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard on many occasions that there is no cure for canker sores, but after using this product for 4 months I realized that this just isn&#x27;t true.  </li>
            <li> It becomes much more liquidy given the lack of detergent, but you quickly get used to it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made a huge difference for us.  </li>
            <li> The great thing about this toothpaste is that it prevents the inevitable.  </li>
            <li> In all this time, amazingly - nobody really knew the cause of the canker sores or sensitivity to toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a toothpaste that was SLS free but had flouride.  </li>
            <li> I cannot stress enough how great this product is.  </li>
            <li> You will find this to be a great benefit when used regularly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great toothpaste, definitely would suggest it to sufferers of canker sores or even non-sufferers!</li>
            <li> If you floss every night and use this toothpaste then you will rarely get mouth sores!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since March, and it has not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It has made a significant reduction in the number and frequency of canker sores I get.</li>
            <li> This product was first recommended to me by a Dental Hygienist many years ago.</li>
            <li> so excited.</li>
            <li> So the big \\&quot;C\\&quot; is worth every penny - it is a great product that deserves 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Foaming agents fill the mouth with suds, sending a signal to users that their mouths are clean.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing and has finally, after many years of suffering, given me relief from my canker sores.</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I found this toothpaste as I can use it daily and get that fresh feeling without any discomfort.</li>
            <li> It &amp;#34;suds&amp;#34; up just enough and has a pleasant taste.</li>
            <li> The mint aroma gets stronger each time I used it, it gotten so strong that I had to rinse it out right away.</li>
            <li> I feel your pain, including right now!</li>
            <li> At most stores, it costs and arm and a leg, but the subscription service through Amazon really makes it affordable.</li>
            <li> I love the gentle mint flavor.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so much what&#x27;s IN the toothpaste as what&#x27;s NOT in the toothpaste that is in most others.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it, prevents her from getting canker sores due to medications, I will keep ordering for her to keep her happy.</li>
            <li> When I do, they are mild.  </li>
            <li> It shipped quickly and was received within 5 workdays.  </li>
            <li> So, I tried to use more, squeezing more paste as I cover a different area of my teeth each time hoping that it will help.</li>
            <li> There are several on the market, but after trying most, I like the taste and feel of the Rembrandt the most.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad to have this brand choice in toothpaste (SLS free) as a canker sore sufferer, however with this packaging update it is not as clear anymore.</li>
            <li> what I ordered  with quick delivery</li>
            <li> We received quick delivery of this hard-to-find item.  </li>
            <li> The more aesthetic is the foaming, so you get a nice big lather going in your mouth and feel like you have really done your work.</li>
            <li> The mint flavor is also great, and like some of the other reviewers have already stated, drinking coffee or orange juice after brushing does not affect the tastes!  </li>
            <li> I was only able to brush my teeth with children&#x27;s toothpaste --- a grown woman using Sponge Bob Square Pants toothpaste!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it felt like nothing really got clean, my teeth doesn&#x27;t feel smooth</li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of keeping it all in your mouth (you might laugh, but I&#x27;m totally serious - the first couple times were interesting), it&#x27;s great stuff.</li>
            <li> I used to spend more time with canker sores than without them, and they&#x27;d get huge and last for two weeks at a time.</li>
            <li> I debated buying this because of the price but all I can say is that its worth it.</li>
            <li> it will take some time to become effective, but overall it will reduce your mouth sores.</li>
            <li> Not only does it prevent the sores from coming, but more importantly, it prevents them from staying.    </li>
            <li> This toothpaste was recommended by my dermatologist but it is no longer available at local drug stores in my area so this is the most convenient way for me to buy it.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> My 12 year old daughter had suffered with canker sores for many years.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> The one plus was that while having a canker sore, this toothpaste was nearly painless to brush with unlike many others.</li>
            <li> It is sodium laurel sulphate or SLS, which is an ingredient that enhances the foaming action of your toothpaste and is found in most pastes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Absolutely worth a try to see if SLS is contributing to your canker</li>
            <li> It is well worth the money to be out of pain.</li>
            <li> and it really did mean the end of canker sores for me and my family which is great!</li>
            <li> Other companies also make SLS-free toothpastes, but should probably wise up to the marketing smarts of Rembrandt and stamp \\&quot;Canker Sore\\&quot; on their tubes.    </li>
            <li> It used to be that when I switched to this stuff (first used it in ~2007), my cankersores would heal much more quickly and stop growing larger.  </li>
            <li> Aside from the fact that this is probably the only product on the internet that has no negative reviews, this stuff is truly amazing.  </li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t really prevent any canker sore at all!</li>
            <li> Let me say that the reviews are NOT exaggerated and this product delivers what it promises and reduces canker sores.</li>
            <li> ;)    </li>
            <li> For more information, \\&quot;recurrent apthous ulcer\\&quot; is the technical name for canker sores - google away.  </li>
            <li> We tried many different toothpastes and even rinses from the doctor (that had a side effect of discoloring the teeth).</li>
            <li> but it is a sacrifice I am willing to make.</li>
            <li> But like some of the reviews say, please be aware that this stuff is very watery!</li>
            <li> I also use Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s, but this is my first choice of the two.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a lot more liquid than brushing with regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> exactly why.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be the first to admit that the causes of canker sores are very unique to each individual.  </li>
            <li> This is a product that is hard to find in local drugstores for some reason, but Amazon.com has the best prices</li>
            <li> Next day, I reused the regular Colgate, and my teeth felt fresh and clean once more.</li>
            <li> Quite a tide of positive comments on this.</li>
            <li> would pretty much do the trick.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say for sure if the toothpaste switch was the main thing that did the trick because I did try a lot of remedies, but I will say that this paste really does help prevent further outbreaks.</li>
            <li> While I doubt the toothpaste caused those additional sores, it certainly didn&#x27;t prevent them.</li>
            <li> Finally I ordered Squiggle toothpaste and am fine with it.  </li>
            <li> I think I had a sore or two when I first got this, and I could tell right away that brushing with this was not nearly so painful on the existing sores as it normally is with regular toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying this toothpaste if you suffer from canker sores!</li>
            <li> It is, indeed gentle - no sores or any problems reported.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> This toothpaste really seems to help with my canker sores.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for about 2 years now and it has become one of the products I absolutely swear by.</li>
            <li> (the packaging has changed from light blue to purple</li>
            <li> and he recommends it to his patients with braces and it really does work.  </li>
            <li> It really does work.  </li>
            <li> It was so embarassing and horrendous that I was home-stuck for the vast majority of my free time.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s gentle on your sores too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t develop a sensitivity to sulfates until I was in college, but when it arrived it was very severe.  </li>
            <li> I had a problem of not wanting to brush in the morning if I hadn&#x27;t finished my coffee yet because it ruined the experience so much.</li>
            <li> My wife and I are both susceptible to the SLS compound that makes toothpaste very sudsy.  </li>
            <li> It shouldn&#x27;t cost so much to exclude that ingredient.</li>
            <li> I have problems with Canker Sores and this worked very well.  </li>
            <li> This toothpaste really works.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;d think it&#x27;s a modern day miracle.  </li>
            <li> I like the whole &amp;#34;canker sore&amp;#34</li>
            <li> (I use that as a way to tell if it&#x27;s really working or not).</li>
            <li> It really makes a difference for me during the time I have an ulcer in my mouth..</li>
            <li> I have tried many things and this is definitely so much gentler than other toothpastes when brushing with canker sores in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> Rembrandt for Canker Sore Sufferers definitely reduces the flare ups significantly.</li>
            <li> Also I like the taste of this better than other SLS-free toothpastes.</li>
            <li> I just wish it feel a bit more like the other toothpaste where it burn a bit in your mouth</li>
            <li> To get the full benefit, you&#x27;ll want to *only</li>
            <li> I finally decided to give the Rembrandt Canker Sore toothpaste a try and while I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the lack of foam when I brushed, I was won over when my canker sores completely stopped.</li>
            <li> Huge relief after years of suffering from a near constant stream of them.</li>
            <li> I paid $8 for a tube of the Rembrandt Canker Sore toothpaste, which provides enough to last three weeks at most with twice a day brushing.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find that the ingredient list is very different from the stuff I used to be able to find at the local drugstores.</li>
            <li> but, it&#x27;s worth noting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who would like to try some casual tooth whitening, the Rembrandt can be a good toothpaste to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I not only suffered through the normal healing time of canker sores while using the Rembrandt Canker Sore toothpaste, but actually ended up getting more canker sores.</li>
            <li> And I know this toothpaste is responsible, because if I use a different toothpaste for whatever reason (I run out, I go on vacation and forget it, etc), I will immediately start getting canker sores 1-2 days right after.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I discovered the effects of Listerine in high school.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more expensive than most other toothpastes, but worth it!  </li>
            <li> For what its worth, I&#x27;ve also found that always washing my mouth with an antiseptic mouthwash like Listerine before/after bed, as well as after biting my cheek or tongue, and after eating anything that could be a trigger (citrus, red wine, tomato, and a few others) is helpful in preventing more of these buggers.  </li>
            <li> Whenever I don&#x27;t use it and use a normal toothpaste I get canker sores.</li>
            <li> Was delighted to find this online at Amazon, after our local grocery store stopped carrying it last year and then recently our local Walgreen&#x27;s stopped carrying it as well.  </li>
            <li> My local drug stores do not regularly carry this product, but its efficacy is undeniable and it is indispensable for preventing mouth irritation, so I order it on line now.  </li>
            <li> My husband used to get very frequent canker sores.  </li>
            <li> Here is why, usually with toothpaste, just a finger tips amount of it could easily cleans your whole mouth, but as for this product, once you applied it to your front teeth or anywhere on your teeth that&#x27;s the only spot you can actually clean, only very little of it would stay on the teeth and most of it would drips everywhere, leaving you with your teeth and toothbrush with no cleaning product on it.</li>
            <li> (well, ALL toothpaste brands - even Tom&#x27;s Natural Brand!).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty simple...</li>
            <li> People with canker sores have fewer outbreaks and less pain if they use SLS free products\\&quot;    Rubbing your gums and tongue with the \\&quot;filler\\&quot; ingredient for soaps and shampoos.  </li>
            <li> I have suffered from canker sores my whole life, and tried many different things short of prescriptions to get rid of them (topical ointments, not eating chocolate, not eating acidic things, different mouthwashes, baking soda, etc) and nothing worked, until now.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from canker sores throughout my life, and have never found any particular trigger or useful cure other than patience and pain-numbing Kanka medication.</li>
            <li> Apparently I got what I ordered, however, if you look at the image of the tube of toothpaste on the right of this screen, it is for the Rembrandt Canker Sore toothpaste &#x27;regular&#x27; flavor.  </li>
            <li> Although I didn&#x27;t see any quick results, over the weeks I noticed that the smaller of my sores would disappear faster than the bigger sores.</li>
            <li> It does appear to cause some modest whitening of teeth.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> G Rembrandt Premium Whitening Mint Toothpaste with Fluoride, Extra Gentle (For Canker Sore Sufferers) - 3 oz</li>
            <li> We did know exactly what we were getting since we&#x27;ve been using the toothpaste for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get them as frequently</li>
            <li> I have found that it is the only thing that really works to prevent and to heal cankers in the mouth.  </li>
            <li> After a week you become completely used to non-foaming toothpaste.&lt;br</li>
            <li> G Rembrandt Premium Whitening Mint Toothpaste with Fluoride, Extra Gentle (For Canker Sore Sufferers) - 3 oz (Pack of 3)]]&lt;br</li>
            <li> I needed a whitening tooth paste that was also sensitive.  </li>
            <li> Over a year ago I developed a reaction to the whitener in toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty expensive compared to most other toothpaste, but if you get canker sores often, then I think it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> the product expiration dates show it is fresh enough that we will use it up long before the freshness expires.</li>
            <li> I have always had issues with mouth ulcers from things that are high in acid especially strawberries,peaches,etc, and I&lt;br /&gt;love fruits.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that I suffered with canker sores as long as I did thanks to SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) in the major toothpaste brands</li>
            <li> years ago after I bought a tube as a last resort while on a trip to New York.  </li>
            <li> My dad has suffered from severe canker sores his whole life (he gets multiple canker sores the size of a dime at times), and I had also been having them regularly</li>
            <li> Its quite a bit more expensive than normal toothpastes, and isn&#x27;t in all stores, so Amazon&#x27;s three-pack helps out a lot!  </li>
            <li> I will use no other toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> first use, the only notable difference from regular toothpaste is that this type is \\&quot;flat\\&quot; because it is missing a foaming component - it is this missing component that seems to contribute to the mouth irritations.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is that I really can&#x27;t stand Listerine, but the canker sores do not occur as long as I routinely use it.</li>
            <li> Rembrandt Extra Gentle for Canker Score Sufferers, the box and tube with the big \\&quot;C\\&quot;, definitely reduces aphthous ulcers in the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> people are sensitive to SLS and it causes canker sores for them, so a toothpaste formulated for canker sore sufferers is likely to be SLS-free.</li>
            <li> They are now barely noticeable.    </li>
            <li> SLS - free toothpaste has brought down my (and my partner&#x27;s) incidence of canker sores from every few weeks to maybe once or twice a year (and they are then smaller and geal much faster).</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t overstate how much this product has made such a significant difference over the approximately five years that I&#x27;ve been using it.  </li>
            <li> And well worth the mess!  </li>
            <li> size is small for what you pay, but it is definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li> No more money spent on canker sore remedies (that seldom work) and no more days/weeks on bland soft diet to help reduce pain and heal more quickly.       </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much to say about this toothpaste other than it works!</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s of Maine isn&#x27;t bad either, but in the end I&#x27;ve decided this is pretty much my favorite toothpaste</li>
            <li> I suffer from frequent canker sores, and when I use Rembrandt C toothpaste, the canker sores are fewer and less intense than when I use other kinds of toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> None other on the market work as well for my husband, who suffered for decades from frequent canker sores until he switched to toothpaste without any SLS.  </li>
            <li> The few other other SLS-free toothpastes we have bene able to find have formulations that he does not like as well due to taste, texture, etc.     </li>
            <li> Whatever ingredient they remove to make it less irritating must be a \\&quot;bonding\\&quot; ingredient that keeps regular toothpaste in a more paste-y form.</li>
            <li> As far as I know, his paintings are rather dark and they tend to show Dutch men and women who don&#x27;t seem at all concerned with oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> because there is no foaming agent, it is very runny, and messy!)</li>
            <li> For as long as I can remember, I used to have multiple canker sores at a time.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t heed the advice and the first few times I used it, it would spill out of my mouth if my head was not tilted slightly upward.</li>
            <li> I tried a number of different things from only drinking water, changing my diet, and using a variety of other products but nothing stopped my canker sores once and for all.</li>
            <li> It works very well but is hard to find except on line.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re suffering at all from canker sores, you really owe it to yourself to at least give this a try.</li>
            <li> As a canker sore sufferer for as long as I can remember (about 1-2 a month), I thought I would just have to deal with them forever.</li>
            <li> At the same time the SLS has a side effect of \\&quot;turning off\\&quot; the sweetness tastebuds of your tongue and amping up the ones that taste bitter.</li>
            <li> Once home I started using my toothpaste again and my canker sore never developed.  </li>
            <li> I still catch myself looking down or just barely lowering my head and that stuff will come pouring out.</li>
            <li> There are not many choices out there without SLS, so taking it off the main messaging of the package makes it harder to find - and I worry I have not selected the correct product.</li>
            <li> None of the other local drug stores or grocery stores carry it now.</li>
            <li> The only other thing I don&#x27;t like about</li>
            <li> Today I am nearly free of canker sores, only developing them when I catch a cold (maybe 1 time per year).  </li>
            <li> SLS and Ibuprofen are both triggers for me, and everyone seems to have a few different triggers - but SLS is fairly universal.   </li>
            <li> It turns out that in some people, various things can break down the lining inside our mouths -</li>
            <li> This is the only toothpaste for people who have chronic canker sores due to over sensitivity to the harsh chemicals (SLS, etc) in the larger brand toothpaste companies.</li>
            <li> I ran out of this toothpaste recently and had trouble finding it in my town.  </li>
            <li> Everything is what we expected it to be.  </li>
            <li> After only a day of use, I found a drastic reduction in the stinging pain associated with the sores and after a few days the sores had subsided.</li>
            <li> It is getting harder and harder to find in stores</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lifelong mouth ulcer sufferer.  </li>
            <li> I would usually get 2-3 at a time, they would last for a few days, finally go away, and the cycle would repeat in about 1-2 weeks.     </li>
            <li> Only bad thing is I think they may have changed the flavor at some point in recent years, seems I don&#x27;t care for the taste in a recent batch as much as I used to, but that&#x27;s not a huge deal, it&#x27;s just toothpaste.</li>
            <li> With the absence of a harsh foaming agent the toothpaste dramatically cuts down on the frequency and severity of canker sores.</li>
            <li> The sore never grows to a point of extreme discomfort or pain.  </li>
            <li> It is really a small caveat to something that works such wonders!</li>
            <li> I have prefered Rembrandt whitening toothpaste all of my life, and I have been offered no reason to use any other.</li>
            <li> but lo and behold - it&#x27;s all due to SLS.  </li>
            <li> just ran out of it the other day</li>
            <li> (And also avoid other triggers, like citrus.)  </li>
            <li> The small size is also at the 3 oz limit which means you can take it through airport security in your carry-on luggage, a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s money</li>
            <li> (And haven&#x27;t found any other SLS- free).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even when I do get a sore now they are much smaller, less painful, and last much shorter.</li>
            <li> The one downside to this product is that it is a little difficult to keep in your mouth when you first start using it.  </li>
            <li> This toothpaste is a little difficult to get used to at first (</li>
            <li> Yes, it is quite expensive for toothpaste however this really does work</li>
            <li> Down the toothbrush to your hand.  </li>
            <li> During a recent trip to Boston when I found out that I don&#x27;t have tooth paste, I went to a nearby store and noticed this brand and noticed it was expensive than other brands and above all I never saw or noticed this brand before.</li>
            <li> I tried other that were too harsh.</li>
            <li> We have been using this toothpaste for about a year and a half</li>
            <li> so I experimented with a few toothpastes, cinnamon for example, and it still made everything taste horrid for about a half hour after.</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little cheaper</li>
            <li> We purchased it in the stores and then all of a sudden it was very hard to find.  </li>
            <li> It is really painful when I get these and was told years ago that this toothpaste would help clear them up since the regular toothpaste has SLS and this one does not.</li>
            <li> Messy.  </li>
            <li> but my wife decided to try Rembrandt a few months ago</li>
            <li> After trying it myself for a few days and based on the evidence offered by my wife, I can now report my findings:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The tubes are so small not worth it.</li>
            <li> Few things work this well, but for sulfate sensitivity this is the silver bullet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some major stores have stopper carrying it, and it&#x27;s a scary thought that this might be discontinued -</li>
            <li> This has been going since I was a little kid!  </li>
            <li> I did a little research and found out that it is not even the flavoring of toothpaste that affects your tastebuds!</li>
            <li> The product was a little hard to find so there were periods of time that I had to go with out.</li>
            <li> Now, no more canker sores.  </li>
            <li> Usually, the sore will go away in a day or two without you noticing</li>
            <li> Was not able to find this brand of Rembrandt in any drugstore, discount chain, or grocery.  </li>
            <li> Ulcer may be caused by using SLS because it causes excessive sloughing of oral mucosa and dries the protective layer of oral tissues which causes underlying tissues to become damaged.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I will continue to us it or not.</li>
            <li> I usually have 2-4 a month.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to find in stores these days - so subscription here on Amazon works</li>
            <li> of purchase makes sense as this is hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> your mouth (as opposed to cold sores, which occur *outside* your mouth).  </li>
            <li> My outbreak started around the beginning of August (or late July maybe) and they didn&#x27;t diminish until the end of October.</li>
            <li> the problem i have is how slow it arrives.</li>
            <li> I still get an occasional small sore, but they don&#x27;t mushroom into incredibly painful ulcers that go on for two weeks.  </li>
            <li> Eating or drinking after brushing is such an unpleasant experience for me that I couldn&#x27;t bear to do it if I was planning on taking my travel mug of coffee with me.</li>
            <li> I had heard before about using toothpastes that didn&#x27;t contain SLS but tracking down any to purchase was difficult.</li>
            <li> I may try a less expensive one if it comes along.  </li>
            <li> After getting sick of constantly having canker sores, I did some google searches and found out about SLS-free toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This is a huge plus for anybody who likes to brush before eating, or who merely waited to brush after breakfast because of the nasty tastes.    </li>
            <li> For three and a half months I had a HORRIBLE stress related outbreak of canker sores!</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s impossible to find at Walgreen&#x27;s, CVS or any other store.</li>
            <li> and when I do have one, I don&#x27;t make it worse by using a toothpaste that agrivates the site.</li>
            <li> For me, combining a gluten-free diet with this toothpaste has caused an almost complete remission of this very annoying problem.  </li>
            <li> and it has significantly decreased the number of canker sores he gets- probably by about 80%!  </li>
            <li> and I gets a nasty after taste which last throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I realized that regular toothpastes seemed to slough off the skin in my mouth (disgusting, I know).</li>
            <li> Expensive though.</li>
            <li> I used to get awful canker sores about once a month, but as soon as I started using this toothpaste, I&#x27;ve had probably 2 in the last 5 years.  </li>
            <li> If you have problems with canker sores, you can&#x27;t do wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> and when I do, it isn&#x27;t as painful or irritating to brush.  </li>
            <li> Desperate to avoid the steroids, I researched online and found this product.</li>
            <li> recommend this for both the desperate and the nonchalant.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t so crazy about the texture or the taste.</li>
            <li> The biggest complaints are the cost and it is difficult to find in the stores, so you do have to plan ahead and not run out!</li>
            <li> It probably would have saved me from ordering the wrong thing if the picture was an image of the purple &#x27;Mint&#x27; flavor!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sad it appears to be discontinued now!</li>
            <li> Toothpaste used to burn my mouth so badly that I didn&#x27;t brush my teeth, and I would get yelled at by my parents.  </li>
            <li> This was a bad idea.</li>
            <li> but once you get used to it, it&#x27;s not so bad.</li>
            <li> I was shocked -- and still am -- but this product received all of the five star ratings it&#x27;s getting.</li>
            <li> Having this toothpaste is a must have for anyone who suffers with canker sores!</li>
            <li> If you suffer from painful canker craters, this is the product for you!</li>
            <li> A must have if you want to prevent those horrible things.</li>
            <li> It was just awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> For a person that gets canker sores regularly, this toothpaste fits the bill.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate the sore and it seems to keep the sores at bay, meaning i&#x27;ve been getting fewer since using this regularly.  But that could be my imagination. The only downside is that because it doesn&#x27;t foam up like regular toothpaste, it runs easier.  Down the toothbrush to your hand.  Messy.  And, if it gets on your clothes, it leaves a white stain.  But the pro&#x27;s out way the con&#x27;s.  This is a product that is hard to find in local drugstores for some reason, but Amazon.com has the best prices so it&#x27;s easy to get it from them.</li>
            <li> (Written by Bill Morgan, Susan&#x27;s husband!)  I&#x27;ll be the first to admit that the causes of canker sores are very unique to each individual.  From diet to illness to stress, there are many triggers, and this product may not help everyone.  My dad has suffered from severe canker sores his whole life (he gets multiple canker sores the size of a dime at times), and I had also been having them regularly (I am 38 now).  However, about 7-8 years ago, I read an article that some research had shown that the \\&quot;sudsing agent\\&quot; (the part that makes it bubble up in you mouth) in toothpaste had been targeted as a leading cause of canker sores.  I went in search of a brand of toothpaste that did not contain the agent, and found Rembrandt.  WHAT A DIFFERENCE!  Today I am nearly free of canker sores, only developing them when I catch a cold (maybe 1 time per year).  I highly recommend trying this toothpaste if you suffer from canker sores!</li>
            <li> I get these nagging canker sores but this toothpaste has helped me a lot. I debated buying this because of the price but all I can say is that its worth it.</li>
            <li> works well to reduce canker sores.  it will take some time to become effective, but overall it will reduce your mouth sores.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much to say about this toothpaste other than it works! As a canker sore sufferer for as long as I can remember (about 1-2 a month), I thought I would just have to deal with them forever. But after switching to this toothpaste about a year ago, I probably have had about an 80-90% reduction in my canker sore occurrence. I only got them back for the 1st month I got braces. This definitely is a life saver! 41-41 5-star reviews can&#x27;t be misleading, lol.</li>
            <li> i have used the product for years. It works grear. the problem i have is how slow it arrives. it has been several weeks and it still has not arrived.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Total person ever since the it was launched but my wife decided to try Rembrandt a few months ago and she is very happy with it - she&#x27;s not coming back to Total. She claims that her teeth are now a shade whiter and she likes the flavor. After trying it myself for a few days and based on the evidence offered by my wife, I can now report my findings:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It does appear to cause some modest whitening of teeth.&lt;br /&gt;- It is, indeed gentle - no sores or any problems reported.&lt;br /&gt;- The minty flavor is STRONG. This is a warning because some may not be able to tolerate it. I have no problem because I rinse with Listerine after tooth-brushing anyway but, it&#x27;s worth noting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who would like to try some casual tooth whitening, the Rembrandt can be a good toothpaste to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. - I have no idea what the Rembrandt name is suppose to be about. As far as I know, his paintings are rather dark and they tend to show Dutch men and women who don&#x27;t seem at all concerned with oral hygiene. The last thing the comes to mind when I think Rembrandt would be &#x27;sparkling teeth&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Like many reviewers I have suffered with canker sores since childhood.  This toothpaste combined with using Avamin Melts once a day almost totally prevent me from getting canker sores.  When I do, they are mild.  I ran out of this toothpaste recently and had trouble finding it in my town.  Within 2 weeks of switching to Tom&#x27;s, I had 4 to 6 canker sores at a time.  I finally ordered this toothpaste from Amazon as well as the Avamin Melts.  Now, no more canker sores.  Yea!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard on many occasions that there is no cure for canker sores, but after using this product for 4 months I realized that this just isn&#x27;t true.  Rembrant for canker sore sufferers is the cure for canker sores.  Not only does it prevent the sores from coming, but more importantly, it prevents them from staying.    Sometimes you will develop a sore or cut from biting the inside of your cheek or lip, and the development of a canker sore is inevitable.  The great thing about this toothpaste is that it prevents the inevitable.  The sore never grows to a point of extreme discomfort or pain.  Usually, the sore will go away in a day or two without you noticing it was even there to begin with.    The mint flavor is also great, and like some of the other reviewers have already stated, drinking coffee or orange juice after brushing does not affect the tastes!  This is a huge plus for anybody who likes to brush before eating, or who merely waited to brush after breakfast because of the nasty tastes.    The one downside to this product is that it is a little difficult to keep in your mouth when you first start using it.  It becomes much more liquidy given the lack of detergent, but you quickly get used to it.  It is really a small caveat to something that works such wonders!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001FB5I9G Rembrandt Premium Whitening Mint Toothpaste with Fluoride, Extra Gentle (For Canker Sore Sufferers) - 3 oz (Pack of 3)]]    I have prefered Rembrandt whitening toothpaste all of my life, and I have been offered no reason to use any other. The effect of the product and the ease of use has always made it my toothpaste of choice.</li>
            <li> Was not able to find this brand of Rembrandt in any drugstore, discount chain, or grocery.  Was thrilled to find  it on Amazon.  (Have had canker sores in my mouth since I was a kid and this toothpaste does the best job of keeping them at bay....)    It shipped quickly and was received within 5 workdays.  Bravo Amazon!</li>
            <li> My husband used to get very frequent canker sores.  We tried many things to prevent and treat them.  Finally a doctor suggested using a non-foaming toothpaste such as this and it has significantly decreased the number of canker sores he gets- probably by about 80%!  He&#x27;s been using it now for 3 years or so and it has been wonderful.  No cavities in that time either.  The biggest complaints are the cost and it is difficult to find in the stores, so you do have to plan ahead and not run out!</li>
            <li> The creators of this formula for toothpaste were absolutely ingenious.  Aside from the fact that this is probably the only product on the internet that has no negative reviews, this stuff is truly amazing.  I can&#x27;t believe that I suffered with canker sores as long as I did thanks to SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) in the major toothpaste brands (well, ALL toothpaste brands - even Tom&#x27;s Natural Brand!).  This has been going since I was a little kid!  Toothpaste used to burn my mouth so badly that I didn&#x27;t brush my teeth, and I would get yelled at by my parents.  In all this time, amazingly - nobody really knew the cause of the canker sores or sensitivity to toothpaste.  Some people thought it was viral, genetic, whatever... but lo and behold - it&#x27;s all due to SLS.  SLS and Ibuprofen are both triggers for me, and everyone seems to have a few different triggers - but SLS is fairly universal.   The people at Rembrandt who figured out this formula cannot be thanked enough.  It&#x27;s a great toothpaste in general too - you&#x27;re not giving anything up by using this.  I will buy this product forever.  Some major stores have stopper carrying it, and it&#x27;s a scary thought that this might be discontinued - but I am glad to see it here!  Oh also note it is 3 oz, so perfect for your carry on luggage!</li>
            <li> I used to suffer from canker sores about once a month but after using this i get them maybe once or twice a year. just ran out of it the other day and i already have been chewing my gums because they are so irritated. This stuff is definitely worth it!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  None other on the market work as well for my husband, who suffered for decades from frequent canker sores until he switched to toothpaste without any SLS.  The few other other SLS-free toothpastes we have bene able to find have formulations that he does not like as well due to taste, texture, etc.     It&#x27;s more expensive than most other toothpastes, but worth it!  No more money spent on canker sore remedies (that seldom work) and no more days/weeks on bland soft diet to help reduce pain and heal more quickly.       Was delighted to find this online at Amazon, after our local grocery store stopped carrying it last year and then recently our local Walgreen&#x27;s stopped carrying it as well.  None of the other local drug stores or grocery stores carry it now. Excellent price for three tubes at a time.  the product expiration dates show it is fresh enough that we will use it up long before the freshness expires.</li>
            <li> We did know exactly what we were getting since we&#x27;ve been using the toothpaste for a long time.  They quit carrying it at Walgreens so we were happy we could get it on Amazon.  Everything is what we expected it to be.  It is nice we got it in a pack because it will be longer before we have to order it again.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste really seems to help with my canker sores.  I don&#x27;t get them as frequently and when I do, it isn&#x27;t as painful or irritating to brush.  It&#x27;s pretty expensive compared to most other toothpaste, but if you get canker sores often, then I think it&#x27;s worth it.  The only other thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it gets watery almost as soon as you start brushing with it, so sometimes I have to spit and add more to my toothbrush halfway through brushing.  Whatever ingredient they remove to make it less irritating must be a \\&quot;bonding\\&quot; ingredient that keeps regular toothpaste in a more paste-y form.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste was recommended by my dermatologist but it is no longer available at local drug stores in my area so this is the most convenient way for me to buy it.</li>
            <li> Canker sores are often caused by sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), which is a foaming agent in most toothpastes. It irritates mouth tissue and makes it more susceptible to developing canker sores. This toothpaste simply omits that ingredient. At most stores, it costs and arm and a leg, but the subscription service through Amazon really makes it affordable.</li>
            <li> Apparently I got what I ordered, however, if you look at the image of the tube of toothpaste on the right of this screen, it is for the Rembrandt Canker Sore toothpaste &#x27;regular&#x27; flavor.  The description, however, has the word &#x27;Mint&#x27; in it, which is what I received.  It probably would have saved me from ordering the wrong thing if the picture was an image of the purple &#x27;Mint&#x27; flavor!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had a canker sore since I started using this product. Huge relief after years of suffering from a near constant stream of them. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t really prevent any canker sore at all! I think it even helps promote canker sores for that matter. Here is why, usually with toothpaste, just a finger tips amount of it could easily cleans your whole mouth, but as for this product, once you applied it to your front teeth or anywhere on your teeth that&#x27;s the only spot you can actually clean, only very little of it would stay on the teeth and most of it would drips everywhere, leaving you with your teeth and toothbrush with no cleaning product on it. The first time I used it, it felt like nothing really got clean, my teeth doesn&#x27;t feel smooth and I gets a nasty after taste which last throughout the day. So, I tried to use more, squeezing more paste as I cover a different area of my teeth each time hoping that it will help. This was a bad idea. The mint aroma gets stronger each time I used it, it gotten so strong that I had to rinse it out right away. Next day, I reused the regular Colgate, and my teeth felt fresh and clean once more. Happy. Save yourself some money and buy canker cover or canker-rids instead, I haven&#x27;t tried the canker cover yet, though I have it, but for sure the canker-rids promotes faster recovery and eliminates the pain.</li>
            <li> I have suffered for years from canker sores and did not know the cause.  It is such a blessing to know the relief that the Rembrandt C toothpaste gives me.  By using it I have fewer outbreaks and when I do have one, I don&#x27;t make it worse by using a toothpaste that agrivates the site.</li>
            <li> Well living in USA for 20 years I don&#x27;t even know that this brand exists. During a recent trip to Boston when I found out that I don&#x27;t have tooth paste, I went to a nearby store and noticed this brand and noticed it was expensive than other brands and above all I never saw or noticed this brand before. So I gave this a try and will use it until there are teeth in my mouth for the rest of my life. It does help to remove coffee color stains.</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from canker sores for over a year and was taking steroids periodically to suppress the sores. Desperate to avoid the steroids, I researched online and found this product. Let me say that the reviews are NOT exaggerated and this product delivers what it promises and reduces canker sores. After only a day of use, I found a drastic reduction in the stinging pain associated with the sores and after a few days the sores had subsided. Now, after about 3 weeks (and one tube gone) of diligent use, I am relatively sore-free.    Thank you Rembrandt !</li>
            <li> If you suffer from mouth sores like I do then you must use this toothpaste. If you floss every night and use this toothpaste then you will rarely get mouth sores! Good Luck!</li>
            <li> I have tried many things and this is definitely so much gentler than other toothpastes when brushing with canker sores in your mouth.  I do believe it helps it heal as well.  Five stars, rembrandt!  Why don&#x27;t they sell you at regular stores??</li>
            <li> This toothpaste has saved me from a lot of pain!  After suffering from canker sores for years (ow!), I finally did some research on causes.  Canker sores are sores that occur on the mucous membranes *inside* your mouth (as opposed to cold sores, which occur *outside* your mouth).  It turns out that in some people, various things can break down the lining inside our mouths - Sodium Lauryl-Sulfate (\\&quot;SLS\\&quot;) is one of them, and an ingredient in almost every toothpaste.  It helps them foam - you&#x27;ll notice that this toothpaste doesn&#x27;t foam up as you brush.  Its also an ingredient in many shampoos, so be sure not to put them in your mouth either.  ;)    To get the full benefit, you&#x27;ll want to *only* brush with SLS-free toothpastes.  (And also avoid other triggers, like citrus.)  There are several on the market, but after trying most, I like the taste and feel of the Rembrandt the most.  Its quite a bit more expensive than normal toothpastes, and isn&#x27;t in all stores, so Amazon&#x27;s three-pack helps out a lot!  I always make sure to order more before I run out.    For what its worth, I&#x27;ve also found that always washing my mouth with an antiseptic mouthwash like Listerine before/after bed, as well as after biting my cheek or tongue, and after eating anything that could be a trigger (citrus, red wine, tomato, and a few others) is helpful in preventing more of these buggers.  For more information, \\&quot;recurrent apthous ulcer\\&quot; is the technical name for canker sores - google away.  And good luck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for about 2 years now and it has become one of the products I absolutely swear by. For as long as I can remember, I used to have multiple canker sores at a time. I had always asked the dentist what I could do about it but he never had any good suggestions. After getting sick of constantly having canker sores, I did some google searches and found out about SLS-free toothpaste. I realized that regular toothpastes seemed to slough off the skin in my mouth (disgusting, I know). I stumbled across this brand and ever since I started using it I&#x27;ve only had 2 or 3 canker sores.   Yes, it is quite expensive for toothpaste however this really does work and if you truly suffer from canker-sores, you won&#x27;t mind spending a couple extra bucks.   (the packaging has changed from light blue to purple but it&#x27;s still the same thing)</li>
            <li> I wanted a toothpaste that was SLS free but had flouride.  I love the gentle mint flavor.  I like that this toothpaste is non-foaming also.  I wish it came with a easy pop-up top than a screw off. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since March, and it has not disappointed.  The reviews on here don&#x27;t lie!  This toothpaste is a little difficult to get used to at first (because there is no foaming agent, it is very runny, and messy!) but once you get used to it, it&#x27;s not so bad. And well worth the mess!  I have had MAYBE 3 canker sores since I&#x27;ve been using this product, whereas before they were an almost constant annoyance.  I cannot stress enough how great this product is.  If you suffer from painful canker craters, this is the product for you!</li>
            <li> This is the best product on the market for those who suffer from canker sores. It&#x27;s not so much what&#x27;s IN the toothpaste as what&#x27;s NOT in the toothpaste that is in most others. You will find this to be a great benefit when used regularly. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I started using Rembrant for cankers (C) years ago after I bought a tube as a last resort while on a trip to New York.  I have found that it is the only thing that really works to prevent and to heal cankers in the mouth.  I told my Orthodontist about it and he recommends it to his patients with braces and it really does work.  It is getting harder and harder to find in stores so, when I did find it at Amazon, I bought several tubes of it.</li>
            <li> Rembrandt Extra Gentle for Canker Score Sufferers, the box and tube with the big \\&quot;C\\&quot;, definitely reduces aphthous ulcers in the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been plagued with mouth cankers and irritation for years - in fact I was convinced they were caused by excess acid and thusly did not eat foods like tomatoes and citrus.  Rembrandt for Canker Sore Sufferers definitely reduces the flare ups significantly. For me, combining a gluten-free diet with this toothpaste has caused an almost complete remission of this very annoying problem.  Now citrus and tomatoes are back on the menu!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon first use, the only notable difference from regular toothpaste is that this type is \\&quot;flat\\&quot; because it is missing a foaming component - it is this missing component that seems to contribute to the mouth irritations.  After a week you become completely used to non-foaming toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size is small for what you pay, but it is definitely worth it.  My local drug stores do not regularly carry this product, but its efficacy is undeniable and it is indispensable for preventing mouth irritation, so I order it on line now.  The small size is also at the 3 oz limit which means you can take it through airport security in your carry-on luggage, a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t overstate how much this product has made such a significant difference over the approximately five years that I&#x27;ve been using it.  I have been tempted a couple of times to use a sample of regular toothpaste from my dentist and after brushing just a couple of times, I would be back at square 1 with a canker sore outbreak.  So the big \\&quot;C\\&quot; is worth every penny - it is a great product that deserves 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 20 years.  It really does work.  Explore the [...] site for more info..    \\&quot;Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS): is the foaming agent found in most toothpaste and mouthwash formulations..  Foaming agents fill the mouth with suds, sending a signal to users that their mouths are clean.  Ulcer may be caused by using SLS because it causes excessive sloughing of oral mucosa and dries the protective layer of oral tissues which causes underlying tissues to become damaged.  People with canker sores have fewer outbreaks and less pain if they use SLS free products\\&quot;    Rubbing your gums and tongue with the \\&quot;filler\\&quot; ingredient for soaps and shampoos.  Yuck.  Ditch the SLS.</li>
            <li> Helps heal and make sure you don&#x27;t get canker but just buy cheapest toothpaste that does not have SLS and your good. Like Sensodyne at Costco. The tubes are so small not worth it.</li>
            <li> My 12 year old daughter had suffered with canker sores for many years. We tried many different toothpastes and even rinses from the doctor (that had a side effect of discoloring the teeth). We have been using this toothpaste for about a year and a half and we have had no canker sores. It is more expensive than regular toothpaste but it&#x27;s worth it. We found the stores in our area didn&#x27;t sell it so we order it online. I would definitely give this a try if you are a canker sore sufferer. Good luck.</li>
            <li> Quite a tide of positive comments on this. Unfortunatley, I cannot join it so enthusiastically. I paid $8 for a tube of the Rembrandt Canker Sore toothpaste, which provides enough to last three weeks at most with twice a day brushing. I have suffered from canker sores throughout my life, and have never found any particular trigger or useful cure other than patience and pain-numbing Kanka medication. I not only suffered through the normal healing time of canker sores while using the Rembrandt Canker Sore toothpaste, but actually ended up getting more canker sores. While I doubt the toothpaste caused those additional sores, it certainly didn&#x27;t prevent them. The one plus was that while having a canker sore, this toothpaste was nearly painless to brush with unlike many others. Rembrandt Canker Sore toothpaste seems to be nothing but a sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS)-free toothpaste and nothing more--i.e., no miracle cure in the ingredients. Other companies also make SLS-free toothpastes, but should probably wise up to the marketing smarts of Rembrandt and stamp \\&quot;Canker Sore\\&quot; on their tubes.    Good luck to all you fellow canker sore sufferers. I feel your pain, including right now!</li>
            <li> If you suffer from canker sores, you must try this product. It has made a significant reduction in the number and frequency of canker sores I get. This product was first recommended to me by a Dental Hygienist many years ago. The product was a little hard to find so there were periods of time that I had to go with out. During those times, I noticed my canker sores would reappear. Now I make sure I have this product at all times. I bought the three pack and set up the auto purchase! THAT&#x27;S how good it is! I wish it was a little cheaper but it is a sacrifice I am willing to make.</li>
            <li> For three and a half months I had a HORRIBLE stress related outbreak of canker sores! It was so embarassing and horrendous that I was home-stuck for the vast majority of my free time. I tried home remedies and canker patches and even this. I will admit that I did not see any immediate progress. My outbreak started around the beginning of August (or late July maybe) and they didn&#x27;t diminish until the end of October. This tooth paste was my biggest help. Although I didn&#x27;t see any quick results, over the weeks I noticed that the smaller of my sores would disappear faster than the bigger sores. The bigger ones took a while to get rid of (thank Jesus that they&#x27;re gone!), but now that I&#x27;ve gone through two tubes of this stuff I am not looking back. I can&#x27;t say for sure if the toothpaste switch was the main thing that did the trick because I did try a lot of remedies, but I will say that this paste really does help prevent further outbreaks. And it&#x27;s gentle on your sores too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this for both the desperate and the nonchalant. But like some of the reviews say, please be aware that this stuff is very watery! I didn&#x27;t heed the advice and the first few times I used it, it would spill out of my mouth if my head was not tilted slightly upward. That&#x27;s my only peeve about it. I still catch myself looking down or just barely lowering my head and that stuff will come pouring out. Other than that, it&#x27;s money well spent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try. I&#x27;m glad that I did.</li>
            <li> After fighting with almost a constant stream of canker sores for years, I finally decided to put an end to them once and for all. I tried a number of different things from only drinking water, changing my diet, and using a variety of other products but nothing stopped my canker sores once and for all. I finally decided to give the Rembrandt Canker Sore toothpaste a try and while I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the lack of foam when I brushed, I was won over when my canker sores completely stopped. I was shocked -- and still am -- but this product received all of the five star ratings it&#x27;s getting. It&#x27;s amazing and has finally, after many years of suffering, given me relief from my canker sores. I&#x27;m able to eat and drink what I want, but just by changing toothpastes I was able to eliminate my canker sores altogether. If you&#x27;re suffering at all from canker sores, you really owe it to yourself to at least give this a try.</li>
            <li> I am so glad to have this brand choice in toothpaste (SLS free) as a canker sore sufferer, however with this packaging update it is not as clear anymore. There are not many choices out there without SLS, so taking it off the main messaging of the package makes it harder to find - and I worry I have not selected the correct product. It &amp;#34;suds&amp;#34; up just enough and has a pleasant taste. Expensive though. I also use Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s, but this is my first choice of the two.</li>
            <li> I used to get awful canker sores about once a month, but as soon as I started using this toothpaste, I&#x27;ve had probably 2 in the last 5 years.  I&#x27;m so sad it appears to be discontinued now!</li>
            <li> With the absence of a harsh foaming agent the toothpaste dramatically cuts down on the frequency and severity of canker sores. It&#x27;s a great toothpaste, definitely would suggest it to sufferers of canker sores or even non-sufferers!</li>
            <li> This was a great product but was discontinued.  I did a lot of searching on the Internet, comparing ingredients to eliminate sulfates.  Finally I ordered Squiggle toothpaste and am fine with it.  I tried other that were too harsh.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001FB5I9G Rembrandt Premium Whitening Mint Toothpaste with Fluoride, Extra Gentle (For Canker Sore Sufferers) - 3 oz (Pack of 3)]]&lt;br /&gt;just what I ordered  with quick delivery</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 5 years and it works great. Whenever I don&#x27;t use it and use a normal toothpaste I get canker sores. A must have if you want to prevent those horrible things.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t develop a sensitivity to sulfates until I was in college, but when it arrived it was very severe.  Thankfully, my doctor recommended that I try this toothpaste and it solved the problem instantly.  Few things work this well, but for sulfate sensitivity this is the silver bullet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is very good and my teeth feel very clean after using this.  It also has fluoride, which can help people with tooth sensitivity and prevent cavities.</li>
            <li> After suffering from canker sores since childhood I gave this toothpaste a try. I had heard before about using toothpastes that didn&#x27;t contain SLS but tracking down any to purchase was difficult. Growing up I found some relief using Lysene supplements when I would get a sore to help reduce the size and duration of the sore but I would still get several every month. Ever since switching to Rembrandt For Canker Sore Sufferers I went from averaging 2-3 sores a month to 2-3 sores a year. Even when I do get a sore now they are much smaller, less painful, and last much shorter. If you have problems with canker sores, you can&#x27;t do wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> I had a problem of not wanting to brush in the morning if I hadn&#x27;t finished my coffee yet because it ruined the experience so much. Eating or drinking after brushing is such an unpleasant experience for me that I couldn&#x27;t bear to do it if I was planning on taking my travel mug of coffee with me. I figured it was the mint so I experimented with a few toothpastes, cinnamon for example, and it still made everything taste horrid for about a half hour after. I did a little research and found out that it is not even the flavoring of toothpaste that affects your tastebuds! It is sodium laurel sulphate or SLS, which is an ingredient that enhances the foaming action of your toothpaste and is found in most pastes. It has two purposes, one functional, and one more aesthetic. The functional is that it acts as a surfactant so that the toothpaste goes into all the nooks and crannies of your teeth. The more aesthetic is the foaming, so you get a nice big lather going in your mouth and feel like you have really done your work. At the same time the SLS has a side effect of \\&quot;turning off\\&quot; the sweetness tastebuds of your tongue and amping up the ones that taste bitter. That is why a glass of orange juice practically sends you through the roof after brushing. The side effect lasts 20-30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people are sensitive to SLS and it causes canker sores for them, so a toothpaste formulated for canker sore sufferers is likely to be SLS-free. There are lots more SLS free pastes on Amazon, like Tom&#x27;s of Maine. This just happened to be the first one I tried, and I was thrilled to be able to scrub my teeth clean and grab my to-go mug of coffee and actually enjoy every sip!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from canker sores my entire life. I would usually get 2-3 at a time, they would last for a few days, finally go away, and the cycle would repeat in about 1-2 weeks.     Two things make them stop occurring:     1) Using Listerine mouthwash immediately after brushing    2) This toothpaste    I discovered the effects of Listerine in high school. The only problem is that I really can&#x27;t stand Listerine, but the canker sores do not occur as long as I routinely use it. Eventually I decided to try this toothpaste instead of Listerine. It worked perfectly. I would no longer get canker sores even without the use of Listerine. And I know this toothpaste is responsible, because if I use a different toothpaste for whatever reason (I run out, I go on vacation and forget it, etc), I will immediately start getting canker sores 1-2 days right after.</li>
            <li> Rembrandt&#x27;s done a great job with this one. I think it&#x27;s the best of their product line, because it&#x27;s quite gentle but still does an excellent job in both the maintenance and appearance departments.</li>
            <li> I am delighted that we found this product online.  It seems that stores have stopped stocking it on their shelves.  My wife and I are both susceptible to the SLS compound that makes toothpaste very sudsy.  It prompts canker sores and fever blisters.  I  hope that Rembrandt does not stop manufacturing it all together.  It was easy to find, order and was delivered on time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this about a month now, and my canker sore problem is greatly improved.  I still get an occasional small sore, but they don&#x27;t mushroom into incredibly painful ulcers that go on for two weeks.  They are now barely noticeable.    I think I had a sore or two when I first got this, and I could tell right away that brushing with this was not nearly so painful on the existing sores as it normally is with regular toothpaste.  So, that was a good omen right away (and would be worth the price even if this product did not reduce the number/severity of the sores).    I suspect just about any \\&quot;natural\\&quot; toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t include Sodium Laurel Sulfate (sp?) would pretty much do the trick. I may try a less expensive one if it comes along.  It shouldn&#x27;t cost so much to exclude that ingredient.</li>
            <li> My husband gets canker sores and our hygenist recommended this toothpaste.  We purchased it in the stores and then all of a sudden it was very hard to find.  Very happy that we were able to find it on-line.  He loves it and it works!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty simple...everyone in my family used to get the occasional canker sore...we&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for years now and none of has had one in forever. Only bad thing is I think they may have changed the flavor at some point in recent years, seems I don&#x27;t care for the taste in a recent batch as much as I used to, but that&#x27;s not a huge deal, it&#x27;s just toothpaste. Tom&#x27;s of Maine isn&#x27;t bad either, but in the end I&#x27;ve decided this is pretty much my favorite toothpaste and it really did mean the end of canker sores for me and my family which is great!</li>
            <li> I suffer from frequent canker sores, and when I use Rembrandt C toothpaste, the canker sores are fewer and less intense than when I use other kinds of toothpaste.  Also I like the taste of this better than other SLS-free toothpastes.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from canker sores since I was a child. For the last ten years or so I have used Rembrandt toothpaste for canker sore sufferers and I can count on one hand the canker sores I have had since then. I will use no other toothpaste.  My local Walgreens stopped carrying this product and I am so happy to be able to buy it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> This arrived on time and in good condition.  I needed a whitening tooth paste that was also sensitive.  I have problems with Canker Sores and this worked very well.  I would recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> SLS - free toothpaste has brought down my (and my partner&#x27;s) incidence of canker sores from every few weeks to maybe once or twice a year (and they are then smaller and geal much faster). Personally, I know that if I&#x27;m on the road and forgot to bring some along and have to brush with regular toothpaste I will likely get a canker sore within next couple of weeks.  I know that SLS sensitivity is not cause of canker sores for everyone, but for me it sure is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paying the extra for the Rembrandt is a no-brainer.  It&#x27;s made a huge difference for us.  (And haven&#x27;t found any other SLS- free).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to find in stores these days - so subscription here on Amazon works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely worth a try to see if SLS is contributing to your canker are misery - it sure was for us!</li>
            <li> After reading all the favorable reviews, I had hoped this toothpaste would minimize my outbreaks of canker sores, but such has not been the case.  It has a very nice texture and flavor ... but it is an adjustment to get used to the lack of &amp;#34;sudsiness.&amp;#34;  Not sure if I will continue to us it or not.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t so crazy about the texture or the taste. Squiggle toothpaste is much better in the non-sls category of toothpastes.</li>
            <li> We received quick delivery of this hard-to-find item.  This is the only toothpaste for people who have chronic canker sores due to over sensitivity to the harsh chemicals (SLS, etc) in the larger brand toothpaste companies.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from canker sores my whole life, and tried many different things short of prescriptions to get rid of them (topical ointments, not eating chocolate, not eating acidic things, different mouthwashes, baking soda, etc) and nothing worked, until now. I used to spend more time with canker sores than without them, and they&#x27;d get huge and last for two weeks at a time. It was a nightmare. I finally read about SLS and the connection to canker sores. Since trying this toothpaste five months ago, I have only had one episode of canker sores - when I accidentally grabbed my sons&#x27;s toothpaste one morning. Yes, the toothpaste is kind of pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it to me not to have canker sores any more. Since it doesn&#x27;t foam, it takes some getting used to: it&#x27;s a lot more liquid than brushing with regular toothpaste. Once you get the hang of keeping it all in your mouth (you might laugh, but I&#x27;m totally serious - the first couple times were interesting), it&#x27;s great stuff. Hopefully these comments will help a fellow sufferer decide to try this stuff - I hope it works for you!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste really works. I have not had a canker sore since I started using this 6 months ago. I usually have 2-4 a month.  I went on vacation for 4 days and left this toothpaste at home. I used my husband&#x27;s regular toothpaste and started to develop a canker sore. Once home I started using my toothpaste again and my canker sore never developed.  It is well worth the money to be out of pain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lifelong mouth ulcer sufferer.  50+ years.  I switched to this toothpaste recently and you&#x27;d think it&#x27;s a modern day miracle.  This toothpaste whitens, has fluoride but does not have the ulcer causing sls - sodium lauryl sulfate.</li>
            <li> this is a great product for us sufferers mouth sores.&lt;br /&gt;ease of purchase makes sense as this is hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I like the whole &amp;#34;canker sore&amp;#34; thing. I just wish it feel a bit more like the other toothpaste where it burn a bit in your mouth (I use that as a way to tell if it&#x27;s really working or not).</li>
            <li> I have always had issues with mouth ulcers from things that are high in acid especially strawberries,peaches,etc, and I&lt;br /&gt;love fruits. It is really painful when I get these and was told years ago that this toothpaste would help clear them up since the regular toothpaste has SLS and this one does not. I used to purchase this at different stores and can no&lt;br /&gt;longer find at any of those including the drug stores. I went on Amazon this month and saw where I could get it and&lt;br /&gt;was so excited. My daughter has braces and tends to get the mouth sores also, so I gave her a tube of this and it&lt;br /&gt;worked for her also.  I am so thankful that this could still be purchased even if I need to order it. I hope they never stop&lt;br /&gt;carrying this toothpaste. It really makes a difference for me during the time I have an ulcer in my mouth..</li>
            <li> I always switch to this toothpaste when I have cankersores.  It used to be that when I switched to this stuff (first used it in ~2007), my cankersores would heal much more quickly and stop growing larger.  This newer formulation doesn&#x27;t seem to be as effective at preventing the cankersore growth.  I&#x27;m not sure exactly why. I can&#x27;t find that the ingredient list is very different from the stuff I used to be able to find at the local drugstores.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it, prevents her from getting canker sores due to medications, I will keep ordering for her to keep her happy.</li>
            <li> My husband struggles with cancer sores. The dentist recommended he use this toothpaste. He loves it! However, it&#x27;s impossible to find at Walgreen&#x27;s, CVS or any other store. Have to order on line.</li>
            <li> Over a year ago I developed a reaction to the whitener in toothpaste. It was just awful. It also caused problems with my eating spicy and acidic foods. I was only able to brush my teeth with children&#x27;s toothpaste --- a grown woman using Sponge Bob Square Pants toothpaste! I am so happy that I found this toothpaste as I can use it daily and get that fresh feeling without any discomfort. The dental hygienist told me my teeth even look whiter!</li>
            <li> This Rembrandt toothpaste made for canker sores is the only thing I&#x27;ve ever found to work! Having this toothpaste is a must have for anyone who suffers with canker sores! I love this product!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years.  It works very well but is hard to find except on line.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the toothpaste.  Helps with canker sores.  I bought 3 tubes and will not be able to use them when the Date on them with expire.  In the future I would like to know the expiration date.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste and no longer get canker sores since I have been using it (maybe 4-5 years).  I just wish they would stop renaming it and changing the packaging.</li>
