            <li>I was impressed with them</li>
            <li>very good grips</li>
            <li>but it does a great job of counteracting the weight of a gun..</li>
            <li>but the product did arrive on time or under the estimated delivery date and the product is in great working order.</li>
            <li>Still, they operate as described and are great in quality.</li>
            <li>I use these with the tube tip combo, and they work great.</li>
            <li>i absolutely love these grips!!</li>
            <li>These guys r great and the grip is good</li>
            <li>Good material and good product.</li>
            <li>Perfect for quick change using one machine and for anyone getting arthritis in their hands.</li>
            <li>Great product, feels good in hand, would buy again and recommend to others, no problems, does exactly as posted, loved it</li>
            <li>Perfect for fast changing of needles.</li>
            <li>I love the weight they add to the machine, give it a good balance.</li>
            <li>I emailed this company and they were extremely great and sent me a new one within two days!!!!</li>
            <li>a good gun not these cheap Taiwan made pieces that r not USA hand made</li>
            <li>will get many more for all my machines</li>
            <li>but nope they sent me one I&#x27;m confident they tested before sent out.......</li>
            <li>great product, just too much for me.</li>
            <li>Just feels more stable to me.</li>
            <li>I ordered 2 of these out of excitement for the innovative idea.</li>
            <li>im impressed they came very fast and were good heavy quality helped reduce vibration and machine topheavyness  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still pretty nice.</li>
            <li>They are worth every penny and more.</li>
            <li>So quick and easy to change out tips and matching needle.</li>
            <li>They got here really quick and great buy especially for the price</li>
            <li>clean up</li>
            <li>These are alot heavier and easier to hold, and clean up faster before going into the autoclave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>i prefer the disposable tips and the twistlok makes clean up a breeze</li>
            <li>I brought one these  gribs and have used it and the waight is heavy but it works great for me and easy to change tip .fast</li>
            <li>As mentioned by others this grip is a bit heavier than most, but it allows for decent control.</li>
            <li>Makes work simple, the grip is comfortable, easy to clean, perfect quality will definitely purchase another one to have it as a back up</li>
            <li>give it 4 stars because the allen screws (hex screws) are basically the same kind found on cheaper types of grip.</li>
            <li>One works good the other was broke when i got it</li>
            <li>Ive already ordered another one of these and will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>Would be better if what I recieved was actually a 1&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Super fast delivery, and the twist makes it so much easier than pulling out the allen wrench.</li>
            <li>The texture on the tube makes for a secure hold and no slipping.</li>
            <li>These little guys come in handy</li>
            <li>for the extra 3 bucks i loved this style over the other you dont have to worry with the allen wrench</li>
            <li>Holds back stem and tip nice and tight.</li>
            <li>Makes cleaning your nibs a little more convenient, but the internal mechanism presents a cleaning problem.  </li>
            <li>thanks ACM GLOBAL!!!!</li>
            <li>Cool little grips and tubes.  </li>
            <li>the only thing about them is if you tighten them to tight they are a pain to get undone other then that they are lovely.</li>
            <li>they make needle changes and tip changes quick and easy.the tube still uses the usual allen screw but doesnt bother me one bit</li>

            <li> Grip feels solid and vibration is minimal.</li>
            <li> So beware before buying this item its not worth the time if your looking for a larger grip.</li>
            <li> Even though the tightening mechanism is better than a lame allen screw it tends to get hard to tighten.</li>
            <li> I like using it on my shader, allowing me to quickly switch between a larger round and flat tips without having to dirty my allen wrench.</li>
            <li> but I wish it closed all the way when tightened on the tube</li>
            <li> , also the small side has a slightly larger diameter</li>
            <li> but the disappointment set in right away.</li>
            <li> And both of them had to have the twist part screwed so tight in order to hold the tip that i almost needed a pair of pliers to do it.</li>
            <li> it was really heavy and well made</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit heavy</li>
            <li> OMG this thing is heavy.</li>
            <li> They both came with removable stems secured by a small alen head screw but</li>
            <li> they could of just said sorry not responsible for broken or defective products</li>
            <li> I received one from an order and unfortunately it had issue that some comments had...</li>

            <li> I got 3 of these groups I was impressed with them They got here really quick and great buy especially for the price I would recommend them to anyone</li>
            <li> very good grips im impressed they came very fast and were good heavy quality helped reduce vibration and machine topheavyness  will get many more for all my machines</li>
            <li> Great product, feels good in hand, would buy again and recommend to others, no problems, does exactly as posted, loved it</li>
            <li> I received one from an order and unfortunately it had issue that some comments had...wouldn&#x27;t hold a metal or plastic tip!!  I emailed this company and they were extremely great and sent me a new one within two days!!!! I will tell everyone get products from ACM GLOBAL they could of just said sorry not responsible for broken or defective products but nope they sent me one I&#x27;m confident they tested before sent out.......thanks ACM GLOBAL!!!! These guys r great and the grip is good it&#x27;s a bit heavy but it does a great job of counteracting the weight of a gun..a good gun not these cheap Taiwan made pieces that r not USA hand made</li>
            <li> OMG this thing is heavy. I will try to use it. I gave 5 stars because it appears that it will last longer than I will......great product, just too much for me.</li>
            <li> i understand the attention to deltail aspect of life and purchased this product under the assumption that there were (two) 1 inch twistlok grips and there was only one, i was looking for a multiple set and wouldnt of purchased this knowing otherwise. but the product did arrive on time or under the estimated delivery date and the product is in great working order.</li>
            <li> I like the weight and shape but I wish it closed all the way when tightened on the tube, also the small side has a slightly larger diameter but what are you gonna do it&#x27;s still pretty nice.</li>
            <li> Cool little grips and tubes.  Makes cleaning your nibs a little more convenient, but the internal mechanism presents a cleaning problem.  Still, they operate as described and are great in quality.</li>
            <li> Quality product. Easy to use. Holds back stem and tip nice and tight. Ive already ordered another one of these and will buy more in the future. So quick and easy to change out tips and matching needle. They are worth every penny and more. The texture on the tube makes for a secure hold and no slipping. So stop fooling around with allen wrenches and buy these.</li>
            <li> I had cheaper aluminium grips that fell apart over some months (rust, screws stripped etc). These are alot heavier and easier to hold, and clean up faster before going into the autoclave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it 4 stars because the allen screws (hex screws) are basically the same kind found on cheaper types of grip. Even though the tightening mechanism is better than a lame allen screw it tends to get hard to tighten.</li>
            <li> Perfect for fast changing of needles. Grip feels solid and vibration is minimal. Perfect for quick change using one machine and for anyone getting arthritis in their hands. Just feels more stable to me. Thought I&#x27;d have to give up tatting until I got this grip. Now I can still make the finest of lines and the softest of shades.</li>
            <li> I feel  bamboozled. I ordered 2 of these out of excitement for the innovative idea. but the disappointment set in right away. They both came with removable stems secured by a small alen head screw but only one of  them came with a tip. And both of them had to have the twist part screwed so tight in order to hold the tip that i almost needed a pair of pliers to do it. I&#x27;ll probably have to find something to wrap around my tips in order to use this.</li>
            <li> i absolutely love these grips!! they make needle changes and tip changes quick and easy.the tube still uses the usual allen screw but doesnt bother me one bit..i prefer the disposable tips and the twistlok makes clean up a breeze</li>
            <li> Barley worked threads are stripped</li>
            <li> Good material and good product.</li>
            <li> Makes work simple, the grip is comfortable, easy to clean, perfect quality will definitely purchase another one to have it as a back up</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery, and the twist makes it so much easier than pulling out the allen wrench. I love the weight they add to the machine, give it a good balance. I use these with the tube tip combo, and they work great.</li>
            <li> These little guys come in handy the only thing about them is if you tighten them to tight they are a pain to get undone other then that they are lovely.</li>
            <li> Would be better if what I recieved was actually a 1&amp;#34; Grip.. So beware before buying this item its not worth the time if your looking for a larger grip.</li>
