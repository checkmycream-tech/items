            <li>The eyeliner still works fine</li>
            <li>Plus it was a super cute</li>
            <li>Luckily though, i emailed the seller and they have agreed to send another one:)</li>

            <li>Overall great product.</li>
            <li>Its cute and fun.</li>
            <li>It was cheap.</li>
            <li>Not as smooth as I was expecting.</li>
            <li>It comes off super easily with water</li>
            <li>I got this eyeliner recently and it is amazing!</li>
            <li>Its a great liner and love the fact that its super black.</li>
            <li>Wow, I absolutely LOVE this liner!</li>
            <li>Okay, 4 stars not 5 because this stuff certainly isn&#x27;t waterproof.</li>
            <li>AND the price is right!</li>
            <li>I love how smothly it goes on and how its really waterprof</li>
            <li>I buy it a lot of, but I hope it&#x27;s delivery more fast.</li>
            <li>These little eye liners are so cute and very easy to use for liquid eye liner!</li>
            <li>The package was pretty damaged, but the inside product was fine.</li>
            <li>It dries extremely quickly and it&#x27;s waterproof.</li>
            <li>It came quickly.</li>
            <li>This was one of the very first items I ever got from amazon,&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>This is my new liner from now on. :)</li>
            <li>But also easy to apply, fast drying</li>
            <li>It works very well for me and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>eyeliner is so worth it for the price</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>It lasts long and is easy to manipulate along the lash line I love it</li>
            <li>and then it comes right off.</li>
            <li>Not only is the packaging adorable, the product also applies super pigmented and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>The downside is that the eyeliner is extremely easy to take off, so naturally I&#x27;m worried throughout the day if my eyeliner is still in one piece.</li>
            <li>Also, there isn&#x27;t very much product</li>
            <li>First liquid eyeliner I have bought.</li>
            <li>The eyeliner itself flakes off after wearing it for a while and isn&#x27;t exactly water proof</li>
            <li>The bottle is super adorable and the main reason I actually bought the product.</li>
            <li>Ill buy alot more!!!</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to a cute japanese doll</li>
            <li>And it dries pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Its pretty liquidy and thin, but when applied, it looks very nice.</li>
            <li>I really like this eyeliner</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>SO MUCH</li>
            <li>AS I CANT GET IT ON STRAIGHT.</li>
            <li>I have never had much luck with them.</li>
            <li>but what you do have is really gnarly.</li>
            <li>&quot; haha).</li>
            <li>It gets kind of messy sometimes.</li>
            <li>Stays on long and spreads easily.</li>
            <li>This was much better than I expected!</li>
            <li>The eyeliner does flake a bit after a while especially on the creases on your eye, but its not bad.</li>
            <li>I mainly bought this for the container.....</li>
            <li>I could compare this to my ultimate favorite eyeliners (revalon super skinny eyeliner and Wet n Wild&#x27;s h20 eyeliner)</li>
            <li>Overall, it was an ok purchase because it functioned well, but the design was mixed up by the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>would older it again...</li>
            <li>Arrived very early!</li>
            <li>I love this little eyeliner.</li>
            <li>The line is VERY precise, and the color is VERY black.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally use liquid eyeliners.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cute but wasn&#x27;t dark enough for me...</li>
            <li>Cute bottle, fast shipping, Not good eyeliner.</li>
            <li>the brush is stiff and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>The little design was so damn cute, only problem is that it takes a while to come to you.</li>
            <li>Its just a plastic pointy stick which is pretty good for getting corners thin and straight, BUT its not waterproof :/</li>
            <li>Its no problem because I&#x27;m nowhere near water</li>
            <li>dried up quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s case is very pretty, however, it takes a little effort to do the line above of your eye.</li>
            <li>product burned a little at first.</li>
            <li>They were not very precise, easily smeared, and just messy.</li>

            <li> I love this little eyeliner.</li>
            <li> The line is VERY precise, and the color is VERY black.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally use liquid eyeliners.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cute but wasn&#x27;t dark enough for me...</li>
            <li> Cute bottle, fast shipping, Not good eyeliner.</li>
            <li> the brush is stiff and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> The little design was so damn cute, only problem is that it takes a while to come to you.</li>
            <li> Its just a plastic pointy stick which is pretty good for getting corners thin and straight, BUT its not waterproof :/</li>
            <li> Its no problem because I&#x27;m nowhere near water</li>
            <li> dried up quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s case is very pretty, however, it takes a little effort to do the line above of your eye.</li>
            <li> product burned a little at first.</li>
            <li> They were not very precise, easily smeared, and just messy.</li>
            <li> It dried out very fast and did not last very long at all.</li>
            <li> It last a long time and dose not have to be reapplied often.</li>
            <li> The eyeliner worked fine though, but im still sad about the bottle.</li>
            <li> did take a long time to arrive, so I would recommend ordering ahead of time.</li>
            <li> It lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> I needed a deep black liquid liner that would last</li>
            <li> it is smudge proof which i like because other eyeliners I buy from stores smudge on my upper eyelid and its a struggle.</li>
            <li> I am an avid user of the eyeliner and have found it very hard to find one that works.</li>
            <li> Though I expected to get the pink doll I got the red one instead.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not very noticeable.</li>
            <li> It peels off pretty weird</li>
            <li> I have been bawling all day due to allergies and none of it has budged.</li>
            <li> b/c it was not a cute Japanese doll at all.</li>
            <li> Once the eyeliner is on, it does no smudge or transfer onto other parts of the skin if it comes in contact with the liner.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to apply it a lot of times to get it to be that dark black color I like in a liner.</li>
            <li> the formula looks like black paint with water in it.</li>
            <li> So when I do, I hold on tight.</li>
            <li> its a very dark black which i loveeeeee.</li>
            <li> It is just the cutest little thing (I got one wearing glasses).</li>
            <li> The product that was shipped to me was a &amp;#34;Lamelia&amp;#34; brand product that has a thin, slightly curved brush that makes application simple.</li>
            <li> I was not very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> After a few hours it flakes a bit</li>
            <li> Recently I started wearing false lashes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically buy liquid eye liners because I find them messy and hard to apply.  </li>
            <li> So I dont have to do my makeup every few hours!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the bottle I received, but it was no big deal.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smudge because it just disappears as if you didn&#x27;t have eyeliner, kinda weird.</li>
            <li> It is a very thin line liner which I like cause</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cold effect though.</li>
            <li> The product isn&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> Over all though the quality wasn&#x27;t bad...</li>
            <li> It was some nerdy, ugly girl in glasses.</li>
            <li> and i can just ignore the ugly design</li>
            <li> When i pulled it out, i was incredibly disappointed</li>
            <li> I would recommend a pencil base underneath.</li>
            <li> and it looked awful on me.</li>
            <li> THE BRUSH IS TERRIBLE!!!</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s sooo cute! Though I expected to get the pink doll I got the red one instead. It works very well for me and goes on smoothly. After a few hours it flakes a bit but it&#x27;s not very noticeable. I definitely will be getting this product again!</li>
            <li> I guess you get what you pay for. I tried using it once and it looked awful on me. It was difficult to put on neatly, so I went with an eyeliner in a pot that came with a brush, and I like that much better.</li>
            <li> Great product, doesn&#x27;t smudge easily, great price!</li>
            <li> It peels off pretty weird</li>
            <li> product burned a little at first. had to reapply to eye lids multiple times. dried up quickly.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this eyeliner! Plus it was a super cute container.&lt;br /&gt;It did take a long time to arrive, so I would recommend ordering ahead of time.</li>
            <li> Especially for the price, this eyeliner is awesome!  Not only is the packaging adorable, the product also applies super pigmented and lasts all day.  I can be super picky with eyeliners but this one is great :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for it&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> its waterproof like it says and it stays on all day, i love the design and i will buy from them again sometime in the future when i run out</li>
            <li> I really love this liquid eyeliner!!!! its super adorable mine came in purple and i love its packaging! Its not waterproof but lasts all day!! its a very dark black which i loveeeeee. i would recommend it. its a good addition to your makeup bag:)</li>
            <li> bought t to try it out, its easy to use, waterproof, and lasts all day. So I dont have to do my makeup every few hours!</li>
            <li> This is amazing. It doesn&#x27;t glide on but once it&#x27;s on, it is on. I have been bawling all day due to allergies and none of it has budged.</li>
            <li> I mainly bought this for the container..... cute. The product isn&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> Well i just got it todayyyy and its so cute the price was ufff and omg it works i love it :) it also got here 2 weeks before omg :)</li>
            <li> The product that was shipped to me was a &amp;#34;Lamelia&amp;#34; brand product that has a thin, slightly curved brush that makes application simple. It stays on all day with me going to work, then doing an occasional sweaty yoga practice! This eyeliner doesn&#x27;t smudge making me have panda eyes which is also another plus! I could compare this to my ultimate favorite eyeliners (revalon super skinny eyeliner and Wet n Wild&#x27;s h20 eyeliner) however, this one is much cheaper with cute packaging to boot!</li>
            <li> NOT WATERPROOF!! IT RUNS.</li>
            <li> The product would rub off after awhile or it would peel off it was not waterproof.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite liquid eyeliner to be honest. I will keep buying this. it is smudge proof which i like because other eyeliners I buy from stores smudge on my upper eyelid and its a struggle. This eyeliner doesn&#x27;t have a brush or anything. Its just a plastic pointy stick which is pretty good for getting corners thin and straight, BUT its not waterproof :/ It comes off super easily with water so that&#x27;s one lie :c Its no problem because I&#x27;m nowhere near water so overall I really like this eyeliner</li>
            <li> It took about 2 weeks to arrive. The package was pretty damaged, but the inside product was fine. When i pulled it out, i was incredibly disappointed b/c it was not a cute Japanese doll at all. It was some nerdy, ugly girl in glasses. I was really looking forward to a cute japanese doll but i got this instead. Luckily though, i emailed the seller and they have agreed to send another one:) The eyeliner worked fine though, but im still sad about the bottle. The eyeliner does flake a bit after a while especially on the creases on your eye, but its not bad. Its very easy to apply and the formula doesnt have a smell. Its pretty liquidy and thin, but when applied, it looks very nice. Its definitely NOT waterproof whatsoever. And it dries pretty fast. Overall, it was an ok purchase because it functioned well, but the design was mixed up by the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: so yea...the seller never sent me another one but whatever. The eyeliner still works fine and i can just ignore the ugly design haha.</li>
            <li> I give it 5 stars because of the pigmentation and durability of the product. I just would like point out that the bottle is NOT the one photographed. I was disappointed with the bottle I received, but it was no big deal. However, the finish of this product is glossy, not matte like most liquid eyeliners. It&#x27;s a cold effect though.</li>
            <li> I got such a great deal on these!!!&lt;br /&gt;Use it and gave some away for Christmas in stockings.&lt;br /&gt;Adorable and usable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get her!!  And more to share.  Mg.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cute but wasn&#x27;t dark enough for me... just a preference i have to have a darker eyeliner. Over all though the quality wasn&#x27;t bad... no flakes or smudge</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not waterproof so it is good for about an hour but doesn&#x27;t smudge and drys quickly! Love it!</li>
            <li> My make-up talented daughter loves this tool!!! Great price, and cute design made it a happy purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would older it again...</li>
            <li> Extremely easy to apply! The bottle is super adorable and the main reason I actually bought the product. The downside is that the eyeliner is extremely easy to take off, so naturally I&#x27;m worried throughout the day if my eyeliner is still in one piece. Overall great product.</li>
            <li> These little eye liners are so cute and very easy to use for liquid eye liner! The brush is pointed, making it way easier to apply. The product last well and doesn&#x27;t start to rub off after applying. I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is so cute! It dries extremely quickly and it&#x27;s waterproof. The eyeliner is also easy to put on. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> Lovely and Cute! Came in the mail today and the color is solid black-which is perfect! Bottle is super cute &amp; planning to buy more soon!</li>
            <li> SO MUCH YES! This was much better than I expected!</li>
            <li> Okay, 4 stars not 5 because this stuff certainly isn&#x27;t waterproof. But it definitely is smudge proof. It shipped quicker than I thought I would and the quality is quite nice. Not to mention the bottles are cute. :) All in all, it was pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li> I got this eyeliner recently and it is amazing! it has a sort of sheen shine that looks great and the line comes out very exact, Its cute and fun. It last a long time and dose not have to be reapplied often. I love it!</li>
            <li> PRODUCT SAID WAS WATERPROOF BUT I CAN NOT SAY IT IS OR NOT AS I CANT GET IT ON STRAIGHT. THE BRUSH IS TERRIBLE!!!</li>
            <li> It was already opened when I got it in the mail. So I&#x27;m not going to use it. Also it is not waterproof or smudge proof!</li>
            <li> This was one of the very first items I ever got from amazon,&lt;br /&gt;This eyeliner is so worth it for the price I paid,&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s shiny and it doesn&#x27;t smudge or run&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this eyeliner to anyone !!&lt;br /&gt;5 stars (:</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is not waterproof or smudge proof, it stays on for a couple of hours and then it comes right off. It doesn&#x27;t smudge because it just disappears as if you didn&#x27;t have eyeliner, kinda weird. The reviews were great that is why I decided on getting this item, but it is not as great as the reviews make it out to be. Cute bottle, fast shipping, Not good eyeliner.</li>
            <li> First liquid eyeliner I have bought. The applicator is great, and the bottle is so cute. The eyeliner itself flakes off after wearing it for a while and isn&#x27;t exactly water proof but it works excellent for me. Definitely would buy again.</li>
            <li> Stays on long and spreads easily. The fast drying made it very easy to love this product. I am an avid user of the eyeliner and have found it very hard to find one that works. So when I do, I hold on tight.</li>
            <li> I was not very pleased with this product. It dried out very fast and did not last very long at all.</li>
            <li> It lasts long and is easy to manipulate along the lash line I love it</li>
            <li> Great really cute couldn&#x27;t resist the container</li>
            <li> best eyeliner ever!!! Ill buy alot more!!! but i think the shipping is more than it should be..... I love how smothly it goes on and how its really waterprof</li>
            <li> The color is amazing, doesn&#x27;t smudge, the quality is great, I really, really, really, recommend this product. I am happy with it</li>
            <li> Wow, I absolutely LOVE this liner! It is a very thin line liner which I like cause you can always make it thicker. This a very good stuff! Will be ordering more! Arrived very early!</li>
            <li> Simply the best! I don&#x27;t normally use liquid eyeliners. I have never had much luck with them. They were not very precise, easily smeared, and just messy. Recently I started wearing false lashes. Mostly for special occasions or when I want to look my best. I needed a deep black liquid liner that would last and I found it! Cute? Oh yeah! But also easy to apply, fast drying&lt;br /&gt;(so no smears), and it stays put until you remove it. AND the price is right! Buy away! You will not regret it.</li>
            <li> It is not water proof. The eyeliner comes off easily, but its cute, so im keeping it for display.</li>
            <li> I love this little eyeliner. I purchased like 5 of them at once after I tested it out and fell in love.  Its a great liner and love the fact that its super black. I don&#x27;t have to apply it a lot of times to get it to be that dark black color I like in a liner. It has a nice glossy finish.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good. Worth the price. It gets kind of messy sometimes. Also, it can look kinda watery sometimes. I would recommend a pencil base underneath.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically buy liquid eye liners because I find them messy and hard to apply.  This liquid eyeliner has a great, felt like tip for easy application.  Once the eyeliner is on, it does no smudge or transfer onto other parts of the skin if it comes in contact with the liner.  Even during exercise, the eyeliner remains just as applied in the morning! Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> It got here in two day and that was faster then I thought , it looks very nice and it never comes off or smears I recommend this to anyone !</li>
            <li> This is my favorite eye liner ever. It came quickly. It lasted a long time. It worked well and made a great gift. It was cheap. It was good product. And most impressively (To me) 5 months later, the applicator brush hasn&#x27;t worn out!</li>
            <li> The little design was so damn cute, only problem is that it takes a while to come to you. Also, there isn&#x27;t very much product but what you do have is really gnarly.</li>
            <li> I buy it a lot of, but I hope it&#x27;s delivery more fast.</li>
            <li> this is great for a cheap price. the brush is stiff and easy to apply. the formula looks like black paint with water in it. but when it dries, it looks nice and shiny. a lot better than my elf eyeliner!</li>
            <li> This liner is AWESOME!. It is just the cutest little thing (I got one wearing glasses). The line is VERY precise, and the color is VERY black. It has a sheen to it, almost like patent leather (not sparkly). I was very impressed by it (also when someone asks where i got it, its fun being able to say \\&quot;China\\&quot; haha). This is my new liner from now on. :)</li>
            <li> Well there was no recipet in my order when I received it today however I only payed a penny for it so I&#x27;m not too upset. I put the eyeliner on and washed it off to see how the product was and it&#x27;s great I love it. It&#x27;s better than the 10.00 eyeliner I bought from the store. Plus it comes in the cutest bottle ever. Win.</li>
            <li> I bought this eyeliner on amazon. It came around the week period. It&#x27;s case is very pretty, however, it takes a little effort to do the line above of your eye. Not as smooth as I was expecting. The good thing it is somewhat waterproof.</li>
