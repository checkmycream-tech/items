            <li>This works amazing for that</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t own a hairdryer</li>
            <li>It has a nice aroma and used with the shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>Nice to have hair milk in spray form.</li>

            <li>This is the most inexpensive I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  </li>

            <li>My hair is also left shiny and moisturized and it smells great!  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t express how pleased I was with this product.</li>
            <li>Love this leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>Perfect addition to the shampoo and regular conditioner.</li>
            <li>My favorite leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>and I love the way it smell....</li>
            <li>I must say I am not the easiest person to please and I stand here today 100% satisfied</li>
            <li>I have been using Milan products many years.</li>
            <li>I was looking around for something that is geared more to my hair texture (course-kinky</li>
            <li>Smells good and allows hair to hold a nice curl or to keep it sleek and straight.</li>
            <li>Worth every dime!!</li>
            <li>Lightweight, wonderful smell, doesn&#x27;t cause build-up, really does detangle, moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li>AND the smell is fitting for a baby, light and refreshing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>think Mizani&#x27;s using the brand name to give the masses something that could easily go for &amp;lt; $7.  </li>
            <li>Amazing Mizani, you offer so much in hair care, thank you!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very light and fresh.</li>
            <li>I rarely will take the time to review a product unless it&#x27;s worthwhile.  </li>
            <li>I rarely take the time to review a product, but I had to take the time to say I LOVE</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy I found this after trying 4 different products.</li>
            <li>Before trying this, I was using Joico&#x27;s Silk Results Straight Smoother and really had great success with it.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, the price is an insult though :O</li>
            <li>As long as my hair is happy I am.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>It also is a moisturizing conditioning leave in which is great for extremely dry hair.</li>
            <li>An 8.5 oz bottle lasted me two months, no terrible, but the price still really irks me.  </li>
            <li>This really works and I&#x27;m glad about that.</li>
            <li>With a little bit of Murray&#x27;s pomade to help smooth those edges, you&#x27;ll be good to go.</li>
            <li>I would purchase this in 32oz if available - probably not very cost effective for Mizani to do that.</li>
            <li>This smells like the pink Johnson and Johnson Baby lotion to me, it smells really good.  </li>
            <li>The product did untangle my hair and does give extra moisture while leaveing a nice fresh smell.</li>
            <li>They may have gotten the formula just right on this</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair with the right amount of softness.</li>
            <li>I should mention that I used a fine tooth comb on my NATURAL HAIR that had been braided for 3 months, and it was the easiest process ever.</li>
            <li>friend first gave it to me</li>
            <li>Gives it an extra shine and makes me want to touch my hair more often.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products for mixed hair that smells food, but didn&#x27;t detangle her hair too well.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time wearing curly weave and someone recamended this hair spray to me.</li>
            <li>This leave in does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>This Mizani D&#x27;Tangle does exactly what it promises.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t so sure the first time I used it, but after my third try, I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li>I love Mizani products and this product is no different.</li>
            <li>Then spritz on the Mizani and detangle with your fingers first.</li>
            <li>I love using this as  daily moisturizer as well as after washing my hair.</li>
            <li>The scent is clean and soft but people recognize it and give me compliments, its almost powdery (not like baby powder though).</li>
            <li>While, it detangles it strengthens, makes your hair detangle when its wet or dry, it leaves your hair soft as well, and the smell is awesome.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure if you are detangling dry hair to saturate it with a spray water bottle first.</li>
            <li>This really works well, ,my hair can get pretty tangled (relaxed)</li>
            <li>This is a great d tangler especially if you are over due on a touch up (relaxer)</li>
            <li>Thanks to all those positive reviews, otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t have tried this product.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and my daughter&#x27;s hair is a bit coarse.  </li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s nothing really.  </li>
            <li>and this seems to work really well with my hair.</li>
            <li>but it really does detangle your hair without the worry of taking your hair out.  </li>
            <li>I really reccommend those who hair always tangle after rinsing.  </li>
            <li>This product is absolutely a hair staple.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how much slip it produced in her hair -</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s tender-headed, so she really appreciates this product too.</li>
            <li>I really needed a detangler</li>
            <li>Wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much...</li>
            <li>My son was surprised how the comb went right through his very curly hair--helped with styling his fro.</li>
            <li>The product does exactly what it says; nothing more or less.</li>
            <li>I used this product on my mother&#x27;s long hair and it makes it so easy to comb out.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First off let me say this stuff works WONDERS in more ways than one, want to lay down your edges while waiting to relax again?  </li>
            <li>Been using this Milk for 3 years and my hair is so spoiled it won&#x27;t behave for any other moisture milk! :-)</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says it will do with no mess and no fuss.</li>
            <li>and I hardly do much to my hair thanks to the natural wave (Tons of tangles and frizz).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll drop this like a bad habit.&lt;br /&gt;One more thing, while it&#x27;s great for twist-outs, braid-outs, and baby&#x27;s hair, if you use this for a wash and go, expect major shrinkage.  </li>
            <li>I have mostly been using this during stretches (spray around edges, brush down and into a pony tail) and to detangle my 13 month old daughter, nothing has worked better for her dry hair so far.  </li>
            <li>Best detangler I found for my daughter&#x27;s extra long, thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it&#x27;s not oily, it detangles my naturally tight locks with ease.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to women who relax their hair.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product after reading its high recommendations on Amazon.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t mind spending a little more.</li>
            <li>I love this product--it takes away the need for adding conditioner after shampoo and does not weigh my hair down!</li>
            <li>but it does work well for my son that has mixed hair but more on the dry side then</li>
            <li>This is the holy grail for moisturizing your new growth.</li>
            <li>I usually use it after the shower before I brush my hair and it feels light and the smell is not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;Might find it for less somewhere else, but to me it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried better detanglers in the past -</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair feeling soft and manageable!</li>
            <li>I never expected so much from a spray conditioner</li>
            <li>, quickly got her hair parted, combed and braided in 30 minutes with minimal tears from her and me.  </li>
            <li>I used this product in the first 4 months that I was transitioning from a perm back to my natural hair.</li>
            <li>: A little bit surely does go a long way, which offsets the high price a bit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a moisturizer too, so it left my hair feeling really soft and ready to wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and my hair feels soft after.</li>
            <li>i use as a &amp;#34;leave-in&amp;#34; for my natural hair style.  </li>
            <li>my remy hair was soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li>This product FAR exceeded by expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes my hair easier to comb and leaves it feeling soft.</li>
            <li>Mizani products makes my hair feel soft and luxurious.</li>
            <li>I prefer natural products</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s like the old saying &amp;</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy and curly hair</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who where&#x27;s their hair in its natural state.</li>
            <li>Makes my daughters hair soft like butter.</li>
            <li>my hair feels so soft and it works well for detangling.</li>
            <li>I use leave in conditioners on top of using regular conditioner, and it leaves my hair lifeless and sometimes stiff.</li>
            <li>im currently stretching my relaxer and needed something that would make my new growth soft and manageable and this is it!</li>
            <li>As an African American, I am constantly trying new products that will give my hair the right balance.</li>
            <li>my hair dresser always uses this product on my hair after washing &amp; then takes a big wide tooth comb and can comb thru all my natural hair in a minute or less, very detangling im excited to buy this to use at home</li>
            <li>Curls last all day and stays soft.</li>
            <li>Which is B.S.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m more confused by the fact that I&#x27;m getting scared because I&#x27;m almost out of the stuff and don&#x27;t have an economically-friendly runner up.  </li>
            <li>It also has a nice, light smell that isn&#x27;t half bad either.</li>
            <li>Natural black hair, it really helps when I comb back my hair before I apply my gel.</li>
            <li>In its natural state, my hair can be unruly with its thickness and three textures (strait in the back, curly in the front, and kinky in the middle)</li>
            <li>Her hair was detaned I continue spray only because of the amount of hair she has but someone with less hair would do just fine with a few squirts.</li>
            <li>Prior to using this I would spend wash day in tears, but now its painless and takes half as much time.  </li>
            <li>Although it is costly the time and lack of frustration for me and my daughter while detangling her long, thick hair is worth every dime!  </li>

            <li> Then spritz on the Mizani and detangle with your fingers first.</li>
            <li> I love using this as  daily moisturizer as well as after washing my hair.</li>
            <li> The scent is clean and soft but people recognize it and give me compliments, its almost powdery (not like baby powder though).</li>
            <li> While, it detangles it strengthens, makes your hair detangle when its wet or dry, it leaves your hair soft as well, and the smell is awesome.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure if you are detangling dry hair to saturate it with a spray water bottle first.</li>
            <li> This really works well, ,my hair can get pretty tangled (relaxed)</li>
            <li> This is a great d tangler especially if you are over due on a touch up (relaxer)</li>
            <li> Thanks to all those positive reviews, otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t have tried this product.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and my daughter&#x27;s hair is a bit coarse.  </li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s nothing really.  </li>
            <li> and this seems to work really well with my hair.</li>
            <li> but it really does detangle your hair without the worry of taking your hair out.  </li>
            <li> I really reccommend those who hair always tangle after rinsing.  </li>
            <li> This product is absolutely a hair staple.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how much slip it produced in her hair -</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s tender-headed, so she really appreciates this product too.</li>
            <li> I really needed a detangler</li>
            <li> Wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much...</li>
            <li> My son was surprised how the comb went right through his very curly hair--helped with styling his fro.</li>
            <li> The product does exactly what it says; nothing more or less.</li>
            <li> I used this product on my mother&#x27;s long hair and it makes it so easy to comb out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First off let me say this stuff works WONDERS in more ways than one, want to lay down your edges while waiting to relax again?  </li>
            <li> Been using this Milk for 3 years and my hair is so spoiled it won&#x27;t behave for any other moisture milk! :-)</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it will do with no mess and no fuss.</li>
            <li> and I hardly do much to my hair thanks to the natural wave (Tons of tangles and frizz).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll drop this like a bad habit.&lt;br /&gt;One more thing, while it&#x27;s great for twist-outs, braid-outs, and baby&#x27;s hair, if you use this for a wash and go, expect major shrinkage.  </li>
            <li> I have mostly been using this during stretches (spray around edges, brush down and into a pony tail) and to detangle my 13 month old daughter, nothing has worked better for her dry hair so far.  </li>
            <li> Best detangler I found for my daughter&#x27;s extra long, thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it&#x27;s not oily, it detangles my naturally tight locks with ease.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to women who relax their hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after reading its high recommendations on Amazon.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t mind spending a little more.</li>
            <li> I love this product--it takes away the need for adding conditioner after shampoo and does not weigh my hair down!</li>
            <li> but it does work well for my son that has mixed hair but more on the dry side then</li>
            <li> This is the holy grail for moisturizing your new growth.</li>
            <li> I usually use it after the shower before I brush my hair and it feels light and the smell is not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;Might find it for less somewhere else, but to me it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried better detanglers in the past -</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair feeling soft and manageable!</li>
            <li> I never expected so much from a spray conditioner</li>
            <li> , quickly got her hair parted, combed and braided in 30 minutes with minimal tears from her and me.  </li>
            <li> I used this product in the first 4 months that I was transitioning from a perm back to my natural hair.</li>
            <li> : A little bit surely does go a long way, which offsets the high price a bit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a moisturizer too, so it left my hair feeling really soft and ready to wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and my hair feels soft after.</li>
            <li> i use as a &amp;#34;leave-in&amp;#34; for my natural hair style.  </li>
            <li> my remy hair was soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li> This product FAR exceeded by expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes my hair easier to comb and leaves it feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Mizani products makes my hair feel soft and luxurious.</li>
            <li> I prefer natural products</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s like the old saying &amp;</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy and curly hair</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who where&#x27;s their hair in its natural state.</li>
            <li> Makes my daughters hair soft like butter.</li>
            <li> my hair feels so soft and it works well for detangling.</li>
            <li> I use leave in conditioners on top of using regular conditioner, and it leaves my hair lifeless and sometimes stiff.</li>
            <li> im currently stretching my relaxer and needed something that would make my new growth soft and manageable and this is it!</li>
            <li> As an African American, I am constantly trying new products that will give my hair the right balance.</li>
            <li> my hair dresser always uses this product on my hair after washing &amp; then takes a big wide tooth comb and can comb thru all my natural hair in a minute or less, very detangling im excited to buy this to use at home</li>
            <li> Curls last all day and stays soft.</li>
            <li> Which is B.S.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m more confused by the fact that I&#x27;m getting scared because I&#x27;m almost out of the stuff and don&#x27;t have an economically-friendly runner up.  </li>
            <li> It also has a nice, light smell that isn&#x27;t half bad either.</li>
            <li> Natural black hair, it really helps when I comb back my hair before I apply my gel.</li>
            <li> In its natural state, my hair can be unruly with its thickness and three textures (strait in the back, curly in the front, and kinky in the middle)</li>
            <li> Her hair was detaned I continue spray only because of the amount of hair she has but someone with less hair would do just fine with a few squirts.</li>
            <li> Prior to using this I would spend wash day in tears, but now its painless and takes half as much time.  </li>
            <li> Although it is costly the time and lack of frustration for me and my daughter while detangling her long, thick hair is worth every dime!  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use much product due to other reviewers stating it would make your hair greasy.</li>
            <li> and I have had less trouble combing through my hair and it seems like less split ends (only because my hairdressers don&#x27;t yell at me as much :P haha).</li>
            <li> This helps me style my hair for work and my hair feels so soft when I let it down at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I was dreading taking it down because I had a lot of new growth, and from having braids before, I knew the thread/braids/hair would likely be a matted, tangled mess.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have long wavy frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Her hair was dry and unmanagable</li>
            <li> i am 4a-4b thick coarse and it makes it sooo soft , i paired it with the h20 night &amp; Stretching cream</li>
            <li> I just received it today and immediately tested it out, because I&#x27;m trying to stretch my relaxer and was having a hard time with my new growth.</li>
            <li> This detangler moisturizes and provides combing ease, especially when I am 6 weeks plus post relaxer, and it does not weigh the hair down.</li>
            <li> I received this item in the mail today after wAshing her hair yesterday and as some of you will know black hair left untied uncombed is no laughing matter.</li>
            <li> : This little bottle, come with a big price.</li>
            <li> If I find something remotely close to this</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of using it I do not find as moisturizing as I expected.</li>
            <li> My 2 year old has extremely thick, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I use it about every other day and it helps hydrate my hair to reduce frizz</li>
            <li> I am an african american and I have very thick hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product made my hair very greasy and unmanageable.</li>
            <li> saturated the braids with the spray and took the braids down WITH EASE.</li>
            <li> Once the braids were down, I sprayed my hair again and combed through.</li>
            <li> I used this detangler spray on my baby&#x27;s hair and it made it less tangled and easier to manage.</li>
            <li> Although it was a little pricey, I&#x27;ve used Mizani products before</li>
            <li> I have really thick, dry tangled hair!  </li>
            <li> Detangles and all I need is a few sprits, brush, and a fan...styled and out the door in a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I spray it a few times to cover my hair (maybe 4 or 5 sprits).</li>
            <li> Hair stays untangled for awhile for me and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy after use.</li>
            <li> Use everyday, with no build-up, it appears to refresh the hair.</li>
            <li> instead I sprayed just a few squirts on her hair and what a surprise.</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and purchased this expensive stuff for my daughter and tonight after washing and conditioning her hair</li>
            <li> I can by  less expensive product and get the same results.</li>
            <li> , I usually perm my edges &amp; 2&amp;#34;-3&amp;#34; of my roots).</li>
            <li> is the confusing part.  </li>
            <li> ethnic, course, thick, relaxed, colored, and some highlights.</li>
            <li> There was a very small number of negative things mentioned.  </li>
            <li> I bought the product because my daughter has very thick hair</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too bad, but I run out within 3 months tops.</li>
            <li> maybe I got a bad batch...</li>
            <li> I hate keeping my hair in corn rows all the time.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I rarely will take the time to review a product unless it&#x27;s worthwhile.  With this product, I&#x27;m more/less writing this review because I&#x27;m confused.&lt;br /&gt;First off let me say this stuff works WONDERS in more ways than one, want to lay down your edges while waiting to relax again?  This is exceptional for that.  Want to add as a moisture component to your moisture/seal regimen? 5 stars.  Can&#x27;t get your baby&#x27;s hair to behave?  This works amazing for that AND the smell is fitting for a baby, light and refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;This is the confusing part.  An 8.5 oz bottle lasted me two months, no terrible, but the price still really irks me.  I looked at the ingredients to see if there were any substantial things in it that might justify the price and there&#x27;s nothing really.  I get that this stuff is really good but it&#x27;s essentially conditioner-water for $15!? They may have gotten the formula just right on this but when I use it, I&#x27;d rather use it liberally instead of the concentrated, cautious squirts I find myself doing.&lt;br /&gt;I think Mizani&#x27;s using the brand name to give the masses something that could easily go for &amp;lt; $7.  Which is B.S.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m more confused by the fact that I&#x27;m getting scared because I&#x27;m almost out of the stuff and don&#x27;t have an economically-friendly runner up.  I&#x27;m embarrassed to say I&#x27;ll be buying more soon, damn, they got me, lol.  If I find something remotely close to this I&#x27;ll drop this like a bad habit.&lt;br /&gt;One more thing, while it&#x27;s great for twist-outs, braid-outs, and baby&#x27;s hair, if you use this for a wash and go, expect major shrinkage.  3C hair, texlaxed hair over here.  I have mostly been using this during stretches (spray around edges, brush down and into a pony tail) and to detangle my 13 month old daughter, nothing has worked better for her dry hair so far.  Imparts a natural shine, smells brilliant, moisturizes like a mofo, lol.  Good stuff, the price is an insult though :O(</li>
            <li> Curls last all day and stays soft. Detangles quite well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried better detanglers in the past - But this does the trick. It lasts a long time. I use it after every shower...!</li>
            <li> I guess this product varies from hair type to hair type.  My daughter and i both used it and it made our hair unmanageable.  My hair is fine and my daughter&#x27;s hair is a bit coarse.  I still have the product, maybe someone in my family can benefit from it,  the product smells great, just not for me.</li>
            <li> The Mizani D&#x27;Tangle Moisturizing Leave-in Milk, is another great product for your hair, when you spray it on and you comb your hair it really do detangle your hair, wonderful</li>
            <li> I was hoping this product would be as good as the oil but it makes my daughters hair greasy (she has mixed hair texture) but it does work well for my son that has mixed hair but more on the dry side then my daughters. I can by  less expensive product and get the same results.</li>
            <li> I have long wavy frizzy hair. I have used tons of different product out there and this seems to work really well with my hair. I&#x27;ve used a lot of the anti frizz stuff they have out there, but nothing seems to work. I use leave in conditioners on top of using regular conditioner, and it leaves my hair lifeless and sometimes stiff. I don&#x27;t own a hairdryer and I hardly do much to my hair thanks to the natural wave (Tons of tangles and frizz). This stuff actually helps with that. Detangles and all I need is a few sprits, brush, and a fan...styled and out the door in a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;My friend first gave it to me and I have had less trouble combing through my hair and it seems like less split ends (only because my hairdressers don&#x27;t yell at me as much :P haha). I haven&#x27;t given it a second thought, except for the price. It&#x27;s not too bad, but I run out within 3 months tops. I spray it a few times to cover my hair (maybe 4 or 5 sprits). I use it about every other day and it helps hydrate my hair to reduce frizz and my hair feels soft after. Hair stays untangled for awhile for me and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy after use. Gives it an extra shine and makes me want to touch my hair more often. I don&#x27;t tend to use it when I have greasier hair. I usually use it after the shower before I brush my hair and it feels light and the smell is not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;Might find it for less somewhere else, but to me it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it&#x27;s not oily, it detangles my naturally tight locks with ease.  This is the most inexpensive I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  I would purchase this in 32oz if available - probably not very cost effective for Mizani to do that.</li>
            <li> My 2 year old has extremely thick, curly hair.  I have tried many products for mixed hair that smells food, but didn&#x27;t detangle her hair too well.  I finally broke down and purchased this expensive stuff for my daughter and tonight after washing and conditioning her hair I sprayed it on, quickly got her hair parted, combed and braided in 30 minutes with minimal tears from her and me.  Prior to using this product it would take me well over and hour to get through all of her hair.  I will be ordering this stuff from now on.  Although it is costly the time and lack of frustration for me and my daughter while detangling her long, thick hair is worth every dime!  It also has a nice, light smell that isn&#x27;t half bad either.</li>
            <li> im currently stretching my relaxer and needed something that would make my new growth soft and manageable and this is it! As soon as I spray it in it feels softer not to mention the ease for detangling! I love this product! And it smells great too so that&#x27;s a plus</li>
            <li> love, love, love this product.  i use as a &amp;#34;leave-in&amp;#34; for my natural hair style.  provides just the right amount of hold and control; plus i find that it provides excellent moisterizing benefits.</li>
            <li> This was my first time wearing curly weave and someone recamended this hair spray to me. It works great for getting out those tangles. It has a nice aroma and used with the shampoo and conditioner my remy hair was soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li> I have really thick, dry tangled hair!  This works so well.  Prior to using this I would spend wash day in tears, but now its painless and takes half as much time.  My hair is also left shiny and moisturized and it smells great!  Worth every dime!! PS, sometimes I find this at Marshalls and i buy all that they have in stock 8-9 bottles sometimes.</li>
            <li> Works great. Does exactly what it says it will do with no mess and no fuss. Would recommend to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I rarely take the time to review a product, but I had to take the time to say I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I (foolishly) left my full-head sew in weave for three months. I was dreading taking it down because I had a lot of new growth, and from having braids before, I knew the thread/braids/hair would likely be a matted, tangled mess. I went to Ulta to find some detangler to assist in the process, and I found this. Although it was a little pricey, I&#x27;ve used Mizani products before and I knew it would probably work well. This product FAR exceeded by expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saturated the braids with the spray and took the braids down WITH EASE. Once the braids were down, I sprayed my hair again and combed through. I experienced no breakage, no tangles, no matting, no nothing. I should mention that I used a fine tooth comb on my NATURAL HAIR that had been braided for 3 months, and it was the easiest process ever. It&#x27;s a moisturizer too, so it left my hair feeling really soft and ready to wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t express how pleased I was with this product. It will definitely be a staple for me.</li>
            <li> I really love this product!  After I rinse my hair, I spray a substantial amount a use a big tooth comb.  This is not only a leave in conditioner but it really does detangle your hair without the worry of taking your hair out.  I really reccommend those who hair always tangle after rinsing.  I used this product on my mother&#x27;s long hair and it makes it so easy to comb out.  Another winner!!</li>
            <li> I like the moisture this product infuses into my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hair easier to comb and leaves it feeling soft.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely a hair staple. This leave in does exactly what it says. It leaves your hair feeling soft and manageable!</li>
            <li> Love this leave in conditioner. Perfect addition to the shampoo and regular conditioner. I plan to buy this again. It smells so wonderful</li>
            <li> Mizani products makes my hair feel soft and luxurious. I prefer natural products but I use Mizani from time to time. They are good products.</li>
            <li> Use everyday, with no build-up, it appears to refresh the hair. Will order again almost out. arrived on time and in good shape.</li>
            <li> I used this product in the first 4 months that I was transitioning from a perm back to my natural hair. I needed something to help me prevent breakage of my blended hair. This product did the trick.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes and de tangles. Nice to have hair milk in spray form. Smells good and allows hair to hold a nice curl or to keep it sleek and straight.</li>
            <li> No tangles or pulls after I used this product. I also recommend for children with short hair.  My son was surprised how the comb went right through his very curly hair--helped with styling his fro.</li>
            <li> I use Mizani products on my hair because although pricy they do the job. This product is no exception it detangles beautifully and leaves my hair looking, feeling and smelling great! I guess it&#x27;s like the old saying &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;,  and with Mizani products you get beautiful hair!</li>
            <li> This Mizani D&#x27;Tangle does exactly what it promises.  I wasn&#x27;t so sure the first time I used it, but after my third try, I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li> My favorite leave in conditioner. I never expected so much from a spray conditioner but this stuff has substance. It leaves my hair with the right amount of softness. The scent is clean and soft but people recognize it and give me compliments, its almost powdery (not like baby powder though). Amazing Mizani, you offer so much in hair care, thank you!</li>
            <li> Bought this at ulta, just on a whim , makes my hair feel like it did when i was a kid ... i am 4a-4b thick coarse and it makes it sooo soft , i paired it with the h20 night &amp; Stretching cream</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this. it does not moisturize my hair.</li>
            <li> This really works well, ,my hair can get pretty tangled (relaxed) hair.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this on all types of hair you can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> I love Mizani products and this product is no different. I&#x27;ve purchased from this seller before, and was looking for a product from Mizani that I could leave in my hair but wouldn&#x27;t gunk up at the same time and after some research, I was directed to this product. I&#x27;ve purchased it twice now because I&#x27;m that impressed by it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: This little bottle, come with a big price. But it&#x27;s Mizani so that is to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: A little bit surely does go a long way, which offsets the high price a bit. Lightweight, wonderful smell, doesn&#x27;t cause build-up, really does detangle, moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li> Great product, great shipping, great price. Thank You!</li>
            <li> Works great.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Let me tell you about this product.  It does what it says.  It detangles your hair and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it.  I have naturally wavy and curly hair and my daughter has permed hair.  Let me tell you it does wonders.  While, it detangles it strengthens, makes your hair detangle when its wet or dry, it leaves your hair soft as well, and the smell is awesome.  This smells like the pink Johnson and Johnson Baby lotion to me, it smells really good.  Great product Amazon and Mizani.</li>
            <li> As an African American, I am constantly trying new products that will give my hair the right balance. I have virgin air, meaning that I&#x27;ve never put any chemicals in my hair. So, when I&#x27;m pressed for time and can&#x27;t press my hair, I through it in a ponytail. In its natural state, my hair can be unruly with its thickness and three textures (strait in the back, curly in the front, and kinky in the middle) Using the Mizani D&#x27;tangler is the perfect product for my hair. It makes my hair balance in texture and prevents breakage in the most vulnerable spot of my hair ( the middle). I would recommend this product to anyone who where&#x27;s their hair in its natural state. With a little bit of Murray&#x27;s pomade to help smooth those edges, you&#x27;ll be good to go.</li>
            <li> The product does exactly what it says; nothing more or less. I am an african american and I have very thick hair. The product did untangle my hair and does give extra moisture while leaveing a nice fresh smell. However, I found that you still have to use a conditioner this product does not take the place of that. My hair did not feel weigh downed or sticky after use. I would recommmend this product.</li>
            <li> Natural black hair, it really helps when I comb back my hair before I apply my gel. I hate keeping my hair in corn rows all the time. This helps me style my hair for work and my hair feels so soft when I let it down at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> This products gives slip that is essential to detangle hair without stressing the hair. It also is a moisturizing conditioning leave in which is great for extremely dry hair.</li>
            <li> Mizani is a trusted brand with GREAT products! This detangler moisturizes and provides combing ease, especially when I am 6 weeks plus post relaxer, and it does not weigh the hair down. I highly recommend this product to women who relax their hair.</li>
            <li> Best detangler I found for my daughter&#x27;s extra long, thick wavy hair. Just make sure if you are detangling dry hair to saturate it with a spray water bottle first. Then spritz on the Mizani and detangle with your fingers first. I was amazed at how much slip it produced in her hair - my fingers just glided through. She&#x27;s tender-headed, so she really appreciates this product too.</li>
            <li> This really works and I&#x27;m glad about that. I really needed a detangler and I wanted to wanted to stay with the Mizani product line.</li>
            <li> Been using this Milk for 3 years and my hair is so spoiled it won&#x27;t behave for any other moisture milk! :-)</li>
            <li> This is a great d tangler especially if you are over due on a touch up (relaxer) and I love the way it smell....it&#x27;s very light and fresh.</li>
            <li> Makes my daughters hair soft like butter. Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> Hair type: ethnic, course, thick, relaxed, colored, and some highlights. This is the holy grail for moisturizing your new growth. I just received it today and immediately tested it out, because I&#x27;m trying to stretch my relaxer and was having a hard time with my new growth. I knew there had to be a product out there that works for me and I&#x27;m happy I found this after trying 4 different products. I&#x27;m so so happy. Thanks to all those positive reviews, otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t have tried this product. I don&#x27;t care about the price. As long as my hair is happy I am.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after reading its high recommendations on Amazon. After 2 weeks of using it I do not find as moisturizing as I expected.</li>
            <li> Before I make any purchase I read and talk to others about their reviews. This item was no different. There was a very small number of negative things mentioned.  I bought the product because my daughter has very thick hair and I spend an enormous amount of of money managing it. I received this item in the mail today after wAshing her hair yesterday and as some of you will know black hair left untied uncombed is no laughing matter. I opened the box and took her to the vanity to start what I thought would be another daunting task. I attest it was anything but.  Her hair was dry and unmanagable i thought I would need to wash it again instead I sprayed just a few squirts on her hair and what a surprise. Her hair was detaned I continue spray only because of the amount of hair she has but someone with less hair would do just fine with a few squirts. I must say I am not the easiest person to please and I stand here today 100% satisfied</li>
            <li> I love this product--it takes away the need for adding conditioner after shampoo and does not weigh my hair down!</li>
            <li> Very good stuff. Makes combing thru a breeze. I use all Mizani products.</li>
            <li> Does wonders for my hair when I press it.  But what do you expect from all Mizani products? The products do what they say so I don&#x27;t mind spending a little more.</li>
            <li> I have been using Milan products many years.</li>
            <li> Great product! I love using this as  daily moisturizer as well as after washing my hair. my hair feels so soft and it works well for detangling.</li>
            <li> I used this detangler spray on my baby&#x27;s hair and it made it less tangled and easier to manage. It is a great product for children who do not like you combing their hair.</li>
            <li> Before trying this, I was using Joico&#x27;s Silk Results Straight Smoother and really had great success with it. I was looking around for something that is geared more to my hair texture (course-kinky, I usually perm my edges &amp; 2&amp;#34;-3&amp;#34; of my roots). Unfortunately, this product made my hair very greasy and unmanageable. It didn&#x27;t untangle any of my hair and I ended up using what I had left of the Silk Results. I didn&#x27;t use much product due to other reviewers stating it would make your hair greasy. I don&#x27;t know what happen maybe I got a bad batch...</li>
            <li> Works super on my daughter&#x27;s hair- and smells great, too! Wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much... but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> my hair dresser always uses this product on my hair after washing &amp; then takes a big wide tooth comb and can comb thru all my natural hair in a minute or less, very detangling im excited to buy this to use at home</li>
