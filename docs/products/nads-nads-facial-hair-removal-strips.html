    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The size of strips is perfect.  </li>
            <li>this a great buy</li>
            <li>The price for the amount of product is fair.</li>
            <li>I like that the strips are a cotton blend and not plastic like most.</li>
            <li>It actually worked great!</li>
            <li>When you treat the area more than 2 times, you&#x27;re basically ripping off the top layer of your skin</li>
            <li>- so it&#x27;s important that you follow the directions!</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product, but wish it came with more soothing wipes.</li>
            <li>There could be more strips in the package for the price.</li>
            <li>Love this...</li>
            <li>This is so much better and lasts longer.</li>
            <li>Best of all the facial strips.</li>
            <li>Great for fine facial hair.</li>
            <li>Well, between Sally Hanson and Nads, Nads is far superior.  </li>
            <li>It is easy, quick and painless to use.</li>
            <li>Have used these for several years, and it is good stuff.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and the quality is better than most other.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product some time ago, but did not use it at first.  </li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing!</li>
            <li>They work pretty well, I will buy them again.</li>
            <li>I would highly reccommand  </li>
            <li>I have a lot of fine hair above my upper lip, and I use it to remove it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s JUST gentle enough not to really hurt, or irritate my skin and it does the job</li>
            <li>I like Nads better than any other facial wax strips.  </li>
            <li>Then, for several days after using it that first time, It left a scab-looking blob that was very course from whatever the &amp;#34;wax&amp;#34; product did to the skin.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, but did not get a rash or breakouts after using the strips.</li>
            <li>I have had the same experience as the previous reviewer, but the directions/instructions clearly state &#x27;do not use over the the same area more than twice&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>I use these all the time, you can only go over the area once, and if you warm the wax strips prior to use by rubbing it in your hand, then firmly press and rub it oin the skin, hold taught and pull opposite the hair growth.</li>
            <li>The little strips are very small, too, and you have to have good aim to get to isolated areas of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> this was a waste of money and a mess to clean up and get off my skin</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t remove hair nearly as well as other brands.</li>
            <li> It left a very strange film on my face, despite me washing with moisturizer and wiping the area with baby oil.  </li>
            <li> I use a dry body oil for any excess wax on the skin.</li>
            <li> They work moderately well, but they are messy and sticky.</li>
            <li> Shaving may be a high maintenance activity, but it beats having random blotches of damaged skin on your face.</li>
            <li> I had a small patch of hair on my chin that I thought these would take care of, but nope.  </li>
            <li> I have a slight mustache that seems to get worse as I age.</li>
            <li> Now to find the small tub version with cloth strips!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Suffice it to say, the hair didn&#x27;t come out as the product stated it would, and seeing as that&#x27;s the point, it&#x27;s not a good product.  </li>
            <li> I hate to write negative reviews, but these seriously are not worth anyone&#x27;s time.  </li>
            <li> Strips are not strong enough to pull hair out and leave a nasty residue!</li>
            <li> and I am sorry that I did not have the time to return it .....</li>
            <li> sad face</li>
            <li> I had an impossible time getting rid of the sticky residue.</li>
            <li> I had a bad reaction to this product.</li>
            <li> I hate razors!</li>
            <li> Terrible product.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Great for fine facial hair. I have sensitive skin, but did not get a rash or breakouts after using the strips.</li>
            <li> It showed up on time but it dont take all of the hair off you have to keep useing it or get out the tweezers</li>
            <li> did the job it&#x27;s supposed to do! I like that the strips are a cotton blend and not plastic like most.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product some time ago, but did not use it at first.  I recently found the strips in my closet and decided to give it a try.  It actually worked great! I have had the same experience as the previous reviewer, but the directions/instructions clearly state &#x27;do not use over the the same area more than twice&#x27;.  When you treat the area more than 2 times, you&#x27;re basically ripping off the top layer of your skin - so it&#x27;s important that you follow the directions! I will continue to use this product, but wish it came with more soothing wipes.</li>
            <li> Product works well. Only problem I have is the conditioning wipes cause my skin to break out.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like these. They don&#x27;t remove hair nearly as well as other brands.</li>
            <li> Have used these for several years, and it is good stuff.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of fine hair above my upper lip, and I use it to remove it. It is easy, quick and painless to use.</li>
            <li> Well, between Sally Hanson and Nads, Nads is far superior.  There could be more strips in the package for the price.</li>
            <li> I like Nads better than any other facial wax strips.  They are easy to use and the quality is better than most other.</li>
            <li> Strips are not strong enough to pull hair out and leave a nasty residue! Yuck</li>
            <li> This is the only hair removal product that I use.  The size of strips is perfect.  The price for the amount of product is fair.</li>
            <li> I hate to write negative reviews, but these seriously are not worth anyone&#x27;s time.  I had a small patch of hair on my chin that I thought these would take care of, but nope.

            <li> Love this...I have a slight mustache that seems to get worse as I age. I hate razors! This is so much better and lasts longer.</li>

            <li> They work pretty well, I will buy them again.</li>
            <li> I had a bad reaction to this product.</li>

            <li> I never wax with anything else. It&#x27;s JUST gentle enough not to really hurt, or irritate my skin and it does the job well. I will always want this in my cabinet. Now to find the small tub version with cloth strips!</li>
            <li> They work moderately well, but they are messy and sticky. I had an impossible time getting rid of the sticky residue. I notice the bathroom floor had some of the gunk from these strips on it. I think they can improve this product.</li>
            <li> I like this product, I can&#x27;t find this in my local wal-mart store.</li>
            <li> I tell u what I&#x27;ve use waxing before but this takes the cake I used it the 1st day and poof this hair came off I would highly reccommand  this a great buy</li>
            <li> I use these all the time, you can only go over the area once, and if you warm the wax strips prior to use by rubbing it in your hand, then firmly press and rub it oin the skin, hold taught and pull opposite the hair growth. I use a dry body oil for any excess wax on the skin. I dont like the nads facial wand though, it didnt work well for me at all.</li>
            <li> Best of all the facial strips.</li>
