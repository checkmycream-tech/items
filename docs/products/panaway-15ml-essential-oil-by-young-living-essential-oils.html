            <li>Use this and put the peppermint oil on top of it and your pain goes away.</li>
            <li>am still going to do chiropractic treatments and PT, now together with my breathtaking and ultimate pain reliever and muscle relaxant.</li>
            <li>Nothing better than PanAway for joint pain.</li>
            <li>Panaway by Young Living is great for relieving pain .</li>
            <li>We loved it so much we went for the 15 oz.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my grandma and it is very effective essential oil!</li>
            <li>Panaway was pleasant and easy to use, but no major changes in my pain symptoms.  </li>
            <li>Many thanks for the very quick received PanAway product.</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>I am new to Young Living Products and appreciate the opportunity to try some of the more popular oils and blends at better prices.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a quick headache reliever.</li>
            <li>Product was just as described and was received quickly.  </li>
            <li>My Spine Surgeon and I had a deal that I could cancel my upcoming surgery if  I would be able to cope up doing my normal routine from  Monday to Wednesday.</li>
            <li>This is amazing for pain mixed with grapeseed oil</li>
            <li>First Young Living is the best essential oil available due to its&lt;br /&gt;purity and associated effectivness.</li>
            <li>I kept on applying this every time I feel some pain and muscle spasm (which is so severe), amazingly, I was able to have my haircut and sat for almost 30mins- which I could hardly do for 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am very grateful for the option!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really works!!!!ive used it thru my knee replacements and for fibro and nueropathy.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I do not like to take prescription stuff due to the many side affects and can&#x27;t afford to get a massage or go to the chiropractor as often</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I am willing to try it and give it a 2nd chance.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it is natural.</li>
            <li>I am surprised to see this being sold here for $91.78.</li>
            <li>Just to let you know, if you buy this 5ml size from Young Living Essential Oils directly or through a YLEO distributor, the price is between $29.75 for distributors, to $34.45 for preferred customers, to $39.14 for customers.</li>
            <li>Btw, I just started using my  Panaway last Saturday only (fast shipping).</li>
            <li>The only catch is I have to reapply it every 2 hours when in pain, but the relief is near immediate.</li>

            <li> The only catch is I have to reapply it every 2 hours when in pain, but the relief is near immediate.</li>
            <li> It only takes a couple drops at a time so is long lasting.</li>
            <li> I am not a essential oil fanatic, but this stuff really works well on me.</li>
            <li> This is recently good for a painful knee that is not ready for surgery.</li>
            <li> I still have half the bottle left even though I use it 3-4 times a week.</li>
            <li> little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is what we used for our dog when she was having extreme problems with pain.  </li>
            <li> I prefer Two Old Goats lotion which works as well and is less expensive.</li>
            <li> I have used PanAway for a few years for soothing aches and pains.</li>
            <li> I conduct strenuous physical activity and have a bad back.</li>
            <li> The pain starts to dull and becomes tolerable.</li>
            <li> At least at this price ($52 + shipping from 911 Health Shop)</li>
            <li> However, it is very expensive for such a small amount of oil.  </li>
            <li> Maybe someone made a typo, or maybe it is a rip-off.</li>
            <li> I get terrible trigger point pain in my jaw, neck, shoulder, and hip.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I had my doubts that this product works...but it did. I conduct strenuous physical activity and have a bad back. Applied the oil and within 30 mins, pain subsided for the next 6 hours. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have used PanAway for a few years for soothing aches and pains. It has a nice aroma and works within minutes. It only takes a couple drops at a time so is long lasting. I like the fact that it is natural.</li>
            <li> Just to let you know, if you buy this 5ml size from Young Living Essential Oils directly or through a YLEO distributor, the price is between $29.75 for distributors, to $34.45 for preferred customers, to $39.14 for customers. I am surprised to see this being sold here for $91.78. That is the customer price for the 15ml size, not the 5ml size. Maybe someone made a typo, or maybe it is a rip-off. Price aside, I think these Young Living Oils are the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> This is what we used for our dog when she was having extreme problems with pain.  She was relieved of the pain immediately.  She also had acupuncture treatments.  We use it for our pain and pain is instantly taken away.  We loved it so much we went for the 15 oz. bottle for back-up.  Worth the money!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it!!!!  Use this and put the peppermint oil on top of it and your pain goes away.</li>
            <li> This is amazing for pain mixed with grapeseed oil</li>
            <li> I am new to Young Living Products and appreciate the opportunity to try some of the more popular oils and blends at better prices.

            <li> I have severe lumbar herniated disc, and was scheduled for operation on the 6th of May. My Spine Surgeon and I had a deal that I could cancel my upcoming surgery if  I would be able to cope up doing my normal routine from  Monday to Wednesday. Btw, I just started using my  Panaway last Saturday only (fast shipping). I kept on applying this every time I feel some pain and muscle spasm (which is so severe), amazingly, I was able to have my haircut and sat for almost 30mins- which I could hardly do for 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;I am still going to do chiropractic treatments and PT, now together with my breathtaking and ultimate pain reliever and muscle relaxant.</li>
            <li> Excellent pain relief!!</li>
            <li> I bought it for my grandma and it is very effective essential oil! Great buy and would purchase it again!</li>
            <li> This is recently good for a painful knee that is not ready for surgery.</li>
            <li> Many thanks for the very quick received PanAway product. This is the best pain relief product that I use to  help with head/back aches. Great place to buy from. I do it again</li>
            <li> i have used this before-and it is a great product. I dilute it with another oil and warm it before applying.</li>
            <li> I like this oil which is helpful for my plantar fasciitis.  However, it is very expensive for such a small amount of oil.  I prefer Two Old Goats lotion which works as well and is less expensive.</li>
            <li> My wife said these oils are great! I will not question that!</li>
            <li> Panaway by Young Living is great for relieving pain . I use it for back pain and leg pain.  It&#x27;s also a quick headache reliever.</li>
            <li> Nothing better than PanAway for joint pain.</li>
            <li> I am not a essential oil fanatic, but this stuff really works well on me. It works as well as taking prescription pain pills for my fibromyalgia. I get terrible trigger point pain in my jaw, neck, shoulder, and hip. I do not like to take prescription stuff due to the many side affects and can&#x27;t afford to get a massage or go to the chiropractor as often and I&#x27;d like. This works just as well for me. The only catch is I have to reapply it every 2 hours when in pain, but the relief is near immediate. I am very grateful for the option!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way. I have the smaller bottle and mix it with a carrier oil (3-4 drops to a teaspoon of massage oil). I still have half the bottle left even though I use it 3-4 times a week.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough for this product. First Young Living is the best essential oil available due to its&lt;br /&gt;purity and associated effectivness. I am using it to recover from knee surgery and when I am in pain I put&lt;br /&gt;PANAWAY on and I get instant relief. The pain starts to dull and becomes tolerable. Great Product. I have&lt;br /&gt;ordered a second bottle because I do not want to run out.</li>
            <li> Really works!!!!ive used it thru my knee replacements and for fibro and nueropathy.</li>
            <li> Helps take the pains away and it smells good!</li>
            <li> Product was just as described and was received quickly.  Thanks</li>
