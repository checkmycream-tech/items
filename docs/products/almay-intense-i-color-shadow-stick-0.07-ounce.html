            <li>The brown is a bit bold but I like being able to &amp;#34;draw&amp;#34; my eye shadow on when in a hurry.  </li>

            <li>/&gt;The eye shadow in each end of the stick goes on really well.  </li>
            <li>I love Almay, and the color is great, just be weary of putting on a lot of the darker color, its quite dark, especially against my pale skin.</li>
            <li>Great for travel because these sticks and primers that go along with them take up less room in the makeup bag than other palette type shadows.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good but not great.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes</li>

            <li> I particularly like it on days when I&#x27;m in a hurry and just need a little something.</li>
            <li> and it last all day long!</li>
            <li> I wish I could find it in other colors besides the ones that are for specific eyes.  </li>
            <li> They have lasted longer than expected as well.</li>
            <li> This came broken, at first I didn&#x27;t notice, but after 2 uses I tried rolling it up and the makeup broke in half on both sides.</li>
            <li> I tried the other end and it broke also.</li>
            <li> The stick keeps falling out of the holder as I try to apply it, causing smears unless I&#x27;m very careful.</li>
            <li> But if you get the darker color on the applicator of the lighter side, it&#x27;s hard to get off/use properly.</li>
            <li> I use the dark to fill in my brows and just use a brow brush.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re in a hurry in the morning, this product cuts your eye shadow time in half versus powder shadows.  </li>
            <li> Colors not special.</li>
            <li> A little roll in the folds of the eyelids.</li>
            <li> Fatty shadows.</li>
            <li> I just didn&#x27;t like the iridescence of the shadow, and I&#x27;d never use the pale side of the double-sided wand.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to order an untried product online, especially when you can&#x27;t return it after trying it.  </li>
            <li> Too bad; I hate to waste money this way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sad</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the color tones.  </li>
            <li> I am really disappointed with this</li>

            <li> This one wasn&#x27;t that great. The first time I use it , it broke, so I thought it may have been me. I tried the other end and it broke also. I didn&#x27;t like this product at all</li>
            <li> I honestly went online to make this purchase after MUCH research! I am happy to report that I LOVE this makeup!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but not great. It rubs off very easy. It would be great to use in addition to something else.</li>
            <li> The brown is a bit bold but I like being able to &amp;#34;draw&amp;#34; my eye shadow on when in a hurry.  I haven&#x27;t had problems with it crumbling or falling out.  They have lasted longer than expected as well.</li>
            <li> Love these and they arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> I just Loved it. Easy to use and carry for quick makeup application. I got one for.my sister in law too and she loved it too</li>
            <li> This stuff is surprisingly good. This was the first time I used Almay, and dang it works great, it goes on like butter and it last all day long! plus it really brings out your eyes! Great product!</li>
            <li> Why  don&#x27;t they sell this anymore ! Was my go to shadow! Loved the Colors plus it was a really long lasting!</li>
            <li> I love this eye color but I can&#x27;t find it anymore. I&#x27;m very sad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m blonde with bye eyes and do love the ease of this product and its works great with my hair and eye color.  I love it and have stocked up on these.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff a lot. I wish I could find it in other colors besides the ones that are for specific eyes.  Its so easy to put on and stays on and doesn&#x27;t crease, as promised.  It&#x27;s easy to highlight and get accent with just one tool.  LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> glides on easily; shows up well.</li>
            <li> This came broken, at first I didn&#x27;t notice, but after 2 uses I tried rolling it up and the makeup broke in half on both sides. The color payoff isn&#x27;t great, it&#x27;s alright. I suggest using and building the product.</li>
            <li> Fatty shadows. Illyuminayzer gives coolness on the eyelids, but too much yellow. A little roll in the folds of the eyelids.</li>
            <li> Since I can no longer find this in the stores I buy it online. I have sensitive eyes and this is my favorite eyeshadow. I use the dark to fill in my brows and just use a brow brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d pass on this product. I&#x27;m a big fan of eyeshadows, especially ones made for certain eye colors. It does a great job bringing out the blue in my eyes, and the shadow is creamy and goes on smooth. But if you get the darker color on the applicator of the lighter side, it&#x27;s hard to get off/use properly.</li>
            <li> I really only use the gold end, but I LOVE it. I particularly like it on days when I&#x27;m in a hurry and just need a little something. I can put it on lightly, and it looks really nice and subtle. I&#x27;d recommend it for sure.</li>
            <li> If you can find anymore - I&#x27;M INTERESTED - Almay discontinued this line.</li>
            <li> I love Almay, and the color is great, just be weary of putting on a lot of the darker color, its quite dark, especially against my pale skin.</li>
            <li> These sticks are great because you have a color and accent plus you can use easily to line bottom of eyes also. Great for travel because these sticks and primers that go along with them take up less room in the makeup bag than other palette type shadows. I have green eyes, but I bought all of the colors and all of the primers because it is a fun and fast way to mix and match coordinating colors to look your very best.</li>
            <li> I like Almay products, and I trust their purity.  I was disappointed with the color tones.  It&#x27;s difficult to order an untried product online, especially when you can&#x27;t return it after trying it.  I&#x27;m sure many women can relate to this issue.  I just didn&#x27;t like the iridescence of the shadow, and I&#x27;d never use the pale side of the double-sided wand.  Too bad; I hate to waste money this way.</li>
            <li> Almay makes good products and I liked the ease of use with which this product promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eye shadow in each end of the stick goes on really well.  If you&#x27;re in a hurry in the morning, this product cuts your eye shadow time in half versus powder shadows.  Very easy application and the colors are just right -- not too bright, not too dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the color tubes fall out of their holders!  I am really disappointed with this feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, five stars!</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and stays all day. This color is perfect for blue eyes.</li>
            <li> Not only doesn&#x27;t it enhance the color of my eyes, but it&#x27;s a pain to apply.  The stick keeps falling out of the holder as I try to apply it, causing smears unless I&#x27;m very careful.</li>
            <li> Ends broke off after 2nd. use!  Colors not special.</li>
    </ol>
