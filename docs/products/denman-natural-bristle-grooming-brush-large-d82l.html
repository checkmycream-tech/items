    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is an excellent hairbrush.</li>
            <li>One of the best brushes I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>Still going to rate 4-star - &amp;#34;i like it&amp;#34; since it&#x27;s probably the best option out there for quality &amp; price</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>i am so happy now that i have discovered this brush!</li>
            <li>For a fraction of the price you get a great brush with excellent bristles.  </li>
            <li>but now that&#x27;s all ended, my hair is smoothed soooo beautifully, get this you will not regret.</li>
            <li>It is great quality and doesn&#x27;t make my hair staticky.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t expecting the quill pins that stick up out of the brush, although I think they add a great touch.</li>
            <li>When the brush could get through my hair, it felt great.  </li>
            <li>This one is really good and is a great starter  brush.</li>
            <li>Great brush, love it!</li>
            <li>I guess it does a good job of distributing oils, but I wish we&#x27;d gotten one for heavier hair.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t imagine my obsession with hair brushes would end even if I loved this.</li>
            <li>I love this brush!</li>
            <li>Happy that the Denman product is still available, I&#x27;ve been using these brushes for over 50 years.</li>
            <li>Most of my others have the synthetic/plastic bristles, so this was a good change.</li>
            <li>Brush does a nice job on keeping my locks shiny and in place.</li>
            <li>This brush is a nice quality brush but it just polishes the top of my hair</li>
            <li>Just like every good boar bristle brush dot forget to clean it.</li>
            <li>It is very good for smoothing hair when I am wearing an updo, and also helps to spread the natural oils through</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>More information would have helped.</li>
            <li>I think that one would work better as an every day brush.</li>
            <li>and I think i like that one better.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Great product and gentle with my hair.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;that works much better, saving for a Mason Pearson now.</li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>Best purchase made in a long time.</li>
            <li>I have bought over 20 brushes and always have had a brush obsession trying to find the best brush to detangle my very tangly, oily and straight hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well made and cleans easily.</li>
            <li>That is nice for some people but it wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I have several Denman brushes and this one is great.  </li>
            <li>I can buy a cheap Target brush and not have that issue.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE it and HIGHLY RECCOMEND IT!!</li>
            <li>I purchased the large brush also but other than that everything about this brush is perfect!(&#x3D;</li>
            <li>For the price, good solid product.  </li>
            <li>The large was a good choice and my hair has never been healthier with natural bristle mix.</li>
            <li>A very nice gentle brush for long fine  hair.</li>
            <li>Also from the time I took it out of the box and used it the first time, the boar&#x27;s bristles were coming out.  </li>
            <li>it makes combing my hair so much easier!</li>
            <li>I also purchased the Denman Large Bristle Cushion Brush (8 row) for my sister</li>
            <li>I needed a brush that would be gentle on my hair &amp; scalp &amp; not pull or tear my strands.</li>
            <li>This brush does the job very well.</li>
            <li>It smooths my hair without pulling or snagging &amp; is gentle on my edges.</li>
            <li>But I really had to work at it to get it through my hair.  </li>
            <li>The brush feels light, then handle and back made of plastic.</li>
            <li>very well...</li>
            <li>Its too soft to really brush thru my hair.</li>
            <li>but they all damaged my hair too much no matter how gentle, I resorted to brushing and combing my hair in the shower detangling WET hair</li>
            <li>however, i don&#x27;t see much improvement in my hair, &amp; actually start noticing breakage and frizziness at the ends.  </li>
            <li>I use it after I curl my hair to separate the curls without brushing out them out completely.</li>
            <li>Ordered this brush to replace my old brush of 3 years.</li>
            <li>Gave it to my 5 yrar old daughter</li>
            <li>This is a natural bristle brush.</li>
            <li>Way too soft.</li>
            <li>I wish I had gotten the boar and nylon mix brush instead of all natural.</li>
            <li>It massages my scalp and evenly distributes the natural oils on my scalp while beautifuly placing every strand of hair evenly on my head.</li>
            <li>Does Denman really package this product as such?</li>
            <li>because i thought this had been used...ordering directly from amazon now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this is a great brush for fine hair, but it is terrible for thick hair.</li>
            <li>but this one lacks the middle, thick white bristle that mine has~still a nice brush though just doesn&#x27;t work as well without the stiffer middle part.</li>
            <li>the inner clear box that holds the brush in place was cut in half!!!&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>The box was marked, &amp;#34;for fine, thin hair&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I have very thick textured hair that tangles easily</li>
            <li>I had to give them away to two women with fine, thin hair.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> If you are someone like me who has long hair...do not bother even looking at this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush not really knowing if it would be any different from the rest.</li>
            <li> I was seriously thinking of shelling out for a Mason Pearson hair brush but after seeing the similarities between this and an MP, I decided to go with the large Denman.  </li>
            <li> No mention in description that this has NYLON quills in addition to the natural bristles.&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a brush that DOES NOT have anything except natural bristles because the nylon ones break and tear up my poor scalp.  </li>
            <li> The handle is shaped well, just a little to short.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and this brush really does the job of grooming and smoothing my hair.</li>
            <li> When I comb the back of my head, the brush isn&#x27;t hard enough to comb through to my scalp.  </li>
            <li> I had a lot of paddle brushes and wide tooth combs</li>
            <li> Does occasionally give me a little static but not as bad as some other brushes I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> One small drawback is that the handle is almost too short for the size of the brush head.</li>
            <li> My hair is about two inches past my chest and it only takes me about two minutes to brush my hair.</li>
            <li> I like this brush but wish it was a little harder.  </li>
            <li> bag- all for less than the price of one Mason Pearson.</li>
            <li> My hair is very long and thick and this brush doesn&#x27;t brush</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Had to return this to this seller due to fact that there were three weird packing issues that totally stuck out that this wasn&#x27;t new.&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> I have fairly thin, long hair (but it&#x27;s bushy).  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit too small</li>
            <li> This brush is quality made, but I have thick hair and the brush does not penetrate heavy hair.</li>
            <li> Makes all brushes literally pale in comparison!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to explain</li>
            <li> The bristles glide through thick hair without breaking the hair.</li>
            <li> While it doesn&#x27;t get through my hair to the scalp because it&#x27;s so thick, it does what I needed it to.</li>
            <li> again, seriously doubt Denman packages brush like this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have VERY thick hair</li>
            <li> This brush is too expensive (even at $20) to have bristles come out.  </li>
            <li> You have to go for expensive brushes that can reach your scalp.</li>
            <li> but It was to expensive at the time.</li>
            <li> Our hair is very thin, so I thought it would work well for us.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> This is an excellent hairbrush. The bristles glide through thick hair without breaking the hair. One small drawback is that the handle is almost too short for the size of the brush head. An inch added to the handle would correct this problem. The handle is shaped well, just a little to short.</li>
            <li> I have several Denman brushes and this one is great.  Most of my others have the synthetic/plastic bristles, so this was a good change. So far, so good!</li>
            <li> One of the best brushes I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Our hair is very thin, so I thought it would work well for us. However, we do have to pre-brush our hair with another brush and then use this one. I guess it does a good job of distributing oils, but I wish we&#x27;d gotten one for heavier hair.</li>
            <li> For the price, good solid product.  Boar hair brushes tend to be pricey, &amp; don&#x27;t even get me started on Mason Pearson.  however, i don&#x27;t see much improvement in my hair, &amp; actually start noticing breakage and frizziness at the ends.  It may just be the brush separating the strands, that make the damage for visible.  Still going to rate 4-star - &amp;#34;i like it&amp;#34; since it&#x27;s probably the best option out there for quality &amp; price</li>
            <li> I love this brush! I use it after I curl my hair to separate the curls without brushing out them out completely. I bought it because I read it is comparable to the Mason Pearson brush. It is great quality and doesn&#x27;t make my hair staticky.</li>
            <li> Ordered this brush to replace my old brush of 3 years. Its too soft to really brush thru my hair. I have waist length hair and it gets tangled...this brush is no help. Gave it to my 5 yrar old daughter</li>
            <li> Great brush, love it! It my piece of luxury before bed. Wasn&#x27;t expecting the quill pins that stick up out of the brush, although I think they add a great touch. Just think it should b advertised as such.</li>
            <li> This is a natural bristle brush.</li>
            <li> I have very thick textured hair that tangles easily AND I&#x27;m tender-headed. I needed a brush that would be gentle on my hair &amp; scalp &amp; not pull or tear my strands. This brush does the job very well. It smooths my hair without pulling or snagging &amp; is gentle on my edges. While it doesn&#x27;t get through my hair to the scalp because it&#x27;s so thick, it does what I needed it to.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I&#x27;ve only used it twice and I can already see a difference in my hair. My hair is just softer and less frizzy that when I brushed my hair with a normal drugstore brush like Conair. My hair is about two inches past my chest and it only takes me about two minutes to brush my hair. I get all the tangles out and everything. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the handle it&#x27;s a bit too small I purchased the large brush also but other than that everything about this brush is perfect!(&#x3D;</li>
            <li> When the brush could get through my hair, it felt great.  But I really had to work at it to get it through my hair.  I have fairly thin, long hair (but it&#x27;s bushy).  Also from the time I took it out of the box and used it the first time, the boar&#x27;s bristles were coming out.  This brush is too expensive (even at $20) to have bristles come out.  I can buy a cheap Target brush and not have that issue.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Does occasionally give me a little static but not as bad as some other brushes I&#x27;ve owned. It is very good for smoothing hair when I am wearing an updo, and also helps to spread the natural oils through so I don&#x27;t look like a greaseball on days between shampoos.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this is a great brush for fine hair, but it is terrible for thick hair. Way too soft.</li>
            <li> As others have said, it is not as advertised or the one shown in the pictures, it has the longer nylon bristles mixed in.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly. A very nice gentle brush for long fine  hair. Does not break hair or damage scaip. It&#x27;s well made and cleans easily. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Happy that the Denman product is still available, I&#x27;ve been using these brushes for over 50 years. The large was a good choice and my hair has never been healthier with natural bristle mix.</li>

            <li> I have very thick hair and this brush really does the job of grooming and smoothing my hair. Great product!</li>
            <li> For the price and the reviews I thought this would be a Eureka! moment. The brush feels light, then handle and back made of plastic. I have VERY thick hair and it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s brushing through it. I gave it to my kids to play with.</li>
            <li> my wife loves this thing.</li>
            <li> This brush is quality made, but I have thick hair and the brush does not penetrate heavy hair. The box was marked, &amp;#34;for fine, thin hair&amp;#34;. I wish I was informed of this before I purchased two brushes. I had to give them away to two women with fine, thin hair. More information would have helped.</li>
            <li> If you are someone like me who has long hair...do not bother even looking at this product. You have to go for expensive brushes that can reach your scalp.</li>
            <li> This brush works well for detangling and adding extra shine to my hair.  I use it when I get out of the shower, however, I use a different brush for styling.</li>
            <li> I was seriously thinking of shelling out for a Mason Pearson hair brush but after seeing the similarities between this and an MP, I decided to go with the large Denman.  Buy it.  You will not be disappointed.  For a fraction of the price you get a great brush with excellent bristles.  I have one for my vanity, one for my purse, and one for my school bag- all for less than the price of one Mason Pearson.</li>
            <li> I have lots of hair. Brush does a nice job on keeping my locks shiny and in place. About time</li>
            <li> This brush is a nice quality brush but it just polishes the top of my hair it doesn&#x27;t actually untangle it. That is nice for some people but it wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was looking for. I wish I had gotten the boar and nylon mix brush instead of all natural. I think that one would work better as an every day brush.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush not really knowing if it would be any different from the rest. I received it within 4 days and the&lt;br /&gt; minute I used it, I was hooked! It massages my scalp and evenly distributes the natural oils on my scalp while beautifuly placing every strand of hair evenly on my head. I LOVE it and HIGHLY RECCOMEND IT!!</li>
            <li> i dont like it and i have returned it and have not received my credit</li>
            <li> I have bought over 20 brushes and always have had a brush obsession trying to find the best brush to detangle my very tangly, oily and straight hair. I didn&#x27;t imagine my obsession with hair brushes would end even if I loved this. Makes all brushes literally pale in comparison! I had a lot of paddle brushes and wide tooth combs but they all damaged my hair too much no matter how gentle, I resorted to brushing and combing my hair in the shower detangling WET hair but now that&#x27;s all ended, my hair is smoothed soooo beautifully, get this you will not regret. Best purchase made in a long time.</li>
            <li> I like this brush but wish it was a little harder.  When I comb the back of my head, the brush isn&#x27;t hard enough to comb through to my scalp.  I also purchased the Denman Large Bristle Cushion Brush (8 row) for my sister and I think i like that one better.</li>
            <li> Had to return this to this seller due to fact that there were three weird packing issues that totally stuck out that this wasn&#x27;t new.&lt;br /&gt;1. massive taping effort used to seal already opened plastic bag/cover. Does Denman really package this product as such? doubt it&lt;br /&gt;2. the inner clear box that holds the brush in place was cut in half!!!&lt;br /&gt;3. a plastic foam pad was glued to the back of the brush to hold it in place. again, seriously doubt Denman packages brush like this.&lt;br /&gt;returned because i thought this had been used...ordering directly from amazon now.</li>
            <li> I love it. Great product and gentle with my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I was going to get a MP but It was to expensive at the time. This one is really good and is a great starter  brush. Just like every good boar bristle brush dot forget to clean it.</li>
            <li> saved my hair! i am so happy now that i have discovered this brush! it makes combing my hair so much easier!</li>
            <li> My hair is very long and thick and this brush doesn&#x27;t brush&lt;br /&gt;my hair very well...it&#x27;s hard to explain but it just doesn&#x27;t seem&lt;br /&gt;to get tangles out or brush it properly, it doesn&#x27;t work at all&lt;br /&gt;for me and I don&#x27;t use it anymore, I have a cheaper brush&lt;br /&gt;that works much better, saving for a Mason Pearson now.</li>
