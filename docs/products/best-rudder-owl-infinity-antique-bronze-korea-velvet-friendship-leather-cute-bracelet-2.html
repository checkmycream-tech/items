            <li>Other than that its a beautiful bracelet!</li>
            <li>Nice quality, much prettier in person!</li>
            <li>I understand that these are cheap</li>

            <li>Luckily I have pliers and know how to fix it.</li>
            <li>Luckily I know how to repair jewelry.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I ordered!</li>
            <li>worth the wait.</li>
            <li>And the price is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth the price I paid for the item.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>It broke right when I put it on</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cute and everything but super fragile,</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a nice casual bracelet, surprisingly goes with a lot of things.</li>
            <li>m almost on the first clasp</li>
            <li>for the low price it&#x27;s kinda cute</li>
            <li>I thought it came with 2 braclets instead of one, the braclet is still cute enough for my bestfriend.</li>
            <li>It took foreber to get on my mail, and it broke the first day I wore it...</li>
            <li>Broke easily although it was exactly how it looks in the picture,  also it was a bit big for my wrist</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>The bracelet is big and doesn&#x27;t fit anybody and the designs like the ancors, owls, etc.</li>
            <li>The latch broke  all ready</li>
            <li>Thanks anyway</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>Its hard to get on and off but other than that its beautiful!</li>
            <li>Very cute to wear, but I haven&#x27;t worn it out and about yet, could be as fragile as people say in the other reviews but haven&#x27;t seen it yet.</li>
            <li>The bracelet looks really cool, I was expected it to hook together magnetically, but it didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I was surprised when I saw the quality of these bracelets.</li>
            <li>her dad fixed it once</li>
            <li>Cute bracelet, big for my wrist and not easily modified.</li>
            <li>but the picture made the bracelet look so fit and the charms look bigger when in reality it was too big and the charms were super small and not so flashy and cute</li>
            <li>but the second time it broke it could not be fixed.</li>
            <li>Only issue is that it sit crooked on my wrist, so i have to move it back to the center of my wrist pretty often.</li>

            <li> The bracelet looks really cool, I was expected it to hook together magnetically, but it didn&#x27;t and it was really difficult to put on by myself. Also one of the bands broke a week after I got it. Have someone else put it on for you</li>
            <li> It broke right when I put it on and it took over a month to get here but it&#x27;s okay I guess</li>
            <li> people who received as a gift loved the product  and even wished to know where i purchased.....they loved it and they are fantastic</li>
            <li> This is a stunning beautiful piece.  I bought it for my daughter and she loves it!  Nice quality, much prettier in person!</li>
            <li> Should have a picture of the clasp &amp; chain because I thought it was a wrap bracelet &amp; it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It took foreber to get on my mail, and it broke the first day I wore it... it&#x27;s cute and everything but super fragile, I dont I would ever buy another one anymore...</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this was just me but the picture made the bracelet look so fit and the charms look bigger when in reality it was too big and the charms were super small and not so flashy and cute like I expected</li>
            <li> my friend loved her belated christmass gift.  It came in perfect shape. Thank you so much. I lookfoward to buying others in the future.</li>
