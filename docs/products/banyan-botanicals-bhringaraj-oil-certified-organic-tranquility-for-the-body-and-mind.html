            <li>I may have to compromise and go back to using the more smelly oils.  </li>
            <li>Not only is it greasy, but it smells mostly like sesame seed oil, which has me wondering if that&#x27;s the main ingredient rather than the bhringaraj.  </li>

            <li> and another long list of ingredients</li>
            <li> Knowing that I&#x27;m super sensitive and it takes weeks for my body to react badly to a product, I&#x27;ll probably just stay away from this oil from now on.</li>
            <li> You know, those little short hairs that show up in the basin?  </li>
            <li> I carefully read all of the Amazon reviews because I wanted to get a non-smelling Bringaraj oil.  </li>
            <li> It seems that as long as i used the Hesh oils, i was not attaining my goals, and after quite a few bottles (and in about 6 months to a year) started experiencing breakage.  </li>
            <li> 4 other oils  (including Vegetable and Mineral oil) -</li>
            <li> The smell is not ovehelming like other indian oils.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t notice any difference in my hair other than it smells like my hands after eating a greasy pizza.</li>
            <li> It takes away all kinks due to its moisturizing properties.</li>
            <li> I have tried Vatika and other Ayurveda oils.</li>
            <li> This product provided the results I was trying to achieve with those other products.</li>
            <li> I was excited about this oil for growth, but my scalp itches like mad when I massage it in.  </li>
            <li> Not worth</li>
            <li> This is a watered down \\&quot;American\\</li>
            <li> or it will run down all day.  </li>
            <li> It has become thicker and less gray in some areas.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to admit it was the Hesh oils because i had stock piled quite a few bottles of this stuff.    </li>
            <li> oil damaged my hair, and dried out my scalp.  </li>
            <li> It turned the shampoo a green tint</li>
            <li> year, I used the product daily after a lost several inches due to a bad cut.</li>
            <li> I have used Hesh&#x27;s Bhringaraj oil in the past, with little or no issues.</li>
            <li> Based on the confused feed back it grows hair, but yet it does not, a real bizzarre review it sounds like someone is confused and has no problem confusing every one else.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!  </li>
            <li> The scary part is that the left side of my scalp literally began moving in a rolling motion, by itself, almost like a muscle contraction.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the concentration varies from batch to batch</li>
            <li> Usually Bhringraj oil should be greenish in color because of the herbal infusion.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately does not work compared to other Bhringraj oils.  </li>
            <li> I have never tried this product but, based on the stupidity that this reviewer decided to give, I probably would not try it, then on the other hand if I was as coffused as this reviewer I might.</li>
            <li> I have a poor sense of smell and even I can smell its sesame seed.  </li>
            <li> One other thing i like about this oil is that it doesn&#x27;t leave any bad smell.</li>
            <li> Anyways, sorry for the ranting</li>
            <li> Sorry Banyan.</li>
            <li> The oil should be \\&quot;made in India\\&quot; to use the correct base oil and herbs.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is one oil that i am really comfortable incorporating into my hair regimen. I was using Hesh Brahmi amla and shikaiki oils, but really didn&#x27;t seem to attain much growth. there are reviews that claim that it makes their hair grow, more powere to them.    But when someone posted about the mineral oil, i really started doing my research. It seems that as long as i used the Hesh oils, i was not attaining my goals, and after quite a few bottles (and in about 6 months to a year) started experiencing breakage.  You know, those little short hairs that show up in the basin?  Or on your light colored clothes? That&#x27;s breakage. Not a hair phase.  I didn&#x27;t want to admit it was the Hesh oils because i had stock piled quite a few bottles of this stuff.    I changed my regimen, and began weaning away from the Hesh Oils. I started using the Bhringarj oil and pills, noticed a difference right away.  My scalp tingles most of the time, my hair is healthier - not greasier, and i am finally attaining my hair goal.    If you look at the ingredients on the hesh oils brahmi and shikaki, you&#x27;ll notice this long list. 4 other oils  (including Vegetable and Mineral oil) - before you even see the word \\&quot;Brahma\\&quot;  and another long list of ingredients before you see \\&quot;Amli\\&quot;...    But if when i looked at the Bhringaraj bottle there were only two: Sesame Oil and Bhringaraj* (*certified organic)</li>
            <li> I carefully read all of the Amazon reviews because I wanted to get a non-smelling Bringaraj oil.  Vadik&#x27;s version has a very strong and overpowering smell but it works as in it grows your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil damaged my hair, and dried out my scalp.  It does have a very minimal smell that quickly goes away but the product doesn&#x27;t work.  Its back to Vadik which smells strong but at least I have a head full of healthy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful of the hype I found it to be completely untrue.</li>
            <li> Amazing oil.The smell is not ovehelming like other indian oils.It has no added fragrance.It keeps my hair soft shiny and moisturised.My hair is also strong and healthy and growing.I wish they sold it in a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> Based on the confused feed back it grows hair, but yet it does not, a real bizzarre review it sounds like someone is confused and has no problem confusing every one else. I have never tried this product but, based on the stupidity that this reviewer decided to give, I probably would not try it, then on the other hand if I was as coffused as this reviewer I might. Bottom line does it work or does it not work.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this oil at all.  Not only is it greasy, but it smells mostly like sesame seed oil, which has me wondering if that&#x27;s the main ingredient rather than the bhringaraj.  I also don&#x27;t notice any difference in my hair other than it smells like my hands after eating a greasy pizza.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!  I truly believe this product is probably 90% sesame oil and only 10% Bhringaraj Oil.  The real Bhringaraj oil has a very strong scent and the fact that the smell is not that bad, is an indication that you aren&#x27;t getting the real thing.  If you want Bhringaraj Oil, get the product that is made from India.  It costs more but you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> I use this oil after I do tea rinses with my amla and shikakai. It leaves the scalp feeling cool, and it does relax me.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Banyan Botanicals Bhringaraj Oil after reading reviews on this site. I have used Hesh&#x27;s Bhringaraj oil in the past, with little or no issues. But my experience with Banyan has been different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year, I used the product daily after a lost several inches due to a bad cut. I began to have headaches, on ocassion. At first, I didn&#x27;t connect it with the oil. This oil doesn&#x27;t have the strong, overpowering scent of other oils. My hair literally thickened and grew faster. It&#x27;s going to take a good while to regain my length, but I got an additional 1 1/2 inches over my normal growth (over a two month period).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I noticed that my eyes were turning red every time I used the oil. Yesterday, I decided to use the oil to the left side of my scalp to see its reaction. My scalp literally began tingling/burning (not in a good way). The scary part is that the left side of my scalp literally began moving in a rolling motion, by itself, almost like a muscle contraction. It took about fifteen minutes for the motion to stop. I got a headache, and washed the stuff out. Knowing that I&#x27;m super sensitive and it takes weeks for my body to react badly to a product, I&#x27;ll probably just stay away from this oil from now on. However, it did produce an additional inch and a half over my normal growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product works...I&#x27;m not sure if the concentration varies from batch to batch (I think that my oil had a heavier concentration), because I never had a problem with the Hesh oil, but have vowed to stay away from bhringaraj oil from now on, out of caution.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil and started using it to help grow my hair. I am from India and I know what \\&quot;real\\&quot; hair oil should be. This is a watered down \\&quot;American\\&quot; version of a traditional Indian hair oil. The oil should be \\&quot;made in India\\&quot; to use the correct base oil and herbs. I called the company up and after the representative sound nervous by me asking questions, she told me the oil is made in the USA !! What a joke! If I want something Indian, I want it made in India! Is that asking a lot? I don&#x27;t want a Toyota car that is \\&quot;made in America\\&quot;. Anyways, sorry for the ranting but the oil doesn&#x27;t work and is a real \\&quot;fake\\&quot;. Sorry Banyan. I have read good reviews on Vadik Herbs and other brands so I&#x27;ll check them out and let you all know...</li>
            <li> I have been gradually losing hair in last 5 years.  I wasn&#x27;t using any hair oil or gel. One of my friends suggested that i should look into Bhringaraj Oil for hair falling and hair weakness.  I have been using this product for almost a year now and notice stronger hair.  This however doesn&#x27;t do any miracle and grow new hair, but it does help with strengthening existing hair. One other thing i like about this oil is that it doesn&#x27;t leave any bad smell.</li>
            <li> [...]  The Products does what it says. Just be careful not to put too much or it will run down all day.  Still it is very good for massaging your scalp and can be used in a bath for moisturizing your skin.  Thank You Seller!</li>
            <li> So far I honestly believe incorporating this oil into my haircare regimen has promoted my hair growth</li>
            <li> It is part of my hair care regimen. It works. I bought larger size (36oz) directly from the company. I am going to buy a gallon so that I won&amp;#34;t have worry in a year or so. I will always use it; I will never stop.</li>
            <li> This oil has made my hair shiny and healthy immediately with the first use. I have been using it for about a week, and my hair has stayed healthy and shiny. It takes away all kinks due to its moisturizing properties. I love this product, and in my personal opinion this is the best oil for my hair. I have tried Vatika and other Ayurveda oils. I have also tried Moroccan oil and Argan oil. This product provided the results I was trying to achieve with those other products. I will keep using it, and firmly believe that it provides the right environment for my hair to thrive in and will promote growth. My hair grows really slow naturally, but with this oil, I just know it will grow out much quicker.</li>
            <li> I did a google search and found this to be the cheapest and..it was organic! you can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRUDUCT.This vendor very unrelable you put order in .They charge you but you never recive your stuff.If you don&#x27;t investigate they never respone to you.If you want to get robe go for it</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I do not think this oil has enough Bhringraj.  Usually Bhringraj oil should be greenish in color because of the herbal infusion.  I have used other Bhringraj oils before and they worked great for reducing hair loss.  I had to stop using other oils usually because they have added fragrances that are pretty strong.  This oil has no smell and washes out great but unfortunately does not work compared to other Bhringraj oils.  I may have to compromise and go back to using the more smelly oils.  &amp;#60;&amp;#60;Sigh&amp;#62;&amp;#62; The price to pay for fabulous hair!</li>
            <li> I did something kind of interesting with the oil - I added it to my shampoo so that every day I wash my hair, the oil smell isn&#x27;t even something I worry about. It turned the shampoo a green tint but it works. One of the girls I work with just mentioned how long my hair is getting, and I&#x27;ve only bee using it for 3 weeks. It dried out my hair a little bit but just throwing conditioner over it worked perfectly and my hair is soft, strong and long. :) I like it.</li>
            <li> This product is a very natural one and really works. I am using this more than a month now, and I see the results</li>
            <li> I was excited about this oil for growth, but my scalp itches like mad when I massage it in.  My ex husband is from India, and he uses it, but it&#x27;s not for me. My hair is what they call 3C, I am AA and Puerto Rican mix, if that helps or matters.</li>
            <li> Helps combat gray hair, thickens and darkens hair. WORKS! Of course, being natural, you don&#x27;t expect results like commercial, chemical preparations...but given time, and patience - WOW what a difference. I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> really not seen much difference...</li>
            <li> I have a poor sense of smell and even I can smell its sesame seed.  I have tried using it several times, leaving it in overnight.  It does nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li> It seems to reverse hair loss, and I have found virtually no downside to this product. I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else.</li>
            <li> It is mostly just sesame oil. The bhringraj level is very low. Not worth buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bhringraj oil should have a dark green color to it, this has a brown color which shows it is mostly sesame oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy the mahabhringraj brand instead, its better.</li>
            <li> I noticed right away that my hair looked/felt healthier.  It has become thicker and less gray in some areas.  I just recommended it to a friend who was complaining about graying and having split ends.  She likes what it&#x27;s doing to her hair too.  We both use a cream to cover the smell.  It&#x27;s a different smell, but not really bad...we&#x27;re just not use to it.  Still, I am recommending it to friends.</li>
