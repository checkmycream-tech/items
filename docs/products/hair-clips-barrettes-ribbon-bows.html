            <li> They are too small for my 3-year old daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> These clips actually stay put, and do not pull or break her delicate hair.  </li>
            <li> I’ve tried putting clips in my little one’s hair before, but she always got fussy when I did so.</li>
            <li> Bows are heavy with thick ribbon that isn&#x27;t adhered tightly as a bow or to the clip.</li>

            <li> I have made this mistake in the past when ordering on Amazon.</li>
            <li> For a toddler who enjoys pulling out of hair, not a great idea to have the teeth rip her hair.</li>

            <li> These are so cute an unique. My 4 month old doesn&#x27;t have much here and these stay put.</li>
            <li> Love it for my 1 year old who does not have to much hair!</li>
            <li> These are adorable and do not hurt baby&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> I am surprised at all the great reviews here..which is why I purchased these bows. Bows are heavy with thick ribbon that isn&#x27;t adhered tightly as a bow or to the clip. The plastic flower and candy clip look so cheap. One of the clips has ribbon which reads &amp;#34;Happy Mothers Day&amp;#34; - huh?! Returning! At more than $1 per clip not worth keeping.</li>
            <li> Very cute hair clips.</li>
            <li> They look so cute and are of such good quality. The edges are also not sharp so you can safely use them on your infants head. Love them!</li>
            <li> Super cute barrettes!</li>
            <li> The barrettes do not slip at all but what I love that I don&#x27;t have to pull my granddaughter&#x27;s hair so tightly for the barette to stay put.  Wish I would have had these for my own daughter!</li>
            <li> Very nice barretts to help hold back my granddaughter&#x27;s hair and look cute.</li>
            <li> my 2 year old grand daughter has very fine hair.  These clips actually stay put, and do not pull or break her delicate hair.  I bought a second set!</li>
            <li> Very pretty, durable and not so easy to pull out for my baby. Safe to use of soft baby hair too. Would&#x27;ve loved if there were lot more colors instead of combinations of pink, green, yellow and orange.</li>
            <li> Love em! Made a great gift for a new little princess.</li>
            <li> My niece looks adorable in these. The variety is great. She&#x27;s 1 year old and they seemed to stay in her wispy hair.</li>

            <li> The clips have teeth that is not fully covered by ribbon. The ribbon ends up sitting between the teeth. For a toddler who enjoys pulling out of hair, not a great idea to have the teeth rip her hair.</li>
            <li> Beautiful hair clips.</li>
            <li> These clips are just darling! I’ve tried putting clips in my little one’s hair before, but she always got fussy when I did so. I later found out that the clips were scratching her scalp a little and making her uncomfortable. I’m really glad I found these. Because they’re all wrapped up, I don’t have to worry about them hurting her scalp. And I love all of the designs. There’s one to match every outfit :D And with this awesome price, I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1VWYK99KC2COM]]My granddaughter loves these Hair Clips.  Great selection, very nice quality!</li>
            <li> I had been looking for baby hair clips (without any metal exposed) that would be gentle on the baby&#x27;s head scalp. These are just perfect since the metal part of the clips are fully covered! The designs are also super cute! Coming in 12-pack makes it even better. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> These are really cute, but just beware they&#x27;re TINY. They stick well in my toddler&#x27;s fine hair (when she&#x27;s not ripping them out).</li>
            <li> Please note that these barrettes are TINY! I have made this mistake in the past when ordering on Amazon. They are too small for my 3-year old daughter&#x27;s hair. They are cute and well-made, so I kept them to use with her dolls. They are perfect for dolls and real babies, but not toddlers.</li>
            <li> Love these clips! My daughter has a lot of hair but hates headbands and snap clips. These clamp clips allow me to put them in and take them out of her hair without fuss.</li>
