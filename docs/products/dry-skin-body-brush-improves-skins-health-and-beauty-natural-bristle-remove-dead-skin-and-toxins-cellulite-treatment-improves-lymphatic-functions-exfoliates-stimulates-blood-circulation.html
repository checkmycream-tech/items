            <li>way.&lt;br /&gt;It came with a nice case, instructions and a hanger</li>

            <li>A nice scrub brush.</li>
            <li>For me, it works effectively at making skin feel and appear smoother.  </li>
            <li>Great price, worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried exfoliating before but this is by far the best results I&#x27;ve ever got.</li>

            <li>High quality, great body brush</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful Dry body brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with my dry skin brush.</li>
            <li>My skins feels invigorated, the lotion I use after absorbs more easily into my skin.</li>
            <li>You will see best results if your skin is completely dry when using it - and then shower afterwards.</li>
            <li>I love the pouch and the self-adhesive pad they include for easy storage.</li>
            <li>Great brush, leaves my skin soft with a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>The brush stimulates the skin but is not too rough so that makes it perfect.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li>It is easy to handle.</li>
            <li>the brush size and strap as it makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li>it falls off of my hand easily.  </li>
            <li>This brush is quite easy to control and is kept in place with a strap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Awesome product, soft bristles that are super effective in dry brushing and comes with nice travel case.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with this brush and am enjoying dry brushing my skin.</li>
            <li>I use it every other night to encourage healthy and beautiful skin.</li>
            <li>The reviews that I read were accurate about the brush not hurting.</li>
            <li>The strap doesn&#x27;t really fit my hand.</li>
            <li>I am really happy with this purchase, though I was expecting the brush to be bigger.</li>
            <li>I love the feeliing of a good dry body brush.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, had great instructions on proper use of brush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased two of these the first time around.</li>
            <li>She loves it and says it&#x27;s great for dry skin cleaning.</li>
            <li>I think it is a great size, bristles are great, the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because even though the strap on the back is helpful, I really wish the strap was adjustable.  </li>
            <li>Dry skin brushing is very popular these days as a detox method,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very exhilarating as well as it exfoliates dead skin</li>
            <li>I loved my dry skin body brush, it has the right softness and stiffness to brush my skin in a healthy</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about the health claims, but the skin care claim seems to be true.</li>
            <li>It definitely doesn&#x27;t feel good</li>
            <li>Feels so good on my skin just like the back scrubber.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Many years ago, an older gentleman came up to me and showed me how he combed his skin with a comb to remove impurities.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Love it so far!  </li>
            <li>This brush is not the worth the price I payed for it.</li>
            <li>The emails that I received from the seller were professional and infused with their passion for the product which is a great personal touch.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Really good quality and not too rough on the skin.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery - product exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>The strength of the bristles is just right.</li>
            <li>It is also the right size for my hand which is a medium size.</li>
            <li>Bristles are just the right strength to work but not be too abrasive.  </li>
            <li>The brush can be used by both the right- and left-handed person.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s canvas, and very large, so</li>
            <li>The brush is small, compact bristles, great quality.  </li>
            <li>I ordered my first dry skin body brush and loved it so much that I ordered the traveler brush as well.  </li>
            <li>I thought the price was very reasonable for the quality of the product.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought many dry brushes, this one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>Admittedly I have longer hands than most women so for the average women the brush should be fine.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft yet firm, and my skin feels so smooth after a good brushing.</li>
            <li>I love how it feels on my skin especially on my legs.</li>
            <li>Felt a difference the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a difference after the first couple uses.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>However, the first time I used it the bristles were already falling off.</li>
            <li>My first one and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fist pretty well on my hand</li>
            <li>After the first use my itchiness went away.</li>
            <li>This product looks and feels exactly as it is described.</li>
            <li>My skin feels much smoother!</li>
            <li>The only thing that would make it better, is to purchase two (one for each hand) and to have someone do the brushing for you.</li>
            <li>I always thought if I scrubbed my arms and legs good while showering I would remove the dried skin, but I would still have the dryness.</li>
            <li>but these are darn good brushes for removing dead skin.  </li>
            <li>and I would definitely recommend this brush to anyone looking for a great body dry brush.  </li>
            <li>I have followed the instructions, first using light brush strokes and putting a little more pressure as time goes on.</li>
            <li>This is a great brush- Not too stiff, not too soft.  </li>
            <li>were over $15 more and not nearly as sturdy as this brush.  </li>
            <li>Size is too small ... is good for face</li>
            <li>Dry body brushing has so many benefits.</li>
            <li>I love this dry skin brush.</li>
            <li>You can really feel the blood flowing while you use this thing</li>
            <li>I really appreciate when I get an email from the seller asking if everything was to my liking.</li>
            <li>My skin is so much smoother and softer.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>Large-handed people will figure out soon enough how to get a comfortable grip on the brush.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Have done wonders for my skin along with all natural oils with essential oils :-)</li>
            <li>This is a high quality brush--and the perfect bristle strength for dry brushing...not too firm and not too soft.</li>
            <li>Nice stiff bristles, not too much though for your skin.</li>
            <li>My preference would be to simply store it in the carrying pouch and tuck it away, but the brush is attractive enough to leave on a counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The long body brushes are also available, particularly if you want to get at spots on your back, as well as the contoured.  </li>
            <li>My skins feels great after only a few days of use!</li>
            <li>This is a great dry brush for those looking for firm bristles.</li>
            <li>The bristles are pretty soft and were not bent to either side.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy the dry skin brush.</li>
            <li>I actually look forward to using it prior to showering and feel like it helps my skin absorb lotion much better.  </li>
            <li>My only critique is I hoped it would be a more coarse brush</li>
            <li>Now that I am the older lady</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using this brush.</li>
            <li>High recommended.</li>
            <li>HIghly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Comes in a cute little pouch.</li>
            <li>Oh, I also love that it comes with a little baggy/case and a hook to hang it.</li>
            <li>Love the brush - use it for a few times, and your skin will thank you for it.  </li>
            <li>This brush really works to remove dry dead skin and leave my skin soft and bright looking.</li>
            <li>This lovely hand-held contour brush to buff and exfoliate your dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Arrived on time brand new.</li>
            <li>I love this little brush!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I love yet, because I bought it to improve the appearance of my cellulite.</li>
            <li>You need a helper for your back;)</li>
            <li>It made my skin so soft!</li>
            <li>it came very quickly as promised and included a little pouch to put the brush in and a hook to hang it up with.</li>
            <li>I think I have pretty normal sized hands for a woman, but the strap is really loose.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle enough that I don&#x27;t feel like I am scraping my skin off, but you will feel it!</li>
            <li>Soft sturdy brushes.</li>
            <li>soft bristle brush but not too soft that it won&#x27;t exfoliate well</li>
            <li>I also appreciated that the company took the time to email instructions on how to use it to you, its also included on a card with the brush, which appears to be solidly built.  </li>
            <li>I feel cleaner and have had no trouble adjusting to the bristles.</li>
            <li>So far I like it, as I understand it takes time to work.</li>
            <li>thing that is recommended is that one use a natural bristle brush,</li>
            <li>/&gt;►  Natural Bristle&lt;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay but not quite stiff enough for legs.</li>
            <li>First experience with dry brushing.</li>
            <li>Had I had the chance to sample this product it would not have been my first choice for a dry skin brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too stiff, just right!</li>
            <li>When I need a new one, I plan to buy this same brush again.  </li>
            <li>It is stiff, but it is not painful.</li>
            <li>Dry Skin brushing really works.</li>
            <li>my skin is baby soft after daily use.</li>
            <li>I also had soft swelling above breast bone which has vanished.</li>
            <li>There are several tutorials on YouTube for those who are interested in the benefits and “how-tos” of proper dry skin brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how closely it was related, but I read some more information about dry brushing, and you really need to shower afterward to get rid of the dead skin and toxins.  </li>
            <li>I just started a few days ago, so I&#x27;m not seeing the health benefits of body brushing yet, but I&#x27;m willing to give it a shot.</li>
            <li>The bristles are nice and soft but stiff enough to get the job done without irritating the skin.</li>
            <li>I appreciated this as I had not used a body brush in this manner previously.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 67 and have developed dry, bumpy skin on my forearms.</li>
            <li>Only negative is that I have a small hand, so it would be nice if the strap was adjustable.</li>
            <li>Out is soft enough for his face, yet gets all the loose hair and dust off.</li>

            <li> It is a nice brush to use and feels as if you have woken up your skin without hurting it.</li>

            <li> Nice to have the hook too.</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> way.&lt;br /&gt;It came with a nice case, instructions and a hanger</li>

            <li> It fits my hand nicely.</li>
            <li> A nice scrub brush.</li>
            <li> For me, it works effectively at making skin feel and appear smoother.  </li>
            <li> Great price, worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried exfoliating before but this is by far the best results I&#x27;ve ever got.</li>
            <li> Great Brush, the bristles are just the right touch.</li>
            <li> The strap makes it easy to stay on the hand!</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s quite nice to clean your skin with.</li>
            <li> High quality, great body brush</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful Dry body brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my dry skin brush.</li>
            <li> My skins feels invigorated, the lotion I use after absorbs more easily into my skin.</li>
            <li> You will see best results if your skin is completely dry when using it - and then shower afterwards.</li>
            <li> I love the pouch and the self-adhesive pad they include for easy storage.</li>
            <li> Great brush, leaves my skin soft with a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> The brush stimulates the skin but is not too rough so that makes it perfect.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li> It is easy to handle.</li>
            <li> the brush size and strap as it makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li> it falls off of my hand easily.  </li>
            <li> This brush is quite easy to control and is kept in place with a strap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Awesome product, soft bristles that are super effective in dry brushing and comes with nice travel case.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this brush and am enjoying dry brushing my skin.</li>
            <li> I use it every other night to encourage healthy and beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> The reviews that I read were accurate about the brush not hurting.</li>
            <li> The strap doesn&#x27;t really fit my hand.</li>
            <li> I am really happy with this purchase, though I was expecting the brush to be bigger.</li>
            <li> I love the feeliing of a good dry body brush.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, had great instructions on proper use of brush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased two of these the first time around.</li>
            <li> She loves it and says it&#x27;s great for dry skin cleaning.</li>
            <li> I think it is a great size, bristles are great, the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because even though the strap on the back is helpful, I really wish the strap was adjustable.  </li>
            <li> Dry skin brushing is very popular these days as a detox method,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very exhilarating as well as it exfoliates dead skin</li>
            <li> I loved my dry skin body brush, it has the right softness and stiffness to brush my skin in a healthy</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about the health claims, but the skin care claim seems to be true.</li>
            <li> It definitely doesn&#x27;t feel good</li>
            <li> Feels so good on my skin just like the back scrubber.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Many years ago, an older gentleman came up to me and showed me how he combed his skin with a comb to remove impurities.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Love it so far!  </li>
            <li> This brush is not the worth the price I payed for it.</li>
            <li> The emails that I received from the seller were professional and infused with their passion for the product which is a great personal touch.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Really good quality and not too rough on the skin.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery - product exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> The strength of the bristles is just right.</li>
            <li> It is also the right size for my hand which is a medium size.</li>
            <li> Bristles are just the right strength to work but not be too abrasive.  </li>
            <li> The brush can be used by both the right- and left-handed person.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s canvas, and very large, so</li>
            <li> The brush is small, compact bristles, great quality.  </li>
            <li> I ordered my first dry skin body brush and loved it so much that I ordered the traveler brush as well.  </li>
            <li> I thought the price was very reasonable for the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought many dry brushes, this one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> Admittedly I have longer hands than most women so for the average women the brush should be fine.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft yet firm, and my skin feels so smooth after a good brushing.</li>
            <li> I love how it feels on my skin especially on my legs.</li>
            <li> Felt a difference the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a difference after the first couple uses.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> However, the first time I used it the bristles were already falling off.</li>
            <li> My first one and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fist pretty well on my hand</li>
            <li> After the first use my itchiness went away.</li>
            <li> This product looks and feels exactly as it is described.</li>
            <li> My skin feels much smoother!</li>
            <li> The only thing that would make it better, is to purchase two (one for each hand) and to have someone do the brushing for you.</li>
            <li> I always thought if I scrubbed my arms and legs good while showering I would remove the dried skin, but I would still have the dryness.</li>
            <li> but these are darn good brushes for removing dead skin.  </li>
            <li> and I would definitely recommend this brush to anyone looking for a great body dry brush.  </li>
            <li> I have followed the instructions, first using light brush strokes and putting a little more pressure as time goes on.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush- Not too stiff, not too soft.  </li>
            <li> were over $15 more and not nearly as sturdy as this brush.  </li>
            <li> Size is too small ... is good for face</li>
            <li> Dry body brushing has so many benefits.</li>
            <li> I love this dry skin brush.</li>
            <li> You can really feel the blood flowing while you use this thing</li>
            <li> I really appreciate when I get an email from the seller asking if everything was to my liking.</li>
            <li> My skin is so much smoother and softer.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> Large-handed people will figure out soon enough how to get a comfortable grip on the brush.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Have done wonders for my skin along with all natural oils with essential oils :-)</li>
            <li> This is a high quality brush--and the perfect bristle strength for dry brushing...not too firm and not too soft.</li>
            <li> Nice stiff bristles, not too much though for your skin.</li>
            <li> My preference would be to simply store it in the carrying pouch and tuck it away, but the brush is attractive enough to leave on a counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The long body brushes are also available, particularly if you want to get at spots on your back, as well as the contoured.  </li>
            <li> My skins feels great after only a few days of use!</li>
            <li> This is a great dry brush for those looking for firm bristles.</li>
            <li> The bristles are pretty soft and were not bent to either side.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy the dry skin brush.</li>
            <li> I actually look forward to using it prior to showering and feel like it helps my skin absorb lotion much better.  </li>
            <li> My only critique is I hoped it would be a more coarse brush</li>
            <li> Now that I am the older lady</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using this brush.</li>
            <li> High recommended.</li>
            <li> HIghly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Comes in a cute little pouch.</li>
            <li> Oh, I also love that it comes with a little baggy/case and a hook to hang it.</li>
            <li> Love the brush - use it for a few times, and your skin will thank you for it.  </li>
            <li> This brush really works to remove dry dead skin and leave my skin soft and bright looking.</li>
            <li> This lovely hand-held contour brush to buff and exfoliate your dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Arrived on time brand new.</li>
            <li> I love this little brush!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I love yet, because I bought it to improve the appearance of my cellulite.</li>
            <li> You need a helper for your back;)</li>
            <li> It made my skin so soft!</li>
            <li> it came very quickly as promised and included a little pouch to put the brush in and a hook to hang it up with.</li>
            <li> I think I have pretty normal sized hands for a woman, but the strap is really loose.  </li>
            <li> It is gentle enough that I don&#x27;t feel like I am scraping my skin off, but you will feel it!</li>
            <li> Soft sturdy brushes.</li>
            <li> soft bristle brush but not too soft that it won&#x27;t exfoliate well</li>
            <li> I also appreciated that the company took the time to email instructions on how to use it to you, its also included on a card with the brush, which appears to be solidly built.  </li>
            <li> I feel cleaner and have had no trouble adjusting to the bristles.</li>
            <li> So far I like it, as I understand it takes time to work.</li>
            <li> thing that is recommended is that one use a natural bristle brush,</li>
            <li> /&gt;►  Natural Bristle&lt;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay but not quite stiff enough for legs.</li>
            <li> First experience with dry brushing.</li>
            <li> Had I had the chance to sample this product it would not have been my first choice for a dry skin brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too stiff, just right!</li>
            <li> When I need a new one, I plan to buy this same brush again.  </li>
            <li> It is stiff, but it is not painful.</li>
            <li> Dry Skin brushing really works.</li>
            <li> my skin is baby soft after daily use.</li>
            <li> I also had soft swelling above breast bone which has vanished.</li>
            <li> There are several tutorials on YouTube for those who are interested in the benefits and “how-tos” of proper dry skin brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how closely it was related, but I read some more information about dry brushing, and you really need to shower afterward to get rid of the dead skin and toxins.  </li>
            <li> I just started a few days ago, so I&#x27;m not seeing the health benefits of body brushing yet, but I&#x27;m willing to give it a shot.</li>
            <li> The bristles are nice and soft but stiff enough to get the job done without irritating the skin.</li>
            <li> I appreciated this as I had not used a body brush in this manner previously.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 67 and have developed dry, bumpy skin on my forearms.</li>
            <li> Only negative is that I have a small hand, so it would be nice if the strap was adjustable.</li>
            <li> Out is soft enough for his face, yet gets all the loose hair and dust off.</li>
            <li> No other changes, just the addition of dry brushing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The natural bristle brush is neither too soft nor too hard.  </li>
            <li> It makes a big difference brushing the skin dry and then showering.</li>
            <li> After a week or so of daily dry brushing, the skin on my arms has become smoother.</li>
            <li> I actually like the feel of dry brushing or buffing my skin and could get used to it.  </li>
            <li> Feels a little stiff at first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been hearing about the benefits of dry brushing and wanted to try it.</li>
            <li> Brush is supposed to be used dry before you get in the shower.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush for dry brushing to help with cellulite and circulation.  </li>
            <li> I used to work in a luxury bath product store and the dry brushes sold there</li>
            <li> Also purchased one for my father, who has terribly dry skin all over his body.  </li>
            <li> I use it for dry skin brushing.</li>
            <li> I started dry skin brushing from 6 months</li>
            <li> so she could begin dry brushing.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dry skin, and this brush still works for me.</li>
            <li> and I came across your ad for a dry skin body brush, I remembered what he had told me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started dry brushing, but I think my skin is already getting smoother.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this brush a few times since receiving it only a week ago.</li>
            <li> A balm for dry skin!  </li>
            <li> I had previously purchased a brush and the bristles could only be used one way</li>
            <li> Everyone should read about the health benefits due to dry brushing.</li>
            <li> The bristles are coarse but not too harsh.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are not too rough.</li>
            <li> The brush arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> I have very hard water where I live</li>
            <li> Also, the company was EXTREMELY helpful in sending me instructions once the brush has shipped.  </li>
            <li> problem I have with it and the reason I gave it only 4 stars, is that it&#x27;s a bit small.</li>
            <li> We followed brushing directions, (novel thought) and this time noticed almost immediate improvement in his always rough, irritated, red-headed skin!  </li>
            <li> The bristles are 5/8” long, firm, but not stiff enough to be uncomfortable when I use the brush.  </li>
            <li> Dry brushing your skin is supposed to help with lymph drainage as well as exfoliate dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> The 1/2” braided, knotted loop is thick and not likely to snap.  </li>
            <li> I had another brush that was too soft for difficult rough patches</li>
            <li> ,  less winter itchy feeling.  </li>
            <li> It came with a little hanging bag and a sticky hook for the bathroom wall.</li>
            <li> I tried dry brushing a few years ago, didn&#x27;t get a real bristle brush, was uncomfortable and gave it up as unnecessary beauty routine..</li>
            <li> My skin changes less dramatic, with just a smoother overall</li>
            <li> This brush is a complete game changer!</li>
            <li> My cellulite has decreased in appearance after only one week of use.  </li>
            <li> Use it everyday.</li>
            <li> If anything, it gets the dead skin off.</li>
            <li> This brush is a little hard/ stiff for my skin.</li>
            <li> I think in just a short time, if they continue falling off I will have to get a new brush.. :(</li>
            <li> Not to stiff as some brushes are.</li>
            <li> The bristles are not so stiff that it&#x27;s painful, it&#x27;s very invigorating!</li>
            <li> No notable change yet.</li>
            <li> The use is supposed to be invigorating and that it is, depending on how hard you brush.  </li>
            <li> Again very small bush.</li>
            <li> Aside from the product, I did have some weird sore throat issues when I was brushing in the morning, with no shower.  </li>
            <li> and if you went &amp;#34;against the grain&amp;#34; it was painful.  </li>
            <li> It is almost painful.</li>
            <li> I hate it</li>
            <li> Very painful to use...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased two of these the first time around. Great to use on itchy skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I love yet, because I bought it to improve the appearance of my cellulite. No notable change yet. but no damage either.</li>
            <li> Great brush, perfect size for home and travel. The bristles are soft yet firm, and my skin feels so smooth after a good brushing. Now I need to find one that can reach my back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been hearing about the benefits of dry brushing and wanted to try it. The reviews for this brush helped me feel confident ordering it. I&#x27;m happy with this brush and am enjoying dry brushing my skin.</li>
            <li> Nice bristles, fits in my palm for easy brushing, feels great, nice pouch to store with hook to hang if desired. Most importantly, sellers who want you happy!  I would buy again, and recommend to anyone for legs and arms. You need a helper for your back;)</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product. Arrived on time brand new. Comes in a cute little pouch. It took about 3 days to notice an improvement in my skin. It made my skin so soft! I love how it feels on my skin especially on my legs. I&#x27;ve tried exfoliating before but this is by far the best results I&#x27;ve ever got. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Top knotch quality. Quick delivery. Great price, worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Awesome. Felt a difference the first time I tried it. You can really feel the blood flowing while you use this thing</li>
            <li> A friend told me about this. Dry brushing your skin is supposed to help with lymph drainage as well as exfoliate dead skin cells. I got the package on time. It came with a little hanging bag and a sticky hook for the bathroom wall. I&#x27;ve used it several times now. Doesn&#x27;t shed very many bristles at all. Feels a little stiff at first but it doesn&#x27;t hurt. Brush is supposed to be used dry before you get in the shower. I thought the price was very reasonable for the quality of the product. I really appreciate when I get an email from the seller asking if everything was to my liking.</li>
            <li> Product as described. Thank you</li>
            <li> Great brush, leaves my skin soft with a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> So awesome! Great purchase, and my skin is baby soft after daily use. This brush is a complete game changer!</li>
            <li> This is a great dry brush for those looking for firm bristles. I had another brush that was too soft for difficult rough patches but this one does the trick. It&#x27;s also nicely compact.</li>
            <li> Love using this brush before the shower.  I have noticed a difference after the first couple uses.  Also, the company was EXTREMELY helpful in sending me instructions once the brush has shipped.  I appreciated this as I had not used a body brush in this manner previously.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful Dry body brush. I use it every other night to encourage healthy and beautiful skin. Dry Skin brushing really works. This is a fantastic brush at a great price. Everyone should read about the health benefits due to dry brushing. This would be a great stocking stuffer for everyone on your Christmas List. I love it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush for dry brushing to help with cellulite and circulation.  Considering the quality of this brush, the price is excellent.  I used to work in a luxury bath product store and the dry brushes sold there were over $15 more and not nearly as sturdy as this brush.  My cellulite has decreased in appearance after only one week of use.  When I need a new one, I plan to buy this same brush again.  Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Very nice item.  I love the way it makes my skin feel during and after each use.  Also purchased one for my father, who has terribly dry skin all over his body.  We used it once and the change was remarkable.</li>
            <li> First experience with dry brushing. Have heard and read quite a bit, this is a great brush for beginners. Smooth, great handle and size. Highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I use this brush for my boxer. Hee comes running to me when he sees out come out. Out is soft enough for his face, yet gets all the loose hair and dust off. Its the same style as a face brush for horses... But a way better deal!!!</li>
            <li> High quality, great body brush</li>
            <li> I love this little brush!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my dry skin brush. My skin is so much smoother and softer.</li>
            <li> Love the brush! I think it is a great size, bristles are great, the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because even though the strap on the back is helpful, I really wish the strap was adjustable.  I think I have pretty normal sized hands for a woman, but the strap is really loose.  Otherwise, I love the brush, I think it does a great job and I would definitely recommend this brush to anyone looking for a great body dry brush.  Oh, I also love that it comes with a little baggy/case and a hook to hang it.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, soft bristles that are super effective in dry brushing and comes with nice travel case.</li>
            <li> It got to my house quickly, which was great! I love using my skin brush. However, the first time I used it the bristles were already falling off. I think in just a short time, if they continue falling off I will have to get a new brush.. :( But I do like it and had great delivery and tracking when I ordered it.</li>
            <li> Why haven&#x27;t I heard of this before now! im astonished at what this had</li>
            <li> Great brush, nice size, and the bristles are softer than I thought they would be. It is a nice brush to use and feels as if you have woken up your skin without hurting it. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the dry skin brush. It makes a big difference brushing the skin dry and then showering. I always thought if I scrubbed my arms and legs good while showering I would remove the dried skin, but I would still have the dryness. I don&#x27;t have that any more! It is wonderful! Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!!</li>
            <li> Brush is as advertised - just wonderful!  I would recommend this vendor.</li>
            <li> A great product and I am VERY happy with it.  Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> The strap doesn&#x27;t really fit my hand. It would be nice if it was elastic.</li>
            <li> I love it. It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for and the brissels are the perfect hardness!!!</li>
            <li> I love the feeliing of a good dry body brush. I use it when I awaken and talk about being invigorated! The strength of the bristles is just right. I don&#x27;t know about the health claims, but the skin care claim seems to be true. I&#x27;m 67 and have developed dry, bumpy skin on my forearms. After a week or so of daily dry brushing, the skin on my arms has become smoother. No other changes, just the addition of dry brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem I have with it and the reason I gave it only 4 stars, is that it&#x27;s a bit small. Admittedly I have longer hands than most women so for the average women the brush should be fine. Large-handed people will figure out soon enough how to get a comfortable grip on the brush. I think I&#x27;ll change the rating to 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought many dry brushes, this one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. Perfect!</li>
            <li> Came with instructions on what to do! I pair it with a cellulite cream!</li>
            <li> This is a great brush! My first one and I am very happy with it. It is easy to handle.</li>
            <li> This brush is not the worth the price I payed for it. Again very small bush. Could of gotten one larger at the dollar store. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Feels great and I feel better after using it!  Nice to have the hook too.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;The brush is great! I like that instructions were included in the package.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I am really happy with this purchase, though I was expecting the brush to be bigger. But it works...</li>
            <li> Great Product!  Has already reduced appearance of cellulite. Great addition to beauty routine.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality brush--and the perfect bristle strength for dry brushing...not too firm and not too soft. Also, a great seller. Very happy -- item just as described and quickly shipped. Thank you!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brush twice or so a week for about a month.  It definitely doesn&#x27;t feel good but I&#x27;ve noticed my skin looks healthier!</li>
            <li> I have followed the instructions, first using light brush strokes and putting a little more pressure as time goes on. I use the brush before my shower each morning. My skins feels invigorated, the lotion I use after absorbs more easily into my skin. I feel the brush works as advertised. I highly recommend using this brush.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Love the brush size and strap as it makes it easy to use. The brush stimulates the skin but is not too rough so that makes it perfect. The emails that I received from the seller were professional and infused with their passion for the product which is a great personal touch.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase. The brush arrived quickly and is of excellent quality.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush- Not too stiff, not too soft.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to lose a lot of bristles either.  The only thing is that I wish is that the handle was elastic- It&#x27;s canvas, and very large, so it falls off of my hand easily.  Still love it though!  Plus, it arrived quickly in it&#x27;s own pouch and had it&#x27;s own hook- Very cute!</li>
            <li> I ordered my first dry skin body brush and loved it so much that I ordered the traveler brush as well.  I actually look forward to using it prior to showering and feel like it helps my skin absorb lotion much better.  SO glad I found this wonderful company and tool.</li>
            <li> A balm for dry skin!  I don&#x27;t use this as regularly as it is intended (the packaging said fives times a day). I have very hard water where I live and I use this brush when I get itchy..  It helps a lot. It is gentle enough that I don&#x27;t feel like I am scraping my skin off, but you will feel it!</li>
            <li> Great Brush, the bristles are just the right touch. Not to stiff as some brushes are. The strap makes it easy to stay on the hand! Love it, thank you!</li>
            <li> Use it everyday. And it comes with a cute storage pouch.</li>
            <li> The bristles are coarse but not too harsh.  My skins feels great after only a few days of use!</li>
            <li> The perfect body brush. Just what I was looking for in terms of size and bristle strength.</li>
            <li> Soft sturdy brushes. Works great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite nice to clean your skin with.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, had great instructions on proper use of brush.  Good quality.  Makes your skin feel invigorated!!</li>
            <li> The reviews that I read were accurate about the brush not hurting. It is stiff, but it is not painful. I just started a few days ago, so I&#x27;m not seeing the health benefits of body brushing yet, but I&#x27;m willing to give it a shot. If anything, it gets the dead skin off. The brush does come with a cloth carrying bag and plastic hook for hanging in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> soft bristle brush but not too soft that it won&#x27;t exfoliate well, it&#x27;s just perfect!! It&#x27;s fist pretty well on my hand and I like how I can just hang it in the shower</li>
            <li> Truly can&#x27;t speak of any &amp;#34;lymphatic&amp;#34; improvements or miracle cellulite vanishings- but these are darn good brushes for removing dead skin.  Bought two and have definitely noticed that my skin is softer.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!!!! Have done wonders for my skin along with all natural oils with essential oils :-)</li>
            <li> Love the brush - use it for a few times, and your skin will thank you for it.  I also appreciated that the company took the time to email instructions on how to use it to you, its also included on a card with the brush, which appears to be solidly built.  You will see best results if your skin is completely dry when using it - and then shower afterwards.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd order!!&lt;br /&gt;Love these brushes. I use it for dry skin brushing. The bristles are not too rough.I started dry skin brushing from 6 months and I am already starting to see the effects. So relaxing while exfoliating my skin. Dry body brushing has so many benefits.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;was very pleased with this item. it came very quickly as promised and included a little pouch to put the brush in and a hook to hang it up with. excellent product.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> A purchase request from my daughter.  She loves it and says it&#x27;s great for dry skin cleaning.</li>
            <li> Very happy with brush. It is stimulating and invigorating. Nice product.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush for beginners.  The bristles are pretty soft and were not bent to either side.  I had previously purchased a brush and the bristles could only be used one way and if you went &amp;#34;against the grain&amp;#34; it was painful.  I also purchased this brush for my mom so she could begin dry brushing.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Terrable brush.....Used it twice and threw it in the trash.Brissels coming  out.Very painful to use...I hate it</li>
            <li> This brush is a little hard/ stiff for my skin. It is almost painful. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a week and will continue to use hoping the bristles will soften up. Had I had the chance to sample this product it would not have been my first choice for a dry skin brush.</li>
            <li> I loved my dry skin body brush, it has the right softness and stiffness to brush my skin in a healthy way.&lt;br /&gt;It came with a nice case, instructions and a hanger so the brush will have a place of her own. It is also the right size for my hand which is a medium size.</li>
            <li> The natural bristle brush is neither too soft nor too hard.  It feels good and is, in fact, invigorating.  My skin feels and looks good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this brush a few times since receiving it only a week ago. The bristles are nice and soft but stiff enough to get the job done without irritating the skin. It fits my hand nicely. I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I like this brush.  Only negative is that I have a small hand, so it would be nice if the strap was adjustable.</li>
            <li> Bristles are just the right strength to work but not be too abrasive.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this brush! The bristles are not so stiff that it&#x27;s painful, it&#x27;s very invigorating!</li>
            <li> Item was as described and was received on the day estimated. They sent an email stating how to use the product too. Very nice</li>
            <li> Quality product works great!</li>
            <li> Really good quality and not too rough on the skin. Good company to deal with.</li>
            <li> Great for exfoliating skin!</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome. I love brushing it over my skin. It&#x27;s not too stiff, just right!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay but not quite stiff enough for legs.</li>
            <li> Size is too small ... is good for face</li>
            <li> I love using this before showering. It&#x27;s very exhilarating as well as it exfoliates dead skin</li>
            <li> I love this brush! Such a relaxing process and seems to be helping my skin as well!</li>
            <li> I love this dry skin brush. My skin was always itchy before I started using it. After the first use my itchiness went away. It&#x27;s very easy to use and my  skin feels great I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> I use this brush before I shower and it makes my skin feel great! Love the softness! Definitely need for summer (shorts)</li>
            <li> A nice scrub brush. This product looks and feels exactly as it is described. My only critique is I hoped it would be a more coarse brush</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my step-daughter. She&#x27;s happy with it.</li>
            <li> Feels so good on my skin just like the back scrubber.  I feel cleaner and have had no trouble adjusting to the bristles. I don&#x27;t have dry skin, and this brush still works for me.</li>
            <li> This is a well made, great body brush.  High recommended.</li>
            <li> So far I like it, as I understand it takes time to work. However, I&#x27;m happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li> HIghly recommend this product. My skin feels much smoother! Great customer service as well. After ordering the product, I received a list of tips on how to use it. All around great product.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush, sturdy and well-crafted.  For me, it works effectively at making skin feel and appear smoother.  I am also impressed by the vendor (RG City), who not only e-mailed me instructions but also a follow-up to make sure that I liked the product.</li>
            <li> I bought it to wash my hair and works perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Love it so far!  The brush is small, compact bristles, great quality.  No bristles have fallen out and I&#x27;ve used it for about 3 weeks now.  Aside from the product, I did have some weird sore throat issues when I was brushing in the morning, with no shower.  I&#x27;m not sure how closely it was related, but I read some more information about dry brushing, and you really need to shower afterward to get rid of the dead skin and toxins.  I now brush once a day, before showering in the evening.</li>
            <li> Nice stiff bristles, not too much though for your skin. I love the pouch and the self-adhesive pad they include for easy storage.</li>
            <li> Many years ago, an older gentleman came up to me and showed me how he combed his skin with a comb to remove impurities. Now that I am the older lady and I came across your ad for a dry skin body brush, I remembered what he had told me. I purchased the body brush because I have a circulation problem in my legs and I thought this might help. I feel it is doing the job. The only thing that would make it better, is to purchase two (one for each hand) and to have someone do the brushing for you. Aahh!  I did not get a traveling case with mine.</li>
            <li> I tried dry brushing a few years ago, didn&#x27;t get a real bristle brush, was uncomfortable and gave it up as unnecessary beauty routine.. This time, talked my DH into trying it to reduce some leg edema he has acquired with age. We followed brushing directions, (novel thought) and this time noticed almost immediate improvement in his always rough, irritated, red-headed skin!  My skin changes less dramatic, with just a smoother overall,  less winter itchy feeling.  His leg edema has improved!  I also had soft swelling above breast bone which has vanished. Directions say this is a spot lymph can collect.  This has become, in our 80s, a romantic evening routine. Thankyou for this product!</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast. Brush is just what I hoped it would be. Thanks.</li>
            <li> This brush really works to remove dry dead skin and leave my skin soft and bright looking.</li>
            <li> This lovely hand-held contour brush to buff and exfoliate your dry skin.  The brush is . 4-7/8” (L) x 2-1/2’ (W) x 1.5” (H).  Dry skin brushing is very popular these days as a detox method, but although I’ve read about it, I can’t vouch for any of the claims  The claims range from stimulating the lymphatic system to reducing cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that is recommended is that one use a natural bristle brush, one thing this brush does have.  The bristles are 5/8” long, firm, but not stiff enough to be uncomfortable when I use the brush.  The use is supposed to be invigorating and that it is, depending on how hard you brush.  I actually like the feel of dry brushing or buffing my skin and could get used to it.  This brush is quite easy to control and is kept in place with a strap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FEATURES:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;►  Natural Bristle&lt;br /&gt;►  Polished Wooden Frame&lt;br /&gt;►  Cotton loop for hanging&lt;br /&gt;►  Travel Pouch and Hook Included&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush body is made of a beautiful polish wood, no splinters to be had here.  There’s a loop on the end for hanging and a hook that can be attached to the wall.  The 1/2” braided, knotted loop is thick and not likely to snap.  My preference would be to simply store it in the carrying pouch and tuck it away, but the brush is attractive enough to leave on a counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The long body brushes are also available, particularly if you want to get at spots on your back, as well as the contoured.  The brush can be used by both the right- and left-handed person.  There are several tutorials on YouTube for those who are interested in the benefits and “how-tos” of proper dry skin brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery - product exactly as described.  Very pleased with the purchase.  Great follow-up customer service from the vendor.</li>
            <li> The brush arrived as expected. I&#x27;ve just started dry brushing, but I think my skin is already getting smoother. It is an invigorating start to the day.</li>
