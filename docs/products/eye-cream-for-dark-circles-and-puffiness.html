            <li>and they say it really works great.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and nice too.</li>
            <li>Just received, love this product line.  </li>
            <li>Will share more after more use.</li>
            <li>will love the after effects but please give it time.</li>
            <li>I love the pump as it allows the user to control the amount.  </li>
            <li>I really love this creme.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lovely consistency</li>
            <li>I have used it also on top of my foundation which worked out</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>I love Foxbrim products.  </li>
            <li>It works ok</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>there was a decrease in puffiness and a better color to the area under my eyes.</li>
            <li>The Youthful Radiance Eye Cream by Foxbrim comes in a cute 0.5 fl oz (15 mL) container with a pump applicator.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>I got this product free in exchange for my honest opinion of the product.</li>
            <li>This eye cream moisturizes my eyes while also making them look alert and healthy.</li>
            <li>I love the packaging.</li>
            <li>I look a lot more rest since I start using this cream.</li>
            <li>I use it :)</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>Most of the problems under my eye went away.</li>
            <li>I love using this together with Foxbrim&#x27;s Ultra Lift Treatmeant cream.</li>
            <li>My mother is pleased with the results and will continue to use products.</li>
            <li>Eh, it&#x27;s ok as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I feel so much better about how I look.  </li>
            <li>This eye cream is nice because it is light weight</li>
            <li>This cream IS a moisturizer as well, so it makes you skin feel healthy and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and has a nice fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Also, the company was great about shipping at a wicked fast time.</li>
            <li>my opinion, I think one of the best selling points of this product - of which I was unaware (but would&#x27;ve bought it sooner had I known), is its &#x27;Ingredients.&#x27;  </li>
            <li>I think I need to give it some more time...</li>
            <li>like most eye creams on the market, it&#x27;s mostly just hype.  </li>
            <li>the packaging is cute i suppose.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure with continued use, I will see more improvement in this area.</li>
            <li>and I really love, and</li>
            <li>I will say though that even 1 pump was much more than I needed to do both eyes.</li>
            <li>I will say i love this for the hydration</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;d say this is a very nice eye cream for people that don&#x27;t need intense hydration.</li>
            <li>It was very rich cream</li>
            <li>the kind tat is unique to Fox Brim.  </li>
            <li>What I loved about this eye cream is that it&#x27;s light and quickly absorbs into the skin area around my eyes and doesn&#x27;t have an offending scent.</li>
            <li>What I loved about this eye cream is that it&#x27;s light and quickly absorbs into the skin area around my eyes and doesn&#x27;t have an offending scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclosure: I must let you know, I was NOT paid to write this review, but I did receive the item at no cost to me for giving my true and HONEST</li>
            <li>I love that application is easy and a breeze.</li>
            <li>The cream has a nice light fragrance and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>I love this cream, is so light you don&#x27;t even feel it when you use it</li>
            <li>All great, natural products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It worked well for hydration and felt good when applied, but did absolutely nothing for my under eye bags or darkness.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li>This is really creamy and feels good on the skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really have a scent to it, which is good, and it does work well under makeup.</li>
            <li>It was very unusual because most of the time any eye cream I put before my make-up, didn’t keep my skin moist to 8 hours!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to other people - Love this eye cream!!!!</li>
            <li>I love Organic skin care and Foxbrim knows how to do it right!  </li>
            <li>I even see some reduction in fine lines.</li>
            <li>but the cream is easy to apply and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have been using the cream for a month now and continue to see the brightening effect, but haven’t noticed a perceptible difference in fine lines.</li>
            <li>This product dramatically reduced puffiness and darkness under my eyes as well as reduced the look of fine lines at the outer corner of my eyes.</li>
            <li>so I have not tried that or as a moisturizer, because I feel my face is fine at this point in my life.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn’t notice a difference in my fine lines.</li>
            <li>It did decrease the fine lines</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice my fine lines diminishing either</li>
            <li>It has a light scent that</li>
            <li>Today I am bringing the most fun I have had rating beauty items.</li>
            <li>Youthful Radiance Eye Cream” is smooth, light and leaves not residue on the hands.</li>
            <li>gave me eyelid dermatitis, but seemed to smooth the lines around my eyes</li>
            <li>I am writing a review to get this product free.</li>
            <li>I received Fox Brim youthful radiance eye cream free and for review.  </li>
            <li>, this is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>I had been using this cream morning and night for about a week, when I woke up one morning, looked in the mirror, and was surprised by how bright my eyes looked.</li>
            <li>I am so happy I decided to purchase this cream that I totally recommend it.</li>
            <li>ingredients ,cruelty free.</li>
            <li>It seemed to smooth the wrinkles around my eyes some also.</li>
            <li>It was very moisturizing and served well as a nice eye cream.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>The dark circles faded and my eyes looked more healthy and bright.</li>
            <li>The eye cream comes in a small bottle with a pump on the top which is perfect for dispensing the right amount for both eyes while keeping the contents sanitary.</li>
            <li>This eye cream is one of my favorite brands in the market, as it is very gentle on my under eye area.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to have the chance to review this product, and I gotta say, it was great.</li>
            <li>but be sure to use it consistently.</li>
            <li>but despite it’s a rich cream</li>
            <li>With its wonderfully rich consistency, it has given my under-eye just the thing it has been lacking - moisture.</li>
            <li>is provides under my eyes and for that alone its worth the money!</li>
            <li>My make-up, foundation even eye shadow sat very nicely on it and it kept my skin moist and hydrate almost 8 hours after I came back from my work, it was still smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li>The eye cream reminds me of a light moisturizer and absorbs quickly into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, it absorbed very quickly.</li>
            <li>use this under my makeup and at night after I clean my face.</li>
            <li>I like that it is light weight and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling soft and looking great!</li>
            <li>The pump allows for easy application and just the right amount of product to apply where needed.</li>
            <li>The pump allows for easy application and allows you to get just the right amount of product you need for your eyes.</li>
            <li>nothing special.  </li>
            <li>it is better for a moisturizer with very high end ingredients/antioxidants</li>
            <li>To be fair I will give the product more time to work on the dark circles.</li>
            <li>but I really can&#x27;t tell for sure.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>I have absolutely fallen in love with this eye cream.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>

            <li>I have absolutely fallen in love with this eye cream.</li>
            <li>so then I just add a little concealer and good to go!</li>
            <li>I paid particular attention to applying it to my forehead, as that is where most of my wrinkles stand</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy at all and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Look more awake and better overall.</li>
            <li>This is also safe to use under your make up and after you have washed your skin using you favorite facial wash.</li>
            <li>Like it better than most similar products that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>

            <li>I love that it is made with natural ingredients which makes me comfortable using the product.</li>
            <li>While it absorbs quickly, it leaves my skin feeling refreshed.</li>

            <li>The cream is lightweight and absorbs quickly with no remaining residue.  </li>
            <li>It has slightly cool effect that calm the puffy eyes.</li>
            <li>I have not seen a drastic change with dark circles, but it does greatly reduce puffiness.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice lotion, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or sting but doesn&#x27;t seem better than any other.</li>
            <li>I think “Youthful Radiance Eye Cream by Foxbrim” is a great eye cream for youthful radiance, treat puffiness, dark circles and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>really like how the cream dispenses from the container making it easy to control the amount and also to apply to eye area.</li>
            <li>The cream is very nice and it did get rid of the dark circles under my eyes but not the puffy eyes.</li>
            <li>and it was my first application of the product!</li>
            <li>Really like this stuff!!</li>
            <li>The cream is soft and light so it easily adsorbs into the skin around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Finally a product that delivers great results on 65 year old hooded, droopy eyelids!  </li>
            <li>It took time to get those wrinkles and fine lines, so use the whole bottle before you judge the results.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t attest to any real long-term benefits, as I haven&#x27;t used it very consistently, but given the light moisturizing quality</li>
            <li>The packaging itself is nice, I love the little fox in the logo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The pump system is great, no product is wasted through a tube</li>
            <li>is really smooth and the skin absorbs it really fast.</li>

            <li>love the fact that this eye cream is organic and all natural.</li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li>I hope it continues to be worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Overall I liked it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>The packaging is tiny, cute and travel friendly.</li>
            <li>Pleasant on the skin, but no difference in dark circles yet.  </li>
            <li>It left a cool feeling and had a very light scent.  </li>
            <li>cream has a whipped consistency and soaks into your skin right away</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other reviewers have said that the bottle dispenses just the right amount.</li>
            <li>The cream was white and creamy and very easy to apply around the eye area.  </li>
            <li>also love the fact that Foxbrim offers a 90 day money back guarantee if you are not 100% satisfied with their product.</li>
            <li>I love that this bottle has a pump, which makes using the cream much easier and more sanitary than other types of containers.</li>
            <li>I tried a few different concealers over it, and they all caused the product to ball and pill on my skin - one of my all-time greatest beauty pet peeves.</li>
            <li>It really helps the puffiness under my eyes and makes my skin soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>Delivery very fast.  </li>
            <li>You would imagine that with such a thick creamy texture that it might be greasy or sticky, but it&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s perfect not soaking in to the skin too quickly nor does it sit on the skin like a football player&#x27;s face paint...</li>
            <li>tried the FoxBrim Youthful Radiance Eye Cream for a little over a week to get a good idea of how well it worked, or didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It may need more time and regular use.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that the eye cream comes in a pump and one pump is enough to do both eyes.</li>
            <li>at first it felt like it was tighening..but not now.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I enjoy how this product has natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I enjoy how alive my eyes look after using the eye cream, I can also feel the skin tightening for a even more younger look.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>but my eyes needed a different anti puffy product to make my eyes feel better in the mornings.</li>
            <li>My eye zone looks so pretty after use</li>
            <li>I plan on continued use and will be able to tell at a later date.  </li>
            <li>First off, I felt a cooling sensation under my eyes.</li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>but I do believe as with most products that you need to use them for months on end before you see actual results.</li>
            <li>This is the first product that I have tried that truly reduced the puffieness.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really seen any results yet, but time will tell!</li>
            <li>I did pay for this and have just applied it for the first time.</li>
            <li>Either way, this cream is most certainly a must have for every ones facial skin!</li>
            <li>The formula feels amazing on the skin and it never feels oily or greasy like other produces do.</li>
            <li>As allergy season and other irritants flare up it&#x27;s been nice to use a a soothing and hydrating eye cream....</li>
            <li>After using the cream for 4 or 5 days and seeing no results, I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t give up and toss it aside (as I&#x27;ve done with other products), but instead continued using it and, happily, could see a visible, possible difference during the 2nd week!  </li>
            <li>So, I can absolutely tell you that I was able to use this cream without any problems, which is a big deal for me.  </li>
            <li>So, I can absolutely tell you that I was able to use this cream without any problems, which is a big deal for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After application of the product my eyes look more alive and feel soft.</li>
            <li>It contains a lot of product and each use only requires a minute amount of product so this bottle would last a good while.  </li>
            <li>By itself that would be great but these reviewers have also reviewed within a day of each other the same exact products.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light - closer to a lotion consistency than a typical cream, and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>The positive reviews seem to throw it off.</li>
            <li>anyone that does consistently use skin care at night or doesn&#x27;t wear much makeup</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t able to use it for very long.</li>
            <li>while I am not noticing any dramatic change with my dark circles, I can honestly say that the eye cream works beautifully for reducing the puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li>My skin around my eyes was still very soft, fresh and moist.</li>
            <li>As you can see the cream looks like white and after applying this on the skin, it absorbed super fast and hydrates well.</li>
            <li>time I applied “Youthful Radiance Eye Cream by Foxbrim” with great ingredients  such as Aloe, Jojoba Oil, Grapeseed Oil, Rosehip Seed Oil, Green Tea, Vitamin C + E, Tamanu Oil which worked</li>
            <li>It arrived fast.</li>
            <li>I guess my bags are too well formed to change much.  </li>
            <li>Very affordable, well packaged, goes on smoothely.  </li>
            <li>i have dehydrated yet oily skin, which can be very tricky to treat.</li>
            <li>so i dont need as much concealer.</li>
            <li>and I did not see much of a difference in puffiness.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it worked really well as a night cream</li>
            <li>Results are also much quicker than I imagined.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone looking for an eye cream with real results.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t sleep a whole lot.</li>
            <li>I am very sad!&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely, Lubov</li>
            <li>It is non greasy and absorbs into your skin fast.</li>
            <li>The that I&#x27;ve noticed in this short a time is that the skin in my eye area feels smooth and tighter.  </li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t really noticed much difference.  </li>
            <li>and you can&#x27;t really feel it while wearing it.  </li>
            <li>The cream is white (of course) and smooth.</li>
            <li>It absorbs really well</li>
            <li>but, I can&#x27;t really blame the weather for the presence of sleepiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucky</li>
            <li>The  &amp;#34;Organic Herbal Infusion&amp;#34; of plant-based oils is a real plus.</li>
            <li>am giving this a 5 star rating because I know there is not much that can get rid of the circles I have, but this Radiance Eye Cream did lighten the areas around my eyes and did make my skin look and feel more youthful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This eye cream is very hydrating and goes really well on my eyes.</li>
            <li>I use a lot of the ingredients on its own like aloe, green tea, rosehip seed oil, etc.</li>
            <li>Since others have had a good experience with this eye cream, I don&#x27;t want my negative review to influence them.</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t had positive results in all honesty it appears to have made under my eyes more loose than it was before using this product</li>
            <li>you found this review or any of my other reviews interesting or helpful</li>
            <li>First impression: I love the little bottle that the product comes in.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a few days of use, I can state unequivocally that this product is hands down the best I’ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>any positive effects that people claim to see is most likely psychological.......</li>
            <li>I only wear make up when there is a special occasion</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do a darn thing for me - in fact, it seemed like my dark circles were more noticeable.</li>
            <li>Only natural and organic ingredients blended so if you have sensitive skin like me, this product will be appropriate for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>I have been using Foxbrim&#x27;s Eye Cream for Dark Circles and Puffiness for 3 days now, I love it.</li>
            <li>Absolutely did nothing, just some kind of thick lotion.  </li>
            <li>but, I&#x27;ve been noticing this particular winter</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any particular improvement.</li>
            <li>little does go a long way, so lightly touch the top of the container.</li>
            <li>This cream really helped to soothe the area, bring some of the puffiness down and gently minimize some of the fine lines and wrinkle from the tugging.  </li>
            <li>After applying Youthful Radiance Eye Cream, I wait a few minutes and then use a very light under eye concealer.</li>
            <li>The price is too high in my opinion though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To me, even a little improvement is better than none at all.</li>
            <li>wow!!</li>
            <li>Depending on how deep your lines are, you may see some difference but not totally gone, however if your lines are fine, you should really be amazed.</li>
            <li>The cream is rich in ingredients and wont dry out your eyes.</li>
            <li>I have had moderate success with these products until I got a chance to try out Hyaluronic Acid Serum by</li>
            <li>I will totally recommend it if you have dark circles under your eyes like me or if you just want to have a nice cream for your eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep going until the bottle is gone and update with more pictures and comments as long as it last.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue for a few more weeks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve almost used the whole bottle up, and I used it really regularly for the first month or so.</li>
            <li>I started to see and feel a difference.this product is nice and thick</li>
            <li>Good day!&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this cream, unnecessarily.</li>
            <li>Once applied with my third finger on my right hand in one direction up to make sure that as little pressure was applied on the eyes below.  </li>
            <li>The cream goes on easy and feels velvety smooth, and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>No dark circles!!!  </li>
            <li>However, when i apply this at night the next day my eyelids feel healthy and when i apply eyeshadow it doesnt come on looking dry and patchy!</li>
            <li>This goes on smoothly and extremely absorbent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great so far after a few days of using it my dark eye circles are lighter.</li>
            <li>cream is intended to treat dark circles, puffiness, fine fines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Now the texture is light nothing super heavy and especially if you apply it the way I do which</li>
            <li>Puffiness, fine lines, wrinkles, dark circle, and hydration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is packed full of nutrient rich ingredients such as: vitamin C, vitamin E, aloe, green tea extract, jojoba oil etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If a product needs this type of fraudulent deception by manipulating the ratings system, that must mean the product absolutely will not be able to achieve the claims it makes.</li>
            <li>DO NOT waste money on this!</li>
            <li>This is the main reason I haven&#x27;t managed to use it consistently...since I tend not to wear much on my face at night (again, I don&#x27;t have dry skin, and I also prefer to let it breathe while I sleep), I just haven&#x27;t used it a whole lot.</li>
            <li>I have tried other creams and obviously because I am trying more I am still looking for something.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Foxbrim Youthful Radiance Eye Cream is made with all natural ingredients that helps reduce wrinkles, fine lines, puffiness and dark</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, and it feels nice.  </li>
            <li>Left my skin extremely smooth and fresh and when I woke up the next day, it wasn’t any trace of rough morning look.</li>
            <li>Definately reduces dark circles and puffiness to achieve a younger more rested looking face.</li>
            <li>However, I have not seen a reduction in puffiness and have experienced only a little lightening of the dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice though, and I&#x27;m going to continue to use it at least until it runs out in the hope that it&#x27;s doing something longer-term!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried much more expensive eye creams and this is absolutely as good if not better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m starting to notice slight changes to my skin as I&#x27;m aging, and as one would expect, the area I&#x27;m noticing them most is around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I also have a few fine lines.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This has such a cute little packaging.</li>
            <li>I just wanted to be clear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it at least twice per day (day and night) and sometimes even more.</li>
            <li>Received a day early.</li>
            <li>No harsh smell.</li>
            <li>What is the likelihood that several reviewers would purchase and review the exact same group of products on the exact same day?  </li>
            <li>All ingredients are natural as this is a trend for Fox Brim.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t completely get rid of bags but reduces them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely natural and organic</li>
            <li>It does not sting or irritate the sensitive eye area.</li>
            <li>She is also using Foxbrim’s Complete Anti-Aging Moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This organic Foxbrim Youthful Radiance Eye Cream is a complete eye care system.</li>
            <li>All working together to balance, hydrate, repair, and restore your eyes natural beauty.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY DOES NOT WORK OR DO WHAT IT SAYS</li>
            <li>It is rare to find a product that works in such a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>Youthful Radiance Eye Cream by Foxbrim has been formulated to help address anti-aging and eye concerns such as dark circles, puffiness, fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My review is completely honest and is given only after personal, repetitive use of this product.</li>
            <li>However, I still don&#x27;t actually have dry skin, and the problem I seem to run into quite frequently when trying new eye products is that they are incredibly heavy and intense - far, far more than what I personally</li>
            <li>Not very helpful for my puffiness, but maybe I&#x27;m expecting too much from this highly recommended product.</li>
            <li>But, when that happens, I just take the extra and use on the top of my forehead because I am not about to waste anything!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product  especially for contact lens wearers</li>
            <li>This product is light, just enough moisture that does not clog my pores, which has previously been a problem.  </li>
            <li>there isn&#x27;t a strong artificial or lab scent but rather a light scent which I will assume is from the mix of ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a few weeks and find it to be very compatible with my skin type &amp; issue of concern (under eye bags), and can already see its positive effects!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works as well as the more expensive eye creams I&#x27;ve used but at a much lower price point.</li>
            <li>It is a opaque white cream, that really packs a punch when it comes to skin hydration and overall feel.</li>
            <li>It is a opaque white cream, that really packs a punch when it comes to skin hydration and overall feel.</li>
            <li>I have very very sensitive skin,  especially around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to change my original review from a couple of weeks ago, when I stated, \\&quot;I&#x27;m honestly not sure yet that it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>It does definitely decrease puffiness, but as for my dark circles, I don&#x27;t really see all that much difference.</li>
            <li>main problems are dark circles for night that i just cannot sleep and anything to help fight off aging is a plus at any point of your life after high school I feel.</li>
            <li>I am sometimes sensitive to smells and it will make my eyes water constantly if anything is in a cream that shouldn&#x27;t be there.</li>
            <li>The night after I first applied it, I woke up with noticeable reduction in puffiness and dark circle.</li>
            <li>I am sometimes sensitive to smells and it will make my eyes water constantly if anything is in a cream that shouldn&#x27;t be there.</li>
            <li>so if you have extra sensitive skin you don&#x27;t have to worry, they got you.</li>
            <li>I now wake up in the morning with barely any puffy bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t wow me enough for 5 stars, but I received it from Tomoson to review.</li>
            <li>I suffer from dark circles and puffy eyes because I rarely get enough sleep.</li>
            <li>All I know is that it better work because I am extremely upset that it&#x27;s so small.</li>
            <li>My mother is in her late 60’s and was excited to try the eye cream after reading about all the benefits.</li>
            <li>It has an easy pump system and you only need a little bit, so it will last long!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this for 2 days, but I already see a pretty substantial improvement in my dark circles and under eye puffiness.</li>
            <li>But as for taking care of dark circles, not so much.  </li>
            <li>I squirt a little on to my finger and dab about half on of the amount on each eye and then light blend and dab all around the optical opening, eyelid and under eye included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m sure that it would encourage at least a slight improvement in the skin quality of your eye</li>
            <li>Most of the time when I came home my skin is dry and dehydrate and look so tired.</li>
            <li>Not sure I see a huge difference in the dark circles, bit do think it has improved the skin around my eyes.</li>

            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> I love Foxbrim products.  </li>
            <li> It works ok</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> there was a decrease in puffiness and a better color to the area under my eyes.</li>
            <li> The Youthful Radiance Eye Cream by Foxbrim comes in a cute 0.5 fl oz (15 mL) container with a pump applicator.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> I got this product free in exchange for my honest opinion of the product.</li>

            <li> I feel so much better about how I look.  </li>
            <li> This eye cream is nice because it is light weight</li>
            <li> This cream IS a moisturizer as well, so it makes you skin feel healthy and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and has a nice fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Also, the company was great about shipping at a wicked fast time.</li>
            <li> my opinion, I think one of the best selling points of this product - of which I was unaware (but would&#x27;ve bought it sooner had I known), is its &#x27;Ingredients.&#x27;  </li>
            <li> I think I need to give it some more time...</li>
            <li> like most eye creams on the market, it&#x27;s mostly just hype.  </li>
            <li> the packaging is cute i suppose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure with continued use, I will see more improvement in this area.</li>
            <li> and I really love, and</li>
            <li> I will say though that even 1 pump was much more than I needed to do both eyes.</li>
            <li> I will say i love this for the hydration</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;d say this is a very nice eye cream for people that don&#x27;t need intense hydration.</li>
            <li> It was very rich cream</li>
            <li> the kind tat is unique to Fox Brim.  </li>
            <li> What I loved about this eye cream is that it&#x27;s light and quickly absorbs into the skin area around my eyes and doesn&#x27;t have an offending scent.</li>
            <li> What I loved about this eye cream is that it&#x27;s light and quickly absorbs into the skin area around my eyes and doesn&#x27;t have an offending scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disclosure: I must let you know, I was NOT paid to write this review, but I did receive the item at no cost to me for giving my true and HONEST</li>
            <li> I love that application is easy and a breeze.</li>
            <li> The cream has a nice light fragrance and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I love this cream, is so light you don&#x27;t even feel it when you use it</li>
            <li> All great, natural products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It worked well for hydration and felt good when applied, but did absolutely nothing for my under eye bags or darkness.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> This is really creamy and feels good on the skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really have a scent to it, which is good, and it does work well under makeup.</li>
            <li> It was very unusual because most of the time any eye cream I put before my make-up, didn’t keep my skin moist to 8 hours!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to other people - Love this eye cream!!!!</li>
            <li> I love Organic skin care and Foxbrim knows how to do it right!  </li>
            <li> I even see some reduction in fine lines.</li>
            <li> but the cream is easy to apply and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have been using the cream for a month now and continue to see the brightening effect, but haven’t noticed a perceptible difference in fine lines.</li>
            <li> This product dramatically reduced puffiness and darkness under my eyes as well as reduced the look of fine lines at the outer corner of my eyes.</li>
            <li> so I have not tried that or as a moisturizer, because I feel my face is fine at this point in my life.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn’t notice a difference in my fine lines.</li>
            <li> It did decrease the fine lines</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice my fine lines diminishing either</li>
            <li> It has a light scent that</li>
            <li> Today I am bringing the most fun I have had rating beauty items.</li>
            <li> Youthful Radiance Eye Cream” is smooth, light and leaves not residue on the hands.</li>
            <li> gave me eyelid dermatitis, but seemed to smooth the lines around my eyes</li>
            <li> I am writing a review to get this product free.</li>
            <li> I received Fox Brim youthful radiance eye cream free and for review.  </li>

            <li> The dark circles faded and my eyes looked more healthy and bright.</li>
            <li> The eye cream comes in a small bottle with a pump on the top which is perfect for dispensing the right amount for both eyes while keeping the contents sanitary.</li>

            <li> I was lucky enough to have the chance to review this product, and I gotta say, it was great.</li>
            <li> but be sure to use it consistently.</li>
            <li> but despite it’s a rich cream</li>
            <li> With its wonderfully rich consistency, it has given my under-eye just the thing it has been lacking - moisture.</li>
            <li> is provides under my eyes and for that alone its worth the money!</li>
            <li> My make-up, foundation even eye shadow sat very nicely on it and it kept my skin moist and hydrate almost 8 hours after I came back from my work, it was still smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li> The eye cream reminds me of a light moisturizer and absorbs quickly into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , it absorbed very quickly.</li>
            <li> use this under my makeup and at night after I clean my face.</li>

            <li> The pump allows for easy application and allows you to get just the right amount of product you need for your eyes.</li>
            <li> nothing special.  </li>
            <li> it is better for a moisturizer with very high end ingredients/antioxidants</li>
            <li> To be fair I will give the product more time to work on the dark circles.</li>
            <li> but I really can&#x27;t tell for sure.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>

            <li> The cream is soft and light so it easily adsorbs into the skin around my eyes.  </li>

            <li> It took time to get those wrinkles and fine lines, so use the whole bottle before you judge the results.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t attest to any real long-term benefits, as I haven&#x27;t used it very consistently, but given the light moisturizing quality</li>

            <li> Delivery very fast.  </li>
            <li> You would imagine that with such a thick creamy texture that it might be greasy or sticky, but it&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s perfect not soaking in to the skin too quickly nor does it sit on the skin like a football player&#x27;s face paint...</li>
            <li> tried the FoxBrim Youthful Radiance Eye Cream for a little over a week to get a good idea of how well it worked, or didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It may need more time and regular use.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that the eye cream comes in a pump and one pump is enough to do both eyes.</li>
            <li> at first it felt like it was tighening..but not now.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I enjoy how this product has natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I enjoy how alive my eyes look after using the eye cream, I can also feel the skin tightening for a even more younger look.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> but my eyes needed a different anti puffy product to make my eyes feel better in the mornings.</li>
            <li> My eye zone looks so pretty after use</li>
            <li> I plan on continued use and will be able to tell at a later date.  </li>
            <li> First off, I felt a cooling sensation under my eyes.</li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li> but I do believe as with most products that you need to use them for months on end before you see actual results.</li>
            <li> This is the first product that I have tried that truly reduced the puffieness.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really seen any results yet, but time will tell!</li>
            <li> I did pay for this and have just applied it for the first time.</li>
            <li> Either way, this cream is most certainly a must have for every ones facial skin!</li>
            <li> The formula feels amazing on the skin and it never feels oily or greasy like other produces do.</li>
            <li> As allergy season and other irritants flare up it&#x27;s been nice to use a a soothing and hydrating eye cream....</li>
            <li> After using the cream for 4 or 5 days and seeing no results, I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t give up and toss it aside (as I&#x27;ve done with other products), but instead continued using it and, happily, could see a visible, possible difference during the 2nd week!  </li>
            <li> So, I can absolutely tell you that I was able to use this cream without any problems, which is a big deal for me.  </li>
            <li> So, I can absolutely tell you that I was able to use this cream without any problems, which is a big deal for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After application of the product my eyes look more alive and feel soft.</li>
            <li> It contains a lot of product and each use only requires a minute amount of product so this bottle would last a good while.  </li>
            <li> By itself that would be great but these reviewers have also reviewed within a day of each other the same exact products.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light - closer to a lotion consistency than a typical cream, and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> The positive reviews seem to throw it off.</li>
            <li> anyone that does consistently use skin care at night or doesn&#x27;t wear much makeup</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t able to use it for very long.</li>
            <li> while I am not noticing any dramatic change with my dark circles, I can honestly say that the eye cream works beautifully for reducing the puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> My skin around my eyes was still very soft, fresh and moist.</li>
            <li> As you can see the cream looks like white and after applying this on the skin, it absorbed super fast and hydrates well.</li>
            <li> time I applied “Youthful Radiance Eye Cream by Foxbrim” with great ingredients  such as Aloe, Jojoba Oil, Grapeseed Oil, Rosehip Seed Oil, Green Tea, Vitamin C + E, Tamanu Oil which worked</li>
            <li> It arrived fast.</li>
            <li> I guess my bags are too well formed to change much.  </li>
            <li> Very affordable, well packaged, goes on smoothely.  </li>
            <li> i have dehydrated yet oily skin, which can be very tricky to treat.</li>
            <li> so i dont need as much concealer.</li>
            <li> and I did not see much of a difference in puffiness.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it worked really well as a night cream</li>
            <li> Results are also much quicker than I imagined.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone looking for an eye cream with real results.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t sleep a whole lot.</li>
            <li> I am very sad!&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely, Lubov</li>
            <li> It is non greasy and absorbs into your skin fast.</li>
            <li> The that I&#x27;ve noticed in this short a time is that the skin in my eye area feels smooth and tighter.  </li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t really noticed much difference.  </li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t really feel it while wearing it.  </li>
            <li> The cream is white (of course) and smooth.</li>
            <li> It absorbs really well</li>
            <li> but, I can&#x27;t really blame the weather for the presence of sleepiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucky</li>
            <li> The  &amp;#34;Organic Herbal Infusion&amp;#34; of plant-based oils is a real plus.</li>
            <li> am giving this a 5 star rating because I know there is not much that can get rid of the circles I have, but this Radiance Eye Cream did lighten the areas around my eyes and did make my skin look and feel more youthful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This eye cream is very hydrating and goes really well on my eyes.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of the ingredients on its own like aloe, green tea, rosehip seed oil, etc.</li>
            <li> Since others have had a good experience with this eye cream, I don&#x27;t want my negative review to influence them.</li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t had positive results in all honesty it appears to have made under my eyes more loose than it was before using this product</li>
            <li> you found this review or any of my other reviews interesting or helpful</li>
            <li> First impression: I love the little bottle that the product comes in.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few days of use, I can state unequivocally that this product is hands down the best I’ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> any positive effects that people claim to see is most likely psychological.......</li>
            <li> I only wear make up when there is a special occasion</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do a darn thing for me - in fact, it seemed like my dark circles were more noticeable.</li>
            <li> Only natural and organic ingredients blended so if you have sensitive skin like me, this product will be appropriate for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> I have been using Foxbrim&#x27;s Eye Cream for Dark Circles and Puffiness for 3 days now, I love it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely did nothing, just some kind of thick lotion.  </li>
            <li> but, I&#x27;ve been noticing this particular winter</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any particular improvement.</li>
            <li> little does go a long way, so lightly touch the top of the container.</li>
            <li> This cream really helped to soothe the area, bring some of the puffiness down and gently minimize some of the fine lines and wrinkle from the tugging.  </li>
            <li> After applying Youthful Radiance Eye Cream, I wait a few minutes and then use a very light under eye concealer.</li>
            <li> The price is too high in my opinion though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To me, even a little improvement is better than none at all.</li>
            <li> wow!!</li>
            <li> Depending on how deep your lines are, you may see some difference but not totally gone, however if your lines are fine, you should really be amazed.</li>
            <li> The cream is rich in ingredients and wont dry out your eyes.</li>
            <li> I have had moderate success with these products until I got a chance to try out Hyaluronic Acid Serum by</li>
            <li> I will totally recommend it if you have dark circles under your eyes like me or if you just want to have a nice cream for your eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep going until the bottle is gone and update with more pictures and comments as long as it last.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue for a few more weeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve almost used the whole bottle up, and I used it really regularly for the first month or so.</li>
            <li> I started to see and feel a difference.this product is nice and thick</li>
            <li> Good day!&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this cream, unnecessarily.</li>
            <li> Once applied with my third finger on my right hand in one direction up to make sure that as little pressure was applied on the eyes below.  </li>
            <li> The cream goes on easy and feels velvety smooth, and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> No dark circles!!!  </li>
            <li> However, when i apply this at night the next day my eyelids feel healthy and when i apply eyeshadow it doesnt come on looking dry and patchy!</li>
            <li> This goes on smoothly and extremely absorbent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great so far after a few days of using it my dark eye circles are lighter.</li>
            <li> cream is intended to treat dark circles, puffiness, fine fines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Now the texture is light nothing super heavy and especially if you apply it the way I do which</li>
            <li> Puffiness, fine lines, wrinkles, dark circle, and hydration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is packed full of nutrient rich ingredients such as: vitamin C, vitamin E, aloe, green tea extract, jojoba oil etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If a product needs this type of fraudulent deception by manipulating the ratings system, that must mean the product absolutely will not be able to achieve the claims it makes.</li>
            <li> DO NOT waste money on this!</li>
            <li> This is the main reason I haven&#x27;t managed to use it consistently...since I tend not to wear much on my face at night (again, I don&#x27;t have dry skin, and I also prefer to let it breathe while I sleep), I just haven&#x27;t used it a whole lot.</li>
            <li> I have tried other creams and obviously because I am trying more I am still looking for something.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Foxbrim Youthful Radiance Eye Cream is made with all natural ingredients that helps reduce wrinkles, fine lines, puffiness and dark</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and it feels nice.  </li>
            <li> Left my skin extremely smooth and fresh and when I woke up the next day, it wasn’t any trace of rough morning look.</li>
            <li> Definately reduces dark circles and puffiness to achieve a younger more rested looking face.</li>
            <li> However, I have not seen a reduction in puffiness and have experienced only a little lightening of the dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice though, and I&#x27;m going to continue to use it at least until it runs out in the hope that it&#x27;s doing something longer-term!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried much more expensive eye creams and this is absolutely as good if not better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to notice slight changes to my skin as I&#x27;m aging, and as one would expect, the area I&#x27;m noticing them most is around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I also have a few fine lines.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This has such a cute little packaging.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to be clear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it at least twice per day (day and night) and sometimes even more.</li>
            <li> Received a day early.</li>
            <li> No harsh smell.</li>
            <li> What is the likelihood that several reviewers would purchase and review the exact same group of products on the exact same day?  </li>
            <li> All ingredients are natural as this is a trend for Fox Brim.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t completely get rid of bags but reduces them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely natural and organic</li>
            <li> It does not sting or irritate the sensitive eye area.</li>
            <li> She is also using Foxbrim’s Complete Anti-Aging Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This organic Foxbrim Youthful Radiance Eye Cream is a complete eye care system.</li>
            <li> All working together to balance, hydrate, repair, and restore your eyes natural beauty.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY DOES NOT WORK OR DO WHAT IT SAYS</li>
            <li> It is rare to find a product that works in such a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> Youthful Radiance Eye Cream by Foxbrim has been formulated to help address anti-aging and eye concerns such as dark circles, puffiness, fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My review is completely honest and is given only after personal, repetitive use of this product.</li>
            <li> However, I still don&#x27;t actually have dry skin, and the problem I seem to run into quite frequently when trying new eye products is that they are incredibly heavy and intense - far, far more than what I personally</li>
            <li> Not very helpful for my puffiness, but maybe I&#x27;m expecting too much from this highly recommended product.</li>
            <li> But, when that happens, I just take the extra and use on the top of my forehead because I am not about to waste anything!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product  especially for contact lens wearers</li>
            <li> This product is light, just enough moisture that does not clog my pores, which has previously been a problem.  </li>
            <li> there isn&#x27;t a strong artificial or lab scent but rather a light scent which I will assume is from the mix of ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks and find it to be very compatible with my skin type &amp; issue of concern (under eye bags), and can already see its positive effects!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works as well as the more expensive eye creams I&#x27;ve used but at a much lower price point.</li>
            <li> It is a opaque white cream, that really packs a punch when it comes to skin hydration and overall feel.</li>
            <li> It is a opaque white cream, that really packs a punch when it comes to skin hydration and overall feel.</li>
            <li> I have very very sensitive skin,  especially around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to change my original review from a couple of weeks ago, when I stated, \\&quot;I&#x27;m honestly not sure yet that it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> It does definitely decrease puffiness, but as for my dark circles, I don&#x27;t really see all that much difference.</li>
            <li> main problems are dark circles for night that i just cannot sleep and anything to help fight off aging is a plus at any point of your life after high school I feel.</li>
            <li> I am sometimes sensitive to smells and it will make my eyes water constantly if anything is in a cream that shouldn&#x27;t be there.</li>
            <li> The night after I first applied it, I woke up with noticeable reduction in puffiness and dark circle.</li>
            <li> I am sometimes sensitive to smells and it will make my eyes water constantly if anything is in a cream that shouldn&#x27;t be there.</li>
            <li> so if you have extra sensitive skin you don&#x27;t have to worry, they got you.</li>
            <li> I now wake up in the morning with barely any puffy bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t wow me enough for 5 stars, but I received it from Tomoson to review.</li>
            <li> I suffer from dark circles and puffy eyes because I rarely get enough sleep.</li>
            <li> All I know is that it better work because I am extremely upset that it&#x27;s so small.</li>
            <li> My mother is in her late 60’s and was excited to try the eye cream after reading about all the benefits.</li>
            <li> It has an easy pump system and you only need a little bit, so it will last long!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for 2 days, but I already see a pretty substantial improvement in my dark circles and under eye puffiness.</li>
            <li> But as for taking care of dark circles, not so much.  </li>
            <li> I squirt a little on to my finger and dab about half on of the amount on each eye and then light blend and dab all around the optical opening, eyelid and under eye included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m sure that it would encourage at least a slight improvement in the skin quality of your eye</li>
            <li> Most of the time when I came home my skin is dry and dehydrate and look so tired.</li>
            <li> Not sure I see a huge difference in the dark circles, bit do think it has improved the skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li> this is a thick white cream delivered through a pump system bottle that is used for under eye puffiness dark circles fine lines and wrinkles/crows feet.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used long enough to notice a big change</li>
            <li> This Youthful Radiance Eye Cream goes a long way, as only a tiny bit is needed under each eye.  </li>
            <li> So far, I still have dark circles under the eyes.</li>
            <li> As a 51 year old that has lived with dark circles all my life, this has helped with the aging process.</li>
            <li> But after one week of use, both day and night, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s all that much of an improvement.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get rid of my dark circles completely but diminishes about 70% of them</li>
            <li> I have not seen any difference so far regarding the dark circles and puffiness.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any change</li>
            <li> am always a little concerned when using new products around my eyes, that they might sting however, the Youthful Radiance Eye Cream does not cause any stingers.</li>
            <li> It is a &amp;#34;touch top&amp;#34; which is the only thing I wasn&#x27;t too crazy about because if you don&#x27;t do it just right, it will give you too much.</li>
            <li> My under eyes were completely flat!</li>
            <li> So I got a few new things to try -- and didn&#x27;t get beyond this one with my experiment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in arid Arizona and this part of a trio of moisturizers that actually helps my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Over the last several months, I have been trying out a wide variety of Vitamin C serums with hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li> It took a little while to dry completely and absorb totally.</li>
            <li> Seriously, it was a funny sight watching me walk around asking my kids and friends to looks at my eyes.  </li>
            <li> The problem is my skin is very dry especially around my eyes</li>
            <li> I did however like the natural ingredients, and the little pump.</li>
            <li> so it is hard to tell if it will really work or not.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it in the morning under makeup which i have amazing results as it seems like my concealer has not creased as bad since using this.</li>
            <li> but i honestly don&#x27;t have really bad circles either.</li>
            <li> Make sure to keep cold.</li>
            <li> The competition out there is harsh for this type of product and maybe I’ve jumped the gun early on my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> now - thought it didn&#x27;t take that long to make a difference -</li>
            <li> Results will vary, as mine did, but overall it did what I expected it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this creme for a short period of time, but I have already noticed a difference in regards to diminishing black circles.</li>
            <li> It takes only a teeny amount, too, only half a &amp;#34;push&amp;#34; of the dispenser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased more expensive eye creams that have done less.  </li>
            <li> all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container is on the smaller size, however a little of the cream does go a long way with proper use.</li>
            <li> , I look more aged, tired, and dark-circled than usual.</li>
            <li> At times other creams have irritated the skin around my eyes or left them feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> And the hydration it gives my otherwise dry skin is just what the doctor ordered!&lt;br</li>
            <li> And the hydration it gives my otherwise dry skin is just what the doctor ordered!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was shocked to see that a cream actually made my eyes look better.</li>
            <li> I used an entire bottle of this product with hopes to lighten up the hereditary dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from dark circles from lifestyle choices when I was younger.</li>
            <li> I have very deep dark circles and based on the reviews i was hoping that this product will work but even after 2 weeks of using it there is no difference</li>
            <li> Finally I have found an eye cream that DOES get rid of the dark circles under one&#x27;s eyes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the eye cream for the past week and like the results so far.</li>
            <li> Im currently using it for the dark circles under my eyes..</li>
            <li> - It&#x27;s a very tiny container, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> with a lot of facial products I&#x27;ve reviewed, a little bit goes a long way with this one as well.  </li>
            <li> #34;you look like you&#x27;ve got two black eyes&amp;#34;, if I haven&#x27;t had enough sleep.</li>
            <li> But not all of it some of the black and blue is still under my eye.  </li>
            <li> but I have to say I have only been using this product for less than two weeks.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day and am finding my eyes looking less tired and more awake without the dark circles and bags I usually carry around all day long.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is very soothing for tired dry eyes.</li>
            <li> It is a white, thinner type of moisturizer with little to no scent to it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t yet have puffiness beneath my eyes, but I have major dark circles that are made darker by my pale skin.</li>
            <li> Just a small amount of this cream goes a long way so this bottle should last a while.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I hope it&#x27;ll work out for anyone who tries it as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent three or four times the purchase price on creams that don&#x27;t do a thing for circles and puffiness.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can be assured that there are absolutely no silicones, parabens, additives or fillers used.</li>
            <li> The eye cream is soothing for tired eyes and provides moisture which really makes your eyes pop.</li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times</li>
            <li> and I see something but not much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the product for a few days.  </li>
            <li> organic eye cream has key plant based ingredient like Aloe, Jojoba Oil, Grapeseed Oil, Rosehip Seed Oil, Green Tea, Vitamin C, Vitamin E, and Tamanu Oil.</li>
            <li> The puffy bags truly aged my face.</li>
            <li> The puffiness tamed down some, but not completely.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was due to a few nights of little sleep, but ultimately after a week my eyes looked worse than ever.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my eyes are not as puffy in the morning, my dark circles are a little bit lighter and that they my eye area is still moisturized the next morning.</li>
            <li> My eye wrinkles decreased a bit, although I&#x27;m not sure that didn&#x27;t just come from moisturization of my face as a whole with several products.</li>
            <li> I thought they sent me a sample, and not a full size product, as the product is packaged in a tiny, half ounce bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wasted a lot of money on eye creams to reduce medicine created bags and dark circles, and this is the only one that works!</li>
            <li> one major complaint I have is that it doesn&#x27;t sit well under makeup, and since that&#x27;s a touted benefit</li>
            <li> Allow me to upgrade my previous review from 3 to 4 stars, as I believe I do now see improvement from the deep, dark circles that were under my eyes, as well as less wrinkles.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not an immediate fix and didn&#x27;t give me the results I can get with other products.  </li>
            <li> ( I have other experiences with eye cream, they were sticky)</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t break me out like a lot of other products do.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Rip off don&#x27;t buy unless you want to pay $14.00 for a small tiny bottle.  </li>
            <li> Other eye creams feel cooling or tightening after application, where I felt nothing after applying this.  </li>
            <li> I go makeup-free or nights when my skin is feeling a little dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent to this is very minimal, almost no scent at</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent to this is very minimal</li>
            <li> and I already see less black circles and little wrinkles are starting to go away</li>
            <li> Not worth the steep price for such a small amount.</li>
            <li> Just a little dab on your finger tip and applied gently around your eyes will help fight nasty dark circles, puffyness and those pesky fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It makes me look less tired and old, and I do appreciate that!</li>
            <li> I have been plagued with dark circles all my life so whenever I find a product that claims it can help in aiding the reduction of it</li>
            <li> My dark circles (hereditary) are visibly brighter</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything for my dark circles or puffiness.</li>
            <li> My eyes are as dark and puffy as ever.</li>
            <li> I have heard others say they also use it on there face for dark spots</li>
            <li> is was hopping that it would have on my dark circles.</li>
            <li> and- at least instantly - does do what it claims in boosting radiance.</li>
            <li> eye cream helps reduce under eye puffiness and reduce the look of dark circles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; products and not one helped my dark circles before I found this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had dark circles and bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Dark circles under the eyes have not disappeared, and in the morning from the swollen eye cream.</li>
            <li> Even though my mother does not have dark circles under her eyes the under eye area appears brighter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before: I have dark circles and some puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have dark circles under my eyes, my father had them also</li>
            <li> it does moisturize the eye area, but i have not noticed any reduction in the appearance of lines or puffiness or dark circles.  </li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t notice anything with reduction of the dark circles.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that i have noticed my dark circles improving</li>
            <li> Also, after a few uses the pump stopped working &amp; the bottle felt empty.  </li>
            <li> My under eye bags have decreased considerably and the dark circles have diminished, as well.  </li>
            <li> After a few days I did notice a tightening of my skin around my eyes but again, not much for the circles.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> With old age comes tired, puffy eyes with dark circles....</li>
            <li> No more flaking or dry patches and dark circles noticeably improved.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using this 2x&#x27;s a day has given me less dark circles and brighter skin around my eyes -</li>
            <li> It has diminished the dry patches under my eyes that used to annoy me in the past.</li>
            <li> My eyes are less puffy and the dark circles are fading.</li>
            <li> My eyes are lifted and tighter with less baggage.</li>
            <li> The skin appears to have soften somewhat leaving the wrinkles less pronounced.</li>
            <li> Before application I felt around my eyes and they were slightly puffy and afterward</li>
            <li> My eye&#x27;s seemed to be less puffy and a bit brighter.</li>
            <li> I was hopeing for faster results considering the reviews of previous users.</li>
            <li> The pumps on half of my products did not work.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed in this product, especially given all of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I spent $14.00 dollars for a small bottle for a eye cream.</li>
            <li> Moreover, the cream does not penetrate well to the skin and when massaging slightly the skin a little while after applying the creme, the cream is rubbing off.</li>
            <li> There was no irritation or tight feeling.  </li>
            <li> would recommend this to anyone wanting a little brighter skin and a little less tightening around your eyes.</li>
            <li> bags seem to be getting less; eyes still have very dark circles.  </li>
            <li> I have had a little puffiness under my eyes for awhile.</li>
            <li> and I still see them a little bit</li>
            <li> I thought I would try something other than my usual Origins</li>
            <li> It came in the cutest little pump-</li>
            <li> I applied a little bit of it around my eyes at night.</li>
            <li> and I think I need a little touch up</li>
            <li> I have very dark eyes</li>
            <li> As I don&#x27;t have dark circle, so I am not sure if it reduce it or not, but it claim to do that too.</li>
            <li> I purchased the cream a few weeks ago, and use it nightly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this product felt a bit heavy to me</li>
            <li> once dried</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> After a few weeks I didn&#x27;t think it was working</li>
            <li> firm and supple feeling.</li>
            <li> The cream contains Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Aloe, and Green Tea.</li>
            <li> my full review, check out my blog: [...]</li>
            <li> me I got to test out Foxbrim&#x27;s Youthful Radiance Eye Cream with vitamin C, E, aloe and green tea.</li>
            <li> I received their Organic Youthful Radiance Eye Cream to test out a few weeks ago</li>
            <li> and I have been using everyday since.  </li>
            <li> like the fact that it has vitamins C &amp; E, Aloe and Green Tea in it.</li>
            <li> However the size was a little bit to small</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s dry and flaky and tired all over?</li>
            <li> I know it is something passed on but that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that I have tried things to get rid of them or at least lighten them a little.</li>
            <li> It contains Vitamin E, C, Green tea, and aloe!</li>
            <li> I did however think the size of it was a bit small.</li>
            <li> Very firm and supple feeling.</li>
            <li> While the outdoors hasn&#x27;t been the typical walk-in sauna, it has been saying &amp;#34;na, na, na, na, naaaaa&amp;#34; like a mean kid in the schoolyard causing weird dry patches around my eyes...</li>
            <li> noticed that only after a week of using this product, my dark circles were not as bad.</li>
            <li> Whoa--I have used this product in less than two days and am really shocked at the instant results!</li>
            <li> These days it&#x27;s hard to keep up with products that are being made.</li>
            <li> Which is hard to find in this day and age.</li>
            <li> IT DOES ITS NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> Sorry to say, but after a few days, little bumps started appearing around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> It does not affect my makeup in a negative way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weather</li>
            <li> I mean, it was in a matter of minutes that this occurred</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve included pictures for your amusement, I mean judgment.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I still look like I have black eyes.</li>
            <li> Not good at all.</li>
            <li> It isn’t too thick or too thin.</li>
            <li> Nobody can tell when I have late night Netflix binges!</li>
            <li> Not happy,  it didn&#x27;t perform for me as stated.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been approximately 1 week</li>
            <li> and I have not experienced any adverse effects from the cream.  </li>
            <li> I have allergies so the dark circles can be bad at times.</li>
            <li> and i still do not see a dramatic effect</li>
            <li> I felt them again and felt a dramatic change.</li>
            <li> and they all failed me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sticking with it (sorry e.l.f.</li>
            <li> This made my eye bags look worse!</li>
            <li> I am not impressed by this cream.</li>
            <li> I have horrible dark circles under my eyes that doesn&#x27;t go away no matter what I do.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical because I have tried everything (store bought and home remedies)</li>
            <li> BUT again, i don&#x27;t have bad wrinkles either.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy if you have bad wrinkles, you would be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me :(.</li>
            <li> Very unlikely!  </li>
            <li> and that was a bad mistake!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this stuff - I use it twice a day and am finding my eyes looking less tired and more awake without the dark circles and bags I usually carry around all day long.  The cream is soft and light so it easily adsorbs into the skin around my eyes.  It has a light scent that I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this 2x&#x27;s a day has given me less dark circles and brighter skin around my eyes - I would recommend this to other people - Love this eye cream!!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I have had a little puffiness under my eyes for awhile. I have used this product for almost three weeks and I can definitely see a difference under my eyes. I have nothing but great things to say about this product.....I love it just about sums it all up!</li>
            <li> It may have done something but I really can&#x27;t tell for sure. Don&#x27;t buy if you have bad wrinkles, you would be disappointed. Tiny crows feet is my problem and I still see them a little bit</li>
            <li> I used an entire bottle of this product with hopes to lighten up the hereditary dark circles under my eyes.  I wasn&#x27;t convinced it was working... until I ran out.  I&#x27;ve been without it for 2 weeks and in the past week it has become incredibly evident that it was definitely working.  I&#x27;m here now to order another bottle asap!</li>
            <li> Not happy,  it didn&#x27;t perform for me as stated.</li>
            <li> This cream is amazing! My eyes are lifted and tighter with less baggage. I received this product for review.</li>
            <li> Not very helpful for my puffiness, but maybe I&#x27;m expecting too much from this highly recommended product.</li>
            <li> for the short time that I used it, I seemed to see some improvement. However the size was a little bit to small so I wasn&#x27;t able to use it for very long.</li>
            <li> Finally a product that delivers great results on 65 year old hooded, droopy eyelids!  I have been using the product twice a day for about a week and I am extremely happy with the results. My eyes are looking better and better with each passing day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to change my original review from a couple of weeks ago, when I stated, \\&quot;I&#x27;m honestly not sure yet that it&#x27;s working. It may need more time and regular use. So far, I still have dark circles under the eyes. The package did arrive on time and intact.\\&quot;    Allow me to upgrade my previous review from 3 to 4 stars, as I believe I do now see improvement from the deep, dark circles that were under my eyes, as well as less wrinkles. I think it&#x27;s actually plumped up the undereye skin a bit.</li>
            <li> I have been plagued with dark circles all my life so whenever I find a product that claims it can help in aiding the reduction of it then I am one to try it. Foxbrim Youthful Radiance Eye Cream is made with all natural ingredients that helps reduce wrinkles, fine lines, puffiness and dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Foxbrim Youthful Radiance Eye Cream for almost two weeks now. I have noticed that my eyes are not as puffy in the morning, my dark circles are a little bit lighter and that they my eye area is still moisturized the next morning. I love the fact that the eye cream comes in a pump and one pump is enough to do both eyes. The eye cream reminds me of a light moisturizer and absorbs quickly into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the fact that Foxbrim offers a 90 day money back guarantee if you are not 100% satisfied with their product. This way you can try their product and if you don&#x27;t get the desired results you can return it, no questions asked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> What I loved about this eye cream is that it&#x27;s light and quickly absorbs into the skin area around my eyes and doesn&#x27;t have an offending scent. I am sometimes sensitive to smells and it will make my eyes water constantly if anything is in a cream that shouldn&#x27;t be there. So, I can absolutely tell you that I was able to use this cream without any problems, which is a big deal for me.  One of those great finds in my Foxbrim Youthful Radiance Eye Cream. As you all may know I am always in search for the best yet financially friendly beauty, health and fashion items for us savvy beauty gals. Today I am bringing the most fun I have had rating beauty items. Yes, I had a blast rating this product. Why? Because my eyes felt awake. Seriously, it was a funny sight watching me walk around asking my kids and friends to looks at my eyes.  5 stars!!!</li>
            <li> Over the last several months, I have been trying out a wide variety of Vitamin C serums with hyaluronic acid. I have had moderate success with these products until I got a chance to try out Hyaluronic Acid Serum by foxbrim&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It has a semi-thick texture to it, and it applies evenly. I paid particular attention to applying it to my forehead, as that is where most of my wrinkles stand out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few days of use, I can state unequivocally that this product is hands down the best I’ve tried so far. You can literally feel the skin tighten after applying it. It is not sticky and absorbs nicely. The competition out there is harsh for this type of product and maybe I’ve jumped the gun early on my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, that is the way it is. Unless someone else comes along and produces a better product, this one will stay at the top of my list.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed in this product, especially given all of the positive reviews. It worked well for hydration and felt good when applied, but did absolutely nothing for my under eye bags or darkness. I gave it two weeks and decided to give up.</li>
            <li> I had a chance to try out this eye cream and am glad I did. I suffer from dark circles and puffy eyes because I rarely get enough sleep. I wanted to find something that would actually work.  I use a lot of the ingredients on its own like aloe, green tea, rosehip seed oil, etc. with great outcomes so I had good expectations for this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream has a whipped consistency and soaks into your skin right away so you can feel it start to moisturize your eye area. 1 pump is enough for me to cover the area of one eye. I like that there isn&#x27;t a strong artificial or lab scent but rather a light scent which I will assume is from the mix of ingredients. The night after I first applied it, I woke up with noticeable reduction in puffiness and dark circle. With a weeks use, my eye area looked brighter and more rested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foxbrim&#x27;s eye cream worked well for me and its ingredients are pretty awesome. I hope it&#x27;ll work out for anyone who tries it as well.</li>
            <li> Youthful Radiance Eye Cream” is smooth, light and leaves not residue on the hands. Once applied with my third finger on my right hand in one direction up to make sure that as little pressure was applied on the eyes below.  The applicator is great also it comes out with one push, with just the right amount to apply to the eye area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for some weeks. I&#x27;ve used it at least twice per day (day and night) and sometimes even more. Unfortunately, I still look like I have black eyes. It doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Received a day early. Whoa--I have used this product in less than two days and am really shocked at the instant results! My dark circles (hereditary) are visibly brighter and I don&#x27;t have to fix my makeup throughout the day. This is a miracle!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for 2 days, but I already see a pretty substantial improvement in my dark circles and under eye puffiness. I was very skeptical because I have tried everything (store bought and home remedies) and they all failed me. I can&#x27;t wait to see how much more it improves my under eye area over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI - It&#x27;s a very tiny container, but a little goes a long way. It&#x27;s not greasy at all and absorbs quickly. No harsh smell. I can&#x27;t smell it at all.</li>
            <li> This cream is da bomb! I&#x27;ve spent three or four times the purchase price on creams that don&#x27;t do a thing for circles and puffiness. This cream is changing my morning routine. After applying Youthful Radiance Eye Cream, I wait a few minutes and then use a very light under eye concealer. Circles - gone! Purriness - gone! I even see some reduction in fine lines. I am one happy camper.</li>
            <li> Waiti ng for results still but the cream is easy to apply and smooth. I suffer from dark circles from lifestyle choices when I was younger.</li>
            <li> Great product. I need to use it longer to see how effective it is. It arrived fast.</li>
            <li> Absolutely did nothing, just some kind of thick lotion.  Also, after a few uses the pump stopped working &amp; the bottle felt empty.  DO NOT waste money on this!</li>
            <li> gave me eyelid dermatitis, but seemed to smooth the lines around my eyes</li>
            <li> Works as well as the more expensive eye creams I&#x27;ve used but at a much lower price point.</li>
            <li> Good eye cream product. Works well with me.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do a darn thing for me - in fact, it seemed like my dark circles were more noticeable. I did however like the natural ingredients, and the little pump. Maybe too hopeful with the price. The positive reviews seem to throw it off.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this product . It didn&#x27;t do anything for my dark circles or puffiness. I won&#x27;t buy this product again</li>
            <li> Ok I&#x27;m not one to rave about eye cream, but this one is it for me. I&#x27;m an Eminence user, and I love my Neroli and Plum eye creams from Eminence but, I&#x27;ve been noticing this particular winter, I look more aged, tired, and dark-circled than usual. So I got a few new things to try -- and didn&#x27;t get beyond this one with my experiment. I am still under-rested and I&#x27;m still the age that I am, but this actually does brighten my eyes. I&#x27;m sticking with it (sorry e.l.f. and Serumtologie - maybe I&#x27;ll try those another day). I&#x27;ve been using this Foxtrim product for a couple of weeks now - thought it didn&#x27;t take that long to make a difference - and I&#x27;m going to stick with it. It makes me look less tired and old, and I do appreciate that!</li>
            <li> this is the best product that i have every brought for your eye it really work great just like they said and it does not hurt or burn your face&lt;br /&gt;it goes on  easy and feel great i love it and will buy it again</li>
            <li> I guess my bags are too well formed to change much.  I&#x27;ve used most of the bottle and see no difference in anything.  Maybe this is only for younger people so they don&#x27;t develop the droopies.  It might not work on men either.  Sure didn&#x27;t for this guy.</li>
            <li> I have very dark eyes and this cream has moisturized the area nicely to create more of an even look. Look more awake and better overall.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try something other than my usual Origins No Puffery Eye Gel. What a huge mistake that was! This made my eye bags look worse! At first I thought it was due to a few nights of little sleep, but ultimately after a week my eyes looked worse than ever.</li>
            <li> Have noticed some improvement on my under eyes. Haven&#x27;t used long enough to notice a big change</li>
            <li> I have not seen any difference around my eyes, especially the puffiness.</li>
            <li> I see no  difference now that I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of weeks...at first it felt like it was tighening..but not now.</li>
            <li> Made no difference at all. My eyes are as dark and puffy as ever. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have heard amazing stuff on this cream. I have heard others say they also use it on there face for dark spots and they say it really works great. I am writing a review to get this product free.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any particular improvement. It smells nice though, and I&#x27;m going to continue to use it at least until it runs out in the hope that it&#x27;s doing something longer-term!</li>
            <li> Sorry to say, but after a few days, little bumps started appearing around my eyes.  Couldn&#x27;t take a chance on continuing it after that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and feels good on your skin. Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any change but I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> Beware of the  reviews for this product.  I have found that there are reviewers giving this a 5-star rating. By itself that would be great but these reviewers have also reviewed within a day of each other the same exact products.  What is the likelihood that several reviewers would purchase and review the exact same group of products on the exact same day?  Very unlikely!  Buyer beware!  If a product needs this type of fraudulent deception by manipulating the ratings system, that must mean the product absolutely will not be able to achieve the claims it makes.</li>
            <li> My hubby started wanting to use a eye cream I read the reviews and ordered it. He likes it. Uses it at night and in the am, it&#x27;s nice and absorbs well</li>
            <li> I like how the cream feels and it&#x27;s perfect for my skin. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Very good product!!!!</li>
            <li> The packaging is tiny, cute and travel friendly. As you can see the cream looks like white and after applying this on the skin, it absorbed super fast and hydrates well. It has slightly cool effect that calm the puffy eyes.The scent is light and nice too. As I don&#x27;t have dark circle, so I am not sure if it reduce it or not, but it claim to do that too.</li>
            <li> Just received, love this product line.  Very affordable, well packaged, goes on smoothely.  Will share more after more use.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely fallen in love with this eye cream. It is a opaque white cream, that really packs a punch when it comes to skin hydration and overall feel. After washing my face at night, I apply this all over my face. It&#x27;s a eye cream, but I like the benefits and results it gave me around my eyes, I decided to use it all over. 1 pump from the bottle and I have enough product to cover my entire face. I dot it around on my forehead, cheeks, nose, and chin. Then I massage it into my skin, and head off to bed. When I wake up in the morning, my face is radiant. My skin is so soft and smooth. Very firm and supple feeling. And the hydration it gives my otherwise dry skin is just what the doctor ordered!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent to this is very minimal, almost no scent at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container is on the smaller size, however a little of the cream does go a long way with proper use. I love that this bottle has a pump, which makes using the cream much easier and more sanitary than other types of containers. The packaging itself is nice, I love the little fox in the logo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> What I loved about this eye cream is that it&#x27;s light and quickly absorbs into the skin area around my eyes and doesn&#x27;t have an offending scent. I am sometimes sensitive to smells and it will make my eyes water constantly if anything is in a cream that shouldn&#x27;t be there. So, I can absolutely tell you that I was able to use this cream without any problems, which is a big deal for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little does go a long way, so lightly touch the top of the container. It is a &amp;#34;touch top&amp;#34; which is the only thing I wasn&#x27;t too crazy about because if you don&#x27;t do it just right, it will give you too much. But, when that happens, I just take the extra and use on the top of my forehead because I am not about to waste anything! I figure if it can work around the eyes, it will help there too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can be assured that there are absolutely no silicones, parabens, additives or fillers used. Only natural and organic ingredients blended so if you have sensitive skin like me, this product will be appropriate for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will love the after effects but please give it time. It took time to get those wrinkles and fine lines, so use the whole bottle before you judge the results. I find that is the best way to make sure you used it all appropriately and gave it the benefit of the doubt. To me, even a little improvement is better than none at all. Depending on how deep your lines are, you may see some difference but not totally gone, however if your lines are fine, you should really be amazed.</li>
            <li> Must have. I bought it for my mom, and I love it too!!  worth every penny !!!&lt;br /&gt;Will buy it again!!</li>
            <li> I received Fox Brim youthful radiance eye cream free and for review.  It came in the cutest little pump- the kind tat is unique to Fox Brim.  I love the pump as it allows the user to control the amount.  The cream was white and creamy and very easy to apply around the eye area.  It left a cool feeling and had a very light scent.  There was no irritation or tight feeling.  All ingredients are natural as this is a trend for Fox Brim.  I wear contacts so I am constantly tugging and pulling at the skin around my eye area.  I also seem to have a lo of puffiness around m eye area.  This cream really helped to soothe the area, bring some of the puffiness down and gently minimize some of the fine lines and wrinkle from the tugging.  I would highly recommend this product  especially for contact lens wearers&lt;br /&gt; I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using &amp;#60;a href&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;BOTTOMc112c5d4f2fd346c390f00f6ca0df1e6&amp;#34; rel&#x3D;&amp;#34;nofollow&amp;#34;&amp;#62;Tomoson.com&amp;lt;/a&gt;. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> It has been over 2 weeks of me using it and i still do not see a dramatic effect is was hopping that it would have on my dark circles. I have very deep dark circles and based on the reviews i was hoping that this product will work but even after 2 weeks of using it there is no difference</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wasted a lot of money on eye creams to reduce medicine created bags and dark circles, and this is the only one that works! Make sure to keep cold.</li>
            <li> Pleasant on the skin, but no difference in dark circles yet.  I purchased the cream a few weeks ago, and use it nightly.</li>
            <li> I really love this creme.  I&#x27;ve only been using this creme for a short period of time, but I have already noticed a difference in regards to diminishing black circles.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  I hope it works as well as they say it does.</li>
            <li> Well my eyes are still puffy!  Won&#x27;t be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to notice slight changes to my skin as I&#x27;m aging, and as one would expect, the area I&#x27;m noticing them most is around my eyes. Including an eye cream or otherwise-targeted eye product has become part of my daily routine. However, I still don&#x27;t actually have dry skin, and the problem I seem to run into quite frequently when trying new eye products is that they are incredibly heavy and intense - far, far more than what I personally need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In that regard, this is a fantastic product. It&#x27;s very light - closer to a lotion consistency than a typical cream, and it absorbs quickly. It moisturizes my skin plenty, and it does seem to have a bit of a brightening effect, as it claims. I can&#x27;t attest to any real long-term benefits, as I haven&#x27;t used it very consistently, but given the light moisturizing quality, I&#x27;m sure that it would encourage at least a slight improvement in the skin quality of your eye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one major complaint I have is that it doesn&#x27;t sit well under makeup, and since that&#x27;s a touted benefit, I think it&#x27;s absolutely worth bringing up. I tried a few different concealers over it, and they all caused the product to ball and pill on my skin - one of my all-time greatest beauty pet peeves. If you don&#x27;t wear any undereye concealer, then this can definitely work as a daytime product for you, but if you apply anything at all under your eyes during the day, this will strictly be a nighttime eye cream. This is the main reason I haven&#x27;t managed to use it consistently...since I tend not to wear much on my face at night (again, I don&#x27;t have dry skin, and I also prefer to let it breathe while I sleep), I just haven&#x27;t used it a whole lot. If it didn&#x27;t have this issue with my makeup, I would have used it daily without hesitation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone that does consistently use skin care at night or doesn&#x27;t wear much makeup, I&#x27;d say this is a very nice eye cream for people that don&#x27;t need intense hydration. It&#x27;s a lovely consistency and- at least instantly - does do what it claims in boosting radiance. I&#x27;ll definitely keep using it on days I go makeup-free or nights when my skin is feeling a little dry.</li>
            <li> been using it for like 2 weeks now and I already see less black circles and little wrinkles are starting to go away</li>
            <li> I enjoy how this product has natural ingredients. When applying anything to your skin I worry about anything additional breaking out my skin. These days it&#x27;s hard to keep up with products that are being made. The eye cream is soothing for tired eyes and provides moisture which really makes your eyes pop. The pump allows for easy application and just the right amount of product to apply where needed. The cream is very light and not greasy at all, this product will not stain and make sure to keep away from your eyeballs. the cream helps to revitalize skin under your eyes, helps to reduce puffiness and to bring life back to your eyes. I enjoy how alive my eyes look after using the eye cream, I can also feel the skin tightening for a even more younger look. I have not seen a drastic change with dark circles, but it does greatly reduce puffiness.  The cream is rich in ingredients and wont dry out your eyes. This is also safe to use under your make up and after you have washed your skin using you favorite facial wash. The pump system is great, no product is wasted through a tube so you save money instead of throwing money away. For those looking for an alternative to help with eye puffiness and to keep your under eye moisturized, I recommend the Foxbrim eye cream.</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s living up to my greatest expectations! Yippee! As a 51 year old that has lived with dark circles all my life, this has helped with the aging process. The skin appears to have soften somewhat leaving the wrinkles less pronounced. Hope it continues to help. Feels good  anyway.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t completely get rid of bags but reduces them. but be sure to use it consistently.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is very soothing for tired dry eyes. It feels great when you apply it, like it is refreshing the skin around your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;This cream is intended to treat dark circles, puffiness, fine fines and wrinkles. I had been using this cream morning and night for about a week, when I woke up one morning, looked in the mirror, and was surprised by how bright my eyes looked. There were no bags or darkness under my eyes. It is rare to find a product that works in such a short amount of time. This beauty blogger was a bit impressed. I have been using the cream for a month now and continue to see the brightening effect, but haven’t noticed a perceptible difference in fine lines.</li>
            <li> I have used this eye cream for two days and am very pleased with it.  I have used it also on top of my foundation which worked out okay.  If cream continues to do the same I will reorder.  I am 76.</li>
            <li> It is a nice lotion, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or sting but doesn&#x27;t seem better than any other.</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t had positive results in all honesty it appears to have made under my eyes more loose than it was before using this product</li>
            <li> Finally I have found an eye cream that DOES get rid of the dark circles under one&#x27;s eyes. The first night I used it I had a wonderful surprise in the morning. No dark circles!!!  What can be better than that! I love Foxbrim products.  Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> The problem is my skin is very dry especially around my eyes and I straggle to keep it moist and hydrate enough, not only during the day but also at night. I think apply an effective moisturizer eye cream are very essential for both day and night.&lt;br /&gt;This time I applied “Youthful Radiance Eye Cream by Foxbrim” with great ingredients  such as Aloe, Jojoba Oil, Grapeseed Oil, Rosehip Seed Oil, Green Tea, Vitamin C + E, Tamanu Oil which worked awesome!Its package is nice with a pump system bottle. I applied a little bit of it around my eyes at night. It was very rich cream but despite it’s a rich cream, it absorbed very quickly. Left my skin extremely smooth and fresh and when I woke up the next day, it wasn’t any trace of rough morning look. My skin around my eyes was still very soft, fresh and moist.So, I decided to put it on before I put on my make-up and guess what! My make-up, foundation even eye shadow sat very nicely on it and it kept my skin moist and hydrate almost 8 hours after I came back from my work, it was still smooth and fresh. It was very unusual because most of the time any eye cream I put before my make-up, didn’t keep my skin moist to 8 hours! Most of the time when I came home my skin is dry and dehydrate and look so tired.I think “Youthful Radiance Eye Cream by Foxbrim” is a great eye cream for youthful radiance, treat puffiness, dark circles and wrinkles. I wish its package was a bit larger!</li>
            <li> It contains Vitamin E, C, Green tea, and aloe! And it&#x27;s organic. my eyes feeling great.</li>
            <li> This eye cream makes my eyes feel so moisturized without feeling greasy. Which is a problem for me to find one like this  bc i have dehydrated yet oily skin, which can be very tricky to treat. However, when i apply this at night the next day my eyelids feel healthy and when i apply eyeshadow it doesnt come on looking dry and patchy! Which i completely love! My under eye area also looks way brighter so i dont need as much concealer. So glad i was able to review this product, these are my honest opinions.</li>
            <li> Foxbrim was kind enough to send me a sample of their Youthful Radiance Eye Cream to review for Beauty Diva. I thought they sent me a sample, and not a full size product, as the product is packaged in a tiny, half ounce bottle. But I checked their website and the .5 oz container is their full size product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the eye cream for the past week and like the results so far. The cream is a medium weight, white lotion meant to be used around your eye area. I apply the eye cream after getting out of the shower, but before applying makeup. The package directions say you can use the moisturizer morning and night, but I&#x27;ve only been using it in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foxbrim&#x27;s radiance eye cream contains a variety of soothing ingredients including:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;aloe vera&lt;br /&gt;grapeseed oil&lt;br /&gt;green tea leaf extract&lt;br /&gt;evening primrose oil&lt;br /&gt;jojoba oil&lt;br /&gt;rosehip seed oil&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin E&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Radiance eye cream helps reduce under eye puffiness and reduce the look of dark circles. So, the Beauty Diva recommends this product, but wishes it came in a larger size.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working fairly well - Like it better than most similar products that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The cream is very nice and it did get rid of the dark circles under my eyes but not the puffy eyes.I am going to check to see if this company has something specifically for that.The cream has a nice light fragrance and goes on smoothly.I would have given it 5 stars if it had helped the bags !</li>
            <li> It works ok but it&#x27;s not an immediate fix and didn&#x27;t give me the results I can get with other products.  It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> this is a thick white cream delivered through a pump system bottle that is used for under eye puffiness dark circles fine lines and wrinkles/crows feet.This product did deliver moisture and a brightness to my under eye area however it left me feeling a bit tacky afterward. and I did not see much of a difference in puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;this product felt a bit heavy to me so I decided to use it as an over night cream for my eyes and that&#x27;s were I started to see and feel a difference.this product is nice and thick so it worked really well as a night cream and when I woke up each morning I could see a difference there was a decrease in puffiness and a better color to the area under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for over 2 weeks.no change.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and it feels nice.  But as for taking care of dark circles, not so much.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference at all.</li>
            <li> The Youthful Radiance Eye Cream by Foxbrim comes in a cute 0.5 fl oz (15 mL) container with a pump applicator.&lt;br /&gt;As with a lot of facial products I&#x27;ve reviewed, a little bit goes a long way with this one as well.  Just a little dab on your finger tip and applied gently around your eyes will help fight nasty dark circles, puffyness and those pesky fine lines and wrinkles. This product is packed full of nutrient rich ingredients such as: vitamin C, vitamin E, aloe, green tea extract, jojoba oil etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I really enjoyed this product and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This cream is amazing. Look at the ingredients!! wow!! I used this as an all over face moisturizer (it says on the bottle can be used all over) and it is better for a moisturizer with very high end ingredients/antioxidants but my eyes needed a different anti puffy product to make my eyes feel better in the mornings. Either way, this cream is most certainly a must have for every ones facial skin!</li>
            <li> Love the feel so far, but giving it a chance to see the results - I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I feel that this truly is a great product.  Saw results very quickly!</li>
            <li> This product is light, just enough moisture that does not clog my pores, which has previously been a problem.  Not sure I see a huge difference in the dark circles, bit do think it has improved the skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great so far after a few days of using it my dark eye circles are lighter. I started to notice a difference the next day. I am so happy I decided to purchase this cream that I totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> Really nice creamy eye cream , i used this eye cream for the night only ( i have combo skin)&lt;br /&gt;Nice ingredients ,cruelty free. My eye zone looks so pretty after use</li>
            <li> Did not work for me :(.</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream! It has an easy pump system and you only need a little bit, so it will last long! It really helps the puffiness under my eyes and makes my skin soft and smooth! I will definitely being purchasing again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; products and not one helped my dark circles before I found this. It takes only a teeny amount, too, only half a &amp;#34;push&amp;#34; of the dispenser. I&#x27;m in arid Arizona and this part of a trio of moisturizers that actually helps my dry skin. No more flaking or dry patches and dark circles noticeably improved. I combine this with Foxbrim&#x27;s Vitamin C Lotion and their Ultra Lift Night Cream &amp; Treatment. I just reordered!</li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times so it is hard to tell if it will really work or not.  I plan on continued use and will be able to tell at a later date.  The consistency is nice.</li>
            <li> I got this product free in exchange for my honest opinion of the product. I just wanted to be clear. Ith that being said I can tell you that I love this product!!! Immediately after applying the cream under my eyes I could tell that it was working. First off, I felt a cooling sensation under my eyes. Almost as if the cream was telling me it was doing its job. I noticed a change. Before application I felt around my eyes and they were slightly puffy and afterward once dried I felt them again and felt a dramatic change. My under eyes were completely flat! I mean, it was in a matter of minutes that this occurred and it was my first application of the product! Amazing!!  I&#x27;ve been using the eye cream for some time now and while I am not noticing any dramatic change with my dark circles, I can honestly say that the eye cream works beautifully for reducing the puffiness under my eyes. After application of the product my eyes look more alive and feel soft. This eye cream moisturizes my eyes while also making them look alert and healthy. I love that application is easy and a breeze. The pump allows for easy application and allows you to get just the right amount of product you need for your eyes. I also love that this eye cream is safe enough to wear under makeup. It can be used in the morning or at night and can be used as a facial moisturizer. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Great product. I love that it is made with natural ingredients which makes me comfortable using the product. I also saw great results. This product dramatically reduced puffiness and darkness under my eyes as well as reduced the look of fine lines at the outer corner of my eyes. I love the packaging. It contains a lot of product and each use only requires a minute amount of product so this bottle would last a good while.  I would definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this product for review. My review is completely honest and is given only after personal, repetitive use of this product.</li>
            <li> it has been about four weeks and I don&#x27;t see any change.&lt;br /&gt;i will continue to use this product and hopefully it will work.</li>
            <li> I love this cream, is so light you don&#x27;t even feel it when you use it ( I have other experiences with eye cream, they were sticky) is really smooth and the skin absorbs it really fast. It&#x27;s completely natural and organic so if you have extra sensitive skin you don&#x27;t have to worry, they got you. I look a lot more rest since I start using this cream. I will totally recommend it if you have dark circles under your eyes like me or if you just want to have a nice cream for your eyes. Since is so compact you can put it on your purse, so when I&#x27;m on the go and I think I need a little touch up I use it :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*If you found this review or any of my other reviews interesting or helpful, please rate is as &amp;#34;helpful&amp;#34;*&lt;br /&gt;*I receive this product to review it, but all opinions are my own.*</li>
            <li> Definately reduces dark circles and puffiness to achieve a younger more rested looking face. Results are also much quicker than I imagined. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for an eye cream with real results.</li>
            <li> Not good at all. I have been using this cream for quite some time now and have not seen any results. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Youthful Radiance Eye Cream by Foxbrim has been formulated to help address anti-aging and eye concerns such as dark circles, puffiness, fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that only after a week of using this product, my dark circles were not as bad. My eye&#x27;s seemed to be less puffy and a bit brighter. It seemed to smooth the wrinkles around my eyes some also. This is really creamy and feels good on the skin. Just a small amount of this cream goes a long way so this bottle should last a while.&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that this eye cream is organic and all natural. It has a good combination of plant-based moisturizers to soothe, hydrate and strengthen your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I use this under my makeup and at night after I clean my face. While it absorbs quickly, it leaves my skin feeling refreshed. It didn&#x27;t break me out like a lot of other products do.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this eye cream to my friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> This actually worked for me!</li>
            <li> Although I myself did not get any results from using this product, and wrote this in my Amazon review, I am impressed that the company issued an immediate refund and offered more help in correcting my eye puffiness problem. Since others have had a good experience with this eye cream, I don&#x27;t want my negative review to influence them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had dark circles and bags under my eyes. To the point where at times people have said &amp;#34;what&#x27;s wrong&amp;#34; after I&#x27;ve just woke up, or &amp;#34;you look like you&#x27;ve got two black eyes&amp;#34;, if I haven&#x27;t had enough sleep. So, now at the age of 45, I&#x27;m getting myself in shape and I thought I&#x27;d try to do something about this luggage.&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers have said that the bottle dispenses just the right amount. So, I happily pressed the button one full time. That was way too much.&lt;br /&gt;It does have a nice tingly feeling and it does tighten up the baggage and I think lightens the color. But after one week of use, both day and night, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s all that much of an improvement. I&#x27;ve included pictures for your amusement, I mean judgment. I&#x27;ll keep going until the bottle is gone and update with more pictures and comments as long as it last.</li>
            <li> You gotta be kidding me . I spent $14.00 dollars for a small bottle for a eye cream. All I know is that it better work because I am extremely upset that it&#x27;s so small. Rip off don&#x27;t buy unless you want to pay $14.00 for a small tiny bottle.  I thought the box was a joke.  Because I couldn&#x27;t even see the product it was that tiny.  I won&#x27;t buy again that&#x27;s for sure. I wish someone said how tiny the bottle was before I payed for it.  Not one person said it . Just that it works so we will see. Just got it today. Update review.  It works somewhat.  Most of the problems under my eye went away. But not all of it some of the black and blue is still under my eye.  I use this product twice a day.</li>
            <li> After reading alot of great reviews on here I decided to give this a try. I am a medical assistant by day and student by night so I don&#x27;t sleep a whole lot. I have horrible dark circles under my eyes that doesn&#x27;t go away no matter what I do. I started using this before I go to bed at night and again when I wake up in the morning. After a few weeks I didn&#x27;t think it was working so I stopped using it for a couple of days and that was a bad mistake! I still use this twice a day now. It doesn&#x27;t get rid of my dark circles completely but diminishes about 70% of them so then I just add a little concealer and good to go! Nobody can tell when I have late night Netflix binges!</li>
            <li> Used for 3 weeks.  No difference.</li>
            <li> Spreads well, does a great job.</li>
            <li> Great product and great service</li>
            <li> Now the texture is light nothing super heavy and especially if you apply it the way I do which I squirt a little on to my finger and dab about half on of the amount on each eye and then light blend and dab all around the optical opening, eyelid and under eye included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main problems are dark circles for night that i just cannot sleep and anything to help fight off aging is a plus at any point of your life after high school I feel. So depending on your need is how I would suggest the use of FoxBrim. I use it once a day and either in the morning or at night depending on my day. Also they state on the bottle that you can use also as a facial moisturizer and under make up. I only wear make up when there is a special occasion so I have not tried that or as a moisturizer, because I feel my face is fine at this point in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.

            <li> Good day!&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this cream, unnecessarily. a lot of good reviews read on the website Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m waiting for when I use it. But already two months have passed, and there is no result. Dark circles under the eyes have not disappeared, and in the morning from the swollen eye cream. I am very sad!&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely, Lubov</li>
            <li> Very comfortable, soothing, multi-tasking eye cream.  Love It!</li>
            <li> I have nothing but good things to say about this brand, as I have used some of their products and got great results! This eye cream is one of my favorite brands in the market, as it is very gentle on my under eye area. I use it before I go to sleep and in the mornings before I put on my eye makeup. It has diminished the dry patches under my eyes that used to annoy me in the past. It has also been such a big help with makeup application, as my creams are easier to apply and never cake up when I use this eye cream. This is a “great buy” and one product that I would probably repurchase over and over again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
            <li> I have been using Foxbrim&#x27;s Eye Cream for Dark Circles and Puffiness for 3 days now, I love it. My eyes are less puffy and the dark circles are fading. It is non greasy and absorbs into your skin fast. It has a pleasant smell and isn&#x27;t obtrusive. I would recommend this product to all my friends, male or female.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been approximately 1 week and I see something but not much. I was hopeing for faster results considering the reviews of previous users.I&#x27;ll continue for a few more weeks and if I still haven&#x27;t achieved what I want, the manufacturer will be notified.</li>
            <li> This has such a cute little packaging. (It&#x27;s a lot smaller than I imagined.) I love using this together with Foxbrim&#x27;s Ultra Lift Treatmeant cream. It&#x27;s a good moisturizing for around the eye area and keeps those puffy eye bags at bay. I think the wrinkles under my eye bags are just stubborn so I haven&#x27;t seen any results of them lessening yet but I do believe as with most products that you need to use them for months on end before you see actual results. This is a great eye cream and I recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> I received a bottle of Youthful Radiance Eye Cream by Foxbrim  to review for my blog. My mother is in her late 60’s and was excited to try the eye cream after reading about all the benefits. The eye cream comes in a small bottle with a pump on the top which is perfect for dispensing the right amount for both eyes while keeping the contents sanitary. No dipping your fingers in a jar contaminating the cream. The cream goes on easy and feels velvety smooth, and a little bit goes a long way. It absorbs quickly into the skin and does not leave a greasy residue. It has a very light scent that you won’t even notice when applied. It does not sting or irritate the sensitive eye area. Even though my mother does not have dark circles under her eyes the under eye area appears brighter. The wrinkles appear softer and the puffiness is diminishing. My mother is pleased with the results and will continue to use products. She is also using Foxbrim’s Complete Anti-Aging Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the product for a few days.  I like that it is light weight and absorbs quickly.  The that I&#x27;ve noticed in this short a time is that the skin in my eye area feels smooth and tighter.  Looking forward to continued good results with longer use.</li>
            <li> I have very very sensitive skin,  especially around my eyes.  As allergy season and other irritants flare up it&#x27;s been nice to use a a soothing and hydrating eye cream....</li>
            <li> Eh, it&#x27;s ok as a moisturizer. Not worth the steep price for such a small amount. Does nothing for circles or puffiness though. I used it religiously for months and can see no difference at all.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely fallen in love with this eye cream. It is a opaque white cream, that really packs a punch when it comes to skin hydration and overall feel. This organic Foxbrim Youthful Radiance Eye Cream is a complete eye care system. Designed scientifically to target all the biggest concerns all women face. Puffiness, fine lines, wrinkles, dark circle, and hydration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This organic eye cream has key plant based ingredient like Aloe, Jojoba Oil, Grapeseed Oil, Rosehip Seed Oil, Green Tea, Vitamin C, Vitamin E, and Tamanu Oil. All working together to balance, hydrate, repair, and restore your eyes natural beauty. Plus it has no silicones, parabens, or additives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very firm and supple feeling. And the hydration it gives my otherwise dry skin is just what the doctor ordered!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent to this is very minimal, almost no scent at all!</li>
            <li> Since I hit my 50&#x27;s I have been having a problem with brown tinged circles under my eyes as well as puffy bags. This is the first product that I have tried that truly reduced the puffieness. I now wake up in the morning with barely any puffy bags under my eyes. The puffy bags truly aged my face. I feel so much better about how I look.  I have seen some lightening of the brown circles but I have to say I have only been using this product for less than two weeks. To be fair I will give the product more time to work on the dark circles.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t really noticed much difference.  The jury is still out.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a week now and I have to say that it is AMAZING! I could see results after using the cream for one day. Which is hard to find in this day and age. And the fact that it is made with organic ingredients make it an even better deal!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this about a week and I already see great results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what happened to my eyes but they look brighter underneath. I have allergies so the dark circles can be bad at times. I was shocked to see that a cream actually made my eyes look better.</li>
            <li> It was very moisturizing and served well as a nice eye cream. My eye wrinkles decreased a bit, although I&#x27;m not sure that didn&#x27;t just come from moisturization of my face as a whole with several products. I don&#x27;t yet have puffiness beneath my eyes, but I have major dark circles that are made darker by my pale skin. I&#x27;ve almost used the whole bottle up, and I used it really regularly for the first month or so. I noticed no change in my circles.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is nice because it is light weight and you can&#x27;t really feel it while wearing it.  However, it does not feel like it is doing anything.  Other eye creams feel cooling or tightening after application, where I felt nothing after applying this.  I would probably recommend a different product over this one.</li>
            <li> First impression: I love the little bottle that the product comes in. It has a nice pump which releases a perfect amount of cream for under your eyes. The cream is white (of course) and smooth. It isn’t too thick or too thin. The cream contains Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Aloe, and Green Tea. All great, natural products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before: I have dark circles and some puffiness under my eyes. I also have a few fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After: The cream does not leave a tingling effect like some under eye creams do. I did notice that my eyes became brighter. The dark circles faded and my eyes looked more healthy and bright. The puffiness tamed down some, but not completely. I didn’t notice a difference in my fine lines. This cream IS a moisturizer as well, so it makes you skin feel healthy and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Thoughts: I liked the product. It left my skin feeling soft and looking great! The price is too high in my opinion though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I must let you know, I was NOT paid to write this review, but I did receive the item at no cost to me for giving my true and HONEST opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my full review, check out my blog: [...]</li>
            <li> This eye cream is good. It doesn&#x27;t wow me enough for 5 stars, but I received it from Tomoson to review. It does definitely decrease puffiness, but as for my dark circles, I don&#x27;t really see all that much difference. It doesn&#x27;t really have a scent to it, which is good, and it does work well under makeup. As for anti aging I haven&#x27;t really seen any results yet, but time will tell!</li>
            <li> Delivery very fast.  Am very pleased with the product and the price.  I&#x27;ve tried much more expensive eye creams and this is absolutely as good if not better.</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye cream for over a month now.  It goes on smooth and has a nice fragrance.  However, I have not seen a reduction in puffiness and have experienced only a little lightening of the dark circles under my eyes.  At times other creams have irritated the skin around my eyes or left them feeling greasy.  This eye cream does neither.  It absorbs really well and I have not experienced any adverse effects from the cream.  I will continue to use this cream until I have finished the bottle and will re-post if my review changes.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s dry and flaky and tired all over? My under-eyes. This summer weather, hasn&#x27;t been kind to my skin this year. While the outdoors hasn&#x27;t been the typical walk-in sauna, it has been saying &amp;#34;na, na, na, na, naaaaa&amp;#34; like a mean kid in the schoolyard causing weird dry patches around my eyes...but, I can&#x27;t really blame the weather for the presence of sleepiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucky me I got to test out Foxbrim&#x27;s Youthful Radiance Eye Cream with vitamin C, E, aloe and green tea. With its wonderfully rich consistency, it has given my under-eye just the thing it has been lacking - moisture. You would imagine that with such a thick creamy texture that it might be greasy or sticky, but it&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s perfect not soaking in to the skin too quickly nor does it sit on the skin like a football player&#x27;s face paint...it&#x27;s just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am always a little concerned when using new products around my eyes, that they might sting however, the Youthful Radiance Eye Cream does not cause any stingers. There is always that million dollar question: what about makeup? Is my makeup going to melt off my face if I use this? NO! It does not affect my makeup in a negative way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weather this season may have been unkind to my skin, but Foxbrim told the weather to &amp;#34;go fly a kite&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received this product for free to try and review.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to have the chance to review this product, and I gotta say, it was great. The formula feels amazing on the skin and it never feels oily or greasy like other produces do. Also, the company was great about shipping at a wicked fast time. Over all great product and great experience.</li>
            <li> It just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Im currently using it for the dark circles under my eyes.. so far its working GREAT! ... there lightening, and it doesnt make my eyes burn or tingley like a lot of eye cream does! Really like this stuff!!</li>
            <li> I love Organic skin care and Foxbrim knows how to do it right!  I received their Organic Youthful Radiance Eye Cream to test out a few weeks ago and I have been using everyday since.  It&#x27;s a super liht formula that leaves the skin around my eyes feeling refreshed and moisturized.  Works great on fine lines &amp; wrinkles too, love it!</li>
            <li> The pumps on half of my products did not work. Toner leaked in transit.</li>
            <li> I did pay for this and have just applied it for the first time. It feels great. My eyes have been so sore and tired feeling with the cheap cream I have been using. I hope it continues to be worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks and find it to be very compatible with my skin type &amp; issue of concern (under eye bags), and can already see its positive effects!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, I think one of the best selling points of this product - of which I was unaware (but would&#x27;ve bought it sooner had I known), is its &#x27;Ingredients.&#x27;  The  &amp;#34;Organic Herbal Infusion&amp;#34; of plant-based oils is a real plus. This Youthful Radiance Eye Cream goes a long way, as only a tiny bit is needed under each eye.  The cream is lightweight and absorbs quickly with no remaining residue.  After using the cream for 4 or 5 days and seeing no results, I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t give up and toss it aside (as I&#x27;ve done with other products), but instead continued using it and, happily, could see a visible, possible difference during the 2nd week!  My under eye bags have decreased considerably and the dark circles have diminished, as well.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to work.</li>
            <li> have only been using about a week....bags seem to be getting less; eyes still have very dark circles.  I think I need to give it some more time...really like how the cream dispenses from the container making it easy to control the amount and also to apply to eye area.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY DOES NOT WORK OR DO WHAT IT SAYS IT DOES ITS NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> This is a really wonderful eye cream....it has made my eye area softer looking and reduced the puffiness below in a rather short time.  I&#x27;ve purchased more expensive eye creams that have done less.  Impressive!</li>
            <li> I have dark circles under my eyes, my father had them also, it is just something I have always had and kind of been used to. I know it is something passed on but that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that I have tried things to get rid of them or at least lighten them a little. I have tried other creams and obviously because I am trying more I am still looking for something.&lt;br /&gt;I tried the FoxBrim Youthful Radiance Eye Cream for a little over a week to get a good idea of how well it worked, or didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I did notice after 1 use that my eyes seemed more bright. I did not notice a difference at all with the under eye circles. After a few days I did notice a tightening of my skin around my eyes but again, not much for the circles.&lt;br /&gt;I am giving this a 5 star rating because I know there is not much that can get rid of the circles I have, but this Radiance Eye Cream did lighten the areas around my eyes and did make my skin look and feel more youthful.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone wanting a little brighter skin and a little less tightening around your eyes. Results will vary, as mine did, but overall it did what I expected it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I did receive this product for review purposes, all opinions and thoughts are my own and honest.</li>
            <li> nothing special.  it does moisturize the eye area, but i have not noticed any reduction in the appearance of lines or puffiness or dark circles.  like most eye creams on the market, it&#x27;s mostly just hype.  any positive effects that people claim to see is most likely psychological.......like taking a water pill/placebo. the packaging is cute i suppose.</li>
            <li> My review: Foxbrim makes great beauty products. This is one of them. With old age comes tired, puffy eyes with dark circles....and that&#x27;s with a disiplined schedule.This goes on smoothly and extremely absorbent. It leaves the eye area hydrated. This has reduced the swelling and has smoothed my wrinkles a bit. I&#x27;m sure with continued use, I will see more improvement in this area.</li>
            <li> I have only 6 days using the cream and I really love, and most importantly I loved the attention received.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed by this cream. I have not seen any difference so far regarding the dark circles and puffiness. Moreover, the cream does not penetrate well to the skin and when massaging slightly the skin a little while after applying the creme, the cream is rubbing off.</li>
            <li> This is my take on the product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that it has vitamins C &amp; E, Aloe and Green Tea in it. And it&#x27;s Organic also. I did however think the size of it was a bit small. I will say though that even 1 pump was much more than I needed to do both eyes. It is a white, thinner type of moisturizer with little to no scent to it. It took a little while to dry completely and absorb totally. It can be worn under makeup. It did not make my eyes burn or sting at all. It did decrease the fine lines but I didn&#x27;t notice anything with reduction of the dark circles. Overall I liked it and will continue to use it. I would recommend it to family and friends.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is very hydrating and goes really well on my eyes. I&#x27;ve been using it in the morning under makeup which i have amazing results as it seems like my concealer has not creased as bad since using this. Also I use a tiny bit at night in conjunction with another eye cream i use. I can&#x27;t say that i have noticed my dark circles improving but i honestly don&#x27;t have really bad circles either. I don&#x27;t notice my fine lines diminishing either BUT again, i don&#x27;t have bad wrinkles either. I will say i love this for the hydration is provides under my eyes and for that alone its worth the money!</li>
            <li> I found it did not get rid of puffiness as I thought it would. Will probably not purchase again.</li>
