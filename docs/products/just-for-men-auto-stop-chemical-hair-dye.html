    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I followed the directions perfectly and everything worked out GREAT!  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what I did and the color match was perfect.</li>
            <li>Anyway,  when applying it appears it will be great.  </li>
            <li>The built-in comb did great.  </li>
            <li>Pricey but works great.</li>
            <li>The great thing though is that I can use part of a tube just to color the gray on the temples and sides of my head.</li>
            <li>The applicator on these is awesome, so easy,</li>
            <li>All that said it&#x27;s a good product.  </li>
            <li>Some good YouTube videos on application you can review to assist.</li>
            <li>Lasts a good month or longer.</li>
            <li>This stuff is so good</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>Good seller.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Exactly as promised, timely delivery, great price and convenience!</li>
            <li>and this was with the LIGHT BROWN formulation!!</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and works great.</li>
            <li>Opinions are 100% his own.</li>
            <li>About 3-4 months ago, I began noticing a very strong burning and itching when I applied JFM.</li>
            <li>The applicator is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Brown\\&quot; it would have better results.  </li>
            <li>It gets rid of most of it...</li>
            <li>The manufacturer is lying to get you to buy more when they say one time use.  </li>
            <li>And make sure to get a color safe shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Going with the lighter color did give it more of a gradual change though</li>
            <li>My husband tried a box of Just For Men AUTOSTOP and was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I have been using Just For Men for many years.  </li>
            <li>Outstanding.  </li>
            <li>I Love this product, can&#x27;t find this color at the store.</li>
            <li>The comb applicator easily screws on top of the tube.</li>
            <li>I love how easy this is to apply.</li>
            <li>OK SO I got a free sample of this product from Smile360.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great not to have THAT problem....as far as color...</li>
            <li>Is easy to apply and not drippy.</li>
            <li>It goes on a bit dark, but wait atleat 5 minutes, shower and it will be perfect.</li>
            <li>and it seemed to work fine.  </li>
            <li>every time it has washed out fine</li>
            <li>My hair is light brown</li>
            <li>Was a pain to use, cheap gloves were designed for sponge Bob</li>
            <li>It is darker than light brown but shampoos ligher after about three weeks.  </li>
            <li>It was suppose to be light brown</li>
            <li>T25 light brown seems to be discontinued.  </li>
            <li>I think I chose a color too light for him</li>
            <li>He was happy with how it turned out but will probably wait a few years and for more gray hairs to try it again.</li>
            <li>this stuff is not that good, goes on easy, but you don&#x27;t get good coverage, and the color does not last, most of the color washes down the drain when you rinse it out, after application</li>
            <li>and because it stops automatically at the right shade, you can immediately color your beard while your waiting for your hair color to finish!  </li>
            <li>I used it recently and I am very satisfied with the resulting color.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and works very well.</li>
            <li>This is a good single use unit.</li>
            <li>If you follow the instructions the product will do exactly what it says it will do!</li>
            <li>I much prefer the light brown &amp;#34;Touch of Gray&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The product works on oxidation so it is key to make sure the bottle is squeezed to the top when you recap and that you get as much product out of the applicator tip when you are done.  </li>
            <li>When he used the comb-in applicator he found that he would have liked it bigger.</li>
            <li>This came pretty quick without damage.</li>
            <li>This product auto stops at the right time.  </li>
            <li>Here I always find it right away.</li>
            <li>I used this to color my hair and it is very easy and simple to use.  </li>
            <li>but it did cover his grey and looked nice.</li>
            <li>I was totally excited to see this new AutoStop.  </li>
            <li>I have short hair and am able to get 2-3 applications out of one tube.</li>
            <li>The coloring result was mediocre at best.  </li>
            <li>First thing I have to say about this product is PAY ATTENTION when people say go for a lighter color than you think your hair is.  </li>
            <li>At first I was getting rid of it</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t use shampoo for my first shower afterwards....</li>
            <li>I would recommend this as well for a better initial coloring.   </li>
            <li>product did exactly what it said it would do.  </li>
            <li>This was the first time dying my hair.</li>
            <li>So in conclusion - Would LOVE to see this delivery but with the original formula, the color on this will go WAY WAY WAY too dark on you.</li>
            <li>If only the actual dye/formula were as good</li>
            <li>It does a good job of getting rid of the gray but there was a real total distinction of the light brown of my hair to contrast the very dark brown of where I applied the product on my head.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, there are some out there on the Net that rely mostly on natural ingredients, primarily henna.</li>
            <li>I have dark brown hair and chose the light brown since its better to be a tone under than a tone over your natural color...</li>
            <li>was in so much agony</li>
            <li>That helps because of the discount and because I don&#x27;t have to worry about remembering to recolor in a reasonable time.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>So I went with light brown and it was not obvious I had dyed my hair anymore.    </li>
            <li>no matter how much I smear in.  </li>
            <li>If you do this you can re-use this product 3-4 times depending on how much you use each time.  </li>
            <li>I just rinse really well with water to allow it to sink in longer.  </li>
            <li>and it works very well.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li>Fast shipment.</li>
            <li>Quick acting without obnoxious fumes and lasts a reasonable time.</li>
            <li>The process was super simple.</li>
            <li>That being said it does make a significant difference and people not longer can call me out for going grey.    </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>that the normal way to color your hair.  </li>
            <li>Everything about this new product seems to be provided by the lowest cost bidder and it shows.</li>
            <li>not with this new autostop product.  </li>
            <li>I noticed this before I was ready to go outside and decided just to do the whole head of hair to make even.</li>
            <li>I went medium brown at first and had multiple staring at me asking what changed.  </li>
            <li>I normally use it only to darken some very gray spots.</li>
            <li>The only positive thing about it is  that it did get rid of the gray.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After 10 minutes of letting it sit, I showered it out and my natural color was unchanged while only the grey was colored a light brown.  </li>
            <li>I have used the Just for men light brown shampoo in hair treatment before and it was a pretty close match that no one noticed it before, but the first thing my sister told me last, Friday 4th of May 2012, that the initially detail she noticed, on me, is how dark my hair was compared to last week.</li>
            <li>This is convenient because it allows one to actually target where the gray is in your hair so you do not have to do your whole head of hair.</li>
            <li>but I was able to find one at Walmart that appeared at least somewhat gender neutral and affordable.</li>
            <li>Much easier to get even hair color to the roots than their regular coloring agent...</li>
            <li>It gets far FAR darker than whats supposed to.</li>
            <li>I only use this for my beard so most of it goes to waste since you cannot reuse the application</li>
            <li>no mess, even distribution -</li>
            <li>Over several weeks, my skin reacted first with red spotches, then with welts.</li>
            <li>I do recommend putting a think layer of moisturizing cream around the edges of your hair where it meets your face though as it does dye your skin and can look like you have a funny disease on your head if you go over the hairline at all, especially noticeable with short hair.</li>
            <li>but I found particularly at the roots near the sideburns I just can&#x27;t get it to completely block out the grey</li>
            <li>but it certainly hides big white patches that I have on the sides of my head.</li>
            <li>and it turns back the clock in a very natural way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On the other hand, if you carefully read the warning labels on the product box, maybe the formula is the same and the chemicals are so strong that, overnight, you can develop a severe reaction after not having one before.</li>
            <li>so the areas where I applied it were MUCH darker than my natural DARK BROWN....</li>
            <li>Just give me back the old product with the quality gloves.</li>
            <li>I am 44 years old and was graying on the sides for several years, probably 25% or so gray.</li>
            <li>Just For Men website to answer a few questions to pick the right color for you.</li>
            <li>This product used to make my hair very dark when I first tried it a couple years ago.</li>
            <li>I use the lightest brown...while waiting for the 10 or so minutes it turns extremely dark and I get very nervous it is going to stay that way...</li>
            <li>I usually get my hair cut then put this in which is very simple with the brush, put the cap back on right away as the air activates it, and then just jump in the shower and done, too simple</li>
            <li>I prefer the auto stop to the original, it is easier and less messy.  </li>

            <li> I usually get my hair cut then put this in which is very simple with the brush, put the cap back on right away as the air activates it, and then just jump in the shower and done, too simple</li>
            <li> I prefer the auto stop to the original, it is easier and less messy.  </li>
            <li> 99% less of a mess than the old product and so much easier to do.  </li>
            <li> On the hair there is no visible grey, but then after simply rinsing with water (after 10 minutes)</li>
            <li> the same amount of grey hair still exists.</li>
            <li> As I mentioned earlier it won&#x27;t get rid of ALL the grey hair</li>
            <li> I only have about 20% grey</li>
            <li> However, I find that it doesn&#x27;t cover the gray as well or for as long as regular Just for Men hair color.</li>
            <li> I tried touchups less frequently and showering immediately after using JFM, all to no avail.</li>
            <li> this product does not erase all grey hair.  </li>
            <li> but it was actually lighter than he expected.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, impossible to screw up.</li>
            <li> I suspect JFM changed the formula recently as I had no problems whatsoever for the prior almost year and a half.</li>
            <li> this thing turned my hair deep DEEP brown aka black</li>
            <li> The result was subtle, no dramatic change in color, and the gray vanished.</li>
            <li> after I apply I use a DRY tissue paper to wipe back/away all the excess that gets on my forehead and ears.  </li>
            <li> I was actually worried based off the way it looked when applied to my hair that it would be too dark, but no color remains on hair at all after rinsing.  </li>
            <li> where my beard is but above the beard on my cheeks and down on my neck below my beard line.</li>
            <li> Followed directions completely, which isn&#x27;t hard.  </li>
            <li> At 62, my once very dark brown/black beard is all white.</li>
            <li> After applying to your grey areas squeeze the tube so that the product comes to the lip of the tube and then recap tightly.  </li>
            <li> developed a really bad headache, became light headed and almost past out due to this</li>
            <li> I hate grey even more.  </li>
            <li> The regular Just for Men would not cover the gray on my sideburns and temple well and was difficult to get it just on the new growth (after 5 weeks or so).  </li>
            <li> so I put on one of the two included applicator gloves and used the excess that comes out to smear around other areas of my head.  </li>
            <li> My frustration with JFM led me to investigate other products.</li>
            <li> My husband was skeptical but willing.</li>
            <li> and I usually get two applications out of it as my hair is very short (shaved).</li>
            <li> It does tend to have a stopping point, but that is too dark.  </li>
            <li> He thought it was going to end up being too dark</li>
            <li> so the color doesn&#x27;t look unnaturally dark.</li>
            <li> all the color just goes down the drain.  </li>
            <li> Its really too bad because Im now forced to go back to the regular JFM presentation of mixing,</li>
            <li> The smell did not bother him but he did feel a slight burning.</li>
            <li> less mess and no fussing.  </li>
            <li> it turned it to very dark brown almost black where the gray was on the sides of my head.</li>
            <li> It is much less messy</li>
            <li> Now here is the problem, this product is not light brown as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> then I realized it was a waste</li>
            <li> so it was a nice transition instead of shocking.</li>
            <li> However I have thin relatively short hair</li>
            <li> but it was almost black!  </li>
            <li> Not even shampoo, just plain water</li>
            <li> Usually 30 mins to an hour.  </li>
            <li> I find the color starts fading around 2-3 weeks and usually at that point do another application.  </li>
            <li> It says to leave in for 5 mins, but I usually leave for 10-15</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find one made specifically for men</li>
            <li> It was hard to coat the area evenly with the size that it was.</li>
            <li> I do not understand the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> Autostop is not a good substitute.  </li>
            <li> but alas, its not.</li>
            <li> The enclosed \\&quot;colmb\\&quot; is useless.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t agree with reviews that say the comb is useless or not helpful.  </li>
            <li> I have used Just for Men for a number of years, within a few hours of every use My head itches terribly and doesn&#x27;t stop for weeks...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stain the skin badly....</li>
            <li> I hate hair color.  </li>
            <li> This product is horrible!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all. Followed directions completely, which isn&#x27;t hard.  Open tube, attach comb, squeeze and brush through hair.  I only want to color my temples so it&#x27;s not even a lot of area to deal with.  Anyway,  when applying it appears it will be great.  On the hair there is no visible grey, but then after simply rinsing with water (after 10 minutes) all the color just goes down the drain.  100% the same amount of grey hair still exists. I was actually worried based off the way it looked when applied to my hair that it would be too dark, but no color remains on hair at all after rinsing.  Not even shampoo, just plain water there is no color change.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Just for Men AutoStop for about a year. It is easy to use and works great. I have short hair and am able to get 2-3 applications out of one tube.</li>
            <li> this stuff is not that good, goes on easy, but you don&#x27;t get good coverage, and the color does not last, most of the color washes down the drain when you rinse it out, after application</li>
            <li> This came pretty quick without damage. So for the product it was very simple to use. The comb applicator easily screws on top of the tube. This is convenient because it allows one to actually target where the gray is in your hair so you do not have to do your whole head of hair. Now here is the problem, this product is not light brown as shown in the picture. My hair is light brown it turned it to very dark brown almost black where the gray was on the sides of my head. It does a good job of getting rid of the gray but there was a real total distinction of the light brown of my hair to contrast the very dark brown of where I applied the product on my head. I noticed this before I was ready to go outside and decided just to do the whole head of hair to make even. I have used the Just for men light brown shampoo in hair treatment before and it was a pretty close match that no one noticed it before, but the first thing my sister told me last, Friday 4th of May 2012, that the initially detail she noticed, on me, is how dark my hair was compared to last week. So I think I will try a couple of shades lighter next time.</li>
            <li> Just give me back the old product with the quality gloves. Everything about this new product seems to be provided by the lowest cost bidder and it shows. Was a pain to use, cheap gloves were designed for sponge Bob and it did not cover the grey.&lt;br /&gt;No I don&#x27;t plan to use this product again!</li>
            <li> The regular Just for Men would not cover the gray on my sideburns and temple well and was difficult to get it just on the new growth (after 5 weeks or so).  So, I tried this.  It is darker than light brown but shampoos ligher after about three weeks.  The enclosed \\&quot;colmb\\&quot; is useless.  I put it on my finger and applied to roots.  It does tend to have a stopping point, but that is too dark.  Maybe if it were made in \\&quot;lightest brown\\&quot; or \\&quot;Sandy Brown\\&quot; it would have better results.  It is not quite \\&quot;fool proof\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible!  The only positive thing about it is  that it did get rid of the gray.&lt;br /&gt;I developed a really bad headache, became light headed and almost past out due to this product.&lt;br /&gt;I was in so much agony I almost brought my self to the emergency room.  Eventually after sleeping it off the pain&lt;br /&gt;and suffering did go away.  The coloring result was mediocre at best.  It was suppose to be light brown but it was almost black!  Such a misleading company, stay away!</li>
            <li> I hate hair color.  I hate grey even more.  This product auto stops at the right time.  Apply it and forget it.  Then rinse it out.  less mess and no fussing.  Purchased at Amazon with scheduled delivery every two months.  That helps because of the discount and because I don&#x27;t have to worry about remembering to recolor in a reasonable time.</li>
            <li> It really works. Put it on and wait and it will not over-dye the hair. It goes on a bit dark, but wait atleat 5 minutes, shower and it will be perfect.</li>
            <li> First thing I have to say about this product is PAY ATTENTION when people say go for a lighter color than you think your hair is.  I went medium brown at first and had multiple staring at me asking what changed.  So I went with light brown and it was not obvious I had dyed my hair anymore.    Secondly...this product does not erase all grey hair.  It gets rid of most of it...but I found particularly at the roots near the sideburns I just can&#x27;t get it to completely block out the grey no matter how much I smear in.  I leave it in longer than the 15 recommended minutes too.  Usually 30 mins to an hour.  That being said it does make a significant difference and people not longer can call me out for going grey.    YOU CAN REUSE THIS PRODUCT.  The manufacturer is lying to get you to buy more when they say one time use.  After applying to your grey areas squeeze the tube so that the product comes to the lip of the tube and then recap tightly.  I keep mine in the fridge but I don&#x27;t know if this is necessary.  I&#x27;ve also just recapped and kept in a drawer and it seemed to work fine.  After recapping take the applicator tip and blow all the excess product out in to the sink (or in your hand).  At first I was getting rid of it then I realized it was a waste so I put on one of the two included applicator gloves and used the excess that comes out to smear around other areas of my head.  Then flush water through the applicator tip several times and blow it out.  This prevents it from being clogged so you can reuse it.  The product works on oxidation so it is key to make sure the bottle is squeezed to the top when you recap and that you get as much product out of the applicator tip when you are done.  If you do this you can re-use this product 3-4 times depending on how much you use each time.  I find the color starts fading around 2-3 weeks and usually at that point do another application.  As I mentioned earlier it won&#x27;t get rid of ALL the grey hair but it certainly hides big white patches that I have on the sides of my head. So...to recap...go with a step lighter than you think you need.  Follow my instructions for re-use and you can save yourself blowing 8 bucks every 2-3 weeks just to keep your hair darker.  All that said it&#x27;s a good product.  It doesn&#x27;t stain the skin badly....after I apply I use a DRY tissue paper to wipe back/away all the excess that gets on my forehead and ears.  I also don&#x27;t use shampoo for my first shower afterwards....I just rinse really well with water to allow it to sink in longer.  I would recommend this as well for a better initial coloring.   And make sure to get a color safe shampoo.  It&#x27;s hard to find one made specifically for men but I was able to find one at Walmart that appeared at least somewhat gender neutral and affordable.</li>
            <li> I began using JFM about 20 months ago. At 62, my once very dark brown/black beard is all white. I used JFM for about 16-17 months with no problems. I got the desired shade I wanted and it lasted. About 3-4 months ago, I began noticing a very strong burning and itching when I applied JFM. Over several weeks, my skin reacted first with red spotches, then with welts. Constant burning and itching caused me to scratch my bearded area. The splotches and welts turned into open sores. I tried touchups less frequently and showering immediately after using JFM, all to no avail. I stopped using JFM 6 weeks ago and still have itching and defoliation of skin, not only where my beard is but above the beard on my cheeks and down on my neck below my beard line. I use a Gold Bond Ultimate eczema relief product several times daily now to somewhat alleviate the itching. My facial skin continues to defoliate. I suspect JFM changed the formula recently as I had no problems whatsoever for the prior almost year and a half. On the other hand, if you carefully read the warning labels on the product box, maybe the formula is the same and the chemicals are so strong that, overnight, you can develop a severe reaction after not having one before. I like my beard dyed. I am told I look 20 years younger. My frustration with JFM led me to investigate other products. Fortunately, there are some out there on the Net that rely mostly on natural ingredients, primarily henna. Henna reportedly has been used in Middle-Eastern and African cultures where many/most men wear beards for thousands of years.</li>
            <li> This product used to make my hair very dark when I first tried it a couple years ago. I used it recently and I am very satisfied with the resulting color.</li>
            <li> I had to purchase this because &amp;#34;touch of Gray&amp;#34;  T25 light brown seems to be discontinued.  Autostop is not a good substitute.  I much prefer the light brown &amp;#34;Touch of Gray&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It appears to work as advertised.  I only have about 20% grey so picked a shade that was lighter than my hair as recommended by Just for Men.  After 10 minutes of letting it sit, I showered it out and my natural color was unchanged while only the grey was colored a light brown.  Some good YouTube videos on application you can review to assist.</li>
            <li> Exactly as promised, timely delivery, great price and convenience!</li>
            <li> OK SO I got a free sample of this product from Smile360. My husband was skeptical but willing. I think I chose a color too light for him but it did cover his grey and looked nice. Going with the lighter color did give it more of a gradual change though so it was a nice transition instead of shocking.</li>
            <li> I prefer the auto stop to the original, it is easier and less messy.  However I have thin relatively short hair and I find there is barely enough in the tube to get the job done.  If you have thicker longer hair you might need 2.</li>
            <li> My husband tried a box of Just For Men AUTOSTOP and was pleased with the results. He had never colored his hair before and was nervous to try but had some gray hairs that he wondered if he could cover. When he used the comb-in applicator he found that he would have liked it bigger. It was hard to coat the area evenly with the size that it was. The smell did not bother him but he did feel a slight burning. He thought it was going to end up being too dark but it was actually lighter than he expected. He could have put it back on for longer but decided to leave it as it was. He was happy with how it turned out but will probably wait a few years and for more gray hairs to try it again. My husband received this from Just For Men for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% his own.</li>
            <li> This is a good single use unit. I normally use it only to darken some very gray spots. Wash it off in 15 min so the color doesn&#x27;t look unnaturally dark.</li>
            <li> I have been using Just For Men for many years.  I was totally excited to see this new AutoStop.  I read all of the reviews on here, but knew if it didn&#x27;t work that Amazon would give me a refund.  So I ordered the same color I have used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product did exactly what it said it would do.  I followed the directions perfectly and everything worked out GREAT!  The built-in comb did great.  99% less of a mess than the old product and so much easier to do.  I had no discoloring of my skin.  Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t agree with the reviews that say you must buy a darker color to get the color you want.  I don&#x27;t agree with reviews that say the comb is useless or not helpful.  If you follow the instructions the product will do exactly what it says it will do!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works very well. Lasts a good month or longer.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so good and I usually get two applications out of it as my hair is very short (shaved). The color stays in for a couple weeks before needing another application.  It says to leave in for 5 mins, but I usually leave for 10-15 and it works very well. I do recommend putting a think layer of moisturizing cream around the edges of your hair where it meets your face though as it does dye your skin and can look like you have a funny disease on your head if you go over the hairline at all, especially noticeable with short hair. Makes me look 10 years younger! I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I usually get my hair cut then put this in which is very simple with the brush, put the cap back on right away as the air activates it, and then just jump in the shower and done, too simple</li>
            <li> Guys, if you color your hair, this is the ONE to get.  Much easier to get even hair color to the roots than their regular coloring agent... and because it stops automatically at the right shade, you can immediately color your beard while your waiting for your hair color to finish!  Outstanding.  Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> I have used Just for Men for a number of years, within a few hours of every use My head itches terribly and doesn&#x27;t stop for weeks...not with this new autostop product.  Used several times and each time no itch...it&#x27;s great not to have THAT problem....as far as color...I use the lightest brown...while waiting for the 10 or so minutes it turns extremely dark and I get very nervous it is going to stay that way...every time it has washed out fine and it turns back the clock in a very natural way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend....</li>
            <li> I do not understand the negative reviews. This was the first time dying my hair. I am 44 years old and was graying on the sides for several years, probably 25% or so gray. The process was super simple. The applicator is very easy to use. I applied, waited 10 minutes, rinsed and then shampooed. The result was subtle, no dramatic change in color, and the gray vanished. Very pleased with this product. Go to the Just For Men website to answer a few questions to pick the right color for you. That&#x27;s what I did and the color match was perfect.</li>
            <li> The applicator on these is awesome, so easy, no mess, even distribution - If only the actual dye/formula were as good but alas, its not. It gets far FAR darker than whats supposed to. I have dark brown hair and chose the light brown since its better to be a tone under than a tone over your natural color...this thing turned my hair deep DEEP brown aka black so the areas where I applied it were MUCH darker than my natural DARK BROWN....and this was with the LIGHT BROWN formulation!! Its really too bad because Im now forced to go back to the regular JFM presentation of mixing, etc So in conclusion - Would LOVE to see this delivery but with the original formula, the color on this will go WAY WAY WAY too dark on you.</li>
            <li> I Love this product, can&#x27;t find this color at the store. always out. Here I always find it right away.</li>
            <li> I used this to color my hair and it is very easy and simple to use.  You simply comb it in with the applicator provided.  It is much less messy that the normal way to color your hair.  I used it on my mustache and had  no problem.  I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Pricey but works great. I only use this for my beard so most of it goes to waste since you cannot reuse the application</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, impossible to screw up. Quick acting without obnoxious fumes and lasts a reasonable time.</li>
            <li> Good product. Is easy to apply and not drippy.</li>
            <li> Good price. Fast shipment. As advertised. Good seller.</li>
            <li> I love how easy this is to apply. It is truly a no-mess application. However, I find that it doesn&#x27;t cover the gray as well or for as long as regular Just for Men hair color. The great thing though is that I can use part of a tube just to color the gray on the temples and sides of my head. I can get a couple uses from each box.</li>
