            <li>Like all of their products this is another great one and it abolishes blackheads if you haven&#x27;t allowed them to become tar pits!</li>
            <li>So there&#x27;s a good chance it may still work for others.</li>
            <li>This makes my face feel so good after just one use! :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a good, creamy consistency, and there&#x27;s something kind of nice about pampering yourself with a mask on the weekend.</li>
            <li>I love putting this on my face!</li>
            <li>amazing.  </li>

            <li>I tried this mask based on a Youtube recommendation and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  </li>
            <li>you will love it.</li>
            <li>My face looked very clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Feels nice, smells nice, but doesn&#x27;t seem to have much of a pore cleaning affect on me.</li>
            <li>However, it also hasn&#x27;t harmed my skin either and has a nice scent, is easy to wash off, and is fun to use for &amp;#34;spa nights&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Makes me feel pretty, and makes my face nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is great and it leaves your face very clean and soft right from the first use.</li>
            <li>I thought my face was clean until I used this.</li>
            <li>great product all natural and no ink inside the mask ingeredients washes off quiet well and would reccomend to many</li>
            <li>I use this about once a week when I remember, and it does a great job of calming my skin down.</li>
            <li>It left my face, bright, smooth, and clear.</li>
            <li>Dead skin Works great</li>
            <li>Great for your pores really works well, learned about this from my little sister.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried for years to find something to help with the large pores on my nose and cheeks and this does the trick.  </li>
            <li>leave it on for 10-15 minutes and then rinse it off very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s scented but not so much that it bothered me.  </li>
            <li>I imagine it would work better for someone who has less oil and pore issues, but it did nothing for me.</li>
            <li>This is one product I don&#x27;t think I can live without.</li>
            <li>10 minutes later it looked like old paint that was chipping off the wall!!</li>
            <li>It gives you a very deep clean Black heads</li>
            <li>This mask is really smooth, and dries slowly.  </li>
            <li>Left it either really dry or really oily.</li>
            <li>I bought this several months ago, I have oily skin and large visible pores and this has done little to help with it.</li>

            <li> It also takes a little longer to dry than I&#x27;m used to for a facial mask.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always thought that facial masks were a luxury item, but no more!  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t produce permanent results, but for a few days afterward my  skin looks healthier, my pores are less noticeable, and my makeup goes on smoother.</li>
            <li> Takes away the redness, reduces discoloration of dark spots, and helps with acne!</li>
            <li> I tried it and as it dried it was burning.</li>
            <li> Weird burning itchy feeling as it dries (for me at least).</li>
            <li> Doesnt taste all that bad on some toast with cream cheese, but please don&#x27;t eat it.</li>

            <li> I have never tried a clay mask before. I thought my face was clean until I used this. It left my face, bright, smooth, and clear. My face looked very clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I leave it on for 10-15 minutes and then rinse it off very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I accidentally left it on for 20 minutes (my toddler had a potty accident so I had to change his clothes), and it started to itch but it went away as soon as rinsed it off. Try not to leave it on too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I recommend this mask, especially if you have blackheads.</li>
            <li> Love an easy go to face mask! This makes my face feel so good after just one use! :)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin. Left it either really dry or really oily. Weird burning itchy feeling as it dries (for me at least). Will not buy again. Try at your own risk</li>
            <li> I love this product. It gives you a very deep clean Black heads Dead skin Works great</li>
            <li> I bought this product at walmart. I tried it and as it dried it was burning. then when I went to see if it was dry which was 10 minutes later it looked like old paint that was chipping off the wall!! When I rinsed it off it left my skin with red patches!!!!! BUYERS BEWARE! DO NOT USE.</li>
            <li> I love putting this on my face! Takes away the redness, reduces discoloration of dark spots, and helps with acne! This is one product I don&#x27;t think I can live without. I use it twice a week .</li>
            <li> This stuff is GREAT!!!! No irritation, no foul smell.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> This is the best clay mask!&lt;br /&gt;The smell is great and it leaves your face very clean and soft right from the first use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always thought that facial masks were a luxury item, but no more!  I tried this mask based on a Youtube recommendation and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  I&#x27;ve tried for years to find something to help with the large pores on my nose and cheeks and this does the trick.  The mask is creamy and luxurious feeling.  It&#x27;s scented but not so much that it bothered me.  It also takes a little longer to dry than I&#x27;m used to for a facial mask.  The end result, though: amazing.  My pores were visibly smaller after just one application.  I&#x27;ve used it up to twice a week with no dryness or irritation.  It doesn&#x27;t produce permanent results, but for a few days afterward my  skin looks healthier, my pores are less noticeable, and my makeup goes on smoother.</li>
            <li> Feels nice, smells nice, but doesn&#x27;t seem to have much of a pore cleaning affect on me. However, nothing works for me. So there&#x27;s a good chance it may still work for others. I have dry thin skin that gets easily irritated.</li>
            <li> Makes me feel pretty, and makes my face nice and smooth. I like to make patterns on my face, or make myself look like a cat. Doesnt taste all that bad on some toast with cream cheese, but please don&#x27;t eat it.</li>
            <li> This mask is really smooth, and dries slowly.  Works great for evening my skin tone!</li>

            <li> Great for your pores really works well, learned about this from my little sister.</li>
            <li> I bought this several months ago, I have oily skin and large visible pores and this has done little to help with it. Even trying to switch it from once a week to several times a week yielded no improvement. However, it also hasn&#x27;t harmed my skin either and has a nice scent, is easy to wash off, and is fun to use for &amp;#34;spa nights&amp;#34;. I imagine it would work better for someone who has less oil and pore issues, but it did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> great product all natural and no ink inside the mask ingeredients washes off quiet well and would reccomend to many</li>
            <li> this by  far is the best mask i have tried. you will love it.I USE IT ONCE A WEEK A</li>
            <li> I use this about once a week when I remember, and it does a great job of calming my skin down. It&#x27;s got a good, creamy consistency, and there&#x27;s something kind of nice about pampering yourself with a mask on the weekend.</li>
