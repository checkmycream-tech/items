            <li>Crayola is the best!</li>
            <li>I helped her put some on and it worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s especially perfect for beginners who have never used hair chalk before.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m a happy momma</li>
            <li>And what is surprising is that I loved it too.  </li>
            <li>it is good for about a day and its not clumpy.  </li>
            <li>This was a good idea</li>

            <li>Works great for weekend fun and washes out in a snap :-)</li>
            <li>This was our first experience with hair chalk and this was the perfect product to try first!  </li>
            <li>My daughter love these except</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>About 95% of it washed out of her hair, the rest took a couple more days</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure she will love it also.</li>
            <li>My daughters love this product.</li>
            <li>doesnt work as easily as i was explained</li>
            <li>Color was faded and light.</li>
            <li>The pink color came out easily with one shampoo, which is great since my daughter can&#x27;t have unnatural hair color at school.  </li>
            <li>she was soooo excited, as&lt;br</li>
            <li>It would be nice to be able to order new colors in the exact sizes for this applicator.  </li>
            <li>It can get crusty when the kids forget to clean up and cover up.</li>
            <li>You can easily use this product to play with fun hair colors over the weekend and</li>
            <li>I bought this product to use in my 8 year old daughter&#x27;s hair and we really enjoyed it!  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use and mess free!!</li>
            <li>Washes out easy and my daughter can use it all by herself whenever she wants.</li>
            <li>If it works, it will totally be worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it is super bright on someone with lighter hair, but for how dark my daughter&#x27;s hair is, I was pleasently surprised.</li>
            <li>This particular applicator made it very easy to use, with absolutely NO mess whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>if you keep going over the same section of hair the color gets even darker and its makes an even better finish.  </li>
            <li>The different colors (wish there were more than two) are clumpy and takes a lot of effort to finish an inch size piece of hair.  </li>
            <li>At first I was concerned about putting anything like this in her hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen some reviews suggest wetting hair first to make the color pop, but we didn&#x27;t have to do that at all.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried so many different brands without much luck.</li>
            <li>The top extension part breaks easily and is hard to pull through hair.  </li>
            <li>It colored hair like it said; but it also colored fingers, hands, rags and anything else that had the misfortune of touching it while it was wet.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has light brown with blonde streaks in her hair.  </li>
            <li>dirty is AWESOME!  </li>
            <li>the color was vibrant.  </li>
            <li>high lite</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and think it can be used for people of all ages.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s normal or not.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend it for a young girl who likes some streaks in her hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used professional chalk</li>
            <li>My 10 year old tried it on her brown hair and the color would not show after repeated applications.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 9-year old daughter over the summer</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my six year old.</li>
            <li>no mess either.</li>
            <li>She even did it by herself and made no mess.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s inexpensive, non messy and really, really fun!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it was by the same manufacturer or not, but I&#x27;m sure it didn&#x27;t say Crayola on it.  </li>
            <li>My little girl wanted to color her hair like the older girls she sees on TV and in movies, so we compromised with this product which allows her to have the hair color that she wants while giving me the peace of mind that I can wash it out!</li>
            <li>then back to normal in time for school!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, she woke up the next morning with big pink dye stains on her face in the places where her hair touched her skin over night, and it took several face scrubbings to get it off,  AND she was absolutely DEVESTATED because the whole product was JUNK and had to be thrown out!!</li>
            <li>It was not worth the hassle of trying to make it work right.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was going to be some piece of junk that my daughter had to have, but actually I was very surprised by how well it worked.  </li>
            <li>It actually works on my 6 year old&#x27;s brown hair!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve read some of the other reviews for hair chalk and many of them talk about how messy they are to use.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve only used the pink so far (the other color is blue), but it was easy to use and the color showed up well on her blond hair.  </li>
            <li>purchased second one for my 9 year old neighbor&#x27;s bday...</li>
            <li>The colors of the Crayola Hair Hi-Lights were vibrant and showed up well on her dark blond hair.</li>

            <li> My daughter (8 years old) has medium to dark brown hair</li>

            <li> I would use on dry hair and then after you put the chalk on</li>
            <li> We used the chalk on dry hair, and then curled it and sealed the color with hairspray.  </li>
            <li> There were a few loose crumbles, but overall the applicator (looks like a mini, plastic flat iron) kept the color on the hair and not all over the fingers.  </li>
            <li> Although they appear to last awhile, I&#x27;m considering ordering some other types of hair chalk and cutting them to fit this applicator.  </li>
            <li> so I was super skeptical.</li>
            <li> and it may  just be harder to wash well.</li>
            <li> The product began to crumble making a mess in the sink.</li>
            <li> That little holder?</li>
            <li> I use a little hair spray to keep the color longer.</li>
            <li> She could not stand the greasy texture left behind in her hair so she shampooed it out immediately.</li>
            <li> For the record, we&#x27;ve tried several spray-on temporary colors, pastel chalking, and one or two stick-type colors with poor- to mixed-results.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if that is going to work</li>
            <li> Color hard go go on.</li>
            <li> It sucks</li>
            <li> Oh well, at least it was inexpensive to try.</li>
            <li> but she has extremely thick hair</li>
            <li> Not impressed and definitely not worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a little stocking stuffer, an expensive one at that.  </li>
            <li> Not good.  </li>
            <li> It was also rather expensive for contents.</li>
            <li> color canisters are very hard to get out of the plastic holders they were in - and the color itself was oozing an oily horribly staining dye.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AWFUL!!</li>
            <li> AWFUL!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product did not meet my expectations. It literally looked like crayola was rolled on the hair. Color was faded and light. Not impressed and definitely not worth the money.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AWFUL!! The only reason I gave it a 1 star - is because there wasn&#x27;t an option for a lower rating!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color canisters are very hard to get out of the plastic holders they were in - and the color itself was oozing an oily horribly staining dye. We wondered if we got a product that had been damaged by being stored in an overheated summer warehouse, so we got it all cleaned up and put together, and let her use it. AWFUL!!!, she woke up the next morning with big pink dye stains on her face in the places where her hair touched her skin over night, and it took several face scrubbings to get it off,  AND she was absolutely DEVESTATED because the whole product was JUNK and had to be thrown out!! (Took me 2 days to get the dye stains off of my hands!)</li>
            <li> My daughter love these except the color comb doesnt work to well</li>
            <li> That little holder? What a joke.. I tossed it out. I just used the cartridges &amp;#34;as is&amp;#34;, and wiped a streak of chalk on my hair.  :)</li>
            <li> Not good.  Would not buy. Color hard go go on. Have yo repeat and still dies not work&lt;br /&gt; It sucks</li>
            <li> My daughter could put the highlights in herself but the chalk doesn&#x27;t stay on. I&#x27;ve never used professional chalk so I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s normal or not. The chalk was on her brush (and back in her hair) for a couple days and rubbed off on clothing. About 95% of it washed out of her hair, the rest took a couple more days but she has extremely thick hair and it may  just be harder to wash well. Overall I like it and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> My 10 year old tried it on her brown hair and the color would not show after repeated applications. The product began to crumble making a mess in the sink. She could not stand the greasy texture left behind in her hair so she shampooed it out immediately. Oh well, at least it was inexpensive to try.</li>
            <li> It colored hair like it said; but it also colored fingers, hands, rags and anything else that had the misfortune of touching it while it was wet.  It was not worth the hassle of trying to make it work right.  It was also rather expensive for contents.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 9-year old daughter over the summer and it actually works!  For the record, we&#x27;ve tried several spray-on temporary colors, pastel chalking, and one or two stick-type colors with poor- to mixed-results.  The colors of the Crayola Hair Hi-Lights were vibrant and showed up well on her dark blond hair. There were a few loose crumbles, but overall the applicator (looks like a mini, plastic flat iron) kept the color on the hair and not all over the fingers.  I&#x27;d buy it again!</li>
            <li> This product delivers what it promises.  My little girl wanted to color her hair like the older girls she sees on TV and in movies, so we compromised with this product which allows her to have the hair color that she wants while giving me the peace of mind that I can wash it out!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried so many different brands without much luck. Crayola is the best! It actually works on my 6 year old&#x27;s brown hair!</li>
            <li> Purchased for my granddaughters 6th. birthday and she&lt;br /&gt;tore open the package and loaded the cartridge &amp; began&lt;br /&gt;to high lite her own hair....she was soooo excited, as&lt;br /&gt;she had never had pink &amp; blue hi-lites in her hair.  She&lt;br /&gt;was dressing up for her birthday dinner at her favorite&lt;br /&gt;Japanese restaurant. It was a big hit.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased second one for my 9 year old neighbor&#x27;s bday...&lt;br /&gt;It is not until June....I&#x27;m sure she will love it also.</li>
            <li> For thirteen dollars I expected this to be bigger.  There is no size information on this site.  It&#x27;s like a little stocking stuffer, an expensive one at that.  I returned it and will be finding something else.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and mess free!! I would use on dry hair and then after you put the chalk on I use a little hair spray to keep the color longer. My daughters love this product. Works great for weekend fun and washes out in a snap :-)</li>
            <li> I bought something that looked just like this at Justice for my daugther. I&#x27;m not sure if it was by the same manufacturer or not, but I&#x27;m sure it didn&#x27;t say Crayola on it.  Anyway, she absolutely loves it.  And what is surprising is that I loved it too.  I helped her put some on and it worked perfectly.  it is good for about a day and its not clumpy.  the color was vibrant.  I thought it was going to be some piece of junk that my daughter had to have, but actually I was very surprised by how well it worked.  no mess either. I&#x27;d highly recommend it for a young girl who likes some streaks in her hair.  my daughter is blond and it showed up well after one application, but if you keep going over the same section of hair the color gets even darker and its makes an even better finish.  but again, its not necessary to do multiple times as even one application will cut it.</li>
            <li> This was a good idea but I don&#x27;t think there is a product truly for kids.  The top extension part breaks easily and is hard to pull through hair.  The different colors (wish there were more than two) are clumpy and takes a lot of effort to finish an inch size piece of hair.  It can get crusty when the kids forget to clean up and cover up.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my six year old. Big big hit. My daughter has light brown with blonde streaks in her hair.  At first I was concerned about putting anything like this in her hair. But it does truly wash out, with no trace.  It&#x27;s kinda like chalk, but you can see it in the hair.</li>
            <li> The color could have been a bit darker.  It was as advertised and I would recommend it.  Washes out easy and my daughter can use it all by herself whenever she wants.</li>
            <li> My daughter (8 years old) has medium to dark brown hair so I was super skeptical. I&#x27;m sure it is super bright on someone with lighter hair, but for how dark my daughter&#x27;s hair is, I was pleasently surprised. She even did it by herself and made no mess. She likes it and it keeps her entertained so I&#x27;m a happy momma</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use in my 8 year old daughter&#x27;s hair and we really enjoyed it!  This was our first experience with hair chalk and this was the perfect product to try first!  We&#x27;ve only used the pink so far (the other color is blue), but it was easy to use and the color showed up well on her blond hair.  The color stayed in place all night and it didn&#x27;t get on her clothes, the bathroom or anything it wasn&#x27;t supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read some of the other reviews for hair chalk and many of them talk about how messy they are to use.  This particular applicator made it very easy to use, with absolutely NO mess whatsoever.  The applicator contains all of the chalk, and you use it similar to a curling iron, pulling the hair through without having to touch it with your fingers.  We used the chalk on dry hair, and then curled it and sealed the color with hairspray.  I&#x27;ve seen some reviews suggest wetting hair first to make the color pop, but we didn&#x27;t have to do that at all.  The pink color came out easily with one shampoo, which is great since my daughter can&#x27;t have unnatural hair color at school.  You can easily use this product to play with fun hair colors over the weekend and then back to normal in time for school!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside I see is that you can&#x27;t purchase Crayola chalk refills for this product.  It would be nice to be able to order new colors in the exact sizes for this applicator.  Although they appear to last awhile, I&#x27;m considering ordering some other types of hair chalk and cutting them to fit this applicator.  Not sure if that is going to work but I want to try. If it works, it will totally be worth it. Having the applicator so you don&#x27;t have to get your hands and clothes dirty is AWESOME!  I highly recommend this product and think it can be used for people of all ages.  It&#x27;s especially perfect for beginners who have never used hair chalk before.  It&#x27;s inexpensive, non messy and really, really fun!</li>
