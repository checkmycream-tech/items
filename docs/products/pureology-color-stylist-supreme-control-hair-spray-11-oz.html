            <li> received product timely, and as expected.</li>
            <li> Bast hairspray I can find!! Really amped up the volume!! My favorite hairspray!</li>
            <li> Best Hairspray Ever.&lt;br /&gt;Holds well. Doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out or make it feel like cement.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Really great hair spray!</li>
            <li> I have been using their InCharge hairspary for years, which left my hair a little stiff, until I&#x27;d run my hands through it.  This new one doesnt feel like I have any hairspray on my hair at all, it&#x27;s extremely light, and makes my hair look really healthy, but still holds nicely.  I not a fan of the scent, but thankfully, the smell goes away in about 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Best holding hair spray ever!</li>
            <li> This is a great hair spray even in damp weather. It holds well and&lt;br /&gt;yet does not feel stiff or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;Problem........&lt;br /&gt;It was packaged in a box that was not sealed on the sides. So the&lt;br /&gt;damaged box arrived with nothing but the hairspray cap inside.</li>
            <li> Love it. Had to find replacement for pureology in charge firm hairspray. This is it!!!!!</li>
            <li> Very good hold for fine hair in humid weather.</li>
            <li> The use of this hair spray holds my hair in place but does not look stiff.  The product doesn&#x27;t appear to build up on my hair as some hair sprays do.</li>
            <li> I have been searching high and low for a history that is has a lot of control,, but is not sticky or too stiff. It also has to smell good. This is it!</li>
            <li> Strong hold and no flakes. I didn&#x27;t realize I was buying strong hold hairspray but I really do like it. If you want strong hold with no flakes then this is a must have!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite sprays. It holds up well and it has a nice fragrance to it. It also washes out well too. Doesn&#x27;t leave a noticible buildup.</li>
            <li> Best hairspray ever. Has a pleasant smell last a long time. Cannot buy in the salons discontinued.</li>
            <li> This is the best hairspray ever! I highly recommend it. Your hairstyle stays well for a few days without being helmet head.</li>
            <li> great product best ever will buy again</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray.  Finally, I have ended my search for a strong enough holding hairspray that doesn&#x27;t smell nasty.  It&#x27;s about time!  Please keep making it because my plan is to stick with this one for life!</li>
            <li> I love the Pureology line... they are expensive but my color lasts twice as long too.  This spray has great hold, and I always get comments (usually after a hug) on how great my hair smells!  It brushes out easily which makes for less breakage.  I am in my 50&#x27;s and this is my new &amp;#34;cult&amp;#34; favorite for my age group - so many of my friends grew up in the day and age when we ALL used&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Shaper&amp;#34; exclusively (if you recognize this then you know what I mean).  Pamper your color and it will treat you well.</li>
            <li> I love Pureology!  I don&#x27;t think I have ever found a product of there&#x27;s that I didn&#x27;t like.  This hairspray is perfect for my long semi thick hair.  It&#x27;s a medium hold, smells good and I&#x27;ve had great results with it!  I will keep purchasing this product!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and love it.  This review is for the condition of the product when it arrived to me.  The lids were shattered and they don&#x27;t spray right.  Never have I gotten anything from anyone in such condition.  Very unsatisfied with with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a ton of different hairsprays (that&#x27;s what growing up in the 80&#x27;s creates, is a hair spray devotee). I love the Pureology shampoos and conditioners, but this hairspray is not great at all. Here&#x27;s why: It leaves my hair feeling dry and cake-y. It looks so dry that it starts flaking off by mid morning. By the end of the day, if I even try and brush my hair, it starts flaking all over the place, making it look like dandruff. It also seems to buildup on my hair. I had to use a clarifying treatment to remove it. Lastly, it makes my hair feel very stiff (some might like that), even just a little spray will stiffen it up way too much (then just flake off). I will never buy this hairspray again, and would never recommend it to anyone that I like. I&#x27;m going to stuck with my Aveda hairsprays for now.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that I straighten. This hair spray really helps hold hair in place and keeps out humidity, so I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair more than a couple times per week. It is easy to comb/brush through. Happy I tried it.</li>
            <li> This spray does exactly what i should!! Supreme hold!! Leaves my hair shiny and holds all day and is easy to brush out at the end of the day. It has never flaked. It is not meant to be sprayed heavily, layer it. Yes i would recommend this mostly to someone with fine hair and using other treatments from purology systems.</li>
