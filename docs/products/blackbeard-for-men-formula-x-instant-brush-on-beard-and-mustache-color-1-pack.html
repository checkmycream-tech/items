            <li>excellent..</li>
            <li>happy this mascara doesn&#x27;t come off when I don&#x27;t want to</li>
            <li>/&gt;Blackbeard is great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy for him.  </li>
            <li>Great idea</li>
            <li>great product..</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>Worked out great.</li>
            <li>It does wash off in water easily so put it on best before you go to work</li>
            <li>and I am good to go.</li>
            <li>I loved it.</li>
            <li>Looks really good and stays in place till washed out with soap.</li>

            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>its  just ok ,  its  not as  good  as  just for  men  </li>
            <li>I Tried Blackbeard for men and really liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>its a great product and application was clean.</li>
            <li>The brown color blended perfectly and looked more natural than dye because the hair color isn&#x27;t all uniform.</li>
            <li>fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think its a suitable mascara for those who have 40% or more gray or for those want to touch up sideburns.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s pretty happy.  </li>
            <li>i love this</li>
            <li>But the more I used it, the more it clumped and smeared.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see how this is any better then</li>
            <li>but could be better.</li>
            <li>better for me than dyeing so thumbs up.</li>
            <li>Plus it won&#x27;t irritate your face like most mustache and beard dyes because it is not a dye.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great - not gloopy and clumpy and when applied with moustache wax then brushed, really does my &#x27;stache good!</li>
            <li>Good easy application stays on the whole day</li>
            <li>Now its easy to use, and easy to take off.</li>
            <li>and it was easy to get off</li>
            <li>Easy application and didn&#x27;t irritate his skin.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use I can&#x27;t even believe it.</li>
            <li>This mascara is durable and does not wash off easily.</li>
            <li>It still looks fine after a day at work, but if I&#x27;m going out at night I might do a touch-up.</li>
            <li>: goes on super fast, looks good.</li>
            <li>Covers well and last a good while.</li>
            <li>Applicator is much easier and more reliable.</li>
            <li>Not bad</li>
            <li>Gave this stuff a shot, overall pretty good.</li>
            <li>So at first, this product rocked!  </li>
            <li>Makes me look extra sexy too!</li>
            <li>The best part is that I leave a little gray on the edges so it looks totally natural.</li>
            <li>also the Cap&#x27;n sends you a free dating guide book if you go to their website which is pretty funny.</li>
            <li>They have a whole pirate theme which is pretty funny and goofy videos as well.</li>
            <li>half-way right</li>
            <li>For my own purposes, I simply wound up using my girlfriend&#x27;s mascara which accomplished my goal without the shoe-polish like texture.</li>
            <li>The black blends pretty good with my hair color</li>
            <li>Its ideal for active men or guys who work outside.</li>
            <li>In the meantime this works pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;Way</li>
            <li>mostly on the outside edges.  </li>
            <li>and you should be ok for the next 24 hours till you do another touch up.  </li>
            <li>Does what it says it does, and now he definitely looks better...</li>
            <li>a solid investement I&#x27;d say :)</li>
            <li>its a nice and portable for when i go on business trips and need to have a sharp look.</li>
            <li>it looked liked black shoe polish .</li>
            <li>easy to apply and is water proof, using it has brought my skin back to life after years of use of the chemical gel beard for men.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally easy to use and stays on very well and covers up the gray solidly.  </li>
            <li>I would subtract a half star for this but since I can only do 4 or 5 I will do 5 because overall I am very very happy to have found Blackbeard for Men!And</li>
            <li>So if you have fine hair or a few days of stubble, you have to have use a light, feather touch when applying; otherwise the color will smear on your skin.</li>
            <li>and really I have no complaints.</li>
            <li>If I applied too much then one could tell that I colored my hair.  </li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s really it.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend got this for me -- I think as a joke because she said I was complaining too much about gray beard kicking in me not liking how it looks and</li>
            <li>it goes on fast and get&#x27;s rid of the gray&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so really it&#x27;s win-win.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely recommend it as fast and easy and natural looking.</li>
            <li>I bought this for someone who looks older than he should and refused to use dye because he says they give him a rash.</li>
            <li>To summarize a very good product and it matches well with my beard and looks natural and really has only minor downsides but much less than dying</li>
            <li>Just wished Blackbeard lasted a little longer but other than that Blackbeard is great.</li>
            <li>On their website it says theres a new version coming that will last longer and resistint to smudges so cool.</li>
            <li>But the rate I&#x27;m getting in India is too high.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product to all men and for them to dump the chemical gel they use ...</li>
            <li>Dyeing your beard with Just for Men would probably take less time and look more natural.</li>
            <li>Kinda tough washing it off, but great product overall</li>
            <li>The only thing is I just figured out to just use cheap eye lash make up is the same thing</li>
            <li>wand is thick and covers a good chunk of facial hair.</li>
            <li>After several other attempts I finely figured it out!</li>
            <li>He looks hot and about 8 years younger.</li>
            <li>how I want to maintain my natural beard color etc etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far no hives.</li>
            <li>I had to wipe most of it out just to get somewhat of a more natural look instead of an in your face, fake black appearance.</li>
            <li>long day I would certainly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Used Blackbeard for the \\&quot;country rock\\&quot; look at a show -- looks natural, sweating not a problem, lasts a long time!</li>
            <li>I bought Blackbeard for Men (Black) after much research.  </li>

            <li> Once the color coats a patch of skin, its arduous to remove without having to wash your whole face and start over.</li>
            <li> If I applied too little then it would cover the longer beard hair but not the smaller gray hair.  </li>
            <li> Please be careful when applying and washing because it stealthily smudges on your hands and</li>
            <li> First application was a failure, it was thick, clumpy and after playing with it to get it looking</li>
            <li> I also noticed other people who would look at me when I was speaking to them at work -</li>
            <li> The other issue is it can rub off on a towel, so I have to remember to use a tissue after a shower to get off any excess.</li>
            <li> I needed something that would last for at least a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only in my late 30s.</li>
            <li> A bit to dark for me it looked like women&#x27;s eye make up</li>
            <li> My beard is 90% white/grey, while my head (hairs) are 90% black (you get the picture how it looks.  </li>
            <li> white/grey show under black hair.  </li>
            <li> I put it on in less than a minute.</li>
            <li> This AM, the applicator was a mess</li>
            <li> but  it  doesn&#x27;t  destroy your face either,  its  not very easy to use until you get  the  hang of  it</li>
            <li> I had been dying my mustach and beard and it was destroying my skin.</li>
            <li> Gentlemen if you use the Chemical ladden color gel that destroys your face with scratches skin, dry face and broken beard.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Uses a small amount in his mustache and goatee...</li>
            <li> find it too thick and clumps.</li>
            <li> This stuff is VERY thick, and when applied makes the beard feel stiff and sticky.  </li>
            <li> My husband hated how his goatee was so much grayer than the rest of his hair.  </li>
            <li> it wears off over time but very slowly.</li>
            <li> You can wipe your mouth with a napkin during dinner and not have to worry about your secret grays being revealed to dinner</li>
            <li> This product is horrible ,it&#x27;s like putting candle wax on your face.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Covers well and last a good while. I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> The product color my mustache but i have to reapply it several times a day.</li>
            <li> The black blends pretty good with my hair color and really I have no complaints. First application was a failure, it was thick, clumpy and after playing with it to get it looking half-way right it looked liked black shoe polish . After several other attempts I finely figured it out! Now its easy to use, and easy to take off. I recommend this.</li>
            <li> I have blond hair and a blender and I wanted to just change it up for a bit so I found this product and it worked I didn&#x27;t smear it and staining my clothes and it was easy to get off and I Lassa long day I would certainly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Touches the skin and gets smudged when used to cover the beard grey</li>
            <li> Nice product. But the rate I&#x27;m getting in India is too high.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my guy. Easy application and didn&#x27;t irritate his skin.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use chemical based dyes so I researched for alternatives.  I bought Blackbeard for Men (Black) after much research.  My beard is 90% white/grey, while my head (hairs) are 90% black (you get the picture how it looks.  I used this product for 10 days when I was trying to grow out my beard.  I applied it every morning.  If I applied too much then one could tell that I colored my hair.  If I applied too little then it would cover the longer beard hair but not the smaller gray hair.  It will also stain the skin.  I didn&#x27;t know about this until my wife told me that from far my beard looks dark however, on close distance white/grey show under black hair.  I also noticed other people who would look at me when I was speaking to them at work - though they couldn&#x27;t/didn&#x27;t say anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used water to wash my face and the color didn&#x27;t come off (even it did, it wasn&#x27;t noticeable).  As another reviewer mentioned, you can only use paper towel/tissue to dry your face.  If you use towel and rub your face then the color will come off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color only lasts for a day, which wasn&#x27;t an issue for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I tried to use henna and this product at the same.  The henna didn&#x27;t stick because this product made my hair greasy/oily.  I guess they use some greasy/oily substance so temporary color can stick to hair particles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, If you need to touch up then this works otherwise go with another product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great - not gloopy and clumpy and when applied with moustache wax then brushed, really does my &#x27;stache good!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. It is a godsend. I had been dying my mustach and beard and it was destroying my skin. I tried this stuff and THANK YOU. It is so easy to use I can&#x27;t even believe it. I put it on in less than a minute. I put it on before work in the morning and I am good to go. The best part is that I leave a little gray on the edges so it looks totally natural. Now the downsides. it wears off over time but very slowly. It still looks fine after a day at work, but if I&#x27;m going out at night I might do a touch-up. The other issue is it can rub off on a towel, so I have to remember to use a tissue after a shower to get off any excess. But that&#x27;s really it. It stays on well and doesn&#x27;t come off on my shirt collor or pillow. I would subtract a half star for this but since I can only do 4 or 5 I will do 5 because overall I am very very happy to have found Blackbeard for Men!And also the Cap&#x27;n sends you a free dating guide book if you go to their website which is pretty funny. They have a whole pirate theme which is pretty funny and goofy videos as well.To summarize a very good product and it matches well with my beard and looks natural and really has only minor downsides but much less than dying so I am now sold, Arr! for Blackbeard.</li>
            <li> This is a heavy duty mascara that is meant for men who sport real beards. This mascara is durable and does not wash off easily. Its ideal for active men or guys who work outside. My fiance can clutch my chin without the dye rubbing off on her fingers. You can wipe your mouth with a napkin during dinner and not have to worry about your secret grays being revealed to dinner guests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wand is thick and covers a good chunk of facial hair. So if you have fine hair or a few days of stubble, you have to have use a light, feather touch when applying; otherwise the color will smear on your skin. Once the color coats a patch of skin, its arduous to remove without having to wash your whole face and start over. The mascara does not rub off completely with a wet tissue or even a clearasil pad. Please be careful when applying and washing because it stealthily smudges on your hands and fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think its a suitable mascara for those who have 40% or more gray or for those want to touch up sideburns. If you want to shroud tiny patches of gray especially around the chin and mustache, this mascara maybe overpowering. In those areas, I would go with a women&#x27;s waterproof mascara. Finally, because this mascara tends to stick, I have to fully wash my beard every night before going to bed. I have left it on overnight and it caused itching.  It however does not cause my skin to break out or anything. My newborn baby has no allergies to it either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy this mascara doesn&#x27;t come off when I don&#x27;t want to but I wish it would come off when I do want it to! Dyeing your beard with Just for Men would probably take less time and look more natural.</li>
            <li> When I washed or showed it would wash off. I needed something that would last for at least a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a musician with a generous helping of silver in my beard. Used Blackbeard for the \\&quot;country rock\\&quot; look at a show -- looks natural, sweating not a problem, lasts a long time! This stuff rocks.</li>
            <li> excellent..i love this</li>
            <li> its  just ok ,  its  not as  good  as  just for  men  but  it  doesn&#x27;t  destroy your face either,  its  not very easy to use until you get  the  hang of  it</li>
            <li> So at first, this product rocked!  But the more I used it, the more it clumped and smeared. This AM, the applicator was a mess so I tried washing it only to have the brush separate from the handle.  I purchased a competitor as a backup and used it this AM.  I loved it. Applicator is much easier and more reliable. Its softer as well and easier to use.</li>
            <li> This stuff is VERY thick, and when applied makes the beard feel stiff and sticky.  I only needed this product to darken my beard for costume purposes, but after trying it out, decided I did not like the feel.  For my own purposes, I simply wound up using my girlfriend&#x27;s mascara which accomplished my goal without the shoe-polish like texture.</li>
            <li> its a great product and application was clean. its a nice and portable for when i go on business trips and need to have a sharp look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only in my late 30s. My girlfriend got this for me -- I think as a joke because she said I was complaining too much about gray beard kicking in me not liking how it looks and how I want to maintain my natural beard color etc etc.&lt;br /&gt;Blackbeard is great. It&#x27;s totally easy to use and stays on very well and covers up the gray solidly.  Makes me look extra sexy too! The one downside is that you have to apply it every day and that it sometimes wipes off on your towels after you shower. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it as fast and easy and natural looking.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible ,it&#x27;s like putting candle wax on your face.</li>
            <li> I tried this because JFM  started to burn my skin.&lt;br /&gt;It find it too thick and clumps. I don&#x27;t see how this is any better then mascara I could have bought for $4.00 in Walmart.  I had to wipe most of it out just to get somewhat of a more natural look instead of an in your face, fake black appearance. It just didn&#x27;t do the trick for me.</li>
            <li> Good easy application stays on the whole day</li>
            <li> Gave this stuff a try. Not bad.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: goes on super fast, looks good. Way easier than JFM.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: lasts about 8 hrs or so and then it starts to fade, and I have to touch it up. Not bad but could be better. Also smudges on my towel after my shower so I have to remember to wipe it off with a tissue. On their website it says theres a new version coming that will last longer and resistint to smudges so cool. In the meantime this works pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;Way better for me than dyeing so thumbs up.</li>
            <li> My husband hated how his goatee was so much grayer than the rest of his hair.  Uses a small amount in his mustache and goatee...mostly on the outside edges.  Looks really good and stays in place till washed out with soap.</li>
            <li> I recently got this for my husband because he got hives from other dyes. Since this isn&#x27;t a dye, he tried it. So far no hives. He&#x27;s pretty happy.  I&#x27;m happy for him.  He looks hot and about 8 years younger.</li>
            <li> Gentlemen if you use the Chemical ladden color gel that destroys your face with scratches skin, dry face and broken beard.&lt;br /&gt;I have a solution and that is Blackbeard for men which is instant no chemical. easy to apply and is water proof, using it has brought my skin back to life after years of use of the chemical gel beard for men.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to all men and for them to dump the chemical gel they use ...&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product that I have being using for months now.</li>
            <li> I Tried Blackbeard for men and really liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros- it goes on fast and get&#x27;s rid of the gray&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons- it only lasts a day and you have to touch it up each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Just wished Blackbeard lasted a little longer but other than that Blackbeard is great. Just do touch ups when you need it and everything will be allright. It does wash off in water easily so put it on best before you go to work and you should be ok for the next 24 hours till you do another touch up.  Plus it won&#x27;t irritate your face like most mustache and beard dyes because it is not a dye. I recommend this product !</li>
            <li> Great idea great product.. The only thing is I just figured out to just use cheap eye lash make up is the same thing lol</li>
            <li> Gave this stuff a shot, overall pretty good. Only lasts a day so it&#x27;s not like a dye, but it only took about 10 seconds to put on so really it&#x27;s win-win. The brown color blended perfectly and looked more natural than dye because the hair color isn&#x27;t all uniform. Solid.</li>
            <li> A bit to dark for me it looked like women&#x27;s eye make up</li>
            <li> Kinda tough washing it off, but great product overall</li>
            <li> I bought this for someone who looks older than he should and refused to use dye because he says they give him a rash. So I tried this stuff. Worked out great. Good product. Does what it says it does, and now he definitely looks better...a solid investement I&#x27;d say :)</li>
