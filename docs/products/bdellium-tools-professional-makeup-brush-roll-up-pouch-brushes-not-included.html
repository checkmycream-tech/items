            <li>I have been looking online for a good brush roll for years.  </li>
            <li>Thankfully, this was the perfect fit.  </li>

            <li>Really great quality and fantastic price!  </li>
            <li>Nice product at a good price.</li>
            <li>I wanted to keep all my brushes in the best shape and all right in where I could see them.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I purchased this pouch-if you are debating on whether or not to get it-just got for it!  </li>
            <li>I sure didn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li>This one is great - it fit all of my brushes and they&#x27;re laid out nicely so I can see each one.</li>
            <li>This is a nice brush holder.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a nice holder that I can use for home and travel.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with this bdellium tools makeup brush roll.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my assortment of cosmetic brushes &amp; very portable..highly recommend for travelers...</li>
            <li>holds brushes nicely, but you need plenty of room to unfold, as this unfolds 4 times.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a really nice brush case, and</li>
            <li>Hello Ladies,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the this item and was glad to see that it arrived in good condition.</li>
            <li>To be honest, this is pouch is made for eye-shadow brushes.</li>
            <li>A must have for all gals who own allot of brushes.  </li>
            <li>Great for traveling or just keeping brushes organized and clean at home.</li>
            <li>It rolls up nice with a velcro strap and is very secure with tossing it around.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll come in handy as well.</li>
            <li>This makeup brush roll-up pouch has been the perfect replacement for my old pouch.  </li>
            <li>I love, love, love this pouch!  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love the Velcro strap - so much better than tying!</li>
            <li>While this might not be ideal for a serious makeup artist with TONS of brushes, this is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>Comparable brush rolls can cost much more.</li>
            <li>If the strip was just an inch longer  it would be better.</li>
            <li>I have about 25 different brushes, and it is wonderful to be able to keep them all in one organized place as well as prevent any colors from rubbing from one to another (eyeshadow winding up on a foundation brush, etc).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually in love with this roll</li>
            <li>This is inexpensive and holds many brushes</li>
            <li>Fabulous makeup brush roll!</li>
            <li>She loves his, plenty of room to add more.</li>
            <li>I am more organized with my makeup.</li>
            <li>It holds and organizes my brushes and it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot room, but keeps brushes safe when traveling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I am able to store about 27 brushes in there and 2 spatulas.</li>
            <li>Love that I can safely store all my brushes while staying organized.</li>
            <li>I should have started a company designing them tho b/c surely someone who may not use make up all time designed this one....</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>and I love the olive interior.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Most cosmetic travel bags do not allow for the number of brushes I like to take with me.  </li>
            <li>Great fabric outside and great, easy to clean fabric inside.</li>
            <li>Another reviewer mentioned to unpick the stitching on some of the compartments to allow more brushes to fit, and it was a fabulous idea!  </li>
            <li>My array of loose brushes fit perfectly, and because you roll it up, it doesn&#x27;t take a lot of space.</li>
            <li>And it has a Velcro strap making it easy to close.</li>
            <li>The idea of not having to find something to cram the brushes in and the ease of packing will be so easy.  </li>
            <li>It makes travel easy when I need to do makeup for events or photo shoots.</li>
            <li>Love this brush holder, Great quality, Holds all your eye shadow and smaller brushes..</li>
            <li>The color is amazing (the robins blue), it sooo soft, and the magnetic clasp works great!!!</li>
            <li>I was never much into eye shadow until I realized that having a great diverse brush set is essential and this roll is perfect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to open the roll and be able to quickly retrieve the correct brush to use.  </li>
            <li>: I made my own make-up roll (and will continue to use that), however this pouch is more professional looking,so I will carry it me when I travel.</li>
            <li>I have 17 brushes comfortably in this roll.  </li>
            <li>It holds a lot, and my brushes I believe are almost 9\\&quot; at the longest and they all fit.</li>
            <li>But being pleather, clean up is easy.</li>
            <li>Brushes of all sizes fit.</li>
            <li>It is great quality and has plenty of slots for various brushes.</li>
            <li>not all of my brushes fit -</li>
            <li>Overall, its a great bag -</li>
            <li>This one fit the bill and had a ton of pockets.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I have been looking for!!</li>
            <li>This wonderful little pouch holds all of my makeup brushes and tools with spaces to spare!  </li>
            <li>This was truly worth it!</li>
            <li>Lots of pockets, to fit more than one brush or a large brush.</li>
            <li>In the end, they all fit well, but don&#x27;t plan on putting too many large brushes in there.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hence, we need something to keep the brushes in for transport or storage and to keep them clean.</li>
            <li>Material sturdy and clean finish.</li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t many makeup brush rolls available that consist of sufficient pockets and at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>everything was secure &amp; closed up very nicely...</li>
            <li>THIS roll however, is soft, flexible, and the top flap that flips over the brushes to keep them from falling out and touching each other is great.</li>
            <li>let me first say that i would definitely buy this product again because it stands in great relation to the price you pay.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much I keep my brushes in it all the time now.</li>
            <li>I really like the pouch but wish the side pockets were more accessable.</li>
            <li>Side pouches: are good to keep powder foundation (such as MAC studio fix), blush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find it&#x27;ll still be perfectly useful to travel with)</li>
            <li>This product has individual slots to hold all of your brushes to keep them nice and organized.</li>
            <li>It holds so many brushes that I was able to put all my face brushes on one side and all my eye brushes on the other.</li>
            <li>It is just fine, but was priced rather high</li>
            <li>Fabulous product, very well made and large enough to fit many brushes.  </li>
            <li>Has been looking for brush bag, for some time, but couldn&#x27;t find right one.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t have much experience with many others, just the one that came with my Crown set as I have only been recently introduced to good brushes with lots of options.</li>
            <li>But overall a great product and I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li>I had the hardest time finding a brush roll that was long enough to handle my beautiful bdellium brushes.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I began putting in the brushes and immediately knew this was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I found exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>but I opted for this \\&quot;studio line\\&quot; version as it was just a bit bigger but seemed a more functional size.</li>
            <li>, I bought this because I needed something smaller and more convenient to hold my brushes in.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed and didn&#x27;t find at stores.</li>
            <li>This is the first one I have purchased from this seller</li>
            <li>Love the wrap around velcro closure on the outside too!</li>
            <li>It would be a better case with the slots spacing done differently.</li>
            <li>I removed much of the stitching to create wider pockets and added velcro to the side pockets to make them useful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very well made piece with many pockets for you to store all your eye shadow, eye brow brushes which I have quite a few :-)</li>
            <li>a longer velcro hoops, so if you have more brushes you can still seal it properly.</li>
            <li>This roll-up pouch was exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li>This brush case was exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>Makes my morning routine so much faster because it&#x27;s all organized and within reach!  </li>
            <li>However, the roll that came with it is a faux reptile like plastic that is stiff and doesn&#x27;t roll nicely and the top cover doesn&#x27;t come over the brushes well to keep them in, so I just had the brushes over the top and they would fall out if I turned the roll upside down.</li>
            <li>This is a nice sturdy case and easy to clean but does not fit larger brushes so limits the brushes you can carry in it.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s nicely made.</li>
            <li>I was looking for one to hold at least 10 brushes comfortably, be easy to clean, easy to close.  </li>
            <li>I have two large brushes I just lay in the case and roll it up.  </li>
            <li>so one can put large handle brushes there.  </li>
            <li>- also - needs a longer Velcro strip depending on how much you want to fit in the roll up - mine is pretty full and the velcro strip is not long enough -&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>I am now able to comfortably fit a mixture of about 40 large and small brushes, solving the problem of having all the brushes I need in one place!</li>
            <li>I have a set of Crown Brushes that I really like.</li>
            <li>Makes getting ready in the morning that much easier.</li>
            <li>Too much space needed for my work.</li>
            <li>I really like this roll, it keeps all my brushes in one place and is compact.</li>
            <li>The material is pleather, but doesn&#x27;t really look like it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really convenient and flexible and you don&#x27;t have to fumble with elastic bands or a tie that comes undone.</li>
            <li>This holds all of them with room to spare and because it rolls up compactly, it&#x27;ll be a breeze to take the whole thing when I go on vacation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price is also reasonable.</li>
            <li>i think it would be best to have a few larger / wider spaces as well as the ones that are currently in the bag.  </li>
            <li>but I guess you really can&#x27;t have it all.</li>
            <li>i think there should be one large pocket on left or right instead of making them all the same, again, would have been nice to mix up the sizing a bit for larger items.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be buyng an extra one (or more).</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this holder to all</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>An interior flap folds down to protect the bristles of the brushes when the pouch is rolled up, and the inner material reminds me of a synthetic canvas, making it easy to wipe clean and dry quickly.</li>
            <li>love that the case is long enough to hold tall brushes, not just the ones with 3\\&quot; handles.</li>
            <li>The reason I gave it 4 stars is due to the fact that the Velcro strip could be a bit longer, but it is still just fine.</li>
            <li>I needed a new brush roll-up pouch because my old one was ready for the garbage can.  </li>
            <li>all new things have a new smell...</li>
            <li>I put my brushes with larger handles in the top row, and then had to work a tiny bit to get some of my smaller brushes into the lower sleeves.</li>
            <li>A little bulky but easy to carry along.</li>
            <li>Added bonus of form + function: the leatherette is very soft to the touch, making it easy to roll, and I like the army green color on the inside.</li>
            <li>Will only hold half as many brushes as advertised and there is no give in the brush slots</li>
            <li>For now, I just took out the stitches between 2 regular pockets to merge them into one large one.&lt;br /&gt;2:  </li>
            <li>There is no harsh smell as I&#x27;ve seen others mention....</li>
            <li>Durable and soft</li>
            <li>It has 20 individual, same-sized slots which are wide enough to hold my thick-handled blush brush, and can also be used to double up brushes with thinner handles, effectively increasing the capacity to over 20 brushes of varying size.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of the outside, and when rolled, the case is smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li>This one is very well made, has 10 pockets plus 4 larger ones on the side, and a cover for the brushes.</li>
            <li>,  the end pockets have little use,  but other than that this is nice.</li>
            <li>Really like this pouch, only wished it had some larger compartments for brushes, I like some other reviewers actually tore out seaming in order to create the size I needed which worked, but actually need more space.</li>
            <li>There are two rows of brush sleeves, one right in front of the other.</li>
            <li>With twenty brushes inside, I had to roll it more tightly than I expected to get the two velcro bits on the strap to meet</li>
            <li>I ended up taking a seam ripper to open / combine a few so that the brushes would fit -</li>
            <li>Love this one - read other reviews about stitching being too tight -</li>
            <li>but it is very functional and should last a long time.  </li>
            <li>I use Bare Escentuals makeup</li>
            <li>a large part on each side (about 2&#x27;&#x27;) is closed of, but you can open the seam for additional storage.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>The exterior i made of a soft, supple leather material and the velcro on the strap that secures the roll is long enough to keep it closed when it is empty, as well as when it is full of brushes.</li>
            <li>I looked high and low for a replacement case/pouch without contents that could accommodate long brushes and finally found this one.</li>
            <li>Gets dirty but is easy to clean with a wet paper towel or cloth.</li>
            <li>However, a few things to be aware of:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I am so glad that I purchased this pouch-if you are debating on whether or not to get it-just got for it!  </li>
            <li> I sure didn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> This one is great - it fit all of my brushes and they&#x27;re laid out nicely so I can see each one.</li>
            <li> This is a nice brush holder.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a nice holder that I can use for home and travel.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with this bdellium tools makeup brush roll.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my assortment of cosmetic brushes &amp; very portable..highly recommend for travelers...</li>
            <li> holds brushes nicely, but you need plenty of room to unfold, as this unfolds 4 times.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, a really nice brush case, and</li>
            <li> Hello Ladies,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the this item and was glad to see that it arrived in good condition.</li>
            <li> To be honest, this is pouch is made for eye-shadow brushes.</li>
            <li> A must have for all gals who own allot of brushes.  </li>
            <li> Great for traveling or just keeping brushes organized and clean at home.</li>
            <li> It rolls up nice with a velcro strap and is very secure with tossing it around.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll come in handy as well.</li>
            <li> This makeup brush roll-up pouch has been the perfect replacement for my old pouch.  </li>
            <li> I love, love, love this pouch!  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love the Velcro strap - so much better than tying!</li>
            <li> While this might not be ideal for a serious makeup artist with TONS of brushes, this is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Comparable brush rolls can cost much more.</li>
            <li> If the strip was just an inch longer  it would be better.</li>
            <li> I have about 25 different brushes, and it is wonderful to be able to keep them all in one organized place as well as prevent any colors from rubbing from one to another (eyeshadow winding up on a foundation brush, etc).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually in love with this roll</li>
            <li> This is inexpensive and holds many brushes</li>
            <li> Fabulous makeup brush roll!</li>
            <li> She loves his, plenty of room to add more.</li>
            <li> I am more organized with my makeup.</li>
            <li> It holds and organizes my brushes and it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot room, but keeps brushes safe when traveling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I am able to store about 27 brushes in there and 2 spatulas.</li>
            <li> Love that I can safely store all my brushes while staying organized.</li>
            <li> I should have started a company designing them tho b/c surely someone who may not use make up all time designed this one....</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> and I love the olive interior.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Most cosmetic travel bags do not allow for the number of brushes I like to take with me.  </li>
            <li> Great fabric outside and great, easy to clean fabric inside.</li>
            <li> Another reviewer mentioned to unpick the stitching on some of the compartments to allow more brushes to fit, and it was a fabulous idea!  </li>
            <li> My array of loose brushes fit perfectly, and because you roll it up, it doesn&#x27;t take a lot of space.</li>
            <li> And it has a Velcro strap making it easy to close.</li>
            <li> The idea of not having to find something to cram the brushes in and the ease of packing will be so easy.  </li>
            <li> It makes travel easy when I need to do makeup for events or photo shoots.</li>
            <li> Love this brush holder, Great quality, Holds all your eye shadow and smaller brushes..</li>
            <li> The color is amazing (the robins blue), it sooo soft, and the magnetic clasp works great!!!</li>
            <li> I was never much into eye shadow until I realized that having a great diverse brush set is essential and this roll is perfect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to open the roll and be able to quickly retrieve the correct brush to use.  </li>
            <li> : I made my own make-up roll (and will continue to use that), however this pouch is more professional looking,so I will carry it me when I travel.</li>
            <li> I have 17 brushes comfortably in this roll.  </li>
            <li> It holds a lot, and my brushes I believe are almost 9\\&quot; at the longest and they all fit.</li>
            <li> But being pleather, clean up is easy.</li>
            <li> Brushes of all sizes fit.</li>
            <li> It is great quality and has plenty of slots for various brushes.</li>
            <li> not all of my brushes fit -</li>
            <li> Overall, its a great bag -</li>
            <li> This one fit the bill and had a ton of pockets.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I have been looking for!!</li>
            <li> This wonderful little pouch holds all of my makeup brushes and tools with spaces to spare!  </li>
            <li> This was truly worth it!</li>
            <li> Lots of pockets, to fit more than one brush or a large brush.</li>
            <li> In the end, they all fit well, but don&#x27;t plan on putting too many large brushes in there.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hence, we need something to keep the brushes in for transport or storage and to keep them clean.</li>
            <li> Material sturdy and clean finish.</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t many makeup brush rolls available that consist of sufficient pockets and at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> everything was secure &amp; closed up very nicely...</li>
            <li> THIS roll however, is soft, flexible, and the top flap that flips over the brushes to keep them from falling out and touching each other is great.</li>
            <li> let me first say that i would definitely buy this product again because it stands in great relation to the price you pay.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much I keep my brushes in it all the time now.</li>
            <li> I really like the pouch but wish the side pockets were more accessable.</li>
            <li> Side pouches: are good to keep powder foundation (such as MAC studio fix), blush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find it&#x27;ll still be perfectly useful to travel with)</li>
            <li> This product has individual slots to hold all of your brushes to keep them nice and organized.</li>
            <li> It holds so many brushes that I was able to put all my face brushes on one side and all my eye brushes on the other.</li>
            <li> It is just fine, but was priced rather high</li>
            <li> Fabulous product, very well made and large enough to fit many brushes.  </li>
            <li> Has been looking for brush bag, for some time, but couldn&#x27;t find right one.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t have much experience with many others, just the one that came with my Crown set as I have only been recently introduced to good brushes with lots of options.</li>
            <li> But overall a great product and I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I had the hardest time finding a brush roll that was long enough to handle my beautiful bdellium brushes.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I began putting in the brushes and immediately knew this was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I found exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> but I opted for this \\&quot;studio line\\&quot; version as it was just a bit bigger but seemed a more functional size.</li>
            <li> , I bought this because I needed something smaller and more convenient to hold my brushes in.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed and didn&#x27;t find at stores.</li>
            <li> This is the first one I have purchased from this seller</li>
            <li> Love the wrap around velcro closure on the outside too!</li>
            <li> It would be a better case with the slots spacing done differently.</li>
            <li> I removed much of the stitching to create wider pockets and added velcro to the side pockets to make them useful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very well made piece with many pockets for you to store all your eye shadow, eye brow brushes which I have quite a few :-)</li>
            <li> a longer velcro hoops, so if you have more brushes you can still seal it properly.</li>
            <li> This roll-up pouch was exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li> This brush case was exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> Makes my morning routine so much faster because it&#x27;s all organized and within reach!  </li>
            <li> However, the roll that came with it is a faux reptile like plastic that is stiff and doesn&#x27;t roll nicely and the top cover doesn&#x27;t come over the brushes well to keep them in, so I just had the brushes over the top and they would fall out if I turned the roll upside down.</li>
            <li> This is a nice sturdy case and easy to clean but does not fit larger brushes so limits the brushes you can carry in it.</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s nicely made.</li>
            <li> I was looking for one to hold at least 10 brushes comfortably, be easy to clean, easy to close.  </li>
            <li> I have two large brushes I just lay in the case and roll it up.  </li>
            <li> so one can put large handle brushes there.  </li>
            <li> - also - needs a longer Velcro strip depending on how much you want to fit in the roll up - mine is pretty full and the velcro strip is not long enough -&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I am now able to comfortably fit a mixture of about 40 large and small brushes, solving the problem of having all the brushes I need in one place!</li>
            <li> I have a set of Crown Brushes that I really like.</li>
            <li> Makes getting ready in the morning that much easier.</li>
            <li> Too much space needed for my work.</li>
            <li> I really like this roll, it keeps all my brushes in one place and is compact.</li>
            <li> The material is pleather, but doesn&#x27;t really look like it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really convenient and flexible and you don&#x27;t have to fumble with elastic bands or a tie that comes undone.</li>
            <li> This holds all of them with room to spare and because it rolls up compactly, it&#x27;ll be a breeze to take the whole thing when I go on vacation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price is also reasonable.</li>
            <li> i think it would be best to have a few larger / wider spaces as well as the ones that are currently in the bag.  </li>
            <li> but I guess you really can&#x27;t have it all.</li>
            <li> i think there should be one large pocket on left or right instead of making them all the same, again, would have been nice to mix up the sizing a bit for larger items.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be buyng an extra one (or more).</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this holder to all</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> An interior flap folds down to protect the bristles of the brushes when the pouch is rolled up, and the inner material reminds me of a synthetic canvas, making it easy to wipe clean and dry quickly.</li>
            <li> love that the case is long enough to hold tall brushes, not just the ones with 3\\&quot; handles.</li>
            <li> The reason I gave it 4 stars is due to the fact that the Velcro strip could be a bit longer, but it is still just fine.</li>
            <li> I needed a new brush roll-up pouch because my old one was ready for the garbage can.  </li>
            <li> all new things have a new smell...</li>
            <li> I put my brushes with larger handles in the top row, and then had to work a tiny bit to get some of my smaller brushes into the lower sleeves.</li>
            <li> A little bulky but easy to carry along.</li>
            <li> Added bonus of form + function: the leatherette is very soft to the touch, making it easy to roll, and I like the army green color on the inside.</li>
            <li> Will only hold half as many brushes as advertised and there is no give in the brush slots</li>
            <li> For now, I just took out the stitches between 2 regular pockets to merge them into one large one.&lt;br /&gt;2:  </li>
            <li> There is no harsh smell as I&#x27;ve seen others mention....</li>
            <li> Durable and soft</li>
            <li> It has 20 individual, same-sized slots which are wide enough to hold my thick-handled blush brush, and can also be used to double up brushes with thinner handles, effectively increasing the capacity to over 20 brushes of varying size.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of the outside, and when rolled, the case is smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> This one is very well made, has 10 pockets plus 4 larger ones on the side, and a cover for the brushes.</li>
            <li> ,  the end pockets have little use,  but other than that this is nice.</li>
            <li> Really like this pouch, only wished it had some larger compartments for brushes, I like some other reviewers actually tore out seaming in order to create the size I needed which worked, but actually need more space.</li>
            <li> There are two rows of brush sleeves, one right in front of the other.</li>
            <li> With twenty brushes inside, I had to roll it more tightly than I expected to get the two velcro bits on the strap to meet</li>
            <li> I ended up taking a seam ripper to open / combine a few so that the brushes would fit -</li>
            <li> Love this one - read other reviews about stitching being too tight -</li>
            <li> but it is very functional and should last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I use Bare Escentuals makeup</li>
            <li> a large part on each side (about 2&#x27;&#x27;) is closed of, but you can open the seam for additional storage.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> The exterior i made of a soft, supple leather material and the velcro on the strap that secures the roll is long enough to keep it closed when it is empty, as well as when it is full of brushes.</li>
            <li> I looked high and low for a replacement case/pouch without contents that could accommodate long brushes and finally found this one.</li>
            <li> Gets dirty but is easy to clean with a wet paper towel or cloth.</li>
            <li> However, a few things to be aware of:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m certainly not in love with the army green interior but thought they would probably pick pink instead which I would dislike even more.  </li>
            <li> only minor improvement I&#x27;d suggest the maker are;&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> I literally couldn&#x27;t \\&quot;smell\\&quot; the new leather after I touched it a few times.</li>
            <li> The seller sent the item promptly and I received it several days earlier than expected.  </li>
            <li> The few that I found in the store had only one or two larger spaces for bigger brushes.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve got a zillion brushes with long handles.  </li>
            <li> Like other&#x27;s have mentioned, the second row isn&#x27;t quite as functional as I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li> smaller than I thought, and the brush slides are a little narrow especially for larger brushes.</li>
            <li> Who knew it was so dang hard to find a new brush roll?</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that when you put brushes in every pouch, the Velcro on the strap closure isn&#x27;t long enough to close it.</li>
            <li> Secondly, if you fill up the pockets, say even to half capacity, the velcro now longer meets up to keep it closed.  </li>
            <li> so you&#x27;re very limited to what brushes you can put in there.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that if you have brushes with a thickish handle you cannot use the 2nd row to hold anything.</li>
            <li> If you have the Samantha Chapman powder brush, it will not fit and the blush brush from the same line will be a struggle to get in.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an empty make-up brush kit.</li>
            <li> however, it seems this one, and others i have purchased in the past, only have one size pockets for the brushes...</li>
            <li> One other thing i would add-</li>
            <li> Only complaint would be it does not have a wrist strap, although has a hole for one.?.?.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that when you unroll it you have to turn it around.</li>
            <li> If the brushes have a wide handle on the bottom, they will not fit.</li>
            <li> Meaning when you unroll it the brushes are facing down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made sturdy enough but the design is poor unless you only want to use it for small (eye shadow) brushes.</li>
            <li> Buy these for WAY less</li>
            <li> Black Leatherette (is that how you spell it?!)&lt;br</li>
            <li> The one I used previously zipped and eventually it all fell apart.</li>
            <li> I do like the Velcro wrap to hold things in tightly.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t figured out what I&#x27;ll use the little pouches on the sides for yet</li>
            <li> From the photos, I was expecting something a little nicer (but for the price, I&#x27;m not complaining).&lt;br /</li>
            <li> The slots are to narrow and to close together.</li>
            <li> However, if you consider buying this product you should know that there are a few things which are not ideal:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I shopped around for some brush pouches and they are not cheap.</li>
            <li> No more endlessly searching for a brush!</li>
            <li> I do wish there was at least one very wide slot</li>
            <li> It holds my ID, debit-credit cards, cash and any small notes.</li>
            <li> No more searching through the drawer to figure out which brush</li>
            <li> Size: small to medium.</li>
            <li> Holds a ton of brushes and folds up small.  </li>
            <li> What i mean by that is that, brushes that are bottom heavy (kabuki, foundation, blush brushes) will  restrict you from using both slots provided.</li>
            <li> This is one of the very few that fits the bill.  </li>
            <li> so I only needed a case and it was frustrated trying to find just a case for makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> It even looks expensive.</li>
            <li> The reviewers weren&#x27;t wrong.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> Velcro i thought i would hate,</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Just what I was looking for! Theses days there are makeup brushes for all of the make-up we apply -  including our liquid foundation! Hence, we need something to keep the brushes in for transport or storage and to keep them clean. This one is great as it accommodates all lengths and widths of all the brushes I own. And it has a Velcro strap making it easy to close.</li>
            <li> I purchased this makeup brush roll-up pouch after seeing a similar one being used by a makeup artist. I had been putting my brushes in a zippered pouch when I traveled but then I would have to take all of them out and sort through them to find the one I was looking for. This pouch has all the space I need to organize my brushes. It holds so many brushes that I was able to put all my face brushes on one side and all my eye brushes on the other. I have my brushes stored in my roll in the order that I use them. I love this product so much I keep my brushes in it all the time now.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a roll up bag for make up brushes for when I travel.  The few that I found in the store had only one or two larger spaces for bigger brushes.  This one suits my needs greatly.  I put the big ones at the back and the smaller items in the front pockets.  Only two issues.  I&#x27;m certainly not in love with the army green interior but thought they would probably pick pink instead which I would dislike even more.  Secondly, if you fill up the pockets, say even to half capacity, the velcro now longer meets up to keep it closed.  I&#x27;ll probably resort to an elastic band.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for. Great for traveling or just keeping brushes organized and clean at home.</li>
            <li> Nice product at a good price. Holds all my brushes and rolls up neatly. Comparable brush rolls can cost much more.</li>
            <li> This is a nice brush holder. I have been looking for a nice holder that I can use for home and travel. Love this one - read other reviews about stitching being too tight - I have not had this problem. Also, I have several makeup brushes and there is tons of space - if someone doesn&#x27;t have enough space for their brushes, they must have LOTS of brushes! The reason I gave it 4 stars is due to the fact that the Velcro strip could be a bit longer, but it is still just fine. If the strip was just an inch longer  it would be better. But overall a great product and I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE it!!! The color is amazing (the robins blue), it sooo soft, and the magnetic clasp works great!!! It holds my ID, debit-credit cards, cash and any small notes. Its perfect! Only complaint would be it does not have a wrist strap, although has a hole for one.?.?.</li>
            <li> I have been looking online for a good brush roll for years.  I was looking for one to hold at least 10 brushes comfortably, be easy to clean, easy to close.  I am thrilled with this bdellium tools makeup brush roll. I began putting in the brushes and immediately knew this was exactly what I wanted.  I have 17 brushes comfortably in this roll.  I am using it for storage at home, and finally I am taking proper care of my brushes.  It&#x27;s great to open the roll and be able to quickly retrieve the correct brush to use.  No more searching through the drawer to figure out which brush I want.  Traveling with this brush roll will be so efficient.  The idea of not having to find something to cram the brushes in and the ease of packing will be so easy.  The only part I could not figure out a use for is the 4 pockets.  Love, love, love the Velcro strap - so much better than tying!</li>
            <li> Great brush roll and great price.  I am a makeup artist and this holds all my brushes I need to do a client</li>
            <li> While this might not be ideal for a serious makeup artist with TONS of brushes, this is perfect for me. I have about 25 different brushes, and it is wonderful to be able to keep them all in one organized place as well as prevent any colors from rubbing from one to another (eyeshadow winding up on a foundation brush, etc). Love it!</li>
            <li> Really great quality and fantastic price!  My only complaint is that when you put brushes in every pouch, the Velcro on the strap closure isn&#x27;t long enough to close it.</li>
            <li> I have a set of Crown Brushes that I really like. However, the roll that came with it is a faux reptile like plastic that is stiff and doesn&#x27;t roll nicely and the top cover doesn&#x27;t come over the brushes well to keep them in, so I just had the brushes over the top and they would fall out if I turned the roll upside down. THIS roll however, is soft, flexible, and the top flap that flips over the brushes to keep them from falling out and touching each other is great. It holds a lot, and my brushes I believe are almost 9\\&quot; at the longest and they all fit. It rolls up nice with a velcro strap and is very secure with tossing it around. Your brushes will not fall out and it holds a lot. I&#x27;m actually in love with this roll but I don&#x27;t have much experience with many others, just the one that came with my Crown set as I have only been recently introduced to good brushes with lots of options. I was never much into eye shadow until I realized that having a great diverse brush set is essential and this roll is perfect. Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had makeup brushes so I only needed a case and it was frustrated trying to find just a case for makeup brushes. This is inexpensive and holds many brushes so I am happy for now. I wish the interior color was different though.</li>
            <li> The salesperson/make up person at Sephora inspired me with her impressive collection of brushes in a handy rollup case. I couldn&#x27;t find the same at Sephora so I decided to search my ever faithful Amazon &amp; low and behold I found exactly what I was looking for. This bedellium case is the perfect size and fits my range of brushes quite nicely (fits 15 brushes comfortably). I haven&#x27;t figured out what I&#x27;ll use the little pouches on the sides for yet but I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll come in handy as well. Added bonus of form + function: the leatherette is very soft to the touch, making it easy to roll, and I like the army green color on the inside. Very happy with my purchase! (Oh, I noticed there was a \\&quot;travel line\\&quot; version as well - but I opted for this \\&quot;studio line\\&quot; version as it was just a bit bigger but seemed a more functional size. I find it&#x27;ll still be perfectly useful to travel with)</li>
            <li> This roll-up case is perfect and holds up to 30 brushes. It makes travel easy when I need to do makeup for events or photo shoots. There is no harsh smell as I&#x27;ve seen others mention....all new things have a new smell...I literally couldn&#x27;t \\&quot;smell\\&quot; the new leather after I touched it a few times.</li>
            <li> The pouch is great and holds a lot of makeup in the slide slots in addition to the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only quibble is the slots for the brushes. If the brushes have a wide handle on the bottom, they will not fit. If you have the Samantha Chapman powder brush, it will not fit and the blush brush from the same line will be a struggle to get in. There should have been a variety of widths of slots for the brushes. I had to cut the stitching to make 2 slots into 1 in order to accommodate the brush.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my assortment of cosmetic brushes &amp; very portable..highly recommend for travelers...everything was secure &amp; closed up very nicely...</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this pouch!  Durable and soft, I bought this because I needed something smaller and more convenient to hold my brushes in.  I have used this for travel and every day use and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!  I am so glad that I purchased this pouch-if you are debating on whether or not to get it-just got for it!  You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush roll with the intention of using it to transport my cosmetic brushes during travel. It has 20 individual, same-sized slots which are wide enough to hold my thick-handled blush brush, and can also be used to double up brushes with thinner handles, effectively increasing the capacity to over 20 brushes of varying size. An interior flap folds down to protect the bristles of the brushes when the pouch is rolled up, and the inner material reminds me of a synthetic canvas, making it easy to wipe clean and dry quickly. The exterior i made of a soft, supple leather material and the velcro on the strap that secures the roll is long enough to keep it closed when it is empty, as well as when it is full of brushes. I have zero complaints about this product and would buy it again in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> I really like the pouch but wish the side pockets were more accessable. I actually took a seam ripper to them to customize it.</li>
            <li> The quality of this pouch is very good. It even looks expensive. My array of loose brushes fit perfectly, and because you roll it up, it doesn&#x27;t take a lot of space. Exactly what I needed and didn&#x27;t find at stores.</li>
            <li> Great case. A little bulky but easy to carry along. Gets dirty but is easy to clean with a wet paper towel or cloth.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister for Christmas. She has a lot of brushes and says this is perfect for keeping them organized! She loves it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to keep all my brushes in the best shape and all right in where I could see them.  This holds all the standard brushes I have with no problem.  I have two large brushes I just lay in the case and roll it up.  Makes getting ready in the morning that much easier.</li>
            <li> The pouch is larger than the last one I had but it is very functional and should last a long time.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> holds brushes nicely, but you need plenty of room to unfold, as this unfolds 4 times. Too much space needed for my work. I do like the Velcro wrap to hold things in tightly.</li>
            <li> Will only hold half as many brushes as advertised and there is no give in the brush slots so you&#x27;re very limited to what brushes you can put in there.</li>
            <li> If you want MAC brushes but cannot afford them...no worries! Buy these for WAY less and you are all set. Best bang for the buck ever!</li>
            <li> I really like this roll, it keeps all my brushes in one place and is compact. Only complaint is that if you have brushes with a thickish handle you cannot use the 2nd row to hold anything.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome brush roll.  It&#x27;s almost identical to the MAC one I have and it seems to be of the same quality.</li>
            <li> There are many compartments, it&#x27;s the perfect size and it&#x27;s quite durable. I use it daily. Awesome and even better for the price.</li>
            <li> This is the first one I have purchased from this seller but I had purchased two of these years ago from elsewhere.  Fabulous product, very well made and large enough to fit many brushes.  Another reviewer mentioned to unpick the stitching on some of the compartments to allow more brushes to fit, and it was a fabulous idea!  I am now able to comfortably fit a mixture of about 40 large and small brushes, solving the problem of having all the brushes I need in one place! The seller sent the item promptly and I received it several days earlier than expected.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I have been looking for!! Fabulous makeup brush roll! Lots of pockets, to fit more than one brush or a large brush. Great fabric outside and great, easy to clean fabric inside. Love the wrap around velcro closure on the outside too! Just so happy to have found it!! :)</li>
            <li> Very nice brush case,  the end pockets have little use,  but other than that this is nice.</li>
            <li> Very impressed!! Thought the leather would look cheap, but was not!!! Very nice!!!!! Holds a lot of brushes, will buy more soon!!</li>
            <li> I have all the make-up brushes I want or need. They seem to last longer than the pouches I&#x27;ve had. I looked high and low for a replacement case/pouch without contents that could accommodate long brushes and finally found this one. It is just fine, but was priced rather high I thought.</li>
            <li> This was truly worth it! I would recommend it to others. I received it in no time. Material sturdy and clean finish.</li>
            <li> I had the hardest time finding a brush roll that was long enough to handle my beautiful bdellium brushes.  Thankfully, this was the perfect fit.  It has two rows of brush slots, so all sizes and lengths fit perfectly.  This makes packing for travel a breeze!</li>
            <li> The slots are to narrow and to close together. It would be a better case with the slots spacing done differently. It also doesn&#x27;t close well with thicker handled brushes.</li>
            <li> I adore makeup and wear it just about every day.  This product has individual slots to hold all of your brushes to keep them nice and organized.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made sturdy enough but the design is poor unless you only want to use it for small (eye shadow) brushes. The stitching is too close together to accommodate regular face brushes. I removed much of the stitching to create wider pockets and added velcro to the side pockets to make them useful. I also had to add velcro to the strap closure as it was way too short. I made it work for me but I would not purchase this again or recommend it - unless you want to modify it like I did.</li>
            <li> Has been looking for brush bag, for some time, but couldn&#x27;t find right one.  Until now.  She loves his, plenty of room to add more.</li>
            <li> I am more organized with my makeup.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of the outside, and when rolled, the case is smaller than I expected. However, a few things to be aware of:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The inside lining feels like nylon. From the photos, I was expecting something a little nicer (but for the price, I&#x27;m not complaining).&lt;br /&gt;* There are two rows of brush sleeves, one right in front of the other. I put my brushes with larger handles in the top row, and then had to work a tiny bit to get some of my smaller brushes into the lower sleeves. In the end, they all fit well, but don&#x27;t plan on putting too many large brushes in there.&lt;br /&gt;* With twenty brushes inside, I had to roll it more tightly than I expected to get the two velcro bits on the strap to meet up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a really nice brush case, and I think I&#x27;m going to be very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This makeup brush roll-up pouch has been the perfect replacement for my old pouch.  There are plenty of spots for lots of brushes.  Nice quality as well!</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t many makeup brush rolls available that consist of sufficient pockets and at a reasonable price.  This is one of the very few that fits the bill.  It&#x27;s a very well made piece with many pockets for you to store all your eye shadow, eye brow brushes which I have quite a few :-), then there is enough also for the foundation, powder, fan, kabuki, blush, blah blah blah.  There are 2 levels of pockets so you can store double of the amount.  Bottom line it&#x27;s a well made and practical brush storage roll and the price is unbeatable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only minor improvement I&#x27;d suggest the maker are;&lt;br /&gt;1:  make the pockets at the end larger so one can put large handle brushes there.  For now, I just took out the stitches between 2 regular pockets to merge them into one large one.&lt;br /&gt;2:  a longer velcro hoops, so if you have more brushes you can still seal it properly.</li>
            <li> This roll-up pouch was exactly what i was looking for. The material is pleather, but doesn&#x27;t really look like it. But being pleather, clean up is easy. It holds and organizes my brushes and it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot room, but keeps brushes safe when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;The Velcro i thought i would hate, but it&#x27;s really convenient and flexible and you don&#x27;t have to fumble with elastic bands or a tie that comes undone.</li>
            <li> let me first say that i would definitely buy this product again because it stands in great relation to the price you pay. That&#x27;s why I gave it 4 stars. However, if you consider buying this product you should know that there are a few things which are not ideal:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) the velcro part is really short, which limits the amount you can store in the roll because you  don&#x27;t want your brushes to be squished.&lt;br /&gt;2) there is a double row of brush pockets, but if you store big brushes (e.g., kabuki brushes) you can only use one row.&lt;br /&gt;3) a large part on each side (about 2&#x27;&#x27;) is closed of, but you can open the seam for additional storage.&lt;br /&gt;4) and if you care for that (which i don&#x27;t), as you can see in the picture, the inside color is horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I am able to store about 27 brushes in there and 2 spatulas. I will probably do sth about the velcro, though.</li>
            <li> Love this brush holder, Great quality, Holds all your eye shadow and smaller brushes.. Highly recommend this holder to all</li>
            <li> Hello Ladies,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the this item and was glad to see that it arrived in good condition. This is a plus for the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now onto the product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Black Leatherette (is that how you spell it?!)&lt;br /&gt;2. Has a smell (hopefully will go away once i wipe it clean)&lt;br /&gt;3. Size: small to medium. What i mean by that is that, brushes that are bottom heavy (kabuki, foundation, blush brushes) will  restrict you from using both slots provided. To be honest, this is pouch is made for eye-shadow brushes. I use it to keep my eyeliners, eye-shadow brushes, slender mascara bottles.&lt;br /&gt;4. Side pouches: are good to keep powder foundation (such as MAC studio fix), blush.&lt;br /&gt;5. Final overview: I made my own make-up roll (and will continue to use that), however this pouch is more professional looking,so I will carry it me when I travel. I am happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendations:&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT OVER-STUFF the pouch! By doing so may result in the pouch not closing, or maybe even bending your brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is as unbiased review I can give. I hope it helps future customers.</li>
            <li> This brush case folds up compactly but holds a ton of brushes.  I use Bare Escentuals makeup and I&#x27;ve got a zillion brushes with long handles.  This holds all of them with room to spare and because it rolls up compactly, it&#x27;ll be a breeze to take the whole thing when I go on vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that the case is long enough to hold tall brushes, not just the ones with 3\\&quot; handles.</li>
            <li> Item is just perfect!Plenty of room for all my extra brushes! Plus the side pockets hold extra smaller brushes. I will definitely be buyng an extra one (or more).</li>
            <li> Holds a ton of brushes and folds up small.  Brushes of all sizes fit. Great purchase for the money. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for almost two years for a makeup brush roll-up with enough pockets that were different sizes and could not find one. This one is very well made, has 10 pockets plus 4 larger ones on the side, and a cover for the brushes. The price is also reasonable. It works well for me.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my mom and she loves it! It is great quality and has plenty of slots for various brushes.</li>
            <li> I shopped around for some brush pouches and they are not cheap. This one is great - it fit all of my brushes and they&#x27;re laid out nicely so I can see each one. I like the roll up and velcro strap. The one I used previously zipped and eventually it all fell apart. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love that I can safely store all my brushes while staying organized.</li>
            <li> Really like this pouch, only wished it had some larger compartments for brushes, I like some other reviewers actually tore out seaming in order to create the size I needed which worked, but actually need more space.</li>
            <li> I like this makeup roll out bag - however, it seems this one, and others i have purchased in the past, only have one size pockets for the brushes...not all of my brushes fit - i think it would be best to have a few larger / wider spaces as well as the ones that are currently in the bag.  I ended up taking a seam ripper to open / combine a few so that the brushes would fit - now it works great! One other thing i would add-i think there should be one large pocket on left or right instead of making them all the same, again, would have been nice to mix up the sizing a bit for larger items.  - also - needs a longer Velcro strip depending on how much you want to fit in the roll up - mine is pretty full and the velcro strip is not long enough -&lt;br /&gt; Overall, its a great bag - i do like the material - I should have started a company designing them tho b/c surely someone who may not use make up all time designed this one....</li>
            <li> Great quality, nice size, fits all my brushes.  A must have for all gals who own allot of brushes.  Good for traveling.</li>
            <li> smaller than I thought, and the brush slides are a little narrow especially for larger brushes. Otherwise, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> This pouch holds a lot of brushes, it is perfect for traveling and keeps everything organized. It looks much more expensive than it is. Great deal!</li>
            <li> Who knew it was so dang hard to find a new brush roll? I sure didn&#x27;t! This thing is great. Perfect size, lots of slots and I love the olive interior. I do wish there was at least one very wide slot but I guess you really can&#x27;t have it all.</li>
            <li> This is a nice sturdy case and easy to clean but does not fit larger brushes so limits the brushes you can carry in it.</li>
            <li> I needed a new brush roll-up pouch because my old one was ready for the garbage can.  This one fit the bill and had a ton of pockets.  I love it.  The reviewers weren&#x27;t wrong.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an empty make-up brush kit. Now, my make-up brushes finally have a home. This pouch keeps them neat and organized, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> This brush case was exactly what I needed.  Most cosmetic travel bags do not allow for the number of brushes I like to take with me.  Although I haven&#x27;t travel-tested it yet, the case looks well-made and sturdy.</li>
            <li> Like other&#x27;s have mentioned, the second row isn&#x27;t quite as functional as I&#x27;d like.  Overall, I do like it though.  Even without&lt;br /&gt;using the additional pockets, there is still plenty of room and it travels well.</li>
            <li> This wonderful little pouch holds all of my makeup brushes and tools with spaces to spare!  Makes my morning routine so much faster because it&#x27;s all organized and within reach!  No more endlessly searching for a brush!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that when you unroll it you have to turn it around. Meaning when you unroll it the brushes are facing down. Other than that it&#x27;s nicely made.</li>
