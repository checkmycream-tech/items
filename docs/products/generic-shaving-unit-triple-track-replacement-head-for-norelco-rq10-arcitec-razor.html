            <li>Great value as it shaves as close and cleans as easily as original shaving heads.</li>
            <li>I am still looking for one that gives a good shave like the original one does.  </li>
            <li>ok</li>

            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Better than the original</li>
            <li>not as good as the older style it replaced</li>
            <li>Though the replacement heads do fit my Philips Norelco razor, they are not made by Philips and they are not OEM.  </li>
            <li>Yes they fit my shaver, but not close to an OEM head.</li>
            <li>No where near as good as OEM head.  </li>
            <li>#34;by Philips&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;OEM&amp;#34; (meaning Original Equipment Manufacturer).  </li>
            <li>Does not provide a close shave, as the original and replacement from Norelco does.</li>
            <li>It does not give as good a shave as the original Phillips shaving head and it is also much larger in size.  </li>
            <li>But it is good enough.</li>
            <li>Fits shaving unit, but is larger than the original head and the assembled shaver doesn&#x27;t fit in the travel case (like the original head).</li>
            <li>The price was right - shipping was prompt - improved the quality of my shaving.......</li>
            <li>It is a good thing that I have saved all of my original Phillips heads that I purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li>Cheap plastic.....made differently than the original.</li>
            <li>They may be worn out a little but they still give a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shaving head was exactly like the one I replaced.</li>
            <li>the 2 year old original blades.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t fit properly in the charging cradle.</li>
            <li>It arrived in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>Very poor,does not give a good shave ,a complete waste of money</li>
            <li>It was not the same as the original.</li>
            <li>does not cut short enough and takes 50% more time to shave</li>
            <li>Finally put the old one back on and got a much better shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Went to Walmart and bought a brand new razor.</li>
            <li>Cheap and usless, not worth the money.</li>
            <li>Yes it works, but not as well as my 1 year old RQ 10.</li>
            <li>When I ordered 2 and received them in early December 2014, the listing expressly stated these were &amp;</li>
            <li>the $31.00 generic shaver head came straight from China.  </li>
            <li>They are a non-branded generic replacement head with a slightly different design, a higher profile but less actual shaving area exposed to the blades, and they do not seem to offer as close a shave as true OEM replacement heads by Philips.  </li>
            <li>Generic item is not really the same that original one.</li>
            <li>The one I have that&#x27;s 2 years old shaves better then the new one, sorry</li>
            <li>I have gone back to using my old one.</li>

            <li> Great value as it shaves as close and cleans as easily as original shaving heads.</li>
            <li> Lengthly delivery. Blades not so sharp, but it is a generic.</li>
            <li> it fits the razor machine ok but it is very rough to shave with. no recommended</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t seem like they are realy sharp.Not much better then the 2 year old original blades. Went back to disposable blades.</li>
            <li> Fits a bit different than my previous purchases . . was skeptical as I had to push it on with more force. . Does seem to work well \\\ does not fit in cleaning system . .</li>
            <li> Works good.  Saved lots</li>
            <li> Very good shaving unit-possibly better than the original one.</li>
            <li> does not cut short enough and takes 50% more time to shave</li>
            <li> The one I have that&#x27;s 2 years old shaves better then the new one, sorry but it&#x27;s a price of crap.</li>
            <li> Excellent replacement for the razor.</li>
            <li> Cheap plastic.....made differently than the original. When running sounded like it was rubbing against the sides.&lt;br /&gt;I tried shaving with this for a week.....worst shave ever. Finally put the old one back on and got a much better shave.&lt;br /&gt;You know what they say.... &amp;#34;You get what you pay for&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> the generic unit was not good.  I had to purchase the one from Norelco</li>
            <li> Generic item is not really the same that original one. But it is good enough.</li>
            <li> cant compare with a razor.</li>
            <li> It is noted as the replacement for the RQ 10. Yes it works, but not as well as my 1 year old RQ 10. It often pulls and hurts and does not give as close a shave. I have gone back to using my old one.</li>
            <li> Fits shaving unit, but is larger than the original head and the assembled shaver doesn&#x27;t fit in the travel case (like the original head).</li>
            <li> It does not give as good a shave as the original Phillips shaving head and it is also much larger in size.  I will now use it and will not buy another one.  I am still looking for one that gives a good shave like the original one does.  It is a good thing that I have saved all of my original Phillips heads that I purchased in the past.  They may be worn out a little but they still give a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;J. Batrlow</li>
            <li> My husband loves it and says they work even better then the name brand.</li>
            <li> The price was right - shipping was prompt - improved the quality of my shaving.......one problem: one of the three shaving heads broke off after 2 or 3 shaves.  I still can use it, but it still falls off occasionally and I can&#x27;t figure out how to fix it.  So I guess this is a qualified five star review.</li>
            <li> Product is a poor imitation of the Norelco product</li>
            <li> When I ordered 2 and received them in early December 2014, the listing expressly stated these were &amp;#34;by Philips&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;OEM&amp;#34; (meaning Original Equipment Manufacturer).  Though the replacement heads do fit my Philips Norelco razor, they are not made by Philips and they are not OEM.  They are a non-branded generic replacement head with a slightly different design, a higher profile but less actual shaving area exposed to the blades, and they do not seem to offer as close a shave as true OEM replacement heads by Philips.  You can purchase generic replacement heads elsewhere for less.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t fit properly in the charging cradle.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t buy this anymore as a Norelco factory made product without spending $199.00 which is ridiculous so the $31.00 generic shaver head came straight from China.  It&#x27;s a piece of junk, don&#x27;t waste your money.  I can get a closer shave using a butcher knife.</li>
            <li> It shipped the same day I orderd it. It arrived in a very timely manner. The shaving head was exactly like the one I replaced. It works very well. Seems a little pricey but I am unable to find it in local stores.  Very pleased over all.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Less clogging than the previous design.</li>
            <li> Yes they fit my shaver, but not close to an OEM head. Sticking with Norelco in the future. BTW the RQ10 has been replaced with the RQ12+ and shaves better than the RQ10.</li>
            <li> not as good as the older style it replaced</li>
            <li> The razor head has worked beyond my expectations.</li>
            <li> already submitted a return request to the company, Elefly.  and have not receieved any reply.&lt;br /&gt;THe generic shaving unit did not fit my RQ10 Shaver.  I requested a refund.</li>
            <li> Better than the original I love it</li>
            <li> Does not provide a close shave, as the original and replacement from Norelco does.</li>
            <li> Cheap and usless, not worth the money.</li>
            <li> No where near as good as OEM head.  Used 1 time and threw away.</li>
            <li> I tried it for three shaves and the blades fell apart. Could not repair it. It was a total waste of money. Went to Walmart and bought a brand new razor. Jerry</li>
            <li> Very poor,does not give a good shave ,a complete waste of money</li>
            <li> Dull shaving heads. Not made by Norelco.</li>
            <li> It was not the same as the original.</li>
            <li> Opens up too often.  Appears to be a knock off and not real parts.</li>
