            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>Love It...</li>
            <li>I used it and got a sunburn on my face after using an spf 30 for many years with out a problem.  </li>
            <li>I purchased it because I wanted something with SPF of 50 or greater for my face.</li>
            <li>love this product .</li>
            <li>I love the feel of the smoothness when applying to face.</li>
            <li>I can have acne or really dry peeling patches but this moisturizer seemed to be perfect.</li>
            <li>Love this sunscreen...goes on easy and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>They either didn&#x27;t smell good, didn&#x27;t feel good on my skin, wouldn&#x27;t work well with makeup, didn&#x27;t have enough spf, or made me break out.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t perfumed, it just smells clean -- and NOTHING like sunscreen!</li>
            <li>If you think this product is too good to be true, you are right.  </li>
            <li>it has a silky feel and blends in easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>-- rest of my bod- super tan!</li>
            <li>product has a great smell, does not feel greasy, and I feel protected from the sun&#x27;s damaging rays for several hours.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have a lot of experience with sunscreen as I have developed fairly severe hyper pigmentation on my face.</li>
            <li>Works well and us good with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>He put sit on before golf then puts other sunscreen on throughout the day since he is very fair skinned.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a scent, it doesn&#x27;t make your face white and sticky, it feels clean and it does provide great protection.</li>
            <li>I first purchased this product from my skin cosmetologist and I love it.  </li>
            <li>My favorite sunblock--smells great and not oily, greasy or too heavy on the face.  </li>
            <li>I really dislike the odor of most</li>
            <li>love this product so much I buy it for my friends and family as gifts.</li>
            <li>It works tremendously well underneath my make up</li>
            <li>I do notice though that once I put it on, the scent quickly gies away.</li>
            <li>follow the Korean/Asian skincare routine, you really need to give this routine a try my skin is so much hydrated, glowy and amazing.</li>
            <li>I will still use the SPF 30 tinted version for a quick run to the store or something</li>
            <li>Package cam quickly</li>
            <li>I have tried so many high SPF moisturizers since having C02 laser on my face in October of 2011.</li>
            <li>Love what it does and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I live in California where it is partly sunny or partly cloudy most days.  </li>
            <li>This is the best sun block I really recommend it to everyone I wear it everyday!</li>
            <li>It is super light and makes my skin feel amazingly soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Also works great for everyday protection under my makeup.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Until I discovered the vital C repair creme, I was using this sunscreen in the morning and at night just because I love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>If there is even a chance that this product will do for you what it has done for me, then it is WELL worth the money to give it a try.</li>
            <li>and I rarely have to reapply any sort of sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very silky with all of the right ingredients!</li>
            <li>However, I find the spf isn&#x27;t so effective if makeup has been applied over the moisturizer, so I apply another coat when I&#x27;m working outside and the sun is intense.  </li>
            <li>Image products never fail me.  </li>
            <li>I planned on using it for the rest of my life or until they stopped making it -- whichever came first.  </li>
            <li>All sunscreens with the zinc are pretty chalky.</li>
            <li>This cream is reasonable, still pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>This is the first product I have put on my face that does not make my eyes water or burn</li>
            <li>The sunscreen has a strong scent, a little  too strong FOR ME.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m willing to pay a little extra for great quality.  </li>
            <li>Disappears quickly, smells fresh, actually moisturizes.</li>
            <li>The fluid absorbs fast and feel light on your skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am VERY picky when it comes to sunscreen that I put on my face.</li>
            <li>It really protects.</li>
            <li>This is such a light moisturize but gives you lots of sun protection.</li>
            <li>RECOMMEND FOR ANYONE WHOM IS OUT IN THE SUN, YOU CAN&#x27;T GET TOO MUCH PROTECTION ON YOUR FACE AFTER A COSMETIC TREATMENT.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>Do not need much.</li>
            <li>and i really like it.</li>
            <li>the ones by Image are subtle, pleasant, and don&#x27;t linger.  </li>
            <li>I live in the sun and have never got to much using this product.</li>
            <li>If I were to buy this at my local spa, the price would be about ten dollars more.)</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Shop</li>
            <li>Far better than any other SPF moisturizer I have used, and I&#x27;ve used pricier brands.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, for the first time in my 60 years I am wearing sunscreen everyday!!</li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t do much for me beside leaving a white cast on my face.</li>
            <li>around, the price does seem to vary quite a bit, but I think Amazon&#x27;s price is about the best (as usual, hard to beat their prices on just about anything!)</li>
            <li>So many sunscreens that I have bought in the past feel like grease on my face, and they doesn&#x27;t soak in for hours.</li>
            <li>and I like the scent and love that it does not leave that overpowering white hue to my face like other sunscreens.</li>
            <li>This one is no different, but it smells so good and actually is absorbed into my skin unlike many of the other very expensive creams.</li>
            <li>;  Then she said that it was not a very good one and showed me all of the spots on my face (most of it) that were unprotected and indicated no spf coverage.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs very and does not leave a white film.</li>
            <li>Recommended by skin care professional.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Image Sunscreens for several years, both the tinted and the matte form, and I really like this product also.  </li>
            <li>I was getting age spots from the sun when I was 25 years old.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and prone to acne</li>
            <li>Great texture - not at all thick or heavy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been protection my facial skin for decades and decided to try this nice creamy delicate scented product and wound up with a facial sunburn.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>If I could choose two, my second choice would be the vital c repair</li>
            <li>It is so soft and isn&#x27;t dry anymore.</li>
            <li>On a recent trip to Ecuador I used this on my sensitive skin (face and minor skin cancer biopsy scars on hands).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really sensitive to certain scents and it&#x27;s hard to find ones</li>
            <li>If you think the products leave your face too shiny, simply use one of the little oil absorbing sheets on the market to remove the shine.</li>

            <li> If you think this product is too good to be true, you are right.  </li>
            <li> it has a silky feel and blends in easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> -- rest of my bod- super tan!</li>
            <li> product has a great smell, does not feel greasy, and I feel protected from the sun&#x27;s damaging rays for several hours.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have a lot of experience with sunscreen as I have developed fairly severe hyper pigmentation on my face.</li>
            <li> Works well and us good with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> He put sit on before golf then puts other sunscreen on throughout the day since he is very fair skinned.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a scent, it doesn&#x27;t make your face white and sticky, it feels clean and it does provide great protection.</li>
            <li> I first purchased this product from my skin cosmetologist and I love it.  </li>
            <li> My favorite sunblock--smells great and not oily, greasy or too heavy on the face.  </li>
            <li> I really dislike the odor of most</li>
            <li> love this product so much I buy it for my friends and family as gifts.</li>
            <li> It works tremendously well underneath my make up</li>
            <li> I do notice though that once I put it on, the scent quickly gies away.</li>
            <li> follow the Korean/Asian skincare routine, you really need to give this routine a try my skin is so much hydrated, glowy and amazing.</li>
            <li> I will still use the SPF 30 tinted version for a quick run to the store or something</li>
            <li> Package cam quickly</li>
            <li> I have tried so many high SPF moisturizers since having C02 laser on my face in October of 2011.</li>
            <li> Love what it does and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I live in California where it is partly sunny or partly cloudy most days.  </li>
            <li> This is the best sun block I really recommend it to everyone I wear it everyday!</li>
            <li> It is super light and makes my skin feel amazingly soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Also works great for everyday protection under my makeup.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Until I discovered the vital C repair creme, I was using this sunscreen in the morning and at night just because I love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> If there is even a chance that this product will do for you what it has done for me, then it is WELL worth the money to give it a try.</li>
            <li> and I rarely have to reapply any sort of sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very silky with all of the right ingredients!</li>
            <li> However, I find the spf isn&#x27;t so effective if makeup has been applied over the moisturizer, so I apply another coat when I&#x27;m working outside and the sun is intense.  </li>
            <li> Image products never fail me.  </li>
            <li> I planned on using it for the rest of my life or until they stopped making it -- whichever came first.  </li>
            <li> All sunscreens with the zinc are pretty chalky.</li>
            <li> This cream is reasonable, still pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> This is the first product I have put on my face that does not make my eyes water or burn</li>
            <li> The sunscreen has a strong scent, a little  too strong FOR ME.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m willing to pay a little extra for great quality.  </li>
            <li> Disappears quickly, smells fresh, actually moisturizes.</li>
            <li> The fluid absorbs fast and feel light on your skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am VERY picky when it comes to sunscreen that I put on my face.</li>
            <li> It really protects.</li>
            <li> This is such a light moisturize but gives you lots of sun protection.</li>
            <li> RECOMMEND FOR ANYONE WHOM IS OUT IN THE SUN, YOU CAN&#x27;T GET TOO MUCH PROTECTION ON YOUR FACE AFTER A COSMETIC TREATMENT.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> Do not need much.</li>
            <li> and i really like it.</li>
            <li> the ones by Image are subtle, pleasant, and don&#x27;t linger.  </li>
            <li> I live in the sun and have never got to much using this product.</li>
            <li> If I were to buy this at my local spa, the price would be about ten dollars more.)</li>
            <li> highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Shop</li>
            <li> Far better than any other SPF moisturizer I have used, and I&#x27;ve used pricier brands.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, for the first time in my 60 years I am wearing sunscreen everyday!!</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t do much for me beside leaving a white cast on my face.</li>
            <li> around, the price does seem to vary quite a bit, but I think Amazon&#x27;s price is about the best (as usual, hard to beat their prices on just about anything!)</li>
            <li> So many sunscreens that I have bought in the past feel like grease on my face, and they doesn&#x27;t soak in for hours.</li>
            <li> and I like the scent and love that it does not leave that overpowering white hue to my face like other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> This one is no different, but it smells so good and actually is absorbed into my skin unlike many of the other very expensive creams.</li>
            <li> ;  Then she said that it was not a very good one and showed me all of the spots on my face (most of it) that were unprotected and indicated no spf coverage.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs very and does not leave a white film.</li>
            <li> Recommended by skin care professional.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Image Sunscreens for several years, both the tinted and the matte form, and I really like this product also.  </li>
            <li> I was getting age spots from the sun when I was 25 years old.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and prone to acne</li>
            <li> Great texture - not at all thick or heavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been protection my facial skin for decades and decided to try this nice creamy delicate scented product and wound up with a facial sunburn.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> If I could choose two, my second choice would be the vital c repair</li>
            <li> It is so soft and isn&#x27;t dry anymore.</li>
            <li> On a recent trip to Ecuador I used this on my sensitive skin (face and minor skin cancer biopsy scars on hands).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really sensitive to certain scents and it&#x27;s hard to find ones</li>
            <li> If you think the products leave your face too shiny, simply use one of the little oil absorbing sheets on the market to remove the shine.</li>
            <li> I have long used Image Daily Moisturizer and appreciate its SPF 50.</li>
            <li> but this one is my new everyday moisturizer and sunblock.</li>
            <li> Be careful, because same product comes in different SPFs.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts and helps out the dry patches.</li>
            <li> My face never feels dry &amp; never sunburns.</li>
            <li> I can not live without this product.  </li>
            <li> I spent 3 days on the lake and it was like I hadn&#x27;t been in the sun</li>
            <li> I always put the last little bit on my hands; they seem improved with a few weeks use.</li>
            <li> The only complaint (from him) is that it goes on thick and can leave his beard white.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s price on this product- its substantially less</li>
            <li> (I often just use a little bronzing powder to take away the slight stickiness.)</li>
            <li> a little oily but not greasy/heavy feel....</li>
            <li> It raked a little or it can be greasy under foundation.</li>
            <li> It provides the protection without leaving a heavy feeling on your face.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need to put it on heavy.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my husband and I to wear everyday.  </li>
            <li> Have been using this moisturizer and spf for a few years now.</li>
            <li> Moisturizer without being too heavy, greasy while providing protection</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy or heavy.  </li>
            <li> And I had just applied this product 3 hours previously!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to find a sheer SPF 50, but Image has done it.</li>
            <li> The dermatologist said I needed to use a sunscreen with at least a 40 SPF with zinc oxide for protection.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on a mere whim.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very pleased w/Ultimate Image moisturizer</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that breaks out easily, and this sunscreen has been perfect. Even with the strong yet nice bubblegum scent. I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It provides the protection without leaving a heavy feeling on your face.  Perfect for Phoenix sun.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, for the first time in my 60 years I am wearing sunscreen everyday!! Disappears quickly, smells fresh, actually moisturizes.</li>
            <li> Image products never fail me.  Delivery was perfect.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Awesome product... great company to buy from... use it every day!</li>
            <li> a little oily but not greasy/heavy feel.... like because of the protection. A bit pricey so might go back to the Neutrogena</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen I have ever used. It soaks in well and doesn&#x27;t interfere with foundation, if you choose to use some. (I often just use a little bronzing powder to take away the slight stickiness.) I always put the last little bit on my hands; they seem improved with a few weeks use.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of experience with sunscreen as I have developed fairly severe hyper pigmentation on my face. This stuff is great. I spent 3 days on the lake and it was like I hadn&#x27;t been in the sun (face only) -- rest of my bod- super tan! Thus lotion is Lite and smells wonderful. :)</li>
            <li> I first purchased this product from my skin cosmetologist and I love it.  I have rosacea and this moisturizer keeps me from braking out.  I would recommend it to any one with this skin problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed.  I&#x27;ve been using this for several years -- even before the company reformulated it.  I planned on using it for the rest of my life or until they stopped making it -- whichever came first.  Then I had a DermaScan Screening, and I could see all of the sun damage on my face.  The technician told me I needed to start wearing a sunscreen and I told her I do .. I did .. I had one on now!  She said &amp;#34;you do?!?&amp;#34;  Then she said that it was not a very good one and showed me all of the spots on my face (most of it) that were unprotected and indicated no spf coverage.  And I had just applied this product 3 hours previously!  I did some reserach and discovered that to really be effective, a facial sunscreen MUST contain mexoryl, which is the best UVA absorber. This product does not.  I really loved this, too ..........................</li>
            <li> Seems to be effective.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer - it has a silky feel and blends in easily.</li>
            <li> The best SPF and daily moisturizer I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> So many sunscreens that I have bought in the past feel like grease on my face, and they doesn&#x27;t soak in for hours. Then my face just feels sticky. As a result, I end up not wanting to re-apply as often as I should.&lt;br /&gt;This product has a great smell, does not feel greasy, and I feel protected from the sun&#x27;s damaging rays for several hours.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Shop around, the price does seem to vary quite a bit, but I think Amazon&#x27;s price is about the best (as usual, hard to beat their prices on just about anything!)</li>
            <li> This is the Holy Grail of sunscreens. Truly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am VERY picky when it comes to sunscreen that I put on my face. I have never found one that worked well for me. They either didn&#x27;t smell good, didn&#x27;t feel good on my skin, wouldn&#x27;t work well with makeup, didn&#x27;t have enough spf, or made me break out. I purchased this product on a mere whim. It popped up in a sunscreen search I did and it had the highest spf. The decision to buy something like this from a brand I never heard of was the BEST decision I have ever made. I swear, this sunscreen changed my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until I discovered the vital C repair creme, I was using this sunscreen in the morning and at night just because I love how it makes my skin feel. It is super light and makes my skin feel amazingly soft and smooth. It works tremendously well underneath my make up ( I just allow about 5 minutes for it to absorb before applying foundation ). One of my favorite things about this product is the smell. It isn&#x27;t perfumed, it just smells clean -- and NOTHING like sunscreen! I really dislike the odor of most sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I was stranded on a desert island and had to pick ONE skincare product to bring with me, it would be this one. If I could choose two, my second choice would be the vital c repair creme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product so much I buy it for my friends and family as gifts. Everyone I have given it to has absolutely loved it, used it all, and then bought more. If there is even a chance that this product will do for you what it has done for me, then it is WELL worth the money to give it a try. Chances are you will fall in love just like I did.</li>
            <li> I love this product which is why I reordered it. It also has a nice scent.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist. Best moisturizer ever and an awesome sunscreen too!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is the best I have used.  The seller was prompt with shipping.</li>
            <li> Great texture - not at all thick or heavy. Provided great protection. I will buy again. Made my skin feel nice. Smelled nice too!</li>
            <li> This is a good product and gives excellent protection.  This is applied after the serum in the morning. I am finished with this review.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many high SPF moisturizers since having C02 laser on my face in October of 2011. The dermatologist said I needed to use a sunscreen with at least a 40 SPF with zinc oxide for protection. All sunscreens with the zinc are pretty chalky. This one is no different, but it smells so good and actually is absorbed into my skin unlike many of the other very expensive creams. This cream is reasonable, still pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product line for years. Love what it does and highly recommend it. We all need skin protection and moisture.</li>
            <li> This is the first product I have put on my face that does not make my eyes water or burn so I just love this product for out side</li>
            <li> I have used this for a few years and it has great sun protection and is perfect under make up. It has a floral scent that I don&#x27;t mind, but if you don&#x27;t like scents, you will not like this. I do notice though that once I put it on, the scent quickly gies away.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen has a strong scent, a little  too strong FOR ME. It really didn&#x27;t do much for me beside leaving a white cast on my face.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone and combination skin and it did not make me break out. It absorbs very and does not leave a white film. It&#x27;s very hydrating and is a nice base for make-up. Great I Image product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I follow the Korean/Asian skincare routine, you really need to give this routine a try my skin is so much hydrated, glowy and amazing. There are a number of steps but I can get all of them done in 10-15 mins.</li>
            <li> Have used for about 1 year now and I like the scent and love that it does not leave that overpowering white hue to my face like other sunscreens. Very light too.</li>
            <li> Living in California, protection for my face is essential. I have long used Image Daily Moisturizer and appreciate its SPF 50. As a moisturizer, I put it on each morning and know that my face is protected from the sun as well. During the day I will add a bit more if I know I will be out in the sun. It&#x27;s light and a little bit goes a long way. A tube will last me 4 to 6 weeks. Don&#x27;t need to put it on heavy.</li>
            <li> Recommended by skin care professional.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. I have combination skin. I can have acne or really dry peeling patches but this moisturizer seemed to be perfect. It doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts and helps out the dry patches. I LOVE that it is SPF50 so I can use it before  my morning runs. Also works great for everyday protection under my makeup. I will still use the SPF 30 tinted version for a quick run to the store or something but this one is my new everyday moisturizer and sunblock.</li>
            <li> Absolutely awesome moisturizer with sunscreen.  It smells great and really feels good when applied.  Has definitely improved my skin.  It is so soft and isn&#x27;t dry anymore.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen...goes on easy and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by a wonderful lady who does my facials. It has a great smell and is creamy and absorbs quickly into the skin.  Give it a try!</li>
            <li> I like the orange smell. It&#x27;s refreshing. The fluid absorbs fast and feel light on your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Image Sunscreens for several years, both the tinted and the matte form, and I really like this product also.  I&#x27;m really sensitive to certain scents and it&#x27;s hard to find ones I like but the ones by Image are subtle, pleasant, and don&#x27;t linger.  Some might think these products are pricey but I&#x27;m willing to pay a little extra for great quality.  If you think the products leave your face too shiny, simply use one of the little oil absorbing sheets on the market to remove the shine.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent!  Love the smell, love the way that it goes on and never feels greasy.  Best part it that it is full of wonderful ingredients and protects your skin with a SPF 50 sunscreen.  5 star!</li>
            <li> I buy this for my husband and I to wear everyday.  He put sit on before golf then puts other sunscreen on throughout the day since he is very fair skinned.  For me, this is all I need.  The only complaint (from him) is that it goes on thick and can leave his beard white.</li>
            <li> I have been using this sunscreen/moisturizer for 2 years now.  It covers without feeling greasy and goes great under my makeup.</li>
            <li> Great product. Very silky with all of the right ingredients!</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer. It smells great, goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave any oiliness.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I use it every day. Everyone thinks i&#x27;m in my forties. I&#x27;m almost 60! Love the smell. It really protects.</li>
            <li> This is a good sunscreen with a heavenly fragrance. I&#x27;m going to be reordering this one.</li>
            <li> Have been using this moisturizer and spf for a few years now. I was getting age spots from the sun when I was 25 years old. After using this with bi-monthly microdermabrasions, the sun spots are gone and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve burnt my face in almost 3 years. I play and coach sports where I&#x27;m outside ALL day, sweating profusely and I rarely have to reapply any sort of sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works, smells wonderful and isn&#x27;t greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like their night cr&amp;egrave;me.</li>
            <li> I had always stayed away from facial sunblocks because they &amp;#34;cake up&amp;#34; my foundation. What a surprise when my skin doctor used this on my face! Foundation goes on smoothly and the makeup looks great.</li>
            <li> Works well and us good with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen moisturizer I have found. I live in the sun and have never got to much using this product. AND it smells amazing and leave your skin glowing and feeling moist. Love It...</li>
            <li> If you think this product is too good to be true, you are right.  If you are using this for sun protection, do not&lt;br /&gt;trust it.  Shame on this company to call this  50spf.  I used it and got a sunburn on my face after using an spf 30 for many years with out a problem.  I&#x27;ve been protection my facial skin for decades and decided to try this nice creamy delicate scented product and wound up with a facial sunburn.  I&#x27;ll use it as a moisturizer and never buy it again.</li>
            <li> My favorite sunblock--smells great and not oily, greasy or too heavy on the face.  I am a repeat customer and have used this brand of sunscreen now for over 3 years--that&#x27;s how much I love it!</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer and effective sunscreen in one. Goes on smooth and provides a good amount of moisture without clogging pores.</li>
            <li> Very good sunscreen coverage. Easy to apply and seems to last all day.  Will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen moisturizer. It raked a little or it can be greasy under foundation.</li>
            <li> Moisturizer without being too heavy, greasy while providing protection</li>
            <li> I have used this product before as recommended by my aesthetician. It is a wonderful moisturizer and sun protection. I have sensitive skin and prone to acne but this product has been well tolerated by my skin. It gives my skin a youthful glow.</li>
            <li> I have used Image products for a while. This is such a light moisturize but gives you lots of sun protection.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff! It does not leave my face oily and it smells great! I purchased it because I wanted something with SPF of 50 or greater for my face. I am buying my second bottle now. Far better than any other SPF moisturizer I have used, and I&#x27;ve used pricier brands.</li>
            <li> The SPF 50 is very important to me.  I live in California where it is partly sunny or partly cloudy most days.  Be careful, because same product comes in different SPFs.</li>
            <li> This is the best sun block I really recommend it to everyone I wear it everyday!</li>
            <li> Package cam quickly, The product is really awesome and creamy, blends into skin well.&lt;br /&gt;It smells really nice. I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> love this product . image is a great moisturizer . goes on great not oliy at all love love love it</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT.  HELPS PROTECT AS WELL AS HELPS REJUVENATE, THEREFORE A WIN WIN!  RECOMMEND FOR ANYONE WHOM IS OUT IN THE SUN, YOU CAN&#x27;T GET TOO MUCH PROTECTION ON YOUR FACE AFTER A COSMETIC TREATMENT.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product and smells great.</li>
            <li> Image Prevention + is the best moisturizer with SPF I&#x27;ve ever used.  The moisturizer absorbs quickly and the built-in sun protection makes it perfect to wear alone or under make up.  I wear it every day!  (And the price on Amazon.com is excellent.  If I were to buy this at my local spa, the price would be about ten dollars more.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple years and I really like it.  I especially like the 50 SPF as I&#x27;m in the sun alot.  However, I find the spf isn&#x27;t so effective if makeup has been applied over the moisturizer, so I apply another coat when I&#x27;m working outside and the sun is intense.  I also like the way it moisturizes my skin without clogging my pores.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen ever!,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best sun protection product out on the market. Being a golfer I&#x27;m out in the sun a lot. I love the feel of the smoothness when applying to face. My face never feels dry &amp; never sunburns.</li>
            <li> Light weight, wonderful, light fragrance.  It&#x27;s difficult to find a sheer SPF 50, but Image has done it. Can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s price on this product- its substantially less that my Drs&#x27;</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer and sun block all in one</li>
            <li> I do not even feel like I am wearing sun lotion. On a recent trip to Ecuador I used this on my sensitive skin (face and minor skin cancer biopsy scars on hands). Worked great. Where I did not apply it evenly, at my hairline, I was burnt. Easy to apply, goes on smooth. Do not need much. I do not use this all over because of the expense.  I use a different product for arms, legs, etc.</li>
            <li> this was recommended to me by a skin care specialist and i really like it. It doesn&#x27;t have a scent, it doesn&#x27;t make your face white and sticky, it feels clean and it does provide great protection.</li>
            <li> I can not live without this product.  It&#x27;s not greasy or heavy.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year and will continue.</li>
