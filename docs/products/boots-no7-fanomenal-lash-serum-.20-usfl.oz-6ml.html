    <ol>
            <li>Great for eyebrows!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about two weeks and the results are incredible.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any eye problems with this</li>
            <li>What a great surprise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>AMAZING!  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with the result so far and will keep using it!</li>
            <li>young- but very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>It was ok.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more of this as gifts for the Holidays.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed my lashes filling in more</li>
            <li>I will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li>The packaging could definitely be better.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and will probably order the one for brows&lt;br /&gt;Works as well as advertised</li>
            <li>I will give it more time.</li>
            <li>they have many brands) and happen to see this beauty.</li>
            <li>and it said lash serum/growth and thought, ok, why not.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll continue using this as I am indeed seeing some growth, definitely on the ends of my lashes which give my eyes that sexy cat look :-D</li>
            <li>This has made a big difference--at a fair price!</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and doesnt have a scent, so</li>
            <li>Also, I wanted to mention this product is not paraben free.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Most lash serums do not actually do what they advertise, however, Boots is fantastic !!</li>
            <li>The lashes I re-grew were short, light colored and fairly thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the price, it was worth it.</li>
            <li>The info on the sheet sent with this says it has something like 75% success rate.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product consistently before bed for about a month now.  </li>
            <li>I hope I can add to the positive reviews when I update this review in the months to come....</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really get the results advertised</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really see much difference.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>Put a Qtip under the  lash when you use the fingernail polish size brush that comes with it, and don&#x27;t fully load the brush, much like scraping a bit off on the sides of the opening hole you do with finger nail polish.</li>
            <li>I like this product and it is long lasting and effective.</li>
            <li>Worked quickly and now they are all grown back!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried RevitaLash, which worked great, but it was expensive and it made my eyes insanely dry and sensitive.</li>
            <li>I normally buy products that are but wanted to try this one anyway due to its low cost and positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using consistently for 2 weeks and see no improvement in my lashes whatsoever, not even a little bit.</li>
            <li>This product made them a bit stronger (which I noticed after experiencing a little less breakage in lashes when removing my makeup), but that alone doesn&#x27;t make it worth the money - my eyelashes don&#x27;t break frequently to begin with.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard enough getting older in a country that has nothing but scorn for older women; being a lashless wonder wasn&#x27;t something I was eager to add to my list of defects.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Little by little :) and it&#x27;s only been a week and a half</li>
            <li> Was missing lashes on half of my right eyelid.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewer that too much product comes out and is wasted.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it did much more than a cold pressed linseed oil would do for growth.</li>
            <li> I Haven&#x27;t kept track on how long I&#x27;ve been using it</li>
            <li> My lashes still aren&#x27;t as long as I want them to be (like kim Kardashian&#x27;s when she&#x27;s wearing her lash extensions)</li>
            <li> And I noticed the ends of my lashes are curled up and long!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really sting to get in the eyes, but a bit irritating for a short time.</li>
            <li> I once used Rimmel London&#x27;s Lash Accelerator serum, and I feel that I got the same results using that while spending half the money.</li>
            <li> After a little over 2 months, I am definitely seeing results.</li>
            <li> If your eyelashes are sparse to begin with, you will have little to hold back excess from getting in the eye.</li>
            <li> No real change in my lashes when using this.</li>
            <li> I had a small part of missing lashes and there starting to grow back.</li>
            <li> My lashes have thinned and straightened a lot in the past few years, and were far too brittle to use mascara.  </li>
            <li> , I think it&#x27;s been a month or a month and a half.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks and my eyelashes are getting longer and thicker.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> The brush is thicker than I would like which makes the application on your lash line a bit messy.  </li>
            <li> I used it every day, probably missed a few days.</li>
            <li> it seems to be working, and I couldn&#x27;t get it at Target where I usually get it.where</li>
            <li> But the directions say to use it for at least 8 weeks.</li>
            <li> They are not as thick as I want them to be, but they are thicker than they were two months ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 52 and lost all my lashes about 5 yrs ago due to an allergic reaction to eyelash extension glue :(  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> So far so good. Look as if lashes are getting fuller.</li>
            <li> It works. Was missing lashes on half of my right eyelid. Worked quickly and now they are all grown back!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really get the results advertised</li>
            <li> This serum helps to boost lash growth and thickness.</li>
            <li> It was ok. I didn&#x27;t think it did much more than a cold pressed linseed oil would do for growth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why or how, but this does work.  My lashes have thinned and straightened a lot in the past few years, and were far too brittle to use mascara.  After 1 week using this they feel supple and seem to be thickening.  It&#x27;s hard enough getting older in a country that has nothing but scorn for older women; being a lashless wonder wasn&#x27;t something I was eager to add to my list of defects.  This has made a big difference--at a fair price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks and my eyelashes are getting longer and thicker.</li>
            <li> No real change in my lashes when using this. Goes on smoothly and doesnt have a scent, so that a plus, but did not see any results.</li>
            <li> After I have used this for a month, I noticed that my eyelashes were longer and thicker. I am very happy with the result so far and will keep using it!</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money ... My eyelashes just kept falling</li>
            <li> MY LASHES ARE JUST STARTING TO GET THICKER</li>
            <li> So far so good. I had a small part of missing lashes and there starting to grow back. Little by little :) and it&#x27;s only been a week and a half I&#x27;d say.</li>
            <li> After a little over 2 months, I am definitely seeing results. My lashes are longer and thicker, and you can&#x27;t beat the price. I&#x27;ve tried RevitaLash, which worked great, but it was expensive and it made my eyes insanely dry and sensitive. I haven&#x27;t experienced any eye problems with this (I&#x27;m a contact wearer). I&#x27;m very pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> AMAZING!  I&#x27;ve been using this for about two weeks and the results are incredible.  Wish all the cosmetics I bought had results like this. I will be buying more of this as gifts for the Holidays.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really see much difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 52 and lost all my lashes about 5 yrs ago due to an allergic reaction to eyelash extension glue :(  The lashes I re-grew were short, light colored and fairly thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product consistently before bed for about a month now.  I&#x27;ve noticed my lashes filling in more AND they are darker!!!  What a great surprise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now and I really like it. My lashes have not gotten thicker, but they have gotten longer. For the price, it was worth it. I will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> Great for eyebrows! I&#x27;ve been using this product every night for about a year on my thinning eyebrows. IT WORKS and I have eyebrows again.</li>
            <li> After one week of use, I notice lashes growing where there was once no hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using consistently for 2 weeks and see no improvement in my lashes whatsoever, not even a little bit. The brush is thicker than I would like which makes the application on your lash line a bit messy.  I agree with the other reviewer that too much product comes out and is wasted.  The packaging could definitely be better.  Also, I wanted to mention this product is not paraben free.  I normally buy products that are but wanted to try this one anyway due to its low cost and positive reviews.  However, this product does take 8 weeks to see results, so I hope I can add to the positive reviews when I update this review in the months to come....</li>
            <li> I love this product and will probably order the one for brows&lt;br /&gt;Works as well as advertised&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend to buy this product</li>
            <li> My lashes are longer. They are not as thick as I want them to be, but they are thicker than they were two months ago. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Most lash serums do not actually do what they advertise, however, Boots is fantastic !!</li>
            <li> The info on the sheet sent with this says it has something like 75% success rate. For the price and odds, I took a chance, and it works for me. After a month my lashes and eyebrows have grown, - not like when I was young- but very happy with the results.  I did learn a trick putting it on. It doesn&#x27;t really sting to get in the eyes, but a bit irritating for a short time. If your eyelashes are sparse to begin with, you will have little to hold back excess from getting in the eye. Put a Qtip under the  lash when you use the fingernail polish size brush that comes with it, and don&#x27;t fully load the brush, much like scraping a bit off on the sides of the opening hole you do with finger nail polish. Then use the Qtip you caught some excess to put on a eyebrow.  Note staring date somewhere, and about 30 days you should see some improvement.</li>
            <li> I think there is some improvement.  But the directions say to use it for at least 8 weeks. I will give it more time.</li>
            <li> it seems to be working, and I couldn&#x27;t get it at Target where I usually get it.where can I get it in a store so I won&#x27;t have to pay postage  mxwelm@gmail.com</li>
            <li> So I tried this because I was waiting for my Latisse order. In the meantime I wanted something to stimulate lash growth. So on my break at work, I stopped by the nearest Duane Reade (in the city they have many brands) and happen to see this beauty. I saw the price and it said lash serum/growth and thought, ok, why not. Purchase it at the drugstore as its $9.99 as opposed to 17 and change here. I Haven&#x27;t kept track on how long I&#x27;ve been using it, I think it&#x27;s been a month or a month and a half. I used it every day, probably missed a few days. And I noticed the ends of my lashes are curled up and long! My lashes still aren&#x27;t as long as I want them to be (like kim Kardashian&#x27;s when she&#x27;s wearing her lash extensions) but I&#x27;ll continue using this as I am indeed seeing some growth, definitely on the ends of my lashes which give my eyes that sexy cat look :-D</li>
            <li> I give this product three stars because although I did not see any lash growth, it did condition my lashes. This product made them a bit stronger (which I noticed after experiencing a little less breakage in lashes when removing my makeup), but that alone doesn&#x27;t make it worth the money - my eyelashes don&#x27;t break frequently to begin with. I used this product every night as part of my night time skin care routine, and when I finished the tube, I felt that my lashes were almost in the same shape they were to begin with. I once used Rimmel London&#x27;s Lash Accelerator serum, and I feel that I got the same results using that while spending half the money.</li>
            <li> I like this product and it is long lasting and effective.</li>
