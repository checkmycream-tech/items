            <li>I&#x27;m vegan - cruelty free is all I use.</li>
            <li>What a miracle that Jason happens to be not JUST cruelty free, but a five-star AAAAAA-class group of products.  </li>
            <li>cheap silicates that do nothing for hair should not be added in conditioners.  </li>
            <li>Try Giovanni&#x27;s &amp;#34;smooth as silk&amp;#34; instead since that is one of their conditioners that does not contain cheap silicates which will never give your hair the moisture it deserves.</li>
            <li>Always leaves my hair smooth and well-conditioned.</li>
            <li>Originally I bought both the Jason&#x27;s shampoo and Conditioner set, but these are both sitting in a landfill somewhere.</li>
            <li>Hair is much more easy to manage and very soft.  </li>
            <li>Might not be the right formula for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>But any who my hair love this product, my hair grows extremely fast with both shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>Soft and shiny hair with a tiny amount of this great conditioner</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used many natural shampoos and conditioners since I was a teenager, I am 29 now.</li>
            <li>I honestly was starting to think that my hair was thinning before I started using this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product so far it does make your hair softer.</li>
            <li>thanks you very much...for all..!!!</li>
            <li>This product was the only change in my regime so it was very easy to diagnose the cause.</li>
            <li>Afterwards, once I blow dried, it just leaves my hair soft, fly away free, and really shiny from roots to ends.  </li>
            <li>The product I recieved was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Jason brand hair products are always consistently high in quality and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>This conditioner loosens up my kinky curls, softens, and moisturize my hair very well.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for any person who is looking for an affordable, natural, and fresh smelling conditioner.</li>
            <li>I wanted a product that was SLS free and could potentially help my hair look thicker.</li>
            <li>it smells fresh and leaves my hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li>I could tell the difference in my hair&#x27;s texture after using this product just one time and my hair has been much softer and never tangles anymore</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling healthier and very silky.</li>
            <li>But in combo with it&#x27;s partnered shampoo, I really did not like this system.</li>
            <li>Very gentle and natural.  </li>
            <li>conditioner is essential if you prefer natural, lightly scented hair products.</li>
            <li>Decent conditioner, though I prefer OGX.</li>
            <li>The Jason brand shampoos are equally high in quality as their conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I highly recommend</li>
            <li>Otherwise, if you are using a low SLS shampoo but using Jason&#x27;s dimethicone conditioner, you will have tons of build up in your hair and it won&#x27;t be pretty!</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and is really manageable.</li>
            <li>I think as with most conditioners you need to give it a few weeks to see how your hair reacts to it.</li>
            <li>The dimethicone in this new product is not water-soluble.  </li>
            <li>It makes your hair fell very soft.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe the conditioner &#x27;strengthens&#x27; because i dont use it on my roots, because you&#x27;re not supposed to, but it makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li>COMPLETE GARBAGE</li>
            <li>And im all about using natural for hair</li>
            <li>This product is very moisturizing, smells fresh but not over-powering, and gets the job done without using much at all, and I have moderately thick hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one works very well at removing the tangles in my long hair.</li>
            <li>After first use I spent about 10 minutes trying to rinse out the conditioner, I still felt like there was stuff in my hair.</li>
            <li>It does not weigh your hair down like many other conditioners tend to do.  </li>
            <li>I am African American female, my hair texture is very kinky</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; is not the same as the old version.  </li>
            <li>no, it will not &amp;#34;restore&amp;#34; your hair or make it truly soft, it will only pretend to.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used all the other retail brands, and have never been able to put it on past the ends.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair that tends to get greasy.</li>
            <li>i have fine thin hair and this gave me volume when in use with the shampoo.</li>

            <li> i have fine thin hair and this gave me volume when in use with the shampoo.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and rinses clean.</li>
            <li> First conditioner I can use from roots to ends without leaving me with limp hair afterwards, even in August humidity!!</li>
            <li> Save the dimethicones for traditional conditioners that only traditional shampoo with SLS can break down.  </li>
            <li> I go thru so much conditioner because of my long, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> This one goes on from roots to ends, and leaves my hair untangled while wet in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Once finished I was gutted to find out it cost roughly $12-$15 a bottle to replace.</li>
            <li> I look forward to trying out other variants.</li>
            <li> I only do co-washes because shampooing is any unnecessary extra step for my hair texture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice and my hair that usually is like straw at the ends and not very soft is now like silk.</li>
            <li> It is a natural product that doesn&#x27;t weigh down my very thick hair</li>
            <li> Especially if you have thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair</li>
            <li> But it also weighs it down.</li>
            <li> This product weighs my hair down and it makes my hair greasy within an hour after using.</li>
            <li> It even makes the lower half of my hair look thinner like it&#x27;s not as spread out or voluminous.</li>
            <li> and you lose less hair.  </li>
            <li> Even though I was cutting my hair regularly, I was still getting split ends due to my need to take really hot showers (yes, hot water plus hair equals bad juju!).</li>
            <li> After a few washes I started to see the difference.</li>
            <li> Then I started noticing that my hair would dry like I put a ton of gel in it, and I mean a ton!</li>
            <li> You can get past the smell.  </li>
            <li> (my hair is about 6 inches past my shoulders and used to be tangled all the time</li>
            <li> I bought several bottles of this to keep my supply going, so needless to say</li>
            <li> I regret using drug store and even expensive &amp;#34;luxury&amp;#34; brands for so long!</li>
            <li> The conditioner is thick as it should be but the smell is just like OMG.  </li>
            <li> This is disappointing...</li>
            <li> The shampoo for this is terrible its very thin and doesn&#x27;t lather well at all.  </li>
            <li> Bought this to help strengthen my hair, but all it did was make my hair look terrible!</li>

            <li> Best conditioner ever! First conditioner I can use from roots to ends without leaving me with limp hair afterwards, even in August humidity!! I&#x27;ve used all the other retail brands, and have never been able to put it on past the ends.  This one goes on from roots to ends, and leaves my hair untangled while wet in the shower.  Afterwards, once I blow dried, it just leaves my hair soft, fly away free, and really shiny from roots to ends.  I LOVE this conditioner!</li>
            <li> I love it. Smells great. It works.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe the conditioner &#x27;strengthens&#x27; because i dont use it on my roots, because you&#x27;re not supposed to, but it makes my hair soft. But it also weighs it down. It even makes the lower half of my hair look thinner like it&#x27;s not as spread out or voluminous.</li>
            <li> I had won a bottle of this conditioner originally in a contest and fell in love with it. Once finished I was gutted to find out it cost roughly $12-$15 a bottle to replace. Enter Amazon Prime. It is a natural product that doesn&#x27;t weigh down my very thick hair so I can use it every day. Living in Florida and swimming and being exposed to chlorine and sun that is quite important to me. My hair has not looked or been this healthy in years. I absolutely love it. If your hair is damaged or just won&#x27;t bounce back after color treatments, consider this product. Especially if you have thick hair. Worth the price.</li>
            <li> I am African American female, my hair texture is very kinky im guessing that is a 4b or 4c. But any who my hair love this product, my hair grows extremely fast with both shampoo and conditioner. This conditioner loosens up my kinky curls, softens, and moisturize my hair very well. Im very happy with results thank you!</li>
            <li> Bought this to help strengthen my hair, but all it did was make my hair look terrible! After first use I spent about 10 minutes trying to rinse out the conditioner, I still felt like there was stuff in my hair. Thinking this was just a part of the product &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; I used it about two more times. Then I started noticing that my hair would dry like I put a ton of gel in it, and I mean a ton! My hair felt crusty as if gel was actually in my hair, but mind you I don&#x27;t use gel! Still to date my hair dries like there is gel in it, a month later, and I&#x27;m going to have to get my hair cut to remove whatever the heck this conditioner put in my hair. This product was the only change in my regime so it was very easy to diagnose the cause. Originally I bought both the Jason&#x27;s shampoo and Conditioner set, but these are both sitting in a landfill somewhere. COMPLETE GARBAGE THAT DAMAGES HAIR!</li>
            <li> Too soon to judge the medicinal or health benefits for this product, but I do like that it&#x27;s very light and it smells pleasant. It does not weigh your hair down like many other conditioners tend to do.  I recommend this.</li>
            <li> Soft and shiny hair with a tiny amount of this great conditioner -- it has a marvelous texture!  I&#x27;m vegan - cruelty free is all I use. Jason is just the ticket. What a miracle that Jason happens to be not JUST cruelty free, but a five-star AAAAAA-class group of products.  Always thrilled with Jason.</li>
            <li> It has Glycerin in it, not entirely Animal cruelty free is it?!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Hair is much more easy to manage and very soft.  I do not know what to use on my hair anymore because of its balding fragile condition, and this seems to help.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; is not the same as the old version.  Jason products seem to be using cheaper ingredients now to save money.  Same with their aloe conditioner.  This is disappointing...cheap silicates that do nothing for hair should not be added in conditioners.  The dimethicone in this new product is not water-soluble.  It only coats the hair which prevents moisture from getting in, so no, it will not &amp;#34;restore&amp;#34; your hair or make it truly soft, it will only pretend to.  Save the dimethicones for traditional conditioners that only traditional shampoo with SLS can break down.  Otherwise, if you are using a low SLS shampoo but using Jason&#x27;s dimethicone conditioner, you will have tons of build up in your hair and it won&#x27;t be pretty! Look at the ingredients to get the hair YOU want! All I know is that I will no longer be buying Jason conditioners.  Try Giovanni&#x27;s &amp;#34;smooth as silk&amp;#34; instead since that is one of their conditioners that does not contain cheap silicates which will never give your hair the moisture it deserves.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and feel  of my hair after using this conditioner. My hair feels soft and is really manageable. I have thick, coarse hair so I need something to help with detangling. I think as with most conditioners you need to give it a few weeks to see how your hair reacts to it. So far so good!</li>
            <li> I love all their products, make sure you add it to your hair with water though! Always leaves my hair smooth and well-conditioned.</li>
            <li> This product is very moisturizing, smells fresh but not over-powering, and gets the job done without using much at all, and I have moderately thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used many natural shampoos and conditioners since I was a teenager, I am 29 now. Jason brand hair products are always consistently high in quality and the price is very reasonable. I would recommend this for any person who is looking for an affordable, natural, and fresh smelling conditioner. The Jason brand shampoos are equally high in quality as their conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner is essential if you prefer natural, lightly scented hair products.</li>
            <li> Nice minty sort of smell. Works well!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this conditioner. I&#x27;ve used it twice and my hair that usually is like straw at the ends and not very soft is now like silk. I regret using drug store and even expensive &amp;#34;luxury&amp;#34; brands for so long!</li>
            <li> You can get past the smell.  The shampoo for this is terrible its very thin and doesn&#x27;t lather well at all.  I cant tell that its done anything actually.  The conditioner is thick as it should be but the smell is just like OMG.  Id rather take the biotin vitamin and use regular shampoo...</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt so healthy</li>
            <li> I used this product in conjunction with the Biotin shampoo. I have fine, thin hair that tends to get greasy. I wanted a product that was SLS free and could potentially help my hair look thicker. This product weighs my hair down and it makes my hair greasy within an hour after using. Yikes. Might not be the right formula for my fine hair. Will never purchase again.</li>
            <li> have been using this for years! love it! it smells fresh and leaves my hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li> I love these products. Leaves my hair soft and great smelling, and as someone who is conscious of ingredients now, I feel good about using this for my body. I look forward to trying out other variants.</li>
            <li> Best conditioner ever for curly, dry hair!  Love Jason.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  Also, the best detangler I&#x27;ve ever used for my daughter&#x27;s fine, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not in love with the smell but it&#x27;s the best conditioner I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s very thick and rinses clean. I highly recommend</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this conditioner. It smells great, is made of great ingredients and my hair apparently appreciates it! I honestly was starting to think that my hair was thinning before I started using this product. However, it turns out that I just needed something &amp;#34;reparative&amp;#34; to help with split ends. Even though I was cutting my hair regularly, I was still getting split ends due to my need to take really hot showers (yes, hot water plus hair equals bad juju!). Although I am trying to take more mild-temp. showers, using this conditioner has worked wonders for my hair. I could tell the difference in my hair&#x27;s texture after using this product just one time and my hair has been much softer and never tangles anymore (my hair is about 6 inches past my shoulders and used to be tangled all the time and I had to use a detangler on a daily basis). I bought several bottles of this to keep my supply going, so needless to say - this conditioner is my favorite! :)</li>
            <li> thanks you very much...for all..!!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any results yet....I&#x27;ve been using it for almost two months now.That&#x27;s all I have to say about it.</li>
            <li> I love this product so far it does make your hair softer. And im all about using natural for hair</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying this conditioner. It leaves my hair feeling healthier and very silky. The product I recieved was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Product is fantastic and arrived quickly!  I love that there is virtually no fragrance.</li>
            <li> I only do co-washes because shampooing is any unnecessary extra step for my hair texture. I prefer larger bottles. It is a good conditioner however. I saw no change in the thickness of my hair.</li>
            <li> This one works very well at removing the tangles in my long hair.</li>
            <li> Smells so great almost like cinnamon cookies or something really delicious.....it&#x27;s also great for the environment and for me.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of chemicals and toxins in it!  Very gentle and natural.  I wish that it came in a bigger bottle.  I go thru so much conditioner because of my long, thick hair.  The conditioner is on the thicker side, not runny.  It makes your hair fell very soft.  It also has biotin in it which helps your hair grow thicker, faster and you lose less hair.  I just had a baby so I am losing tons of hair.  I started using this and I notice a really big difference.  I would definitely recommend it and I will be using it again.  I am going to try the shampoo too when I run out of my current Paul Mitchell shampoo.</li>
            <li> I need it something to improve my scalp. After a few washes I started to see the difference. My hair looks a lot better!</li>
            <li> Decent conditioner, though I prefer OGX.</li>
            <li> I used this with the shampoo and it did not leave my hair greasy at all! i have fine thin hair and this gave me volume when in use with the shampoo. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> On it&#x27;s own this is a nice, light weight conditioner, thats why I gave it 4 stars.  But in combo with it&#x27;s partnered shampoo, I really did not like this system.</li>
