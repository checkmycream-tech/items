    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Very happy.</li>
            <li>Great stuff!  </li>
            <li>This is also the best scent ever.  </li>
            <li>This is the best.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nearly perfect product.</li>
            <li>Great deal for this product.  </li>
            <li>A great buy.</li>
            <li>it works great</li>
            <li>Otherwise works great.</li>
            <li>LOL.</li>
            <li>I am happy to get it on Subscribe and Save as I like to stock up.</li>
            <li>Because it is a great antiperspirant for me, I put up with this problem</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very effective in preventing odor and wetness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The powder scent also isn&#x27;t as pleasant as I would like.  </li>
            <li>Mitchum products are the best and they really work!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Mitchum is great to put on the bottom of your feet (on top of socks) before putting on your sneakers for a workout.</li>
            <li>I love how effective this product is!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>It works amazingly well on wetness and odor...</li>
            <li>The scent that I have, for both, is the Rose Petal.</li>
            <li>I nice find / deal.</li>
            <li>But then I am also one who could set my own kitchen on fire just by washing the dishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I have to make sure to use a good shaving cream on the days I use this deodorant</li>
            <li>I was hoping to love, since it got so many good reviews, but it didn&#x27;t work well....</li>
            <li>Breaks very easily.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite deodorant and it is really effective for me</li>
            <li>The first day or two I thought it was great.  </li>
            <li>i was in love.</li>
            <li>So I probably spend a bit more always having to have a spare stick on hand in case of breakage.  </li>
            <li>it does smell MUCH better...</li>
            <li>I was able to purchase a set of these.  </li>
            <li>Well, while I love this stuff it does fall apart almost everytime.  </li>
            <li>before I figured out having most of it crumble to the floor was not a fluke.</li>
            <li>my wife&#x27;s favorite.</li>
            <li>By the way you can get it at walgreens for 9.00 :)</li>
            <li>I love the ability to buy it in bulk and have it reordered without my having to do so.</li>
            <li>Some sauve deodorant works better on me.</li>
            <li>I love the product and will buy it whenever I have to, but will surely look around for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li>I have used this deodorant for many years.</li>
            <li>I love the texture and</li>
            <li>Love this deodorant.  </li>
            <li>When I first put it on, it is almost slimy feeling, but it dries and I am over it, I liked the kind they discontinued better.</li>
            <li>Look for the Original!</li>
            <li>but it is not always easy to find in stores.  </li>
            <li>this product is strong - when my go-to clinical strength anti-perspirant lost its effectiveness, my friend recommended this one to me.  </li>
            <li>The old deodorant has a better smell and it is more effective.</li>
            <li>Best of all, it does help keep me a bit drier but the main thing is it really helps keep odour at bay for the whole day!</li>
            <li>but when i bought my second one i experienced the crumbling and breaking that everyone else was talking about.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d give Mitchum Advanced Control  Powder....</li>
            <li>Only deordorant my wife can use and great price for bulk, in stores</li>
            <li>get one free over the summer</li>
            <li>Women use this powderly, lightly scented one.</li>
            <li>Have used Mitchem products for many years, this is the first time I ever encountered a defect.</li>
            <li>I love mitchum antispirants and this scent is pretty and not too overpowering with my fragrances.</li>
            <li>morning routine involves showering (sometimes shaving), applying deodorant/antiperspirant, putting on clean clothes and rushing out the door into the heat of the day.  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing product, will buy more when I get low.</li>
            <li>Has a nice soft smell, not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I was lucky if it worked for 48 mins.  </li>
            <li>I use Mitchem clinical because it really works great for inbetween using the prescription, which I can only use once a week.  </li>
            <li>Since mitchum is the only deodorant I can use I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I also have to apply a lot more of the new deodorant.</li>
            <li>Because my thyroid is out of whack, I need deodorant to help with my hot flashes and all I got was flashes of B.O.!  </li>
            <li>I have been able to wipe away the excess marks and still gain the benefits so its works but be sure that the product has had ample time to dry</li>
            <li>I got this product at a reasonable price and received it quickly from the seller!  </li>
            <li>Can not find in stores any more,  my daughter has played sports and has done professional dance.  </li>
            <li>So glad for Mitchum- tried so many other brands I had to toss.</li>
            <li>The new one barely has a scent and is definetly not as effective as the original but dries quicker.</li>
            <li>On the bright side, I did not need to apply any other deodorant/anti-perspirant for a couple of days.  </li>
            <li>gel solid does crumble, but only when you smash it into your arm to use it, lol.</li>
            <li>I got the powder scent and not only was there barely a scent, but when it mixed with your body it wasn&#x27;t a very pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>I tried their latest one that is supposed to last 48 hrs...</li>
            <li>Even my husband starting using this, claiming it was better than the men&#x27;s version.  </li>
            <li>I was able to finally shower</li>
            <li>First time trying Mitchem...</li>
            <li>I have always been a fan of Mitchum and am glad they are striving to make improvements for us extra sweaty folks!</li>
            <li>Hopefully the breakage problem is remedied first -</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I use it for working out or on those really hot summer days.</li>
            <li>Mitchum is the only cruelty-free brand of antipersperant/deodorant on the market that I&#x27;ve been able to find.  </li>
            <li>Most Mitchum is in gel form, but I prefer the solid.  </li>
            <li>This does not work nearly as well as the original Lady Mitchum.  </li>
            <li>Finally, when a good inch was left, all of it broke off from the plastic \\&quot;lifter.\\</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought this antiperspirant twice this year, from two different sources at two different times, and I believe I&#x27;ve given it a fair try.  </li>
            <li>The manufacturer needs to work on the packaging, the formulation or both to achieve better long term product integrity.  </li>
            <li>and I have used Mitchum in the past, so I thought this would be a good choice.  </li>
            <li>and I lost almost 1/2 the container since it crumbles after every use and breaks off large chunks.</li>
            <li>I thought that initial sting would quickly subside, I could get on with my day, and maybe I wouldn&#x27;t apply it to my freshly shaved underarm again.  </li>
            <li>It seems that the company much rather have a prettier bottle then to have something that works.</li>
            <li>That said, what stays in the container works very well for me,</li>
            <li>Did not have much of a smell to it.</li>
            <li>I felt like I had to treat it very gingerly, which isn&#x27;t how it should be.  </li>
            <li>Be gentle and you wont have this problem.</li>
            <li>This is the only Mitchum that blocks sweat and shows no sweat marks on clothes, which is important in dance.</li>
            <li>It really dries out my skin though</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I really needed it until I switched to another brand.</li>
            <li>I end up throwing out 1/4 to 1/2 of the whole stick.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really smell like powder but not too overpowering.</li>
            <li>However, something about that waxy texture does make this product more crumbly and breakable than other deodorant sticks I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>A few downfalls are:&lt;br /&gt;- breaks off very easy</li>
            <li>So, Mitchum if you see these negative comments that means that you should return to the EXACT original formula!!</li>
            <li>Works amazingly to counteract my excessive sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i sweat slightly more than the average person (a dermatologist told me i might have hyperhidrosis,</li>
            <li>The upshot was that I stayed dry and odor free even though I was working in the dreaded heat and humidity.  </li>
            <li>I just wish it had more for my money because the mens Mitchum has 6 for less</li>
            <li>I liked this product for its sweat control, however I probably lost at least 1/4 of it to breakage.  </li>
            <li>Some products will definitely sting after applying to a freshly shaved underarm.  </li>
            <li>It smells like mosquito-repellant and doesn&#x27;t at all live up to its promise.</li>
            <li>I have been using Mitchum for several years now, and it is the only deodorant that true to its protection.</li>
            <li>I bought several Smart Solids - for both women and men-</li>
            <li>Thank you, Mitchum for Women Smart Solid Clinical Performance Powder!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t help w/ sweating any more than other brands, but then it gave me a very strange smell.  </li>
            <li>Goes on sticky, but clear.  </li>
            <li>Goes on clear.</li>
            <li>by the way, I will be calling to complain DIRECTLY to the company 1-888-864-8248.</li>
            <li>i also think they might have fixed the formula so it doesn&#x27;t crumble</li>
            <li>, I think that can be fixed by not rolling it up</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t work any better than regular anti perspirants, I was still sweating and the powder fragrance is too heavy (even before I started</li>
            <li>I like the solid as it is clear and there is no waiting for the product to dry nor is there any white residue on clothing; however, I am distressed that the last inch or more of the product isn&#x27;t usable as it breaks away from the container and is not usable.</li>
            <li>Degree&#x27;s overall quality just seems higher and that&#x27;s what I intend to purchase in the future.</li>
            <li>Other deodorants never last all day for me, especially when I wear sleeveless tops and have bare skin touching bare skin all day.  </li>
            <li>I currently have the old and the new version of this deodorant.</li>
            <li>Generally, it doesn&#x27;t happen early, but it does happen before I am done with the stick.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- takes extra time to dry meaning it leaves those white marks when putting on a shirt too quickly but again, easily remedied by putting on after shirt is on or allowing a little extra time before dressing</li>
            <li>I compared the ingredients and the only thing that the new deodorant has is an added chemical called \\&quot;xylitol\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I thought if I kept using it (dumb me) it would get better.  </li>
            <li>The active ingredients seem to be the same as other brands, but something about the waxy texture seems to make it stay on my skin better.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it is a small price to pay to stay free of embarrassing odor.</li>
            <li>so you aren&#x27;t surprised by white marks showing up when you are out &amp; about.&lt;br</li>
            <li>or it&#x27;s at least worth a try!</li>
            <li>I went back to a regular strength brand for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>This product finally showed me just how terribly human I am and made me sensitive to the misery of others</li>
            <li>Careful not to open too much at a time.</li>
            <li>well, I took a whiff of the broken chunk, and that person was right!!  </li>
            <li>When I use the Smart Solid, I feel less gross and never have to deal with unwanted odor.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> That said, what stays in the container works very well for me,</li>
            <li> Did not have much of a smell to it.</li>
            <li> I felt like I had to treat it very gingerly, which isn&#x27;t how it should be.  </li>
            <li> Be gentle and you wont have this problem.</li>
            <li> This is the only Mitchum that blocks sweat and shows no sweat marks on clothes, which is important in dance.</li>
            <li> It really dries out my skin though</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I really needed it until I switched to another brand.</li>
            <li> I end up throwing out 1/4 to 1/2 of the whole stick.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really smell like powder but not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> However, something about that waxy texture does make this product more crumbly and breakable than other deodorant sticks I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> A few downfalls are:&lt;br /&gt;- breaks off very easy</li>
            <li> So, Mitchum if you see these negative comments that means that you should return to the EXACT original formula!!</li>
            <li> Works amazingly to counteract my excessive sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i sweat slightly more than the average person (a dermatologist told me i might have hyperhidrosis,</li>
            <li> The upshot was that I stayed dry and odor free even though I was working in the dreaded heat and humidity.  </li>
            <li> I just wish it had more for my money because the mens Mitchum has 6 for less</li>
            <li> I liked this product for its sweat control, however I probably lost at least 1/4 of it to breakage.  </li>
            <li> Some products will definitely sting after applying to a freshly shaved underarm.  </li>
            <li> It smells like mosquito-repellant and doesn&#x27;t at all live up to its promise.</li>
            <li> I have been using Mitchum for several years now, and it is the only deodorant that true to its protection.</li>
            <li> I bought several Smart Solids - for both women and men-</li>
            <li> Thank you, Mitchum for Women Smart Solid Clinical Performance Powder!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t help w/ sweating any more than other brands, but then it gave me a very strange smell.  </li>
            <li> Goes on sticky, but clear.  </li>
            <li> Goes on clear.</li>
            <li> by the way, I will be calling to complain DIRECTLY to the company 1-888-864-8248.</li>
            <li> i also think they might have fixed the formula so it doesn&#x27;t crumble</li>
            <li> , I think that can be fixed by not rolling it up</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t work any better than regular anti perspirants, I was still sweating and the powder fragrance is too heavy (even before I started</li>
            <li> I like the solid as it is clear and there is no waiting for the product to dry nor is there any white residue on clothing; however, I am distressed that the last inch or more of the product isn&#x27;t usable as it breaks away from the container and is not usable.</li>
            <li> Degree&#x27;s overall quality just seems higher and that&#x27;s what I intend to purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> Other deodorants never last all day for me, especially when I wear sleeveless tops and have bare skin touching bare skin all day.  </li>
            <li> I currently have the old and the new version of this deodorant.</li>
            <li> Generally, it doesn&#x27;t happen early, but it does happen before I am done with the stick.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- takes extra time to dry meaning it leaves those white marks when putting on a shirt too quickly but again, easily remedied by putting on after shirt is on or allowing a little extra time before dressing</li>
            <li> I compared the ingredients and the only thing that the new deodorant has is an added chemical called \\&quot;xylitol\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I thought if I kept using it (dumb me) it would get better.  </li>
            <li> The active ingredients seem to be the same as other brands, but something about the waxy texture seems to make it stay on my skin better.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it is a small price to pay to stay free of embarrassing odor.</li>
            <li> so you aren&#x27;t surprised by white marks showing up when you are out &amp; about.&lt;br</li>
            <li> or it&#x27;s at least worth a try!</li>
            <li> I went back to a regular strength brand for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> This product finally showed me just how terribly human I am and made me sensitive to the misery of others</li>
            <li> Careful not to open too much at a time.</li>
            <li> well, I took a whiff of the broken chunk, and that person was right!!  </li>
            <li> When I use the Smart Solid, I feel less gross and never have to deal with unwanted odor.</li>
            <li> I sometime use antiperspirant on other frequently sweaty parts - like my forehead if I&#x27;m going to a wedding.</li>
            <li> You can normally count on Mitchum, but this product is a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> just embarrassing) and dove (clinical protection), secret, old spice, certain dri, and even a prescription i got from a dermatologist did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> This one wasn&#x27;t thick, but it also didn&#x27;t seem to work very well.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully I am one who normally enjoys very few if any complications or reactions.  </li>
            <li> Best deodorant and no strong awful smell!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d prefer a little white powder on my clothing than a product that makes me smell like I have drinking problem and doesn&#x27;t even work...</li>
            <li> I much prefer Degree&#x27;s clinical strength version (powder scent), even over Secret&#x27;s clinical strength version.  </li>
            <li> This brand leaves white traces once its dried.</li>
            <li> For this reason, it&#x27;s not very economical.</li>
            <li> I have used other Mitchum deodorant products for years but don&#x27;t know what happened with this one.</li>
            <li> so I decided to try this, as I have tried ALL of the other &#x27;clinical&#x27; , &#x27;maximum strength&#x27; 20% gly products and always sweat through and find odor there by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> That said, I will of course try other products that come along among other brands since solutions to sweatiness are never wholly encompassing.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a change since I usually use a different \\&quot;clinical protection\\&quot; brand.  </li>
            <li> I will  only use this Mitchum, and it is hard to find except on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I put some on the other night before going to bed and my partner asked me if I&#x27;d been drinking whiskey!</li>
            <li> I tend to sweat heavy due to a hormonal issue.  </li>
            <li> The solution is to put a little water in the cap, put the deodorant stick in upside down, shake, and leave upside down until you use it again.</li>
            <li> less fortunate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is a little off, but it grew on me and I like it now.</li>
            <li> hands down!</li>
            <li> I like to buy at least one sick of Mitchum for women Smart Solid Clinical Performance Powder deodorant to have in the house.</li>
            <li> Going back to Secret.</li>
            <li> I assume if you&#x27;ve bought this product it&#x27;s because you consider yourself a &#x27;heavy&#x27; sweater.</li>
            <li> When I traveled to Europe it was not available.</li>
            <li> At least with the other deodorants/antiperspirants if I do have sweating, it controls the odor.</li>
            <li> Never any residue on delicate silks or other fabrics.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little trouble, but if you&#x27;ve already bought it, at least you can use it up</li>
            <li> I have the excessive sweating problem.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the solution is, but when Mitchum figures it out, it would be a five-star product.</li>
            <li> Hard time finding it in store</li>
            <li> It is irritating and a waste.  </li>
            <li> Dove and Secret have 15-16% of the active ingredient (Mitchum has 20%) and is twice as expensive.</li>
            <li> I wanted to switch because Secret was still causing me to sweat some, and it was thick going on.  </li>
            <li> Someone said insect repellent, and I think that may be a decent description.  </li>
            <li> The powder stick fall apart in chunks, it is very hard to use.  </li>
            <li> If it ain&#x27;t broken don&#x27;t fix it....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not controlling the sweating and even worse</li>
            <li> Sticky, ineffective and not a great scent.</li>
            <li> Very expensive and not worth buying again</li>
            <li> Once it dries, it feels like nothing is there and isn&#x27;t uncomfortable at all.  </li>
            <li> , I sweat and this works perfectly no sweating!</li>
            <li> This is the one and only product that keeps me from being stank nasty.  </li>
            <li> WRONG.  </li>
            <li> It absolutely stinks and does not smell at all like baby powder.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s just not polite to sweat all over the place and stink like mad.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;**do not let the bad reviews about the crumbling stop you from trying this deodorant because it does work</li>
            <li> or I get really bad razor burn.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Both sticks sometimes broke off while I applied the product, which was both annoying and wasteful.  </li>
            <li> I hate this deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I hate hate</li>
            <li> hate this product it feels sticky and cause me to have a chemical razor burn....</li>
            <li> Never have I ever had razor burn under my armpits very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have terrible body odor.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s why I&#x27;ll be including one of these sticks in a care package for my nasty sister-in-law.  </li>
            <li> NO, armpits broke out in a rash and itched terribly.  </li>
            <li> Awful!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the only deodorant I use.  Hard time finding it in store so I buy in bulk here.  I tried their latest one that is supposed to last 48 hrs...I was lucky if it worked for 48 mins.  Its gotta be the waxy stick application that does the trick.  Idk, but I&#x27;ve been using it for years and don&#x27;t anticipate a change any time soon</li>
            <li> The first day or two I thought it was great.  After that, no.  It didn&#x27;t help w/ sweating any more than other brands, but then it gave me a very strange smell.  I got the powder scent and not only was there barely a scent, but when it mixed with your body it wasn&#x27;t a very pleasant smell.  Someone said insect repellent, and I think that may be a decent description.  I wanted to switch because Secret was still causing me to sweat some, and it was thick going on.  This one wasn&#x27;t thick, but it also didn&#x27;t seem to work very well.  Won&#x27;t buy again.  Going back to Secret.</li>
            <li> I currently have the old and the new version of this deodorant. I compared the ingredients and the only thing that the new deodorant has is an added chemical called \\&quot;xylitol\\&quot;.  The old deodorant has a better smell and it is more effective. The new one barely has a scent and is definetly not as effective as the original but dries quicker. I also have to apply a lot more of the new deodorant. The scent that I have, for both, is the Rose Petal. That is the only scent I like with Mitchum. So, Mitchum if you see these negative comments that means that you should return to the EXACT original formula!! It seems that the company much rather have a prettier bottle then to have something that works. If it ain&#x27;t broken don&#x27;t fix it....by the way, I will be calling to complain DIRECTLY to the company 1-888-864-8248. I advise everyone the same.</li>
            <li> I have used other Mitchum deodorant products for years but don&#x27;t know what happened with this one. It smells like mosquito-repellant and doesn&#x27;t at all live up to its promise. I put some on the other night before going to bed and my partner asked me if I&#x27;d been drinking whiskey! I&#x27;d prefer a little white powder on my clothing than a product that makes me smell like I have drinking problem and doesn&#x27;t even work...</li>
            <li> Best deodorant and no strong awful smell! So glad for Mitchum- tried so many other brands I had to toss. Finally tried these in Powder after Rosepetal was no longer being made. Very happy.</li>
            <li> i sweat slightly more than the average person (a dermatologist told me i might have hyperhidrosis, but i don&#x27;t think my sweating is that severe... just embarrassing) and dove (clinical protection), secret, old spice, certain dri, and even a prescription i got from a dermatologist did nothing for me. then i got this specific mitchum deodorant and it worked wonders. i was in love. but when i bought my second one i experienced the crumbling and breaking that everyone else was talking about. so i hunted for another deodorant, but after a year i have returned to this one and i think they have worked on a formula or something where it won&#x27;t crumble because the one i recently bought doesn&#x27;t have that problem. this is my staple deodorant that i&#x27;ll probably use for the rest of my life, it&#x27;s reliable and is what works for me and i won&#x27;t use anything else. my hunt is over and i would definitely recommend it to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;**do not let the bad reviews about the crumbling stop you from trying this deodorant because it does work or it&#x27;s at least worth a try! i also think they might have fixed the formula so it doesn&#x27;t crumble**</li>
            <li> I assume if you&#x27;ve bought this product it&#x27;s because you consider yourself a &#x27;heavy&#x27; sweater. I fall into that category and thought I&#x27;d give this a try. I had been using Ban but I was still having breakthrough sweating so I wanted to try this. It&#x27;s not controlling the sweating and even worse I have terrible body odor. At least with the other deodorants/antiperspirants if I do have sweating, it controls the odor. After giving it 2 weeks, this is going in the garbage.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  Other deodorants never last all day for me, especially when I wear sleeveless tops and have bare skin touching bare skin all day.  The active ingredients seem to be the same as other brands, but something about the waxy texture seems to make it stay on my skin better.  Once it dries, it feels like nothing is there and isn&#x27;t uncomfortable at all.  Even my husband starting using this, claiming it was better than the men&#x27;s version.  However, something about that waxy texture does make this product more crumbly and breakable than other deodorant sticks I&#x27;ve tried.  So I probably spend a bit more always having to have a spare stick on hand in case of breakage.  Overall, it is a small price to pay to stay free of embarrassing odor.</li>
            <li> No white residue under your arms, I sweat and this works perfectly no sweating!</li>
            <li> I have the excessive sweating problem.  I use a prescription anti-persperant call Drysol.  I use Mitchem clinical because it really works great for inbetween using the prescription, which I can only use once a week.  Mitchem has always helped with the sweating and now that it makes clinical strength, it is the only one I&#x27;ll buy.</li>
            <li> I liked this product for its sweat control, however I probably lost at least 1/4 of it to breakage.  For awhile, \\&quot;only\\&quot; chunks the size of a grape would just fall off while applying it.  Finally, when a good inch was left, all of it broke off from the plastic \\&quot;lifter.\\&quot; One person said it smelled like mosquito repellant...well, I took a whiff of the broken chunk, and that person was right!!  Can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t notice that!  I thought I&#x27;d give Mitchum Advanced Control  Powder....it does smell MUCH better...no breakage after one week&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> You can normally count on Mitchum, but this product is a huge disappointment. Sticky, ineffective and not a great scent. Skip it. Look for the Original!</li>
            <li> I like the no white residue idea and it works well. But it falls apart and I lost almost 1/2 the container since it crumbles after every use and breaks off large chunks. I tried smashing them back on, didn&#x27;t work. Very expensive and not worth buying again</li>
            <li> Only deordorant my wife can use and great price for bulk, in stores (if you can find it) its 5 per bottle.</li>
            <li> Great deal for this product.  I like that I was able to purchase a set of these.  Mitchum products are the best and they really work!!</li>
            <li> Since mitchum is the only deodorant I can use I am very satisfied with my purchase. The price for the product as well as the speed of the delivery. I will definitely be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite deodorant and it is really effective for me but it is not always easy to find in stores.  I am grateful Amazon has it.  Why 4 stars and not 5?  Well, while I love this stuff it does fall apart almost everytime.  Generally, it doesn&#x27;t happen early, but it does happen before I am done with the stick.  It is irritating and a waste.  The manufacturer needs to work on the packaging, the formulation or both to achieve better long term product integrity.  That said, what stays in the container works very well for me, so I continue to use it despite some frustration with the product crumbling.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it said &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; performance.  Because my thyroid is out of whack, I need deodorant to help with my hot flashes and all I got was flashes of B.O.!  The deodorant lasted about four hours before I realized I need a reapply.  I also had to reapply when I got home and after my workout!</li>
            <li> I bought several Smart Solids - for both women and men- before I figured out having most of it crumble to the floor was not a fluke. The solution is to put a little water in the cap, put the deodorant stick in upside down, shake, and leave upside down until you use it again. It&#x27;s a little trouble, but if you&#x27;ve already bought it, at least you can use it up</li>
            <li> A great buy. I will purchase again for the wife. I nice find / deal. I&#x27;m not gonna let this one go.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Summer in the south.  Sometimes it&#x27;s just not polite to sweat all over the place and stink like mad.  Thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  It&#x27;s very effective in preventing odor and wetness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My morning routine involves showering (sometimes shaving), applying deodorant/antiperspirant, putting on clean clothes and rushing out the door into the heat of the day.  Some products will definitely sting after applying to a freshly shaved underarm.  Thankfully I am one who normally enjoys very few if any complications or reactions.  But then I am also one who could set my own kitchen on fire just by washing the dishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied this product to my underarms recently.  I thought that initial sting would quickly subside, I could get on with my day, and maybe I wouldn&#x27;t apply it to my freshly shaved underarm again.  The upshot was that I stayed dry and odor free even though I was working in the dreaded heat and humidity.  But it wasn&#x27;t all so terrific.  The entire day wore on as if I had given myself a chemical peel and applied biting fire ants to my underarms.  I could not wait to shower again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I was able to finally shower, my underarms looked like... I had given myself a chemical peel and applied biting fire ants to my underarms.  On the bright side, I did not need to apply any other deodorant/anti-perspirant for a couple of days.  I went back to a regular strength brand for sensitive skin.  This product finally showed me just how terribly human I am and made me sensitive to the misery of others less fortunate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that&#x27;s why I&#x27;ll be including one of these sticks in a care package for my nasty sister-in-law.  Thank you, Mitchum for Women Smart Solid Clinical Performance Powder!</li>
            <li> my wife&#x27;s favorite. Can&#x27;t find in stores anymore</li>
            <li> the product falls in pieces when applying to under arm</li>
            <li> First time trying Mitchem... The powder stick fall apart in chunks, it is very hard to use.  Dislike and not recommended.</li>
            <li> Did not have much of a smell to it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Mitchum for several years now, and it is the only deodorant that true to its protection.</li>
            <li> I used to use Mitchum&#x27;s antibacterial roll on product but I don&#x27;t think they make that anymore so I decided to try this, as I have tried ALL of the other &#x27;clinical&#x27; , &#x27;maximum strength&#x27; 20% gly products and always sweat through and find odor there by the end of the day.  This one WORKS!  Goes on soothing because it&#x27;s made of water and no odor and wetness.  By the way you can get it at walgreens for 9.00 :)</li>
            <li> The deodorant stick crumbles apart after a day or two of use. Have used Mitchem products for many years, this is the first time I ever encountered a defect. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> This the only brand that I can wear. I love the ability to buy it in bulk and have it reordered without my having to do so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this antiperspirant twice this year, from two different sources at two different times, and I believe I&#x27;ve given it a fair try.  Both sticks sometimes broke off while I applied the product, which was both annoying and wasteful.  I felt like I had to treat it very gingerly, which isn&#x27;t how it should be.  The powder scent also isn&#x27;t as pleasant as I would like.  I much prefer Degree&#x27;s clinical strength version (powder scent), even over Secret&#x27;s clinical strength version.  Degree&#x27;s overall quality just seems higher and that&#x27;s what I intend to purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> Dove and Secret have 15-16% of the active ingredient (Mitchum has 20%) and is twice as expensive. The smell is a little off, but it grew on me and I like it now. Its a spicy powder scent... Anyway, I got it buy one get one free over the summer and Im just running out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel solid does crumble, but only when you smash it into your arm to use it, lol. Be gentle and you wont have this problem.</li>
            <li> I love how effective this product is! Works amazingly to counteract my excessive sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A few downfalls are:&lt;br /&gt;- breaks off very easy so I keep it rolled up as minimally as possible, just above scraping &amp; haven&#x27;t had any problems since&lt;br /&gt;- takes extra time to dry meaning it leaves those white marks when putting on a shirt too quickly but again, easily remedied by putting on after shirt is on or allowing a little extra time before dressing&lt;br /&gt;- I sometime use antiperspirant on other frequently sweaty parts - like my forehead if I&#x27;m going to a wedding. This brand leaves white traces once its dried. I have been able to wipe away the excess marks and still gain the benefits so its works but be sure that the product has had ample time to dry so you aren&#x27;t surprised by white marks showing up when you are out &amp; about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely continue to purchase this product. I have always been a fan of Mitchum and am glad they are striving to make improvements for us extra sweaty folks! That said, I will of course try other products that come along among other brands since solutions to sweatiness are never wholly encompassing. Hopefully the breakage problem is remedied first - that too me is the biggest annoyance.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a change since I usually use a different \\&quot;clinical protection\\&quot; brand.  I tend to sweat heavy due to a hormonal issue.  I bought this one and I am disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have the issues others had with it breaking, I think that can be fixed by not rolling it up too high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t work any better than regular anti perspirants, I was still sweating and the powder fragrance is too heavy (even before I started sweating).&lt;br /&gt;It seemed like I could smell it every time I moved!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time I will go for a lighter fragrance and stronger anti perspirant.</li>
            <li> This is the one and only product that keeps me from being stank nasty.  This is also the best scent ever.  I have been known to make people smell my armpits.  And they do.  And they like it.</li>
            <li> This is the best.  Can not find in stores any more,  my daughter has played sports and has done professional dance.  This is the only Mitchum that blocks sweat and shows no sweat marks on clothes, which is important in dance.</li>
            <li> this product is strong - when my go-to clinical strength anti-perspirant lost its effectiveness, my friend recommended this one to me.  it works great</li>
            <li> I love mitchum antispirants and this scent is pretty and not too overpowering with my fragrances. Best of all, it does help keep me a bit drier but the main thing is it really helps keep odour at bay for the whole day!</li>
            <li> Works wonders!! Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Breaks into unusable chunks. I&#x27;m so disappointed. Might as throw it out.</li>
            <li> I got this product at a reasonable price and received it quickly from the seller!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Careful not to open too much at a time. Breaks very easily. Otherwise works great.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a Baby Powder scent and I have used Mitchum in the past, so I thought this would be a good choice.  WRONG.  It absolutely stinks and does not smell at all like baby powder.  It doesn&#x27;t last the entire day.  By the evening my armpits smell like I forgot to use deodorant.  The bummer is that I had to purchase 4 of these so now I&#x27;m stuck.  Money spend on a product I do not want to use.</li>
            <li> I hate this deodorant.  After shaving my armpits stung.  I thought if I kept using it (dumb me) it would get better.  NO, armpits broke out in a rash and itched terribly.  This does not work nearly as well as the original Lady Mitchum.  Awful!</li>
            <li> Goes on sticky, but clear.  I was hoping to love, since it got so many good reviews, but it didn&#x27;t work well....Some sauve deodorant works better on me. Kept me dry...but didn&#x27;t help in the deodorizing area.</li>
            <li> I like to buy at least one sick of Mitchum for women Smart Solid Clinical Performance Powder deodorant to have in the house. I use it for working out or on those really hot summer days. It really dries out my skin though so I have to make sure to use a good shaving cream on the days I use this deodorant or I get really bad razor burn. Overall I prefer Dove cucumber scent but&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mitchum is great to put on the bottom of your feet (on top of socks) before putting on your sneakers for a workout. Your feet and shoes will NEVER stink again!</li>
            <li> I just wish it had more for my money because the mens Mitchum has 6 for less money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I love the product and will buy it whenever I have to, but will surely look around for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> it kept breaking apart when i would apply it to my underarm i threw away probably 1/2 of every bottle</li>
            <li> I have used this deodorant for many years. I didn&#x27;t think I really needed it until I switched to another brand. LOL. I went back in a hurry. I have never had an issues even on the hottest of days. Never any residue on delicate silks or other fabrics. I am happy to get it on Subscribe and Save as I like to stock up. When I traveled to Europe it was not available. I only wish I could find a travel size.</li>
            <li> It works amazingly well on wetness and odor...hands down! During the summer, I sweat like a whore in church. When I use the Smart Solid, I feel less gross and never have to deal with unwanted odor. I love the texture and how it doesn&#x27;t cake up under my arms. It&#x27;s a nearly perfect product. However, halfway to 3/4 through the stick, it begins to break off, crumble, fall apart, and can&#x27;t be used anymore. I end up throwing out 1/4 to 1/2 of the whole stick. For this reason, it&#x27;s not very economical. I&#x27;m not sure what the solution is, but when Mitchum figures it out, it would be a five-star product.</li>
            <li> When I first put it on, it is almost slimy feeling, but it dries and I am over it, I liked the kind they discontinued better.</li>
            <li> Love this deodorant.  Goes on clear. Doesn&#x27;t really smell like powder but not too overpowering. Would recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> Mitchum is my antiperspirant of choice. I like the solid as it is clear and there is no waiting for the product to dry nor is there any white residue on clothing; however, I am distressed that the last inch or more of the product isn&#x27;t usable as it breaks away from the container and is not usable. And, this has happened with every purchase, not just an isolated issue. Because it is a great antiperspirant for me, I put up with this problem</li>
            <li> Mitchum is the only cruelty-free brand of antipersperant/deodorant on the market that I&#x27;ve been able to find.  Most Mitchum is in gel form, but I prefer the solid.  Has a nice soft smell, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> This is totally different from the clinical Mitchum at walmart. I hate hate hate this product it feels sticky and cause me to have a chemical razor burn.... Never have I ever had razor burn under my armpits very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product, will buy more when I get low. Also telling all my family and friends about Mitchum</li>
            <li> Mitchum is all we use in this family. Women use this powderly, lightly scented one. I will  only use this Mitchum, and it is hard to find except on Amazon.com. I bought 4 the last time, next time we need some I will buy a case. HERE&#x27;S HOPEING IT IS NOT TAKEN OFF THE SHELF.</li>
