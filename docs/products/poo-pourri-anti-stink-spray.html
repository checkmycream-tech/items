            <li>It smells great!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great!</li>
            <li>It has an awesome lemongrass smell which does the trick for covering those unwanted odors.</li>
            <li>Best bathroom deodorizer on the market!</li>
            <li>it smells very good</li>

            <li>Great conversational piece and allows reluctant guests</li>
            <li>But it makes a great gift for name brand sake</li>
            <li>And it is great to use as air freshener also.  </li>

            <li>AMAZING!  </li>
            <li>It works, quite amazing!</li>
            <li>I will be honest and say that this product is incredible.  </li>
            <li>Also, it has a pleasant aroma, not too overbearing.</li>
            <li>incense matches have the added benefit of combining the pleasant aroma of incense with the odor consumption of a lit match.  </li>

            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>

            <li>But its awesome it really works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I continue to use this product at home because its so effective.</li>
            <li>A MUST have for this kind of set up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves a nice citrusy scent.  </li>
            <li>Keep in mind that I am one to courteous flush two, even three times.</li>
            <li>I make my own now for 1/6 the price.</li>
            <li>I plan on trying many more scents!</li>
            <li>Fun novelty and the scent is great.</li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t recommend just tossing it in with your clothes, it&#x27;s probably safe on its own in your toiletry bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li>found I liked this much better, and must say it is effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Very nice, since my powder room is right off my kitchen-breakfast nook.  </li>
            <li>Most times things are hyped up for selling purposes</li>
            <li>I have given these as gifts to my friends and they love it.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>Worked better as an air freshener than it did in the bowl pre-poop.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>But it really does a great job.and</li>
            <li>I love poo-pourri.</li>
            <li>so I love to joke with my co-workers about &amp;#34;going to drop some lemons&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Most of the odor that comes from poop is methane gas, which is flammable.  </li>
            <li>Smells much better than aerosol sprays too.  </li>
            <li>OK this stuff really works!!!!  </li>
            <li>I would even spritz as air freshener because it smells nice and clean.</li>
            <li>It works really brilliantly, by creating an essential oil film on the top of the water, so that &amp;#34;unfortunate&amp;#34; smells don&#x27;t sneak out.</li>
            <li>So in my quest to calm the smell, I researched and found this amazing product.</li>
            <li>So in my quest to calm the smell, I researched and found this amazing product.</li>
            <li>The result is a nice clean fresh scent!</li>
            <li>and I have to say, what a really cool product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Secondly, this stuff is really strong.  </li>
            <li>but it smells so strong that people will figure out what went on while you were in there.  </li>
            <li>I have to use the maximum sprays (I said my bowel odor is strong), but it works well.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product for anyone with the embarrassing problem of strong bathroom odors.</li>
            <li>Odors Away said to put a drop or two in a cup to make the room smell better, so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s fair to include that product in this review, however it still didn&#x27;t smell good at all.  </li>
            <li>Now you know why this is such a great product.  </li>
            <li>and you know precisely when you pass by road kill.</li>
            <li>:) I bought it for fun and out of curiosity</li>
            <li>I buy “scent free” deodorant, laundry detergent, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it will be no less amazing there.</li>
            <li>sent a bottle to me at no charge (though I still could not get a refund for the original three piece</li>
            <li>If he does his business right before bed, I don&#x27;t even want to sleep in there!</li>
            <li>The smell is so overwhelmingly flowery and perfumey that I almost think that the smell of poo might be better (okay, not really</li>
            <li>You loved the commercial on you tube.  </li>
            <li>I love all three methods; matches and poo-pourri, AND incense matches,  but my personal preference is for the incense matches for the most thorough job of all for the most reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Pretty next time I run out but either way, great product, worth every penny.</li>
            <li>be fair, I generally do not like scented products.</li>
            <li>One-drop Powerful Deodorizer reminded me of the medicinal smell in a porta-potty; not the scent I want in my clean, girlie bathroom.  </li>
            <li>So I looked the product up on Amazon, as I do most new products I encounter.</li>
            <li>It really works!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;We are big fans of Poo-Pourri, and it works like a charm - a magical charm against stink!  </li>
            <li>In fact, it actually works better than that!</li>
            <li>Worth the price</li>
            <li>It totally tames the foul odor and leaves a nice scent instead.</li>
            <li>the ginger, while powerful, is still pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>So I thought the set looked girlie and figured I would buy a set for myself as well as my mom for Christmas as a fun stocking stuffer.  </li>
            <li>This product performs well and leaves my bathroom smelling fresh, no matter what.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product with success in my home both before and after said poo.(sometimes I forget to spray beforehand)</li>
            <li>These are POWERFUL.  </li>
            <li>I couldn’t because it was classified as a Hazardous Material and couldn’t be shipped back via UPS (even though that is how it was shipped to me</li>
            <li>Of course “need” is a little bit strong for this kind of product, but trust me, when you use it, you will see why.</li>
            <li>my body is capable of releasing and this man has just met the true power.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find it really does work. :)</li>
            <li>Well in addition to ordering this set, I also ordered much cheaper versions (One-drop Powerful Deodorizer and Odors away) to compare because I wanted to know if I was paying more for a brand name or if the product actually worked and was worth the higher price.  </li>
            <li>My husband just says that it smells like you s()*)&amp;^*^ out a flower.  </li>
            <li>I am definitely buying more.</li>
            <li>It really does work like it says!</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>I saw the reviews and used my Prime membership to get it fast!</li>
            <li>My whole family loves it!</li>
            <li>addition to regular habits, sometimes vacation can bring on more activity.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny because I got to know about</li>
            <li>it was in YouTube from a Christmas funny ad.</li>
            <li>I saw the Poo-Pourri commercial on youtube and thought it was hilarious, however it said it also worked.</li>
            <li>First let me say that I did not get what I ordered.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion it is not any better than the cover-up sprays that we all currently use.  </li>
            <li>, product was exactly what I ordered and on-time delivery</li>
            <li>The product itself, however, works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not kidding it really works!  </li>
            <li>Really tames the loo!</li>
            <li>The man had been woken up by the wretched stench that only my bowels are able to produce.</li>
            <li>Well, at first I didn’t like it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually used this product for many years and it really works.</li>
            <li>It makes sharing a bathroom much less embarrassing as this product does a wonderful job of keeping the smell down.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more when we use up all of this, but hopefully that won&#x27;t be for a long time.</li>
            <li>and I will tell you Poo-Pourri was HANDS DOWN more effective than the other 2.  </li>
            <li>I really like this and thinks that it works.  </li>
            <li>used it, it really prevent the ordor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really thought it was a joke.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Maybe that person was using too much.  </li>
            <li>Poo-Pourri really works (for a man).</li>
            <li>VERY WELL.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to sound indelicate, but people who are looking at this product all have the same problem, so I&#x27;m going to be blunt.  </li>
            <li>It works but cost too much for what it contains to make it work.</li>
            <li>They offered me the option of receiving one of their many other scents.</li>
            <li>Probably just a matter of taste, but a good, old fashioned ordinary \\&quot;courtesy match\\&quot; will work wonders for a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li>One of the side effects of gastric bypass surgery is a loose stool that has a strong odor.</li>
            <li>Their claim that it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; odors is only half true; it&#x27;s as smelly as any room deodorizer in its own right, but it really does prevent the objectionable organic odors it&#x27;s designed to combat from emanating from the toilet bowl, and there&#x27;s no contest about which aroma is worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>WOW it really works!</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, as much as I like Poo-pourri, there is another product that IMHO is a little better.  </li>
            <li>It is especially useful in my main floor powder-room that is not as private as the other bathrooms in my house.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for all those stinky poos.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>the high cost</li>
            <li>We have it in several different scents - this one is nice, but definitely try some of the others!</li>
            <li>I am so self-conscious of this side effect, that I rarely allow myself to use a public restroom; but sometimes you just don&#x27;t have a choice.  </li>
            <li>They also have lots of other scents available which I found out as I was placing my order</li>
            <li>It seemed like those Saturday Night Live parody commercials.</li>
            <li>, new girlfriend/boyfriends place.</li>
            <li>stuff is amazing, and seriously, don&#x27;t leave home without it.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t laugh, but I actually looked forward to going in there, because this stuff smells so amazing, and honestly does replace any possible bad odors.</li>
            <li>And for people who want a more \\&quot;fragrant\\&quot; solution that plain old bathroom matches, these are great:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is the large bottle for main bathroom, the back up bottle and travel size.  </li>
            <li>I first saw this product on a YouTube 5 second ad which I ALWAYS skip…until this ad.</li>
            <li>The bottles didn&#x27;t come with the charm as they do if ordered directly from poopourri.com but works just as well!</li>
            <li>It is a double whammy that has never failed me.  </li>
            <li>Over the course of the first 2 years I had 8-10 different roommates.</li>
            <li>My only option was to find someone willing to room with me-</li>
            <li>but I carry one bottle around for the emergency stops outside of my house ;)</li>
            <li>Okay, just imagine a small rental house with one bathroom right in the center.  </li>
            <li>and I will certainly be buying something else next time.</li>
            <li>We love this product...but a little pricey which is why only the 4 star.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my friend who happens to be very embarrassed by public pooping.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>In addition, it didn&#x27;t mask the smell where Poo-Pourri completely covered any odor.</li>
            <li>My 17 year old loves her travel size and wished she had this before now.  </li>
            <li>So Poo-Pourri may be more expensive, but it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be glad when competition drives the price down, but meanwhile, I will pay the price, as it really does make having to use the potty at work much less embarrassing.</li>
            <li>This is actually the second fragrance that I have purchased, the first was</li>
            <li>It totally and completely works!!</li>
            <li>This stuff really works lasts a long time</li>
            <li>the Sh*ttin’ Pretty, but at the time, they only had single bottles and this time I needed a three set, 1 for each bathroom, and a portable one.</li>
            <li>So, the Government tried to use the room sharing my bathroom as a \\&quot;transient\\&quot; room for general officers</li>
            <li>poop smells like ginger, so far i have tried 2 different sense.</li>
            <li>But no more hours of leaving the fan on, this thing keeps to itself and dissipates rather quickly.</li>
            <li>My wife would like to try the other scents, so we may not get the exact same set, but something similar.</li>
            <li>I think next time I will try out some of the other scents because the lemon is a little strong but it does leave the bathroom smelling like lemon drops</li>
            <li>This is NOT an air spray but must be shaken and then sprayed directly onto the toilet water prior to using the toilet.</li>
            <li>All requested to live in tents due to the foul odor coming from the bathroom and lingering in their room for days.</li>

            <li> So in my quest to calm the smell, I researched and found this amazing product.</li>
            <li> So in my quest to calm the smell, I researched and found this amazing product.</li>
            <li> The result is a nice clean fresh scent!</li>
            <li> and I have to say, what a really cool product!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, this stuff is really strong.  </li>
            <li> but it smells so strong that people will figure out what went on while you were in there.  </li>
            <li> I have to use the maximum sprays (I said my bowel odor is strong), but it works well.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product for anyone with the embarrassing problem of strong bathroom odors.</li>
            <li> Odors Away said to put a drop or two in a cup to make the room smell better, so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s fair to include that product in this review, however it still didn&#x27;t smell good at all.  </li>
            <li> Now you know why this is such a great product.  </li>
            <li> and you know precisely when you pass by road kill.</li>
            <li> :) I bought it for fun and out of curiosity</li>
            <li> I buy “scent free” deodorant, laundry detergent, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure it will be no less amazing there.</li>
            <li> sent a bottle to me at no charge (though I still could not get a refund for the original three piece</li>
            <li> If he does his business right before bed, I don&#x27;t even want to sleep in there!</li>
            <li> The smell is so overwhelmingly flowery and perfumey that I almost think that the smell of poo might be better (okay, not really</li>
            <li> You loved the commercial on you tube.  </li>
            <li> I love all three methods; matches and poo-pourri, AND incense matches,  but my personal preference is for the incense matches for the most thorough job of all for the most reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Pretty next time I run out but either way, great product, worth every penny.</li>
            <li> be fair, I generally do not like scented products.</li>
            <li> One-drop Powerful Deodorizer reminded me of the medicinal smell in a porta-potty; not the scent I want in my clean, girlie bathroom.  </li>
            <li> So I looked the product up on Amazon, as I do most new products I encounter.</li>
            <li> It really works!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;We are big fans of Poo-Pourri, and it works like a charm - a magical charm against stink!  </li>
            <li> In fact, it actually works better than that!</li>
            <li> Worth the price</li>
            <li> It totally tames the foul odor and leaves a nice scent instead.</li>
            <li> the ginger, while powerful, is still pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> So I thought the set looked girlie and figured I would buy a set for myself as well as my mom for Christmas as a fun stocking stuffer.  </li>
            <li> This product performs well and leaves my bathroom smelling fresh, no matter what.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product with success in my home both before and after said poo.(sometimes I forget to spray beforehand)</li>
            <li> These are POWERFUL.  </li>
            <li> I couldn’t because it was classified as a Hazardous Material and couldn’t be shipped back via UPS (even though that is how it was shipped to me</li>
            <li> Of course “need” is a little bit strong for this kind of product, but trust me, when you use it, you will see why.</li>
            <li> my body is capable of releasing and this man has just met the true power.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find it really does work. :)</li>
            <li> Well in addition to ordering this set, I also ordered much cheaper versions (One-drop Powerful Deodorizer and Odors away) to compare because I wanted to know if I was paying more for a brand name or if the product actually worked and was worth the higher price.  </li>
            <li> My husband just says that it smells like you s()*)&amp;^*^ out a flower.  </li>
            <li> I am definitely buying more.</li>
            <li> It really does work like it says!</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> I saw the reviews and used my Prime membership to get it fast!</li>
            <li> My whole family loves it!</li>
            <li> addition to regular habits, sometimes vacation can bring on more activity.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny because I got to know about</li>
            <li> it was in YouTube from a Christmas funny ad.</li>
            <li> I saw the Poo-Pourri commercial on youtube and thought it was hilarious, however it said it also worked.</li>
            <li> First let me say that I did not get what I ordered.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion it is not any better than the cover-up sprays that we all currently use.  </li>
            <li> , product was exactly what I ordered and on-time delivery</li>
            <li> The product itself, however, works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not kidding it really works!  </li>
            <li> Really tames the loo!</li>
            <li> The man had been woken up by the wretched stench that only my bowels are able to produce.</li>
            <li> Well, at first I didn’t like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually used this product for many years and it really works.</li>
            <li> It makes sharing a bathroom much less embarrassing as this product does a wonderful job of keeping the smell down.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more when we use up all of this, but hopefully that won&#x27;t be for a long time.</li>
            <li> and I will tell you Poo-Pourri was HANDS DOWN more effective than the other 2.  </li>
            <li> I really like this and thinks that it works.  </li>
            <li> used it, it really prevent the ordor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really thought it was a joke.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Maybe that person was using too much.  </li>
            <li> Poo-Pourri really works (for a man).</li>
            <li> VERY WELL.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to sound indelicate, but people who are looking at this product all have the same problem, so I&#x27;m going to be blunt.  </li>
            <li> It works but cost too much for what it contains to make it work.</li>
            <li> They offered me the option of receiving one of their many other scents.</li>
            <li> Probably just a matter of taste, but a good, old fashioned ordinary \\&quot;courtesy match\\&quot; will work wonders for a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li> One of the side effects of gastric bypass surgery is a loose stool that has a strong odor.</li>
            <li> Their claim that it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; odors is only half true; it&#x27;s as smelly as any room deodorizer in its own right, but it really does prevent the objectionable organic odors it&#x27;s designed to combat from emanating from the toilet bowl, and there&#x27;s no contest about which aroma is worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> WOW it really works!</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, as much as I like Poo-pourri, there is another product that IMHO is a little better.  </li>
            <li> It is especially useful in my main floor powder-room that is not as private as the other bathrooms in my house.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for all those stinky poos.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> the high cost</li>
            <li> We have it in several different scents - this one is nice, but definitely try some of the others!</li>
            <li> I am so self-conscious of this side effect, that I rarely allow myself to use a public restroom; but sometimes you just don&#x27;t have a choice.  </li>
            <li> They also have lots of other scents available which I found out as I was placing my order</li>
            <li> It seemed like those Saturday Night Live parody commercials.</li>
            <li> , new girlfriend/boyfriends place.</li>
            <li> stuff is amazing, and seriously, don&#x27;t leave home without it.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t laugh, but I actually looked forward to going in there, because this stuff smells so amazing, and honestly does replace any possible bad odors.</li>
            <li> And for people who want a more \\&quot;fragrant\\&quot; solution that plain old bathroom matches, these are great:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is the large bottle for main bathroom, the back up bottle and travel size.  </li>
            <li> I first saw this product on a YouTube 5 second ad which I ALWAYS skip…until this ad.</li>
            <li> The bottles didn&#x27;t come with the charm as they do if ordered directly from poopourri.com but works just as well!</li>
            <li> It is a double whammy that has never failed me.  </li>
            <li> Over the course of the first 2 years I had 8-10 different roommates.</li>
            <li> My only option was to find someone willing to room with me-</li>
            <li> but I carry one bottle around for the emergency stops outside of my house ;)</li>
            <li> Okay, just imagine a small rental house with one bathroom right in the center.  </li>
            <li> and I will certainly be buying something else next time.</li>
            <li> We love this product...but a little pricey which is why only the 4 star.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my friend who happens to be very embarrassed by public pooping.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> In addition, it didn&#x27;t mask the smell where Poo-Pourri completely covered any odor.</li>
            <li> My 17 year old loves her travel size and wished she had this before now.  </li>
            <li> So Poo-Pourri may be more expensive, but it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be glad when competition drives the price down, but meanwhile, I will pay the price, as it really does make having to use the potty at work much less embarrassing.</li>
            <li> This is actually the second fragrance that I have purchased, the first was</li>
            <li> It totally and completely works!!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works lasts a long time</li>
            <li> the Sh*ttin’ Pretty, but at the time, they only had single bottles and this time I needed a three set, 1 for each bathroom, and a portable one.</li>
            <li> So, the Government tried to use the room sharing my bathroom as a \\&quot;transient\\&quot; room for general officers</li>
            <li> poop smells like ginger, so far i have tried 2 different sense.</li>
            <li> But no more hours of leaving the fan on, this thing keeps to itself and dissipates rather quickly.</li>
            <li> My wife would like to try the other scents, so we may not get the exact same set, but something similar.</li>
            <li> I think next time I will try out some of the other scents because the lemon is a little strong but it does leave the bathroom smelling like lemon drops</li>
            <li> This is NOT an air spray but must be shaken and then sprayed directly onto the toilet water prior to using the toilet.</li>
            <li> All requested to live in tents due to the foul odor coming from the bathroom and lingering in their room for days.</li>
            <li> This package even comes with a tiny little package for the purse, which is super helpful when you are out at a tiny little restaurant, there is only one bathroom, and you know there will be 3 or 4 people waiting in line after you.</li>
            <li> As a test I hesitantly went into the bathroom right after him to take a big whiff and seriously, nothing but ginger.</li>
            <li> I spray four to six  times into the toilet</li>
            <li> I run a delicatessen where Lutefisk is made, and to make it I have to eat it every day, I have seen dogs howl because the smell from my bathroom toilet made it up the hill to my Rhodesian Ridgeback (Lion hunting dog)</li>
            <li> Toilet paper seems to wick the Poo-Pourri off the surface of the water and let the noxious fumes escape.</li>
            <li> intend to order another bottle when this one is gone, which appears to be a long way off.</li>
            <li> A negative complaint was the fragrence is way too strong</li>
            <li> It only takes a few seconds to get rid of bathroom odor and there is nothing left of the smell when you come out.  </li>
            <li> I can now spray the toilet water with four squirts, release the madness, and not a soul knows other than when I make the walls rattle.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Poo-pourri for saving me.d in industrial filth fans in the bathrooms.</li>
            <li> I can now spray the toilet water with four squirts, release the madness, and not a soul knows other than when I make the walls rattle.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Poo-pourri for saving me.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no smell.</li>
            <li> the Hyena&#x27;s closed in but NEVER got closer than 10 feet from the calf.</li>
            <li> The baby Elephant finally jumped off of a cliff and killed itself because fo the smell.    </li>
            <li> , I carefully packed the bottle in case of leaking, but it never leaked inside the plastic bag</li>
            <li> Camp Anaconda as a military contractor.</li>
            <li> Other than that, would get these again.</li>
            <li> This General has seen war ranging from Vietnam to Afghanistan and yet he couldn&#x27;t endure a single \\&quot;number 2\\&quot; of mine behind a closed</li>
            <li> We were a little skeptical that Poo-Pourri could really eliminate stinky bathroom odors, but yes it does, so long as you use it correctly.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try other scents!</li>
            <li> There is no adequate description of the smells</li>
            <li> You spray a little and do your business and no stinky smell.</li>
            <li> that doesn&#x27;t mean I want to smell it or to have it fill my small hotel room when he leaves the bathroom door open after he&#x27;s done.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> I ordered the set with three pump bottles, not two pumps and a little aerosol spray bottle, which is what I received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will tell you a little story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Amazon to the rescue, though, and a delivery in under 24 hours to a sleepy little beach town of less than 200 people, and we were saved!  </li>
            <li> That stench you find while slowly driving down a country road with the windows down</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what else to say other than if you&#x27;re hesitant about purchasing this product then hesitate no more!</li>
            <li> Needless to say my digestive process is different and</li>
            <li> Not a sure thing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;10 days in sometimes small hotel rooms with this man and not once did I smell anything but ginger.  </li>
            <li> I got the 3-piece set (intending to use the small, travel atomizer for work).</li>
            <li> The small, travel atomizer I don&#x27;t like at all.  </li>
            <li> They promptly answered my email asking why I was not satisfied with their product.</li>
            <li> I know this may be hard to believe so</li>
            <li> It is hard to believe, but when used before you &amp;#34;go&amp;#34; there is basically no smell.</li>
            <li> When using this product, you&#x27;d hardly know I was there.</li>
            <li> I only gave three stars because of my disappointment with the travel atomizer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like being forced to inhale the remains of a rotting corpse...</li>
            <li> No more embarrassing bathroom trips to your soon to be in-laws or even worse</li>
            <li> This item was a little expensive for a bottle of spray.</li>
            <li> Sadly it didn&#x27;t come with the little charm.</li>
            <li> What I like is they have different smells and not in a bad way if you get my meaning.</li>
            <li> Everyone has always complained because the spray smells like whatever brand it is with the smell of crap mixed in.</li>
            <li> At first I thought STUPID!</li>
            <li> I have been told that the smell is worse than those who have not had this surgery.  </li>
            <li> It took approximately three months for my family of five to go through a 2 oz.</li>
            <li> If you still don&#x27;t beleive just try one of there small bottles for yourself you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I depended on this to save my marriage, sadly it did not.</li>
            <li> This stuff was useless.</li>
            <li> The purse version, though, is a bit difficult to spray.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Skeptical, but proven wrong.</li>
            <li> you hate ginger, you might want to try a different scent, but I like the smell because I hate overpowering flower smells, and</li>
            <li> My husband totally stinks up our master bath so bad that the stench usually overflows into our bedroom, sometimes even reaching the living room!</li>
            <li> while the other 2 smelled HORRIBLE.  </li>
            <li> and everybody&#x27;s stuff stinks, but</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t go crazy spraying,</li>
            <li> I could use the bathroom upstairs and hear my kids moaning and groaning downstairs about how bad the house stinks.</li>
            <li> I could use the bathroom upstairs and hear my kids moaning and groaning downstairs about how bad the house stinks.</li>
            <li> It also isn&#x27;t refillable, which I thought was stupid.  </li>
            <li> they both smell like ginger, and i hate ginger.</li>
            <li> Intrigued by hysterical adverts.</li>
            <li> And the commercials are hysterical.</li>
            <li> My wife doesn&#x27;t hate me now!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Intrigued by hysterical adverts. But this stuff WORKS. I&#x27;ve placed a subscription. I would even spritz as air freshener because it smells nice and clean.</li>
            <li> I really like this and thinks that it works.  My husband just says that it smells like you s()*)&amp;^*^ out a flower.  To each their own.</li>
            <li> I will be honest and say that this product is incredible.  I had a gastric bypass and for those of you who have had it you know that our number two is enough to kill sometimes.  Needless to say my digestive process is different and I have been told that the smell is worse than those who have not had this surgery.  This product is great.  I spray four to six  times into the toilet and then I go and there is no stink.  I am definitely buying more.</li>
            <li> Most times things are hyped up for selling purposes so I&#x27;m always in doubt. I had nothing to lose and it&#x27;s inexpensive so I said what the heck.  It really works!! What I like is they have different smells and not in a bad way if you get my meaning. If you still don&#x27;t beleive just try one of there small bottles for yourself you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great product once again.</li>
            <li> My daughter brought this on a cruise recently where we shared a very tiny bathroom.  Don&#x27;t laugh, but I actually looked forward to going in there, because this stuff smells so amazing, and honestly does replace any possible bad odors. It works really brilliantly, by creating an essential oil film on the top of the water, so that &amp;#34;unfortunate&amp;#34; smells don&#x27;t sneak out. You have to watch the YouTube ad for this.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t believe how well this stuff works until you use it. Worth the price and then some. Buy it</li>
            <li> It kinda works. Not a sure thing. So a courtesy flush is still required then reapply between legs without spraying genitals. Good luck.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t leave home without it. This stuff comes in handy for poomergencies. It definitely gets rid of yucky oders. I have given these as gifts to my friends and they love it. Keep one in your bathroom and one in your purse.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gag gift for my husband after we saw the video on youtube and I am so glad I did. It really does work like it says! You spray a little and do your business and no stinky smell. I will be buying more when we use up all of this, but hopefully that won&#x27;t be for a long time.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my friend who happens to be very embarrassed by public pooping. She absolutely loves it! Says it works great and loves the to-go sticks. Now she can poop with stinkless pride.</li>
            <li> Actually works! This is probably the best scent out there!</li>
            <li> Saved my marriage!  Every gym, restaurant, hotel, plane, etc... should have this. It really is an amazing product. And the commercials are hysterical.</li>
            <li> Fun novelty and the scent is great. It did not mask any odors. Worked better as an air freshener than it did in the bowl pre-poop.</li>
            <li> I bought it because of the commercial and didn&#x27;t believe it.&lt;br /&gt;I used it, it really prevent the ordor.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t need to be worried having time with my boyfriend anymore.</li>
            <li> I saw the commercial &amp;#34;Girls Don&#x27;t Poop,&amp;#34; by chance on a website. I really thought it was a joke. It seemed like those Saturday Night Live parody commercials. So I looked the product up on Amazon, as I do most new products I encounter. I saw the reviews and used my Prime membership to get it fast! It totally and completely works!! My husband totally stinks up our master bath so bad that the stench usually overflows into our bedroom, sometimes even reaching the living room! If he does his business right before bed, I don&#x27;t even want to sleep in there! Air fresheners can&#x27;t do anything for it. But this stuff works! It totally tames the foul odor and leaves a nice scent instead. My whole family loves it! I plan on trying many more scents! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love this set!  There is the large bottle for main bathroom, the back up bottle and travel size.  Only a couple pumps are needed to prevent orders.  A negative complaint was the fragrence is way too strong but that is not the case.  Maybe that person was using too much.  I love it and so does my husband who says over and over how well it works which I totally second!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely no smell. Don&#x27;t know what else to say other than if you&#x27;re hesitant about purchasing this product then hesitate no more! Love it</li>
            <li> I first saw this product on a YouTube 5 second ad which I ALWAYS skip…until this ad. Within the 5 seconds that it takes to skip the ad, I was hooked and had to not only watch the entire thing, but I purchased it immediately because I had to test it. This is actually the second fragrance that I have purchased, the first was the Sh*ttin’ Pretty, but at the time, they only had single bottles and this time I needed a three set, 1 for each bathroom, and a portable one. Of course “need” is a little bit strong for this kind of product, but trust me, when you use it, you will see why. No more embarrassing bathroom trips to your soon to be in-laws or even worse, new girlfriend/boyfriends place. No need to turn on the shower or sink while you go…you know who you are. Anyways, I will look for the Sh*ttin’ Pretty next time I run out but either way, great product, worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be glad when competition drives the price down, but meanwhile, I will pay the price, as it really does make having to use the potty at work much less embarrassing.</li>
            <li> I love poo-pourri! The bottles didn&#x27;t come with the charm as they do if ordered directly from poopourri.com but works just as well!</li>
            <li> This item was a little expensive for a bottle of spray. But it really does a great job.and it smells very good, This should be sold in a big bottle so that a person can refill the smaller bottles.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I highly recommend it for all those stinky poos.</li>
            <li> We needed this for our store because the bathroom opens to the retail area. Everyone has always complained because the spray smells like whatever brand it is with the smell of crap mixed in. Not anymore this product works great.</li>
            <li> I depended on this to save my marriage, sadly it did not. I run a delicatessen where Lutefisk is made, and to make it I have to eat it every day, I have seen dogs howl because the smell from my bathroom toilet made it up the hill to my Rhodesian Ridgeback (Lion hunting dog) dogs Kennel I literally have had them run away before.  One time on Safari in the African Bush I had a pride of Lions leave their hunting range because of my poop, even after I buried it. A mother Elephant left it&#x27;s baby to be eaten by Hyenas after her infant had stepped in my poo, the Hyena&#x27;s closed in but NEVER got closer than 10 feet from the calf. The baby Elephant finally jumped off of a cliff and killed itself because fo the smell.    My wife of 12 hours made it until I went to the bathroom and got an annulment.    This stuff was useless.</li>
            <li> Makes a great gag gift...!!!</li>
            <li> We were a little skeptical that Poo-Pourri could really eliminate stinky bathroom odors, but yes it does, so long as you use it correctly. This is NOT an air spray but must be shaken and then sprayed directly onto the toilet water prior to using the toilet. The result is a nice clean fresh scent!</li>
            <li> I love poo-pourri. It makes sharing a bathroom much less embarrassing as this product does a wonderful job of keeping the smell down. It took approximately three months for my family of five to go through a 2 oz. bottle.</li>
            <li> Great product,it&#x27;s everything it&#x27;s cracked up to be !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I recommend it to everyone .</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  I can&#x27;t wait to bring it with me on the plane.</li>
            <li> 2 bathrooms, 11 people and not an ounce of Poo-Pourri to be had!  Yikes!  Amazon to the rescue, though, and a delivery in under 24 hours to a sleepy little beach town of less than 200 people, and we were saved!  It felt like FEMA had come in after a disaster...one of the best packages I&#x27;ve ever received!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is amazing, and seriously, don&#x27;t leave home without it.  This package even comes with a tiny little package for the purse, which is super helpful when you are out at a tiny little restaurant, there is only one bathroom, and you know there will be 3 or 4 people waiting in line after you. The purse version, though, is a bit difficult to spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are big fans of Poo-Pourri, and it works like a charm - a magical charm against stink!  We have it in several different scents - this one is nice, but definitely try some of the others!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised. I think next time I will try out some of the other scents because the lemon is a little strong but it does leave the bathroom smelling like lemon drops so I love to joke with my co-workers about &amp;#34;going to drop some lemons&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This stuff really works lasts a long time</li>
            <li> AMAZING!  Especially if you have irritable bowel issues.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Okay, just imagine a small rental house with one bathroom right in the center.  There&#x27;s no vent and no way for the smells to escape.  Now you know why this is such a great product.  I love this product.  My husband loves it.  The dog loves it.  It works!  It smells great!  What can I say...BUY IT!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> At first I thought STUPID! But its awesome it really works. Sadly it didn&#x27;t come with the little charm. You need to try this.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff for a 10-day trip to Alaska with my husband.  We have been together for 18 years; I know the drill of the morning routine and I know that everybody does it and everybody&#x27;s stuff stinks, but that doesn&#x27;t mean I want to smell it or to have it fill my small hotel room when he leaves the bathroom door open after he&#x27;s done.&lt;br /&gt;In addition to regular habits, sometimes vacation can bring on more activity.&lt;br /&gt;10 days in sometimes small hotel rooms with this man and not once did I smell anything but ginger.  As a test I hesitantly went into the bathroom right after him to take a big whiff and seriously, nothing but ginger. (For the record, I was using it before I went too)&lt;br /&gt;If you hate ginger, you might want to try a different scent, but I like the smell because I hate overpowering flower smells, and the ginger, while powerful, is still pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;On an additional note, I carefully packed the bottle in case of leaking, but it never leaked inside the plastic bag I kept it in.  While I don&#x27;t recommend just tossing it in with your clothes, it&#x27;s probably safe on its own in your toiletry bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I continue to use this product at home because its so effective.</li>
            <li> It works, quite amazing!</li>
            <li> poop smells like ginger, so far i have tried 2 different sense. they both smell like ginger, and i hate ginger.</li>
            <li> My wife doesn&#x27;t hate me now! My wife was getting on to me until now. Poo-Pourri really works (for a man).</li>
            <li> Every bathroom needs this!</li>
            <li> WOW it really works! Skeptical, but proven wrong. The only reason I give 4 instead of 5 stars is b/c after my husbands morning business, the lingering smell can only be described as the same as when you spray something over the poo smell. But no more hours of leaving the fan on, this thing keeps to itself and dissipates rather quickly. Also, it has a pleasant aroma, not too overbearing. Will def buy this again!</li>
            <li> This product does works. It&#x27;s funny because I got to know about it was in YouTube from a Christmas funny ad. I put it to the test and IT DOES WORKS VERY WELL. Nothing but flowers smell.</li>
            <li> I saw the Poo-Pourri commercial on youtube and thought it was hilarious, however it said it also worked. So I thought the set looked girlie and figured I would buy a set for myself as well as my mom for Christmas as a fun stocking stuffer.  Well in addition to ordering this set, I also ordered much cheaper versions (One-drop Powerful Deodorizer and Odors away) to compare because I wanted to know if I was paying more for a brand name or if the product actually worked and was worth the higher price.  I tried out all 3 and I will tell you Poo-Pourri was HANDS DOWN more effective than the other 2.  It smelled great (like a light lemon custard) while the other 2 smelled HORRIBLE.  One-drop Powerful Deodorizer reminded me of the medicinal smell in a porta-potty; not the scent I want in my clean, girlie bathroom.  In addition, it didn&#x27;t mask the smell where Poo-Pourri completely covered any odor. Odors Away said to put a drop or two in a cup to make the room smell better, so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s fair to include that product in this review, however it still didn&#x27;t smell good at all.  So Poo-Pourri may be more expensive, but it is worth it.  They also have lots of other scents available which I found out as I was placing my order and I have to say, what a really cool product!</li>
            <li> First let me say that I did not get what I ordered.  I ordered the set with three pump bottles, not two pumps and a little aerosol spray bottle, which is what I received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, this stuff is really strong.  The smell is so overwhelmingly flowery and perfumey that I almost think that the smell of poo might be better (okay, not really but you get my point).  I hoped that I could use it when I was at work but it smells so strong that people will figure out what went on while you were in there.  In my opinion it is not any better than the cover-up sprays that we all currently use.  Add to that the high cost and I will certainly be buying something else next time.</li>
            <li> I was inclined to pooh-pooh this product, but it actually works.  Their claim that it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; odors is only half true; it&#x27;s as smelly as any room deodorizer in its own right, but it really does prevent the objectionable organic odors it&#x27;s designed to combat from emanating from the toilet bowl, and there&#x27;s no contest about which aroma is worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: when you&#x27;re done, flush before you start dropping TP in the bowl, or the use of this stuff will be all for nought.  Toilet paper seems to wick the Poo-Pourri off the surface of the water and let the noxious fumes escape.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually used this product for many years and it really works. I bought it this time for our summer camp where there is no bathroom exhaust fan and I&#x27;m sure it will be no less amazing there. Just follow the directions.</li>
            <li> This product performs well and leaves my bathroom smelling fresh, no matter what.  It is especially useful in my main floor powder-room that is not as private as the other bathrooms in my house.  Very nice, since my powder room is right off my kitchen-breakfast nook.  A MUST have for this kind of set up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as much as I like Poo-pourri, there is another product that IMHO is a little better.  Probably just a matter of taste, but a good, old fashioned ordinary \\&quot;courtesy match\\&quot; will work wonders for a fraction of the price.  Most of the odor that comes from poop is methane gas, which is flammable.  A match doesn&#x27;t just trap the odor, but actually consumes it, using the gas for fuel.  It only takes a few seconds to get rid of bathroom odor and there is nothing left of the smell when you come out.  I also keep a box of matches in each bathroom.  And for people who want a more \\&quot;fragrant\\&quot; solution that plain old bathroom matches, these are great:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://amazon.com/The-Incense-Match-Assorted-Pack/dp/B00AN2EN6M/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_pb_t&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://amazon.com/Set-Books-Incense-Matches-Fragrances/dp/B00C5UIPT6/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_hg_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;refRID&#x3D;1Z6WCQTTDGACN8TZPD57&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://amazon.com/Box-Books-Incense-Matches-Fragrances/dp/B00CP9Z4UA/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_hg_3?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;refRID&#x3D;0KJFP21GCBANXDA7XWS0&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The incense matches have the added benefit of combining the pleasant aroma of incense with the odor consumption of a lit match.  It is a double whammy that has never failed me.  I love all three methods; matches and poo-pourri, AND incense matches,  but my personal preference is for the incense matches for the most thorough job of all for the most reasonable price.</li>
            <li> , product was exactly what I ordered and on-time delivery</li>
            <li> I read a review when looking at this product from a woman who had the gastric bypass surgery (as did I). I don&#x27;t want to sound indelicate, but people who are looking at this product all have the same problem, so I&#x27;m going to be blunt.  One of the side effects of gastric bypass surgery is a loose stool that has a strong odor. I am so self-conscious of this side effect, that I rarely allow myself to use a public restroom; but sometimes you just don&#x27;t have a choice.  After seeing someone I know walk into the stall I had just vacated, and walk back out and enter another stall, I was so embarrassed that I was determined to find something to counteract the problem.  I found this product and decided to give it a try.  I got the 3-piece set (intending to use the small, travel atomizer for work). The small, travel atomizer I don&#x27;t like at all.  It didn&#x27;t spray properly and I ended up with the liquid all over my hand.  Also I had to use my thumb to make it spray at all.  It also isn&#x27;t refillable, which I thought was stupid.  The product itself, however, works pretty well.  I have to use the maximum sprays (I said my bowel odor is strong), but it works well.  It leaves a nice citrusy scent.  I recommend this product for anyone with the embarrassing problem of strong bathroom odors. I only gave three stars because of my disappointment with the travel atomizer.  Otherwise, I&#x27;d give it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! Goodbye air freshner! This is so much better!</li>
            <li> You loved the commercial on you tube.  Go ahead and try it.  I&#x27;m not kidding it really works!  Smells much better than aerosol sprays too.  Really tames the loo!</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that this product has literally saved my relationship with my family and friends. I know this may be hard to believe so I will tell you a little story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From 2006 - 2009 I lived in Balad, Iraq @ Camp Anaconda as a military contractor. In that timeframe, I managed to go from living in a tent, to being put in a Containerized Housing Unit (CHU) (basically a 10x12 metal room with a bathroom between my room and another room like mine). Over the course of the first 2 years I had 8-10 different roommates. All requested to live in tents due to the foul odor coming from the bathroom and lingering in their room for days. Keep in mind that I am one to courteous flush two, even three times. I used spray as well. So, the Government tried to use the room sharing my bathroom as a \\&quot;transient\\&quot; room for general officers/VIP&#x27;s because they only come in for a night or two. Well... That worked for about a day. An AMC commander came in (4-Star) and was placed in my adjoining room... I waited until he was sleeping before I utilized my latrine. About 30 minutes later, I hear cussing, gagging, and a command to don gas masks. The man had been woken up by the wretched stench that only my bowels are able to produce. It&#x27;s like being forced to inhale the remains of a rotting corpse... That stench you find while slowly driving down a country road with the windows down and you know precisely when you pass by road kill. There is no adequate description of the smells my body is capable of releasing and this man has just met the true power. This General has seen war ranging from Vietnam to Afghanistan and yet he couldn&#x27;t endure a single \\&quot;number 2\\&quot; of mine behind a closed door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day I was told that I was going to be put back into a tent where I could use a portapotty- obviously, I was devastated! My only option was to find someone willing to room with me- so I did, and he regretted it every day thereafter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I moved back home, I invested in industrial filth fans in the bathrooms. I could use the bathroom upstairs and hear my kids moaning and groaning downstairs about how bad the house stinks. So in my quest to calm the smell, I researched and found this amazing product. I can now spray the toilet water with four squirts, release the madness, and not a soul knows other than when I make the walls rattle.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Poo-pourri for saving me.d in industrial filth fans in the bathrooms.

            <li> I just say that when I go to the bathroom is all flowers now :) I bought it for fun and out of curiosity but I carry one bottle around for the emergency stops outside of my house ;)</li>
            <li> It is hard to believe, but when used before you &amp;#34;go&amp;#34; there is basically no smell. No need for a courtesy flush anymore. In fact, it actually works better than that!</li>
            <li> Works as advertised!  Give it the #2 test!  Your spouse or roomie will be happy with your decision to de-stink.</li>
            <li> Recently had a group of ladies at the house. They loved the product, and are all planning on buying.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love about this product?! It has an awesome lemongrass smell which does the trick for covering those unwanted odors. I&#x27;ve used this product with success in my home both before and after said poo.(sometimes I forget to spray beforehand) If you do, don&#x27;t fear you can just spritz the air and all is forgiven. My 17 year old loves her travel size and wished she had this before now.  They have some cleaver gift packs on their website which I plan on getting for gifts. Great conversational piece and allows reluctant guests the ease of relief when nature calls. Can&#x27;t wait to try other scents!</li>
            <li> This product cracks me up, but the simple truth is, it works.  These are POWERFUL.  Don&#x27;t go crazy spraying, just 1 or 2 squirts will get it. I bought this set because we could put one in each bathroom and I could have one to take on business trips.  The only reason for four stars instead of five is that the tiny aerator nozzle in the travel size broke after the second use, so it didn&#x27;t spray properly.  Other than that, would get these again. My wife would like to try the other scents, so we may not get the exact same set, but something similar.</li>
            <li> Well, at first I didn’t like it. I found the fragrance cloying and lingering.&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, I generally do not like scented products. I buy “scent free” deodorant, laundry detergent, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to return it but got a response from Amazon I couldn’t because it was classified as a Hazardous Material and couldn’t be shipped back via UPS (even though that is how it was shipped to me…)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frustrated, I contacted the manufacturer. They promptly answered my email asking why I was not satisfied with their product. They offered me the option of receiving one of their many other scents. I chose Citrus Mint.&lt;br /&gt;They sent a bottle to me at no charge (though I still could not get a refund for the original three piece assortment).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found I liked this much better, and must say it is effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I intend to order another bottle when this one is gone, which appears to be a long way off.</li>
            <li> I bought this out of curiosity.  I was surprised to find it really does work. :)</li>
            <li> This stuff works .....</li>
            <li> I can devistate a bathroom. When using this product, you&#x27;d hardly know I was there. Best bathroom deodorizer on the market!</li>
            <li> It works but cost too much for what it contains to make it work. I make my own now for 1/6 the price. But it makes a great gift for name brand sake</li>
            <li> OK this stuff really works!!!!  And it is great to use as air freshener also.  We love this product...but a little pricey which is why only the 4 star.</li>
