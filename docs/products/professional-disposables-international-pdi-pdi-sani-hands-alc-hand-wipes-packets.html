            <li>love these....</li>
            <li>Main use is for cleaning my cpac mask does a great job</li>
            <li>Like the fact they do not have a strong odor.</li>
            <li>These work fine</li>
            <li>Work fine.  </li>
            <li>great to have when out in public or in the car</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>Clean all sorts of things with them and they work every time.</li>
            <li>Moist, strong, and just the right size.</li>
            <li>They leave your hands feeling clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>THEY ARE VERY VERY  MOIST.</li>
            <li>My wife absolutely loves them.</li>
            <li>Item is over priced, costing twice as much.  </li>
            <li>Over the years, many of the different product lines have disappeared off the store shelves, so hopefully these will survive and not dry out on us.  </li>
            <li>I have had one or two dry out after being in my pocket for days and experiencing a lot of wear, but these are a huge improvement over the purell wipes.</li>
            <li>, clean well and hands dry fast.</li>
            <li>I say that because many of individual hand wipe products frequently dry out before I get around to using them, and thus far, these have not.</li>
            <li>Although after a year some have dried out in my hot car, I can&#x27;t blame the company because the inside of the car in the summer gets really, really hot.</li>
            <li>I buy individual handwipes by the hundreds and keep them in all of my vehicles and take them whenever I travel to clean my hands and when other options may not be acceptable.</li>
            <li>The wipes are wet enough to handle a quick clean up for a few people, or for hands</li>
            <li>Small enough to carry around and easy to use.</li>
            <li>100 individual sanitary wipes, well packed, and delivered early.</li>
            <li>These wipes are thicker and softer than the Purel wipes I&#x27;d used in the past (which felt more like wet copy paper than a towelette).  </li>
            <li>Hard to get too excited about sanitizing hand wipes.  </li>

            <li> Love these wipes.  I carry them in the car and in my purse and occasionally use them around the house.  Every time I leave a store I wipe my hands with them.  I feel it keeps me from getting sick, especially during flu season.  They leave your hands feeling clean and fresh.  They do not leave lotion on your hands.</li>
            <li> Great coverage of germs in the environment and so handy for travel.</li>
            <li> great to have when out in public or in the car</li>
            <li> These work fine, clean well and hands dry fast. Clean all sorts of things with them and they work every time.</li>
            <li> Work fine.  Local wipes (CVS, Target) are more expensive.  So this is about the best you can do.  I recommend.</li>
            <li> Small enough to carry around and easy to use. I even used them at a bday party after the kids played on playground before eating.</li>
            <li> These now contain 70% alc. Great to clean up the kiddos! Better than sanitizer when you have dirt and grime on your hands. I will continue to purchase these in bulk.</li>
            <li> The wipes are great and will come in handy when traveling on airplanes.</li>
            <li> Hard to get too excited about sanitizing hand wipes.  However, these go above and beyond the Purel wipes you may be used to (which have fallen in quality).  These wipes are thicker and softer than the Purel wipes I&#x27;d used in the past (which felt more like wet copy paper than a towelette).  The wipes are wet enough to handle a quick clean up for a few people, or for hands and then the picnic table.</li>
            <li> Moist, strong, and just the right size. Although it&#x27;s not stated on the box, I believe it&#x27;s also fragrance-free because there is no flowery or lemony scent to these wipes which is an added plus for us. My wife absolutely loves them. 100 individual sanitary wipes, well packed, and delivered early. Will purchase again for sure.</li>
            <li> They come in handy - my wife loves them in the car after refueling.</li>
            <li> LOVE,LOVE THESE WIPES, I AWAYS HAVE THESE IN MY PURSE AND CAR.  AND I ALWAYS MAKE SURE I HAVE THEM WHEN I AM WITH MY GRANDCHILDREN. THEY ARE VERY VERY  MOIST. THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> These are great and ready for overseas trip.</li>
            <li> Item is over priced, costing twice as much.  Shop elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Resists drying out much better than purell wipes. I have had one or two dry out after being in my pocket for days and experiencing a lot of wear, but these are a huge improvement over the purell wipes.</li>
            <li> Main use is for cleaning my cpac mask does a great job</li>
            <li> So far, so good. I say that because many of individual hand wipe products frequently dry out before I get around to using them, and thus far, these have not. As advertised, they are individually wrapped in a plastic/foil product that looks like it will retain the moisture (diluted alcohol). I&#x27;ll update this review as time passes. I buy individual handwipes by the hundreds and keep them in all of my vehicles and take them whenever I travel to clean my hands and when other options may not be acceptable. Over the years, many of the different product lines have disappeared off the store shelves, so hopefully these will survive and not dry out on us.  Update: 2/9/17 Just bought more. Although after a year some have dried out in my hot car, I can&#x27;t blame the company because the inside of the car in the summer gets really, really hot.</li>
            <li> Ever have a bottle of gel come open in your pocket or purse?  These wipes are the only way to go.  So handy, just throw a couple of packets in your pocket or purse.</li>
            <li> love these....so handy</li>
            <li> Nice. Like the fact they do not have a strong odor. Convenient to carry.</li>
            <li> great for carrying my husband is sugar detibities needs alcohol base cleaners carry them in his pockets</li>
