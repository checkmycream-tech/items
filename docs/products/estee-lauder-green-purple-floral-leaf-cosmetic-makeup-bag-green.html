            <li>It&#x27;s very pretty and spacious for toiletries when I travel.</li>
            <li>They all loved them, the print is beautiful and it&#x27;s not too big or too small.</li>
            <li>I now use it as a bag to hold all my tampons and pads in the bathroom (better than the mishmash of boxes and soft bags that all that comes in).</li>
            <li>Great little bag!</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of make up, but I only carry the necessary with me and this bag fit everything perfectly.</li>
            <li>bag is still cute, but had I realized it was purple and not pink, I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it.</li>
            <li>Very pretty, picture doesn&#x27;t do any justice, also very roomy, holds a lot of my stuff.</li>
            <li>, it is a good little makeup bag.</li>

            <li>I actually repurposed this because despite paying attention to its measurements it is larger than I expected (and I loved that).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK otherwise - just hard to see everything inside at once.</li>
            <li>It has soft sides there is no structure to it.</li>
            <li>It is more blue than green.</li>
            <li>The fabric is a little thin, but the pattern is super cute!</li>
            <li>the picture shows the zipper part as pink, which is the main reason I bought it, I love pink and green...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not pink..</li>

            <li> Quick shipping. Great colors &amp; size</li>
            <li> roomier than expected but not bigger-looking (does that make sense?). Ordered two for myself, then my sister wanted them so I ordered two more. One holds all my hair stuff (brush, bobby pins, travek sized tubes of product) and the other holds my makeup (i travel with at least 3 MAC-sized round blush compacts, 2 foundation compacts, concealer pots, BB cream tube, etc). Long enough for most makeup brushes though I don&#x27;t store mine in it. Very cute design that masks the smudges from my makeup pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the zipper and ribbon are purple. Don&#x27;t know why they look pink in the photo.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for enough makeup to get you through a weekend.  It holds all of my essentials, including everything except my larger powder brushes.  Zips nicely. Super cute design.</li>
            <li> Great little bag! It is a lot more spacious than expected.  Perfect for my purse to put my lipsticks and other items!</li>
            <li> the picture shows the zipper part as pink, which is the main reason I bought it, I love pink and green...It&#x27;s not pink..it&#x27;s purple. bag is still cute, but had I realized it was purple and not pink, I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it.</li>
            <li> So, nice and was able to put all my important cosmetics into it. The color looks better than shown, absolutely love it. Also, an great price.</li>
            <li> the bag was smaller than expected. Quite tiny actually. It has soft sides there is no structure to it. It is more blue than green. I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> Nice for using as a clutch for going down to dinner at my retirement community.</li>
            <li> The bag is nice and light but the zipper is just a slit on the top - not for me b/c I personally like bags that have wider mouths for easier access. It&#x27;s OK otherwise - just hard to see everything inside at once.</li>
            <li> Fits a lot of stuff, looks pretty and great price!</li>
            <li> I loved this pouch bag, it seem so small but it is very roomy! It fits my 20 regular size nail polish and 20 lipsticks! fast shipping and delivery! it was worth every penny!</li>
            <li> this was my pencil and pen bag for my senior year! It worked well! Was able to fit a lot of stationery! I will be taking it to med school, if not as a pencil bag, most definitely for lady essentials or makeup :)</li>
            <li> I actually repurposed this because despite paying attention to its measurements it is larger than I expected (and I loved that).  I now use it as a bag to hold all my tampons and pads in the bathroom (better than the mishmash of boxes and soft bags that all that comes in).</li>
            <li> Just like in the picture! No scam.</li>
            <li> Adorable bag! Perfect for my mom who doesn&#x27;t have a ton of makeup, but still has some wiggle room with this bag. Honestly I expected it to be a lot smaller. Hopefully she likes it for mother&#x27;s day :)</li>
            <li> I ordered these to put trinkets in for my bridesmaids.  They all loved them, the print is beautiful and it&#x27;s not too big or too small.</li>
            <li> Happy with purchase and received the item really fast, great!</li>
