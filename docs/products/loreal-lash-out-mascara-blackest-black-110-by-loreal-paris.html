            <li>It&#x27;s the best Mascara I&#x27;ve ever used, and wish L&#x27;Oreal hadn&#x27;t discontinued it.  </li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>Package in great condition.  </li>
            <li>Great packaging and great price.</li>

            <li>Fast delivery, great service.</li>
            <li>I am basically satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I believe #145 is more available, but I don&#x27;t like the curved brush.  </li>
            <li>Every since Loreal pulled it from retail shelves, I&#x27;ve gone back and forth through so many mascara&#x27;s but could never find one that came close to making my eyelashes look so great.  </li>
            <li>It was shipped very quickly and worked just like I remember.</li>
            <li>My item came quickly and I am so pleased.</li>
            <li>I am so excited I found LASH OUT mascara again.  </li>
            <li>It came in good condition, and I wish I could get more, as it is the only one that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, and really does separate and lengthen my lashes.  </li>
            <li>I have more time to look for a new brand now.</li>
            <li>Now I have to find a new favorite.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite mascara of all time.</li>
            <li>THANKS!</li>
            <li>Funny how every product I really like seems to be discontinued...if it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This came in new packaging and works just like I am used to.</li>
            <li>I have used it since I was 14 years old.  </li>
            <li>I was concerned the product would be old and sticky, but it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find this exact product at Walmart or any other retailer.</li>

            <li> and hopefully it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> However, I bought a few of them a few years or so ago, after #110 was discontinued, and just saved the straight brush of used up #110 after cleaning it well as it fits the same in the #145, and it&#x27;s the same formula.</li>
            <li> , these were not fresh ...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sham</li>
            <li> mascara was dried out even though the package was sealed.</li>
            <li> I think it seems a little drier than others I have purchased in the past</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sad to see that the stores are no longer carrying it and that it might not be made anymore :(  </li>

            <li> Fast delivery, great service. Works great. Highly recommend. THANKS!</li>
            <li> I am so excited I found LASH OUT mascara again.  Every since Loreal pulled it from retail shelves, I&#x27;ve gone back and forth through so many mascara&#x27;s but could never find one that came close to making my eyelashes look so great.  I&#x27;m thankful I found a retailer that sells it again.  My item came quickly and I am so pleased.</li>
            <li> I am basically satisfied with this product. I think it seems a little drier than others I have purchased in the past but it does the job and hopefully it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have used Lash Out mascara for years and couldn&#x27;t believe it was discontinued.  I have more time to look for a new brand now.</li>
            <li> I would give this product 5 stars and use it forever except that it contains parabens. Bummer!!!</li>
            <li> Just the mascara I was hoping it would be.  Package in great condition.  Thank you so much.  Kelly Wiggins. Perfect</li>
            <li> I used this forever and can&#x27;t believe they dont make this anymore.  This came in new packaging and works just like I am used to.</li>
            <li> I love this mascarra!  I have used it since I was 14 years old.  I&#x27;m so sad to see that the stores are no longer carrying it and that it might not be made anymore :(  Now I have to find a new favorite.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite mascara of all time. It&#x27;s a sham they stopped making it years ago. It was shipped very quickly and worked just like I remember. Will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> Price was good ... I understand the product is discontinued however, these were not fresh ... mascara was dried out even though the package was sealed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best Mascara I&#x27;ve ever used, and wish L&#x27;Oreal hadn&#x27;t discontinued it.  It came in good condition, and I wish I could get more, as it is the only one that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, and really does separate and lengthen my lashes.  I&#x27;ve tried others and they don&#x27;t deliver like this does.  I believe #145 is more available, but I don&#x27;t like the curved brush.  However, I bought a few of them a few years or so ago, after #110 was discontinued, and just saved the straight brush of used up #110 after cleaning it well as it fits the same in the #145, and it&#x27;s the same formula.</li>
            <li> This is the only mascara that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. I believe it is discontinued-so I hope I continue to buy here.</li>
            <li> It does no smear and washes off with ease.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this mascara and I was upset when they discontinued it. I am very pleased to have found it on Amazon. Great packaging and great price. I was concerned the product would be old and sticky, but it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this exact product at Walmart or any other retailer. I&#x27;ve used this for years and was so happy to find it online. Funny how every product I really like seems to be discontinued...if it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it.</li>
            <li> Ordered for a friend she loves it thank you!!!!</li>
