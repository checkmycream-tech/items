            <li>This is great stuff</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>works great</li>
            <li>The home treatment doesn&#x27;t work that well, but it works great when used with a tanning bed.</li>
            <li>after two weeks of use (once a week) i noticed great results.</li>
            <li>Great results within 20 mins.</li>
            <li>For the price it is a great product, at the tanning salon I go to</li>
            <li>The teeth whitening system (actaul whitening stuff and mouthpiece) is great</li>
            <li>so i checked amazon and found this great deal.</li>
            <li>is great too.</li>
            <li>I love it!!</li>
            <li>Also, it is very handy that  it can be used at home OR in the tanning bed.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great :P</li>
            <li>And the price was amazing!</li>
            <li>Better than whiting strips but def not the best.</li>
            <li>Bright side</li>
            <li>If you tan in a bed this is a good product...if you dont tan in a bed I wouldn&#x27;t bother wasteing your money.</li>
            <li>Amazon has it at a good price, in a salon it was like $40, pfft.</li>
            <li>The LED light didn&#x27;t do anything for me, so if you want results, tanning bed is your best choice.</li>
            <li>told me how good it worked when i asked.</li>
            <li>and i was very pleased.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>I have used this product four times now and i am in love!</li>
            <li>:) No sensitivity or pain after use!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>It worked amazingly.</li>
            <li>this is amazing</li>
            <li>this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>and it is amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing results</li>
            <li>AMAZING WORKS</li>
            <li>Not like getting a pro whitening treatment, but a great, cheap alternative to that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy they came out with a system to use at home with an LED light.</li>
            <li>I ended up just getting the Imako teeth which are amazing.</li>
            <li>and maybe it&#x27;s because you get the best results in a tanning bed since the uv is much stronger.</li>
            <li>Works nicely.</li>
            <li>I own a tanning salon and this is one of the number one products that sells out.</li>
            <li>so I thought I would try it out to give people an honest opinion.</li>
            <li>So easy and effective!</li>
            <li>i love using it when i go to the tanning bed or even just laying in my own bed.</li>
            <li>The amount of drool that this produces as well is kind of hilarious.  </li>
            <li>Rest of the products are good, except I don&#x60;t think that whitening solution is all that fantastic that they make it out to be.</li>
            <li>nice i used it and start to love</li>
            <li>This store also shipped my order very quickly!</li>
            <li>Pretty whitening, great product.</li>
            <li>the description was exactly what I ordered and the quality of the item was great</li>
            <li>you are supposed to be able to push the button and it stay on so that you can go about your day to day life....</li>
            <li>Turns out the kit from the tanning salon worked wayyy better.</li>
            <li>Looove this product I love how I could whiting my teeth from the comfort of my home.</li>
            <li>Just wish there was more whitener.</li>
            <li>I just wish it came with more of the gel stuff.</li>
            <li>and i love it</li>
            <li>I use a at home whitening gel kit from smile bright and</li>
            <li>i can see a difference in my teeth for sure</li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>, it shipped fast, lol.</li>
            <li>Love it..</li>
            <li>SO WELL, PLEASED...</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve probably list More than I&#x27;ve used .</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>But was more pricey.</li>
            <li>better than my tanning salon</li>
            <li>later it was beautiful!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>OKAY</li>
            <li>I liked it better in the tanning bed rather than the light that comes with it</li>
            <li>Cheaply made!</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>Love the teeth whitening system, my husband and I saw results after 1 whitening session</li>
            <li>Meh.. Works about as well as the crest whitening strips (the $60 dollar ones) but more hassle.</li>
            <li>absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s agreat product and it&#x27;s cheap too!</li>
            <li>Significant whitening after just one use!</li>
            <li>It gave me a beautiful bright white smile within one use</li>
            <li>Fast, easy, cheap, effective, couldn&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
            <li>Works better in a bed than with the portable light.</li>
            <li>many people said their light didnt work, there is a piece of plastic between the batteries</li>
            <li>I love that I Can use this in the tanning bed or at home with the UV light.</li>
            <li>I like having the LED light at home but being able to use the mouth piece in the tanning bed</li>
            <li>I loved it so much I bought one for my boyfriend.</li>
            <li>Also way cool that I can use it at home!</li>
            <li>but it went away very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Works great so far I am using the at home light until tanning season.</li>
            <li>It is an easy to use product</li>
            <li>When I opened my package I got a strong scent come to find the gel had leaked.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy and quick to do!</li>
            <li>It made me slobber when I was standing up, but I lied down and it worked perfectly!</li>
            <li>Will keep using this product as it is much more pleasant for me than the Crest white strips.</li>
            <li>I used this same whitening gel on my teeth when I use to lay in the tanning bed, however I quit tanning now and was happy to see they made a light to use at home.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a coffee drinker or you smoke, you will see a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>This is a great idea especially since it kills two birds with one stone.</li>
            <li>The light did not turn on or work</li>
            <li>Works well when used in tanning bed, didn&#x27;t see results when paired with the handheld light.</li>
            <li>u can use the LED light that comes with the kit.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t yet tried the gel, but the light will not turn on.</li>
            <li>and now my LED light won&#x27;t work...</li>
            <li>I would like to say I&#x27;ve noticed people complaining about the light not working.</li>
            <li>the light turns on.</li>
            <li>i use a dentist curing light that i got off amazon for 20 bucks and results</li>
            <li>At home with light...</li>
            <li>The light does not work.</li>
            <li>because when I received this product the light didn&#x27;t even work and</li>
            <li>I could see that the light and gel were both used.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for anyone with enough time to use it often!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and works as it says.</li>
            <li>Cheap to replace whitening paste.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The light and everything works</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen people complain that the light didn&#x27;t turn on on the home led light.</li>
            <li>Used this product one time &amp; the UV light already quit working.</li>
            <li>As there is risk for burning to tan in a bed every day for my light skin, today I used the Twi-Light that came with it.</li>
            <li>Supper fast shipping saw a difference after just once use so excited!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited that it is cheaper here.  </li>
            <li>I bought this from a tanning salon originally, worked great and lasted a long time..</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this product after reading some reviews.</li>
            <li>I was very excited for this purchase and then very letdown when I discovered that the light didn&#x27;t work at all.  </li>
            <li>I was super excited about finding it here.</li>
            <li>Item as describes, these really do whiten my teeth drastically and the price is way better than the ones I used to buy at my tanning salon.</li>
            <li>This was a very suggested purchase from many people, so I decided to buy it (forgetting to read reviews)</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s true that you get what you pay for</li>
            <li>and i also like my sweet tea.</li>
            <li>The mouthpiece is my favorite part because you can attach the UV light into the mouthpiece and be completely hands-free while your teeth whiten!</li>
            <li>like other people have said and this was great buy.</li>
            <li>Ok let me first say that the first time Ive used this kit was purchased from a tanning salon.</li>
            <li>As described and quick delivery</li>
            <li>The gel was resealed which is super sketchy...</li>
            <li>but first time use is a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once, but so far so good!  </li>
            <li>lol this kit takes half the time</li>
            <li>This product you paint on with a brush exactly where you want it and it absorbs in so you don&#x27;t need to rinse when you&#x27;re done!</li>
            <li>Works great if you are tanning but only last a day and the light that comes with never works dont buy</li>
            <li>This really worked for me in the tanning bed and with the light.</li>
            <li>Make sure you take the safety seal below the batteries out prior to use or the UV light won&#x27;t turn on.</li>
            <li>I thought it was definitely worth the $60 when I bought it there.</li>
            <li>I love this product but the only thing is that the home light did not work.</li>
            <li>Not to mention i have yet to experience any kind of sensitivity which is a definite plus.</li>
            <li>Meh worth a shot.</li>
            <li>Love that this product whitens my teeth and never makes them sensitive.</li>
            <li>but maybe the product would work better if used in an actual tanning bed rather than at home using the UV light tray that comes in the box...</li>
            <li>But having super white teeth is pretty popular, so maybe the advantages of having pearly whites outweighs any negatives?  </li>
            <li>I thought I had ordered the one without the UV lighting, but, it was the right packaging</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used for about a week and have been told so many times that my teeth look super white!</li>
            <li>Definitely well worth the money:)</li>
            <li>I was really hoping that your product would brighten up my smile</li>
            <li>I use it often and have really seen a difference in the whiteness of my teeth!</li>
            <li>Haha I would definately reccomend a buy here!</li>
            <li>I have recommended it to everyone that is interested in teeth whitening.</li>
            <li>I could tell a difference after the first use.</li>
            <li>Regular whitening toothpaste works better and faster.</li>
            <li>and it is totally worth it for how much whiter they make your teeth...</li>
            <li>i also noticed a difference after the first use.</li>
            <li>12 mins to be exact.</li>
            <li>The results are very noticable after just a couple uses!</li>
            <li>The first time I put this product on my teeth</li>
            <li>This product came so fast!</li>
            <li>Item shipped on time and have seen a difference after only using the product one time :)</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I am still searching for that whitening solution that will give me superb results.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>The first time i used this product was in the tanning bed</li>
            <li>but after the first I used this</li>
            <li>Definitely get that bright white smile.</li>
            <li>Even to just try the product once, it&#x27;s much cheaper to order here than through a tanning salon - as one pack at my salon is $45!</li>
            <li>If u need your teeth whiten quickly for an upcoming event I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I will suggest buyin it without the light to save a few bucks because the little light does not work that great in my opinion</li>
            <li>Very satisfactory love the instant results to my teeth!</li>
            <li>Easy to use; only 10-15 minutes</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice much with the light, as I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very powerful, so I probably will just stick to using it every other day in the tanning bed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I noticed minimal results the first time, but a good bit of improvement the second time.</li>
            <li>however, if you want to use this outside of the tanning bed the UV light doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>Absolutely lovin&#x27; it.</li>
            <li>But, back to the product, it comes with a UV light, along with two batteries, a tube of the whitening paste, and the mouth piece.</li>
            <li>, teeth show much improvement.  </li>
            <li>I will keep using to see if I really see a difference.</li>
            <li>Was very please with the shipping -</li>
            <li>I had to scrap as much out of the bottle as I could to use the product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I got the whitening I was expecting with as much product I got to use.</li>
            <li>Will have to go through the hassles of getting a replacement, will take as much time as it would to find replacement batteries.</li>
            <li>I really like the truth.</li>
            <li>However, it whitens VERY WELL</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like there&#x27;s too much space in the container.</li>
            <li>We sold lots of this and it worked really well.</li>
            <li>but... works  in tanning bed very well.</li>
            <li>It dont make your gums sensative and it works fast.</li>
            <li>My teeth are the same color and image used it in the tanning bed as well as with just the light every day for a month.</li>
            <li>My teeth aren&#x27;t perfectly straight</li>
            <li>do.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a bit of a hassle to have the led light in your mouth for so long.  for an added benefit</li>
            <li>white strips(which cost nearly 90 dollars), which never seemed to work as good as i thought they should considering the amount of money i spent on them, plus</li>
            <li>, it is a decent product.  </li>
            <li>For years i have been searching for a decent priced item to whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li>did get white spots on my teeth, BUT they evened out quickly.</li>
            <li>so I totally recommend this product to anyone who is interested!</li>
            <li>I am on my second round of whitening and I am in love!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have the problem that  a lot of other people have had with the light not working until it got turned on in my purse and stayed on</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it two other times, one in the tanning bed and one with the light it comes with</li>
            <li>Not even with brand new batteries.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>Retail price was $38 for this same exact kit.</li>
            <li>Her teeth are pretty crooked, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to make a difference; her teeth shade lightens up anyway.  </li>
            <li>My teeth were pretty white to begin with</li>
            <li>So far, this product works!</li>
            <li>the led light would t turn on half the time and after 1 week wouldn&#x27;t even turn on at all</li>
            <li>There is a little plastic tab in the battery that needs to be taken out before the light will work.</li>
            <li>As far as the drooling goes...</li>
            <li>it made my teeth feel really sensitive</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who is like me with sensitive teeth and wanting to whiten them without pain.  </li>
            <li>and it hasn&#x27;t bothered my sensitive teeth at all.</li>
            <li>they always made my teeth REALLY sensitive to everything.</li>
            <li>Also, do NOT waste your money and by the kit with the LED unit.  </li>
            <li>I have really sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t make them sensitive at all.</li>
            <li>The only con i would say is that if you have healthy sized lips like myself i did notice that when i used the product in the tanning bed, the mouthpiece made my bottom lip a little too pouty and caused a little white mark where the light couldnt get.</li>
            <li>ok ill admit i was a bit sceptical at first, thinking it was a scam because i thought your teeth would just look whiter because your skin would be darker.</li>
            <li>I would highly suggest anyone wanting their pearly whites to be Real white again to use this product.</li>
            <li>Not sure if this works, as my husband advised me I was probably giving myself oral cancer by shining a UV light into my mouth for extended periods of time.  </li>
            <li>Today was the first day that I tried this out in the tanning bed, I didn&#x27;t get the results I was wanting due to the fan in the bed blowing on my teeth and making them sensitive, and me having to keep closing my mouth to stop the pain.  </li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t make my teeth or gums sensitive like other products and I always notice a change from even the first session.</li>
            <li>Definitely works, I read another review saying to use a sensitive teeth toothpaste a week before use, if you have sensitive teeth, and I did and it helped a lot.</li>
            <li>I had to go the doctor due to first degree chemical burn to my bottom lip.</li>
            <li>the teeth whitener gel is only half way full.</li>
            <li>As a pageant girl i have used many more expensive teeth whiteners in the past such as the the crest</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this 2 times so far and already seeing a difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used to use the most expensive of the Crest Whitestrips, but they made my teeth so sensitive after just one treatment.</li>
            <li>some days I&#x27;m to lazy to sit down in my house for thirty minutes not being able to yell at my three kids</li>
            <li>The little light that you use on when not tanning, as far as i am concerned, is a waste of time.</li>
            <li>You can get at least 30 uses out of each tube and the at home LED light actually does work equally as well as using UV lights from a tanning bed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be using it only in the bed apparently.</li>
            <li>happened a lot faster than they probably would with the weak uv light in the unit.</li>
            <li>the back of the light isn&#x27;t holding tight enough to keep the batteries tight to the decide to keep it on.</li>

            <li> This is great stuff</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> works great</li>
            <li> The home treatment doesn&#x27;t work that well, but it works great when used with a tanning bed.</li>
            <li> after two weeks of use (once a week) i noticed great results.</li>
            <li> Great results within 20 mins.</li>
            <li> For the price it is a great product, at the tanning salon I go to</li>
            <li> The teeth whitening system (actaul whitening stuff and mouthpiece) is great</li>
            <li> so i checked amazon and found this great deal.</li>
            <li> is great too.</li>
            <li> I love it!!</li>
            <li> Also, it is very handy that  it can be used at home OR in the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great :P</li>
            <li> And the price was amazing!</li>
            <li> Better than whiting strips but def not the best.</li>
            <li> Bright side</li>
            <li> If you tan in a bed this is a good product...if you dont tan in a bed I wouldn&#x27;t bother wasteing your money.</li>
            <li> Amazon has it at a good price, in a salon it was like $40, pfft.</li>
            <li> The LED light didn&#x27;t do anything for me, so if you want results, tanning bed is your best choice.</li>
            <li> told me how good it worked when i asked.</li>
            <li> and i was very pleased.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> I have used this product four times now and i am in love!</li>
            <li> :) No sensitivity or pain after use!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this!</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> It worked amazingly.</li>
            <li> this is amazing</li>
            <li> this product is amazing.</li>
            <li> and it is amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing results</li>
            <li> AMAZING WORKS</li>
            <li> Not like getting a pro whitening treatment, but a great, cheap alternative to that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy they came out with a system to use at home with an LED light.</li>
            <li> I ended up just getting the Imako teeth which are amazing.</li>
            <li> and maybe it&#x27;s because you get the best results in a tanning bed since the uv is much stronger.</li>
            <li> Works nicely.</li>
            <li> I own a tanning salon and this is one of the number one products that sells out.</li>
            <li> so I thought I would try it out to give people an honest opinion.</li>
            <li> So easy and effective!</li>
            <li> i love using it when i go to the tanning bed or even just laying in my own bed.</li>
            <li> The amount of drool that this produces as well is kind of hilarious.  </li>
            <li> Rest of the products are good, except I don&#x60;t think that whitening solution is all that fantastic that they make it out to be.</li>
            <li> nice i used it and start to love</li>
            <li> This store also shipped my order very quickly!</li>
            <li> Pretty whitening, great product.</li>
            <li> the description was exactly what I ordered and the quality of the item was great</li>
            <li> you are supposed to be able to push the button and it stay on so that you can go about your day to day life....</li>
            <li> Turns out the kit from the tanning salon worked wayyy better.</li>
            <li> Looove this product I love how I could whiting my teeth from the comfort of my home.</li>
            <li> Just wish there was more whitener.</li>
            <li> I just wish it came with more of the gel stuff.</li>
            <li> and i love it</li>
            <li> I use a at home whitening gel kit from smile bright and</li>
            <li> i can see a difference in my teeth for sure</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> , it shipped fast, lol.</li>
            <li> Love it..</li>
            <li> SO WELL, PLEASED...</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve probably list More than I&#x27;ve used .</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> But was more pricey.</li>
            <li> better than my tanning salon</li>
            <li> later it was beautiful!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> OKAY</li>
            <li> I liked it better in the tanning bed rather than the light that comes with it</li>
            <li> Cheaply made!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> Love the teeth whitening system, my husband and I saw results after 1 whitening session</li>
            <li> Meh.. Works about as well as the crest whitening strips (the $60 dollar ones) but more hassle.</li>
            <li> absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s agreat product and it&#x27;s cheap too!</li>
            <li> Significant whitening after just one use!</li>
            <li> It gave me a beautiful bright white smile within one use</li>
            <li> Fast, easy, cheap, effective, couldn&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
            <li> Works better in a bed than with the portable light.</li>
            <li> many people said their light didnt work, there is a piece of plastic between the batteries</li>
            <li> I love that I Can use this in the tanning bed or at home with the UV light.</li>
            <li> I like having the LED light at home but being able to use the mouth piece in the tanning bed</li>
            <li> I loved it so much I bought one for my boyfriend.</li>
            <li> Also way cool that I can use it at home!</li>
            <li> but it went away very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Works great so far I am using the at home light until tanning season.</li>
            <li> It is an easy to use product</li>
            <li> When I opened my package I got a strong scent come to find the gel had leaked.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy and quick to do!</li>
            <li> It made me slobber when I was standing up, but I lied down and it worked perfectly!</li>
            <li> Will keep using this product as it is much more pleasant for me than the Crest white strips.</li>
            <li> I used this same whitening gel on my teeth when I use to lay in the tanning bed, however I quit tanning now and was happy to see they made a light to use at home.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a coffee drinker or you smoke, you will see a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> This is a great idea especially since it kills two birds with one stone.</li>
            <li> The light did not turn on or work</li>
            <li> Works well when used in tanning bed, didn&#x27;t see results when paired with the handheld light.</li>
            <li> u can use the LED light that comes with the kit.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t yet tried the gel, but the light will not turn on.</li>
            <li> and now my LED light won&#x27;t work...</li>
            <li> I would like to say I&#x27;ve noticed people complaining about the light not working.</li>
            <li> the light turns on.</li>
            <li> i use a dentist curing light that i got off amazon for 20 bucks and results</li>
            <li> At home with light...</li>
            <li> The light does not work.</li>
            <li> because when I received this product the light didn&#x27;t even work and</li>
            <li> I could see that the light and gel were both used.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for anyone with enough time to use it often!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and works as it says.</li>
            <li> Cheap to replace whitening paste.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The light and everything works</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen people complain that the light didn&#x27;t turn on on the home led light.</li>
            <li> Used this product one time &amp; the UV light already quit working.</li>
            <li> As there is risk for burning to tan in a bed every day for my light skin, today I used the Twi-Light that came with it.</li>
            <li> Supper fast shipping saw a difference after just once use so excited!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited that it is cheaper here.  </li>
            <li> I bought this from a tanning salon originally, worked great and lasted a long time..</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this product after reading some reviews.</li>
            <li> I was very excited for this purchase and then very letdown when I discovered that the light didn&#x27;t work at all.  </li>
            <li> I was super excited about finding it here.</li>
            <li> Item as describes, these really do whiten my teeth drastically and the price is way better than the ones I used to buy at my tanning salon.</li>
            <li> This was a very suggested purchase from many people, so I decided to buy it (forgetting to read reviews)</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s true that you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> and i also like my sweet tea.</li>
            <li> The mouthpiece is my favorite part because you can attach the UV light into the mouthpiece and be completely hands-free while your teeth whiten!</li>
            <li> like other people have said and this was great buy.</li>
            <li> Ok let me first say that the first time Ive used this kit was purchased from a tanning salon.</li>
            <li> As described and quick delivery</li>
            <li> The gel was resealed which is super sketchy...</li>
            <li> but first time use is a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once, but so far so good!  </li>
            <li> lol this kit takes half the time</li>
            <li> This product you paint on with a brush exactly where you want it and it absorbs in so you don&#x27;t need to rinse when you&#x27;re done!</li>
            <li> Works great if you are tanning but only last a day and the light that comes with never works dont buy</li>
            <li> This really worked for me in the tanning bed and with the light.</li>
            <li> Make sure you take the safety seal below the batteries out prior to use or the UV light won&#x27;t turn on.</li>
            <li> I thought it was definitely worth the $60 when I bought it there.</li>
            <li> I love this product but the only thing is that the home light did not work.</li>
            <li> Not to mention i have yet to experience any kind of sensitivity which is a definite plus.</li>
            <li> Meh worth a shot.</li>
            <li> Love that this product whitens my teeth and never makes them sensitive.</li>
            <li> but maybe the product would work better if used in an actual tanning bed rather than at home using the UV light tray that comes in the box...</li>
            <li> But having super white teeth is pretty popular, so maybe the advantages of having pearly whites outweighs any negatives?  </li>
            <li> I thought I had ordered the one without the UV lighting, but, it was the right packaging</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used for about a week and have been told so many times that my teeth look super white!</li>
            <li> Definitely well worth the money:)</li>
            <li> I was really hoping that your product would brighten up my smile</li>
            <li> I use it often and have really seen a difference in the whiteness of my teeth!</li>
            <li> Haha I would definately reccomend a buy here!</li>
            <li> I have recommended it to everyone that is interested in teeth whitening.</li>
            <li> I could tell a difference after the first use.</li>
            <li> Regular whitening toothpaste works better and faster.</li>
            <li> and it is totally worth it for how much whiter they make your teeth...</li>
            <li> i also noticed a difference after the first use.</li>
            <li> 12 mins to be exact.</li>
            <li> The results are very noticable after just a couple uses!</li>
            <li> The first time I put this product on my teeth</li>
            <li> This product came so fast!</li>
            <li> Item shipped on time and have seen a difference after only using the product one time :)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I am still searching for that whitening solution that will give me superb results.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> The first time i used this product was in the tanning bed</li>
            <li> but after the first I used this</li>
            <li> Definitely get that bright white smile.</li>
            <li> Even to just try the product once, it&#x27;s much cheaper to order here than through a tanning salon - as one pack at my salon is $45!</li>
            <li> If u need your teeth whiten quickly for an upcoming event I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I will suggest buyin it without the light to save a few bucks because the little light does not work that great in my opinion</li>
            <li> Very satisfactory love the instant results to my teeth!</li>
            <li> Easy to use; only 10-15 minutes</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice much with the light, as I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very powerful, so I probably will just stick to using it every other day in the tanning bed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I noticed minimal results the first time, but a good bit of improvement the second time.</li>
            <li> however, if you want to use this outside of the tanning bed the UV light doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> Absolutely lovin&#x27; it.</li>
            <li> But, back to the product, it comes with a UV light, along with two batteries, a tube of the whitening paste, and the mouth piece.</li>
            <li> , teeth show much improvement.  </li>
            <li> I will keep using to see if I really see a difference.</li>
            <li> Was very please with the shipping -</li>
            <li> I had to scrap as much out of the bottle as I could to use the product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I got the whitening I was expecting with as much product I got to use.</li>
            <li> Will have to go through the hassles of getting a replacement, will take as much time as it would to find replacement batteries.</li>
            <li> I really like the truth.</li>
            <li> However, it whitens VERY WELL</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like there&#x27;s too much space in the container.</li>
            <li> We sold lots of this and it worked really well.</li>
            <li> but... works  in tanning bed very well.</li>
            <li> It dont make your gums sensative and it works fast.</li>
            <li> My teeth are the same color and image used it in the tanning bed as well as with just the light every day for a month.</li>
            <li> My teeth aren&#x27;t perfectly straight</li>
            <li> do.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a bit of a hassle to have the led light in your mouth for so long.  for an added benefit</li>
            <li> white strips(which cost nearly 90 dollars), which never seemed to work as good as i thought they should considering the amount of money i spent on them, plus</li>
            <li> , it is a decent product.  </li>
            <li> For years i have been searching for a decent priced item to whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li> did get white spots on my teeth, BUT they evened out quickly.</li>
            <li> so I totally recommend this product to anyone who is interested!</li>
            <li> I am on my second round of whitening and I am in love!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have the problem that  a lot of other people have had with the light not working until it got turned on in my purse and stayed on</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it two other times, one in the tanning bed and one with the light it comes with</li>
            <li> Not even with brand new batteries.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> Retail price was $38 for this same exact kit.</li>
            <li> Her teeth are pretty crooked, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to make a difference; her teeth shade lightens up anyway.  </li>
            <li> My teeth were pretty white to begin with</li>
            <li> So far, this product works!</li>
            <li> the led light would t turn on half the time and after 1 week wouldn&#x27;t even turn on at all</li>
            <li> There is a little plastic tab in the battery that needs to be taken out before the light will work.</li>
            <li> As far as the drooling goes...</li>
            <li> it made my teeth feel really sensitive</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who is like me with sensitive teeth and wanting to whiten them without pain.  </li>
            <li> and it hasn&#x27;t bothered my sensitive teeth at all.</li>
            <li> they always made my teeth REALLY sensitive to everything.</li>
            <li> Also, do NOT waste your money and by the kit with the LED unit.  </li>
            <li> I have really sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t make them sensitive at all.</li>
            <li> The only con i would say is that if you have healthy sized lips like myself i did notice that when i used the product in the tanning bed, the mouthpiece made my bottom lip a little too pouty and caused a little white mark where the light couldnt get.</li>
            <li> ok ill admit i was a bit sceptical at first, thinking it was a scam because i thought your teeth would just look whiter because your skin would be darker.</li>
            <li> I would highly suggest anyone wanting their pearly whites to be Real white again to use this product.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this works, as my husband advised me I was probably giving myself oral cancer by shining a UV light into my mouth for extended periods of time.  </li>
            <li> Today was the first day that I tried this out in the tanning bed, I didn&#x27;t get the results I was wanting due to the fan in the bed blowing on my teeth and making them sensitive, and me having to keep closing my mouth to stop the pain.  </li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t make my teeth or gums sensitive like other products and I always notice a change from even the first session.</li>
            <li> Definitely works, I read another review saying to use a sensitive teeth toothpaste a week before use, if you have sensitive teeth, and I did and it helped a lot.</li>
            <li> I had to go the doctor due to first degree chemical burn to my bottom lip.</li>
            <li> the teeth whitener gel is only half way full.</li>
            <li> As a pageant girl i have used many more expensive teeth whiteners in the past such as the the crest</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this 2 times so far and already seeing a difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to use the most expensive of the Crest Whitestrips, but they made my teeth so sensitive after just one treatment.</li>
            <li> some days I&#x27;m to lazy to sit down in my house for thirty minutes not being able to yell at my three kids</li>
            <li> The little light that you use on when not tanning, as far as i am concerned, is a waste of time.</li>
            <li> You can get at least 30 uses out of each tube and the at home LED light actually does work equally as well as using UV lights from a tanning bed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be using it only in the bed apparently.</li>
            <li> happened a lot faster than they probably would with the weak uv light in the unit.</li>
            <li> the back of the light isn&#x27;t holding tight enough to keep the batteries tight to the decide to keep it on.</li>
            <li> and I actually love that they use minimal packaging because that means less resources wasted!</li>
            <li> I used the product consistently before bedtime for at least 20 minutes (I also brushed daily w/crest 3d radiant toothpaste)</li>
            <li> Only hard things is going 10 days straight...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Crest White Strips in the past and boy did they make my teeth so sensitive, even after I took them off</li>
            <li> And you don&#x27;t have to leave it in too long.</li>
            <li> The only down fall about this product is that if you have sensitive gums like me, when you apply this your gums will burn a little.</li>
            <li> You have to remove the batteries and peel the small clear sticker off then replace batteries and BAM!</li>
            <li> I will say they are a bit uncomfortable but not painful</li>
            <li> I had braces in middle school, and my white spots only occur on the calcification marks that my braces left behind.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, although, you do look a little silly wearing it haha</li>
            <li> though if you arnt laying down flat.</li>
            <li> After you use this product you should notice little white marks or streaks on your teeth but that dissolves within 24 hours.</li>
            <li> So just be careful...</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t give me any gum sensitivity (however I apply it to my teeth carefully).</li>
            <li> Just tilt your head back slightly while in use !</li>
            <li> Seems to be whitening pretty well, but the mouth guard left really bad tan lines around the outside of my mouth that I&#x27;m still trying to get rid of.</li>
            <li> u have any suggestions on other twilight products or maybe some tips</li>
            <li> I think it works as well as any other whitening kit on the market.</li>
            <li> The bottle of teeth whitening liquid that came with it is a little bit too small, I&#x27;ve only used it about 5 times</li>
            <li> the only negative was the bottle that holds</li>
            <li> I was still experiencing sharp pain!  </li>
            <li> This product was awful didn&#x27;t last more than 1 week</li>
            <li> I have however noticed a slight improvement in the color of my teeth from the three times I&#x27;ve used this.  </li>
            <li> and I can tell a slight difference after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> I did experience a little bit of sensitivity</li>
            <li> but it lasts for a little while if you use a tanning bed often.</li>
            <li> the button wont stay down!</li>
            <li> Product works extremely well!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> The batteries arrived dead.</li>
            <li> The mouth piece is not comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any difference and been using a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> this stuff, works, but you have to keep up with the treatments everyday, which was something i didnt</li>
            <li> Dont waste your time.</li>
            <li> I bought two of them and just wasted 30 something dollars..</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> The tabs that you bite down on are kinda small - I can bite them but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not even half the price of what you pay at a tanning salon!</li>
            <li> When I received the box in the mail I was scared because the box was so small</li>
            <li> I am not sure just yet of the color difference.</li>
            <li> Waste of money !</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a small plastic disc under the batteries to keep it from turning on in transit.</li>
            <li> the tubes of whitener are small though</li>
            <li> The worse thing is no matter how tightly I close it, it still oozes out</li>
            <li> (it was hard to see)</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any crazy results just white marks where the guard covers my mouth in the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> Also i was severly sick when little and panacilin stained my teeth yellow.</li>
            <li> I see not difference when I use this, and I don&#x27;t even have difficult stains I just wanted to brighten a little.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say that twilight teeth has not made my teeth any whiter I drink coffee and occasionally smoke, my teeth aren&#x27;t horrible or anything they just have always been yellow</li>
            <li> Im not sure if it was fake or just expired gel</li>
            <li> I should have just bought it at my tanning bed and the seal was broken so it had been tampered with</li>
            <li> Item was leaking and broken</li>
            <li> How ever the product itself still had poor results.</li>
            <li> No odors, bad tastes, messy strips, clunky trays, or unnerving sensativity.</li>
            <li> maybe i&#x27;m doing something wrong.</li>
            <li> and I recommended this product to my friends, also the price is not too expensive I like that.</li>
            <li> if your skeptical about this not being the correct product, don&#x27;t be.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I am on pain medication and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought expensive strips, have had teeth supposedly bleached by my dentist who did a lousy job</li>
            <li> The protocol is somewhat complicated, discouraging me from using it as often as I&#x27;d need to in order to see results.</li>
            <li> It is also nearly impossible to use without drooling.</li>
            <li> so take the batteries out before you get frustrated.</li>
            <li> It leaves spots on your teeth and it&#x27;s painful.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product it does not whiten well at all.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> But I was very disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely terrible.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>

            <li> This is a great idea especially since it kills two birds with one stone. Tanning and teeth whitening. however, if you want to use this outside of the tanning bed the UV light doesn&#x27;t work very well. you are supposed to be able to push the button and it stay on so that you can go about your day to day life....the button wont stay down! i have to hold it which hurts my hand, my gums and it doesn&#x27;t have the consistancy that it would if it just stayed on. If you tan in a bed this is a good product...if you dont tan in a bed I wouldn&#x27;t bother wasteing your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say that twilight teeth has not made my teeth any whiter I drink coffee and occasionally smoke, my teeth aren&#x27;t horrible or anything they just have always been yellow I was really hoping that your product would brighten up my smile but it hasn&#x27;t do u have any suggestions on other twilight products or maybe some tips maybe i&#x27;m doing something wrong.</li>
            <li> Ok let me first say that the first time Ive used this kit was purchased from a tanning salon. Retail price was $38 for this same exact kit. (PALM beach tan) It worked amazingly. My teeth were so white they glowed. When I found twilight teeth on Amazon for $15 I was ecstatic. I ordered the kit and Im not sure if it was fake or just expired gel but it did nothing. Sooo I went back and purchased the kit from the salon and also ordered another kit from Amazon to do a test. Turns out the kit from the tanning salon worked wayyy better. So just be careful... sometimes its legit sometimes you get ripped off. Its the same way with buying tanning lotion on here.</li>
            <li> Pretty whitening, great product. Works better in a bed than with the portable light.</li>
            <li> I think it works great</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas, she saw it at a salon for $40! Awesome price!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great :P I use it often and have really seen a difference in the whiteness of my teeth! As far as the drooling goes...Just tilt your head back slightly while in use ! Haha I would definately reccomend a buy here!</li>
            <li> Looove this product I love how I could whiting my teeth from the comfort of my home. It definitely works, I&#x27;ve started seeing results after the second use and I recommended this product to my friends, also the price is not too expensive I like that.</li>
            <li> Great. Just wish there was more whitener.</li>
            <li> Works great if you are tanning but only last a day and the light that comes with never works dont buy</li>
            <li> The light did not turn on or work but if u go tanning in a bed this is amazing</li>
            <li> Absolutely lovin&#x27; it. Visibly whitens my teeth. No odors, bad tastes, messy strips, clunky trays, or unnerving sensativity. 20 minutes and under. I just wish it came with more of the gel stuff. Amazon has it at a good price, in a salon it was like $40, pfft.</li>
            <li> I received my product on time,it was in excellent condition and i love it,it&#x27;s awesome and a great product.</li>
            <li> I am on my second round of whitening and I am in love! When I received the box in the mail I was scared because the box was so small I thought I had ordered the one without the UV lighting, but, it was the right packaging and I actually love that they use minimal packaging because that means less resources wasted! But, back to the product, it comes with a UV light, along with two batteries, a tube of the whitening paste, and the mouth piece. Make sure you take the safety seal below the batteries out prior to use or the UV light won&#x27;t turn on. The mouthpiece is my favorite part because you can attach the UV light into the mouthpiece and be completely hands-free while your teeth whiten! I&#x27;m two rounds in and I already see a difference so I totally recommend this product to anyone who is interested! And the price was amazing!</li>
            <li> it made my teeth feel really sensitive I should have just bought it at my tanning bed and the seal was broken so it had been tampered with</li>
            <li> This is great stuff I believe your teeth can never be white enough I use a at home whitening gel kit from smile bright and some days I&#x27;m to lazy to sit down in my house for thirty minutes not being able to yell at my three kids lol this kit takes half the time 5-20 minutes it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> ITS AWESOME. works great at home and tanning bed</li>
            <li> Supper fast shipping saw a difference after just once use so excited!!</li>
            <li> The BEST teeth whitening kit I have ever used.  They sell it at the tanning salons for like $60 bucks!!  I thought it was definitely worth the $60 when I bought it there. I&#x27;m so excited that it is cheaper here.  My teeth get so white and IT DOES NOT HURT MY TEETH. No sensitivity. AT ALL. I have recommended it to everyone that is interested in teeth whitening.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> if your skeptical about this not being the correct product, don&#x27;t be. it is the From a tanning salon product. the only negative was the bottle that holds the teeth whitener gel is only half way full.</li>
            <li> have bought at my salon, and used at home a lot.  works great, teeth show much improvement.  Will buy online next time and save money</li>
            <li> I could tell a difference after the first use. I like how the gel drys on so you don&#x27;t need to rinse it afterwards.</li>
            <li> As described and quick delivery</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve uses this every day for forever it doesn&#x27;t work at all. Regular whitening toothpaste works better and faster. I see not difference when I use this, and I don&#x27;t even have difficult stains I just wanted to brighten a little. And when you take the mouth piece out the taste left in your mouth after the lights been on that gel is aweful it tastes like burnt hair. Will not get again.</li>
            <li> this product is amazing. i love using it when i go to the tanning bed or even just laying in my own bed. i can see a difference in my teeth for sure</li>
            <li> Item as describes, these really do whiten my teeth drastically and the price is way better than the ones I used to buy at my tanning salon. I will say they are a bit uncomfortable but not painful and it is totally worth it for how much whiter they make your teeth... White strips can&#x27;t compare... And you don&#x27;t have to leave it in too long.</li>
            <li> I am not sure just yet of the color difference. I will keep using to see if I really see a difference.</li>
            <li> I used this product two days ago. I had to go the doctor due to first degree chemical burn to my bottom lip. Needless to say I am on pain medication and my bottom lip is beyond swollen. There are no words to describe how swollen and big my lip is. The healing process will take 7-10 days.</li>
            <li> I was very excited for this purchase and then very letdown when I discovered that the light didn&#x27;t work at all.  Not even with brand new batteries.  Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> It helps my teeth but it takes time.</li>
            <li> Loved the product- will buy again! Was very please with the shipping - the description was exactly what I ordered and the quality of the item was great</li>
            <li> The home treatment doesn&#x27;t work that well, but it works great when used with a tanning bed.</li>
            <li> The twilight whitening gel seems to work wonderfully. The little light that you use on when not tanning, as far as i am concerned, is a waste of time. It seems to only have a L.E.D. lite in it. How does that work?</li>
            <li> When I opened my package I got a strong scent come to find the gel had leaked. I had to scrap as much out of the bottle as I could to use the product. A bit upsetting.  I don&#x27;t think I got the whitening I was expecting with as much product I got to use.</li>
            <li> Works well when used in tanning bed, didn&#x27;t see results when paired with the handheld light.</li>
            <li> after two weeks of use (once a week) i noticed great results. i also noticed a difference after the first use. i had no sensitivity whatsoever. many people said their light didnt work, there is a piece of plastic between the batteries and i had to take both batteries out to find it (it was hard to see) so take the batteries out before you get frustrated.</li>
            <li> The batteries arrived dead. Will have to go through the hassles of getting a replacement, will take as much time as it would to find replacement batteries.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this! I noticed a difference after one use!</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this product. Great results within 20 mins. 12 mins to be exact. I would highly suggest anyone wanting their pearly whites to be Real white again to use this product. I use it while in the tanning bed and it is amazing. And even if you dont tan in a tanning bed u can use the LED light that comes with the kit. Very easy to use!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Twilight Teeth in the tanning booth on and off for the last couple years. The results are very noticable after just a couple uses! I used to use the most expensive of the Crest Whitestrips, but they made my teeth so sensitive after just one treatment. There is absolutly zero sensitivity with this product.</li>
            <li> Amazing!!!! This is a must buy!</li>
            <li> This product was awful didn&#x27;t last more than 1 week the led light would t turn on half the time and after 1 week wouldn&#x27;t even turn on at all this is a robbery</li>
            <li> Only teeth whitening that actually works instantly</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product off of another site, not Amazon but thought I would share my thoughts on it on here as well.  I have very sensitive teeth so whitening them is always a bother.  I&#x27;ve used Crest White Strips in the past and boy did they make my teeth so sensitive, even after I took them off I was still experiencing sharp pain!  I would recommend this product to anyone who is like me with sensitive teeth and wanting to whiten them without pain.  The first time I put this product on my teeth I did experience a little bit of sensitivity but it went away very quickly.  Today was the first day that I tried this out in the tanning bed, I didn&#x27;t get the results I was wanting due to the fan in the bed blowing on my teeth and making them sensitive, and me having to keep closing my mouth to stop the pain.  I have however noticed a slight improvement in the color of my teeth from the three times I&#x27;ve used this.  For the price it is a great product, at the tanning salon I go to I believe this product sells for about $23.</li>
            <li> Very satisfactory love the instant results to my teeth! I definitely will continue to use this product in the future</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought expensive strips, have had teeth supposedly bleached by my dentist who did a lousy job and nothing compares to this. People ask me how do I get my teeth so white. I only tell people I really like the truth. I read a review that says it doesn&#x27;t work on them and maybe it&#x27;s because you get the best results in a tanning bed since the uv is much stronger.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this works, as my husband advised me I was probably giving myself oral cancer by shining a UV light into my mouth for extended periods of time.  So I only used it once.  The amount of drool that this produces as well is kind of hilarious.  But having super white teeth is pretty popular, so maybe the advantages of having pearly whites outweighs any negatives?  Guess I&#x27;ll go back to the whitestrips.</li>
            <li> Love it! My teeth are so white and it&#x27;s easy and quick to do! Would recommend for anyone looking for sparkling white teeth!!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product it does not whiten well at all. The mouth piece is not comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> Definitely works, I read another review saying to use a sensitive teeth toothpaste a week before use, if you have sensitive teeth, and I did and it helped a lot. Not a permanent whitening system but it lasts for a little while if you use a tanning bed often. The LED light didn&#x27;t do anything for me, so if you want results, tanning bed is your best choice.</li>
            <li> The bottle of teeth whitening liquid that came with it is a little bit too small, I&#x27;ve only used it about 5 times and it&#x27;s almost out. However, it whitens VERY WELL and it hasn&#x27;t bothered my sensitive teeth at all. Highly recommend, although, you do look a little silly wearing it haha</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t yet tried the gel, but the light will not turn on. It&#x27;s like there&#x27;s too much space in the container. I can hear it clink around.. I&#x27;ll be using it only in the bed apparently. Only hard things is going 10 days straight... Ugh. Bright side, it shipped fast, lol.</li>
            <li> Love it.. Definitely wroth the money</li>
            <li> I love this product but the only thing is that the home light did not work. If they don&#x27;t work then don&#x27;t put them in the package.</li>
            <li> Love this! So easy and effective!</li>
            <li> Item was leaking and broken</li>
            <li> Rest of the products are good, except I don&#x60;t think that whitening solution is all that fantastic that they make it out to be.</li>
            <li> This product came so fast! it&#x27;s not offered as prime but came before my prime order did. So simple to use and does not irritate your teeth or gums. It does make you drool though if you arnt laying down flat. I have not tried it out in the tanning bed yet but I have used it for two days now and think that it has made a difference. I didn&#x27;t get any spots on my teeth like other people have said and this was great buy. If it does continue to work at home and at the tanning salon, I will be a return customer.</li>
            <li> ok ill admit i was a bit sceptical at first, thinking it was a scam because i thought your teeth would just look whiter because your skin would be darker. As a pageant girl i have used many more expensive teeth whiteners in the past such as the the crest white strips(which cost nearly 90 dollars), which never seemed to work as good as i thought they should considering the amount of money i spent on them, plus they always made my teeth REALLY sensitive to everything. I have used this product four times now and i am in love! My teeth were noticiably whiter after one use but by i would say the third use they looked like i had them professionaly done. Not to mention i have yet to experience any kind of sensitivity which is a definite plus. The only con i would say is that if you have healthy sized lips like myself i did notice that when i used the product in the tanning bed, the mouthpiece made my bottom lip a little too pouty and caused a little white mark where the light couldnt get. I instead use the product at home and use the LED unit which seems to work just as well.</li>
            <li> Seems to be whitening pretty well, but the mouth guard left really bad tan lines around the outside of my mouth that I&#x27;m still trying to get rid of.</li>
            <li> Meh worth a shot.Haven&#x27;t seen any crazy results just white marks where the guard covers my mouth in the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years! Amazing results</li>
            <li> AMAZING WORKS SO WELL, PLEASED...</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any difference and been using a few weeks now. The worse thing is no matter how tightly I close it, it still oozes out so I&#x27;ve probably list More than I&#x27;ve used . Waste of money !</li>
            <li> nice i used it and start to love</li>
            <li> This was a very suggested purchase from many people, so I decided to buy it (forgetting to read reviews) but I used it ONCE and now my LED light won&#x27;t work...the back of the light isn&#x27;t holding tight enough to keep the batteries tight to the decide to keep it on. The only way I can now use the whitening gel is if I bring it and the mouth piece to the tanning bed. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Works great so far I am using the at home light until tanning season. I would like to say I&#x27;ve noticed people complaining about the light not working. I thought the same thing. You have to remove the batteries and peel the small clear sticker off then replace batteries and BAM! the light turns on. I will post another review once I use it with the tanning bed</li>
            <li> Works nicely. Not like getting a pro whitening treatment, but a great, cheap alternative to that. Doesn&#x27;t give me any gum sensitivity (however I apply it to my teeth carefully). I used this same whitening gel on my teeth when I use to lay in the tanning bed, however I quit tanning now and was happy to see they made a light to use at home. Will keep using this product as it is much more pleasant for me than the Crest white strips.</li>
            <li> Item shipped on time and have seen a difference after only using the product one time :)</li>
            <li> Love that this product whitens my teeth and never makes them sensitive. Also, it is very handy that  it can be used at home OR in the tanning bed. I own a tanning salon and this is one of the number one products that sells out.</li>
            <li> this stuff, works, but you have to keep up with the treatments everyday, which was something i didnt do.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a bit of a hassle to have the led light in your mouth for so long.  for an added benefit i use a dentist curing light that i got off amazon for 20 bucks and results happened a lot faster than they probably would with the weak uv light in the unit.</li>
            <li> I worked at a tanning salon for a while. We sold lots of this and it worked really well. Immediate results. I was super excited about finding it here. but... works  in tanning bed very well. At home with light... Dont waste your time. The light does not work.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I didn&#x27;t have the problem that  a lot of other people have had with the light not working until it got turned on in my purse and stayed on and the battery went out.. This really worked for me in the tanning bed and with the light.</li>
            <li> The teeth whitening system (actaul whitening stuff and mouthpiece) is great and I can tell a slight difference after a few uses.  I have minimal coffee stains and tan frequently, so for the price you can get it off of here, it is a decent product.  However, the box in the package was beat up and falling apart when it arrived, but it did not seem to affect the product inside the box.  Also, do NOT waste your money and by the kit with the LED unit.  The LED unit did not work, could not even get it to come on;  I should have saved my $6 and just bought the whitening with the mouthpeice.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work when I received the item. Even after Battery replacement</li>
            <li> Very good product. Better than whiting strips but def not the best. If u need your teeth whiten quickly for an upcoming event I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this from a tanning salon originally, worked great and lasted a long time.. But was more pricey. I guess it&#x27;s true that you get what you pay for because when I received this product the light didn&#x27;t even work and I could see that the light and gel were both used. The gel was resealed which is super sketchy... I bought two of them and just wasted 30 something dollars.. I wish I read the reviews before purchasing.</li>
            <li> I saw a difference in one use.</li>
            <li> I used the product consistently before bedtime for at least 20 minutes (I also brushed daily w/crest 3d radiant toothpaste) I saw no results. It states on the box that you can use the product while you tan. I don&#x27;t want to jump to any conclusions but maybe the product would work better if used in an actual tanning bed rather than at home using the UV light tray that comes in the box...however, I am not a salon tanner so I cannot confirm that. Unfortunately, I am still searching for that whitening solution that will give me superb results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely terrible. It leaves spots on your teeth and it&#x27;s painful. My teeth hurt for days afterwards. Do not recommend!</li>
            <li> This product is great! It works well both in the tanning bed and at home! It made me slobber when I was standing up, but I lied down and it worked perfectly! I did not get any irritation on my gums like it warned about on the box. This is a great product for anyone with enough time to use it often!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and works as it says. I did not feel like it damaged my teeth at all. I just kept forgetting to use it. But it did work when I would remember to use it.</li>
            <li> Great product!! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> better than my tanning salon ~ LA Tan</li>
            <li> I love that I Can use this in the tanning bed or at home with the UV light. It gave me a beautiful bright white smile within one use I noticed a difference but 3 uses later it was beautiful!</li>
            <li> I used to use this in the tanning salon. I&#x27;m so happy they came out with a system to use at home with an LED light. I absolutely love this product. My teeth are grateful. :) No sensitivity or pain after use! The best part? It&#x27;s not even half the price of what you pay at a tanning salon! I will be repurchasing this.</li>
            <li> My mom noticed a difference in my teeth after my 2nd time using it. I have really sensitive teeth and I did&#x27;t get any sensitivity with this.  Also way cool that I can use it at home!</li>
            <li> My wife uses this regularly and she has seen an improvement, as have I.  The solution contains plenty of peroxide, which is the whitening agent.  Her teeth are pretty crooked, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to make a difference; her teeth shade lightens up anyway.  Really great value for the price!</li>
            <li> i will never have to spend a fortune whiting my teeth through the dentist any longer. this product does wonders.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as product description.</li>
            <li> This is awesome! I&#x27;ve used for about a week and have been told so many times that my teeth look super white! Also, it doesn&#x27;t make them sensitive at all.</li>
            <li> This item suprised me. For years i have been searching for a decent priced item to whiten my teeth. Every item that actualy worked was over priced. I came across this at my tanning salon and the girl told me how good it worked when i asked. I was tempted to buy it but i didnt wanna pay $35 for it so i checked amazon and found this great deal. Now im a soda and coffee drinker and i also like my sweet tea. Also i was severly sick when little and panacilin stained my teeth yellow. The first time i used this product was in the tanning bed and i was very pleased. It dont make your gums sensative and it works fast. I will suggest buyin it without the light to save a few bucks because the little light does not work that great in my opinion</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. This is a product that works.&lt;br /&gt;2. Cheap to replace whitening paste.&lt;br /&gt;3. Easy to use; only 10-15 minutes a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. You will drool all over yourself using this so be prepared.&lt;br /&gt;2. The mouth piece falls apart after a month of usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I use this kit on and off. 10-12 minutes a day give you whiter teeth in a week.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this product after reading some reviews. But I was very disappointed with it. It does not work for me. The light and everything works but it just does not whiten my teeth. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money!</li>
            <li> Did not work. My teeth are the same color and image used it in the tanning bed as well as with just the light every day for a month. There is a little plastic tab in the battery that needs to be taken out before the light will work. How ever the product itself still had poor results. I ended up just getting the Imako teeth which are amazing.</li>
            <li> WORKS OKAY I SUPPOSE...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this 2 times so far and already seeing a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple pointers/issues&lt;br /&gt;1) The tabs that you bite down on are kinda small - I can bite them but people with normal-large mouths probably couldn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;2) The drooling...&lt;br /&gt;3) I&#x27;ve seen people complain that the light didn&#x27;t turn on on the home led light. Mine didn&#x27;t either. HOWEVER! There&#x27;s a small plastic disc under the batteries to keep it from turning on in transit. This must be removed before use or else it won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this! I liked it better in the tanning bed rather than the light that comes with it but first time use is a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once, but so far so good!  No teeth sensitivity yet</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this product as often as I should but will be doing so for a couple weddings I have coming up. It is an easy to use product and I haven&#x27;t had any sensitivity to it like I did with Crest White Strips. I like having the LED light at home but being able to use the mouth piece in the tanning bed is great too.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed! Used this product one time &amp; the UV light already quit working. Cheaply made! Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Significant whitening after just one use! I loved it so much I bought one for my boyfriend.</li>
            <li> I think it works as well as any other whitening kit on the market. The protocol is somewhat complicated, discouraging me from using it as often as I&#x27;d need to in order to see results. It is also nearly impossible to use without drooling.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t make my teeth or gums sensitive like other products and I always notice a change from even the first session. You can get at least 30 uses out of each tube and the at home LED light actually does work equally as well as using UV lights from a tanning bed. My teeth aren&#x27;t perfectly straight so I can&#x27;t use whitening trays or strips because the product will miss areas of my teeth. This product you paint on with a brush exactly where you want it and it absorbs in so you don&#x27;t need to rinse when you&#x27;re done! Fast, easy, cheap, effective, couldn&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product. I had no problems at all &amp; my teeth are pearly white. For not costing an arm and a leg to get white tweth, this product is the beat out there.</li>
            <li> This product is probably the best teeth whiting product I have ever used. I do work at a tanning salon so I thought I would try it out to give people an honest opinion. If you&#x27;re a coffee drinker or you smoke, you will see a HUGE difference. My teeth were pretty white to begin with but after the first I used this my teeth looked 3-5 shades whiter. In the beginning do it 2-3 times in a week, and then after that do it once a week. After you use this product you should notice little white marks or streaks on your teeth but that dissolves within 24 hours. The only down fall about this product is that if you have sensitive gums like me, when you apply this your gums will burn a little.</li>
            <li> Product works extremely well!! I love it!! Definitely get that bright white smile. Just DO NOT order from LOWESTCOSTFORSURE. They do not even send the product!!!!!! Still working with amazon to get my money back its been over a month!!</li>
            <li> Love the teeth whitening system, my husband and I saw results after 1 whitening session</li>
            <li> Meh.. Works about as well as the crest whitening strips (the $60 dollar ones) but more hassle. You make the call.</li>
            <li> I love it!  It is absolutely perfect and I would recommend it to all of my friends and family!</li>
            <li> absolutely love it. the tubes of whitener are small though</li>
            <li> So far, this product works! I have used it twice in a tanning bed (HP Sun Angel for 20 minutes). I noticed minimal results the first time, but a good bit of improvement the second time. As there is risk for burning to tan in a bed every day for my light skin, today I used the Twi-Light that came with it. I don&#x27;t notice much with the light, as I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very powerful, so I probably will just stick to using it every other day in the tanning bed.&lt;br /&gt;I did get white spots on my teeth, BUT they evened out quickly. I had braces in middle school, and my white spots only occur on the calcification marks that my braces left behind. Even to just try the product once, it&#x27;s much cheaper to order here than through a tanning salon - as one pack at my salon is $45! This store also shipped my order very quickly!</li>
            <li> This works great! I used it just once in a tanning bed and I could see the results after just 18 minutes! I&#x27;ve used it two other times, one in the tanning bed and one with the light it comes with and I am very pleased with the results! It&#x27;s agreat product and it&#x27;s cheap too! Definitely well worth the money:)</li>
