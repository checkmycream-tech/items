            <li>color well which is a huge plus as the greys have gotten more aggressive.</li>
            <li>This smells so good and works very well</li>

            <li>.It is easy to lather and rinse and it leaves my hair feeling light with lots of body.</li>
            <li>The scent of this conditioning cleanser is a light fruity mango with a coconut overtone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had great results with Wen, which is a cleansing conditioner that feels like conditioner but can wash your hair and condition it all at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You need to rinse with cool water.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite Wen so far!</li>
            <li>no lol this one works perfect</li>

            <li>-/. Thanks for the fast shipping !!</li>
            <li>I really thought I was going to totally fall in love with wen.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and full of volume.</li>
            <li>It lathers very well</li>
            <li>Very tropical.</li>
            <li>I got this for my Aunt who has very curly hair</li>
            <li>so she needed something that cleanses but also moisturizes very well</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my hair smell &amp; of course, it is a WEN product, so it performs just like I expected.</li>
            <li>If you find it difficult to spread around your hair, add some more water to get it to \\&quot;bloom.\\&quot; Complete and lengthy rinsing is necessary, so a telephone shower nozzle is a great help.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;d love the scent but not sure if its the right product for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Favorite hands down.</li>
            <li>Wen is expensive and I like more bang for my buck:)</li>
            <li>Just wondering if any of you think this scent would be good for long (almost waist length) thick hair?  </li>
            <li>yes it smells fantastic and makes my hair soft , but it also weighs down instead of add volume</li>
            <li>I have used it for several years and have had a positive results.</li>
            <li>love it too bad they discontinued this one, it works the best for my thin blond hair.</li>
            <li>Then I complete the rest of my shower and then rinse it out.</li>
            <li>Last but not least....</li>
            <li>No fly always or static anymore.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of these, and had good and bad results.</li>

            <li> Being someone who has an oily scalp this is NOT a very good product for my hair</li>
            <li> Over all bad  product for people with oily scalps.</li>

            <li> The smell is absolutely amazing!!! It lathers very well but Wen is heavy on my hair. After this I will probably go back to Renpure... I really thought I was going to totally fall in love with wen. It makes my hair to oily :-/. Thanks for the fast shipping !!</li>
            <li> It has changed the feel and strength of my hair. I love it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for it and it was pricey.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Conditions my hair wonderfully</li>
            <li> Excellent cleansing for fine hair. Doesn&#x27;t dry your hair. I have used it for several years and have had a positive results.</li>
            <li> Love Wen. Especially the smell of the mango coconut</li>
            <li> Have been using wen products for about 6 years and will never go back to regular shampoo. My hair has never been so moisturized and happy. No fly always or static anymore. Have gotten most of my friends hooked as well. They have all different hair types but are getting the same great results. Holds color well which is a huge plus as the greys have gotten more aggressive. Recommend to all.l</li>
            <li> WEN PRODUCTS ARE A WIM/WIN!!!</li>
            <li> The scent of this conditioning cleanser is a light fruity mango with a coconut overtone. Very tropical. It makes my hair soft and full of volume. I have fine hair, but a lot of it and it gets dry and static-filled in winter, and rather flat in summer. I don&#x27;t like conditioners as they make my hair greasy sometimes. I&#x27;ve had great results with Wen, which is a cleansing conditioner that feels like conditioner but can wash your hair and condition it all at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each of the different scents is supposed to act differently and that seems odd, but they do. I&#x27;ve tried a number of these, and had good and bad results. The Mango Coconut is one of the better ones for summer. It leaves my hair fluffy and soft and with a lot of volume. By comparison, the Cucumber Aloe, which is supposed to work on oily scalps with dry ends, makes my hair flatter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use seven pumps from a 16oz bottle, for my chin-length, color-treated hair. You mix that small ping-pong ball sized blob with a splash of water and then apply to scalp and ends. I comb mine in with a large-toothed comb --Wen makes a [[ASIN:B00420M64W WEN Cleansing Creme Shower Comb.]] Then I complete the rest of my shower and then rinse it out. You need to rinse with cool water. Otherwise, the conditioner doesn&#x27;t seem to rinse out and your hair gets greasy. That&#x27;s the oddity of this hair product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does NOT suds up at all. If you find it difficult to spread around your hair, add some more water to get it to \\&quot;bloom.\\&quot; Complete and lengthy rinsing is necessary, so a telephone shower nozzle is a great help. If you like tub bathing, your tub can get slippery and you need a Euro-style telephone nozzle in the tub for effective rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a soy-based formula. The regular Wen formulas are wheat-based. If you break out from wheat gluten, this is a great version to try. Of the Wen formulas I&#x27;ve tried (Cucumber, Tea Tree, Pomegranate, Pumpkin and Mango) I like this one almost as much as my favorite Tea Tree.my favorite Tea Tree.</li>
            <li> love it too bad they discontinued this one, it works the best for my thin blond hair.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and love how silky and manageable it makes my hair. It&#x27;s my favorite Wen so far! The Fall Apple Spice is awesome too!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> The wen mango is awesome</li>
            <li> Love love it. Favorite hands down. Love what softness it brings to my hair</li>
            <li> I like the Wen Mango Coconut for several reasons. I like the &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; of the cleanser when I apply it to my hair. It is thicker and a little goes further. Wen is expensive and I like more bang for my buck:) .It is easy to lather and rinse and it leaves my hair feeling light with lots of body. Last but not least....the smell is wonderful..smells like summer and sunshine..I love it.</li>
            <li> Just wondering if any of you think this scent would be good for long (almost waist length) thick hair?  I think I&#x27;d love the scent but not sure if its the right product for my hair.  I also color it as well.  Help</li>
            <li> I have not used it long enough to say if it is good or bad.</li>
            <li> This smells so good and works very well I got this for my Aunt who has very curly hair we are French Creole so she needed something that cleanses but also moisturizes very well and this does both I hope me writing this review helped anyone scared or nervous to try this don&#x27;t be I will also say that I recommend this flavor because I tried the fig and no lol this one works perfect</li>
            <li> Coconut  is  one of  my  favorites. Love it.</li>
            <li> smells great, love what it does to my hair.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase.  Will definitely  order the WEN Mango Coconut again.</li>
            <li> This WEN was very nice. I love the way it makes my hair smell &amp; of course, it is a WEN product, so it performs just like I expected.</li>
            <li> love it! Just wished both came with pumps because two of us were going to split the pack. unable since only one person could have the pump. :o(</li>
            <li> Being someone who has an oily scalp this is NOT a very good product for my hair yes it smells fantastic and makes my hair soft , but it also weighs down instead of add volume and it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;cleanse&amp;#34; my hair I can feel a lot of build up and I rinse my hair for a good three minutes before I exit the shower. Over all bad  product for people with oily scalps.</li>
