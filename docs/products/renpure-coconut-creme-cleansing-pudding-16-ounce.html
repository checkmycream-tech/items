            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Smells great.</li>
            <li>The scent is the great, however.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if Renpure would indicate usage/recommendations/anything to help customers know which version might be best for them.  </li>
            <li>I looked into how I wanted to proceed and decided that cowashing (washing with conditioner instead of shampoo) was a great alternative.</li>
            <li>Smells great, feels great</li>
            <li>My hair is smoother than it&#x27;s been in MONTHS, looks great, smells great.</li>

            <li>This stuff is GREAT</li>
            <li>It smells great however it didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair.</li>
            <li>I love it!!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this!!</li>
            <li>It works just as well as my Wen and it smells AMAZING!</li>
            <li>Switched from Wen and love the savings along with this wonderful product.</li>
            <li>I needed something to really be able to mix into my hair (water mixtures aren&#x27;t great for that!) and soak each strand.</li>
            <li>this cowash....price is great compared to wen and just as good on my hair.</li>
            <li>Works just as good as Wen, smells better and is a fraction of the price!!</li>
            <li>It rinses out easily and leaves my hair smelling wonderful-</li>
            <li>a bottle lasts a while and my girls love it too, my oldest bleaches her hair and anyone knows what kind of hell that does to hair, she started using this and her hair is no longer looking like straw and feels amazing!!!!</li>
            <li>; Renpure is just as good as Wen, and cheaper too.</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t find anything good to say about it.</li>
            <li>Just as good as Wen, but a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.  </li>
            <li>Loved the smell but it does not detangle and I did not like the way it felt in my hair</li>
            <li>This is a good one .</li>
            <li>The price is really good.</li>
            <li>love the way it makes my hair feel and smells great</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Like it much better then WEN!  </li>
            <li>Love this cleansing cream!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more!</li>
            <li>I freaking love my hair on the pudding!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I have wanted to get away from Shampoo/Conditioner and this is the product to be able to do that!</li>
            <li>Its great on my hair and smells super good.</li>
            <li>No greasy feeling and my hair is amazing now.</li>
            <li>this pudding stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>Still cleanses my hair, but I don&#x27;t think it is as effective as WEN.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Renpure products for many years now, the cost is good for the amount of product you get.  </li>
            <li>this one smells like a hazardous chemical processing plant in which a coconut-scented air freshener happens to be hanging.</li>
            <li>This one has kind of a spicey kind of scent to it</li>
            <li>The smell is nice, but once your hair dries it dissipates.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>All in all impressed, been using renpure for about 1.5 months now and my hair feels so much healthier.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d honestly forgotten.</li>
            <li>Great product leaves hair and scalp clean.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it. :D</li>
            <li>This product wasn&#x27;t even very easy to work through my hair and doesn&#x27;t detangle well at all.</li>
            <li>My hair looked and felt beautiful and luxurious after my first use of this product, and each time thereafter.  </li>
            <li>So, I liked the coconut cowash, but I LOVE the pudding version.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try if you are looking for something cheaper, but this is a great example of &amp;</li>
            <li>This has been the best alternative to Wen that I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>For the right hair type, I think this shampoo would be great.</li>
            <li>Excellent for very curly hair, keeps the curls smooth and moisturized</li>
            <li>From an inexpensive, truly hair-friendly product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paraben free, sulfate, chloride and dye free, this &amp;#34;cleansing pudding&amp;#34; is a great option for shampoos and/or conditioners.</li>
            <li>I Love these products.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Tried it, I did, and I am more than pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>When you purchase something that is called &amp;#34;Coconut&amp;#34; bla bla bla, and Coconut is prominently displayed on the label, wouldn&#x27;t you think it would SMELL like coconut?  </li>
            <li>Still need to use conditioner after the co-wash, so make sure you purchase that as well.</li>
            <li>Love the price.  </li>
            <li>Lovely scent.</li>
            <li>Love this non-shampoo.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It also says it&#x27;s gluten free!</li>
            <li>I love the smell of coconut</li>
            <li>It is OK</li>
            <li>This was just ok.</li>
            <li>Soft coconut scent and incredible softness.</li>
            <li>I purchase this for my grand daughter.</li>
            <li>Renpure has been able to pick up the slack.</li>
            <li>I probably used more than my thinner hair needs.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use as many pumps as bottle</li>
            <li>Smells absolutely fabulous!</li>
            <li>I used this with the wen instructions and love it.</li>
            <li>Renpure Pudding smells more like coconut &amp; is thicker than the Renpure conditioning cleanser.</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>I love Wen and have used it for awhile.</li>
            <li>Love Renpure products.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s more of a chemical coconut smell that you find in tanning lotions.</li>
            <li>I think my hair is more tangled after I get out of the shower than when I got in.</li>
            <li>It says Fragrance derived, not quite sure what that means, but I was looking for something with no fragrance.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks and feels better</li>
            <li>Both versions smell identically, and while I like the smell, I don&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li>Does all it claims and more.</li>
            <li>Also, safe on color, and I like that is</li>
            <li>I like the way the pomegranate smells better, but this seems to condition more.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you rinse it longer than you think you will need.</li>
            <li>Smells much better than the pomegranate-scented version.</li>
            <li>After getting dizzy on a nightmare customer service ordeal with WEN, I tried this product and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t expect to have to use that many pumps</li>
            <li>we both just LOVE this and will buy more thank you</li>
            <li>Have used Wen for many years and thought I would try to save some money.</li>
            <li>The pros are, it leaves my hair in better condition than most cleansing conditioners.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is labeled Coconut, but to me it smells more like Play-Doh.</li>
            <li>Love the coconut sent.</li>
            <li>I read about co-washing on a Health &amp; Beauty blog that listed Renpure Coconut Creme Cleansing Pudding as one of the top products to try.</li>
            <li>- I can&#x27;t believe how healthy it&#x27;s condition with this product.</li>
            <li>I have fine, curly hair that frizzes very easily, but I also have a lot of hair....</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair feeling clean and soft and smelling awesome!</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>Also, to be honest, I also just missed the thoroughly clean feeling you get from drenching your hair in cleansing product and rinsing it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells like coconut cake or fru fru sweet coconut of some kind.</li>
            <li>Wen is more like a dense conditioner consistency with better distribution and slippage to really clean well.</li>
            <li>I love how smooth and shiny my hair is.  </li>
            <li>The scent is light and refreshing; cleansing and relaxing.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair easy to comb?</li>
            <li>and the Cowash has a very mild, clean scent, which I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed if you shake these products up before pumping them out, they do seem a bit thicker, as most of them are almost as runny as water.</li>
            <li>I avoid oily or moisturizing hair products because with my hair type, it is easy for my hair to become greasy and stringy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overpowering, but it is strong and stays strong through the day.  </li>
            <li>Wow, this product is amazing!  </li>
            <li>(I know it takes a good amount of product to properly clean, you need to really work it in, etc.).</li>
            <li>Smells great hair soft and clean</li>
            <li>For my fine curly hair, this didn&#x27;t do well.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair use a comb and comb through my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the positive change this is having on my my hair, scalp, and daily routine.</li>
            <li>I switched from Wen for a more economical choice.</li>
            <li>That broduct is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I always thought I over-conditioned, but I guess the conditioners just weren&#x27;t as effective, or the shampoos caused too much damage for the conditioner to make up for.  </li>
            <li>I can FEEL how silky smooth my hair is.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>of course it was fantastic for my hair ..</li>
            <li>Never used a cleansing conditioner before, and I enjoy it.</li>
            <li>So much more reasonably priced and I think it works better than WEN.  </li>
            <li>It feels good, looks healthy and seemed to bring a lot of life back to my hair!</li>
            <li>Leave hair clean and smelling good days later. :)</li>
            <li>This product leaves my hair healthier and more moisturized than shampoo and condition combos ever have, and I&#x27;ve used many kinds including high end.  </li>
            <li>If you have fine hair like me, you can definitely use a cowash and, in my case, the heavier, more moisturizing version worked better and gave me more body.  </li>
            <li>I actually air-dry, or blow-dry just the top of my hair, and it looks great, from soft waves to a sexy bedroom/beachy look.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps it&#x27;s not made for my hair type, which is super fine.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m excited.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited.</li>
            <li>I was brushing it for FUN people!</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t have a smell to it, more like a light scent.</li>
            <li>My hair and scalp feel clean using this</li>
            <li>hair seems clean when done  cleansing with this...would buy again.</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t need any additional product and my hair stays clean, non-greasy and full of volume for days after co-washing.</li>
            <li>always wanted to share hair products specially for mix girls so that you know</li>
            <li>To him it is cloying and too sweet.</li>
            <li>I really like Wen, and I love the pantene cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not a bad smell, it&#x27;s just not my smell.</li>
            <li>not a bad aroma, but not something I like</li>
            <li>Not bad....</li>
            <li>Plus it gets greasy pretty easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just discovering cowashes (cleansing conditioners) and because of them I am finally able to wear my fine, wavy hair as just that - soft waves and curls.  </li>
            <li>All these factors form the perfect storm for serious tangling.</li>
            <li>Oh, and one last thing, the best compliment I can give this conditioning cleanser is that after using it for a week my friends and co workers were asking me what I was doing differently with my hair.</li>
            <li>The product is decent, but not my favorite co-wash.  </li>
            <li>Luckily I ordered this product before I noticed that it was listed as &amp;#34;multicultural&amp;#34; on the Renpure website.</li>
            <li>I have previously used WEN and it&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li>So much that I feel like my hair is easily separated, thus puffy.</li>
            <li>My hair seemed like totally different, better hair!  </li>
            <li>I followed the instructions on the bottle and used the indicated amount, but maybe that&#x27;s just too much for fine hair.</li>
            <li>When I visited Florida last Month I had a shampoo emergency and came across the #renpure line I always heard about washing your hair without shampoo and never thought it will be so amazing .</li>
            <li>Much more affordable plus has a lot of natural products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been almost three months and my curly hair is healthy soft, and manageable.</li>
            <li>Constantly getting compliments on how nice my hair looks and smells.</li>
            <li>So soft and helps detangle, not so many tears.</li>
            <li>My thought is that perhaps my hair needed far more moisture than the WEN was supplying and</li>
            <li>Thought for 1/3 price it would be worth shot.</li>
            <li>and they spent a good hour doing that brush/hair-dry thing they do</li>
            <li>It just kind of feels like your rubbing something into your hair, but not that much different than rubbing water into your hair..</li>
            <li>I really like this better than WEN, and so much cheaper too</li>
            <li>and I fell in love with it, its just as good as wen if not better and will not return to anything else!</li>
            <li>This is so much better than the other coconut cleaning conditioner they make, smells much better.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this after reading other reviews saying that it was as good as WEN.</li>
            <li>I would have been pissed if I had to re-wash my hair right out of the shower because it was greasy.</li>
            <li>I bought the coconut creme cleansing pudding and noticed results right away.  </li>
            <li>I also stopped getting super sweaty/oily/gross hair after working out, sleeping -- even walking my dog used to pretty much sabotage my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I very much wish I had purchased 4 bottles of pantene instead of wasting 20</li>
            <li>Product is very gentle on my color treated hair.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and was worried about having flat hair with this type product.  </li>
            <li>I have fine color treated hair with natural wave and curl.</li>
            <li>With Renpure products, including the Coconut Creme Pudding, it is best to leave your hair very wet and very straight as you work the product through with a wide toothed comb.</li>
            <li>If you have really thick, course hair and want something to make it very silky and fine feeling, then this shampoo would be good for you.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using WEN since Chaz Dean first appeared on QVC selling it.  </li>
            <li>(I used it the second time as I wasn&#x27;t 100% sure it was this product because I used another condtioner afterwards that I hadn&#x27;t used before.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I have been looking for.  </li>
            <li>The HairOne cleansing conditioner is a similar product but seems to do a better job on my hair.</li>
            <li>says when u first try it.</li>
            <li>Really beyond my expectations!</li>
            <li>when you realize, as you&#x27;re first seeing, or tasting, or experiencing something, that you can&#x27;t wait to tell everyone you know about what</li>
            <li>Trying many co washes recently.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t have even given it one star except that it works ok to remove the chlorine from my hair daily.</li>
            <li>The best part, however, is the end result of using this, and is obvious after just one use- my hair is soft, no frizz, and not at all greasy or weighed down.</li>
            <li>One thing I learned using WEN was to rinse my hair VERY WELL and then pour a teaspoon of organic apple cider vinegar over  my hair at the end of the overall rinse and then rinse it a bit more.  </li>
            <li>Nice smelling cleansing shampoo but careful to not use too much like wen because will build up ..</li>
            <li>My hair feels like I just deep conditioned it and my hair feels super clean</li>
            <li>hair dries quicker than it has been since starting no-poo -- it&#x27;s clean!</li>
            <li>I have mostly positive things to say about the aroma.  </li>
            <li>After my first use my hair was so much softer than it is with WEN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time today and thanks to the reviews here</li>
            <li>It smells a bit like real fresh coconut mixed with drugstore fragrance base...or something to that effect.  </li>
            <li>Really like how it makes my hair soft &amp; full.</li>
            <li>so I decide to dry it a bit more and brush it</li>
            <li>Previous to this, I never was great at coaxing curl that looked good and wore my 2a/2b hair straight, dealing sort of poorly with the consequences if high humidity hit.  </li>
            <li>Yet it looked fine textured, not coarse or coated!</li>
            <li>Fast forward to three weeks ago.  </li>
            <li>Much lighter.  </li>
            <li>I really prefer this to WEN for both price and results.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t really coconut, but it&#x27;s not offensive.</li>
            <li>I do not use very often</li>
            <li>will say there&#x27;s not as much &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; to the product when you&#x27;re in the shower and using it</li>
            <li>I concur the consistency is very lthin and not at all like Wen.</li>
            <li>The cost is too much</li>
            <li>Very water and doesn&#x27;t conditions at all.</li>
            <li>(I do not know how people can skip washes, but I think they have a whole technique to it that I am not privy to).  </li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to this because I wanted coconut scent in a cleansing conditioner, even though it is twice the price of the pantene.</li>
            <li>The product was very runny.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>Have to really focus to not spill it out of my hands.</li>
            <li>, seems promising.</li>
            <li>I used a wide tooth comb in the shower to make sure it was evenly distributed and rinsed for 1-2 minutes.</li>
            <li>This one does not smell anything like coconut, though, which really disappoints me, but the Cowash really doesn&#x27;t either...</li>
            <li>(that I don&#x27;t really like)</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t really do that..</li>
            <li>It us very runny</li>
            <li>and I have to use twice as much.</li>
            <li>I think the price is extremely reasonable for what you get</li>
            <li>We really do get what we pay for and this product is not comparable to Wen.</li>
            <li>I knew to use more than the recommended amount of pumps (4 or 5 per section of scalp and then LOTS more as I worked my way down since my hair is long; about waist length).</li>
            <li>Gently cleanses your hair without stripping it; rinses cleanly and clear, leaving hair in soft, manageable condition.  </li>
            <li>I am beyond pleased, and will try other Renpure products based on my experience with it.</li>
            <li>They clean and condition the same.</li>
            <li>Not sure if that is true, but I love the way this makes my hair feel silky and its soft scent.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, mostly straight, long hair (I&#x27;m white as all hell)</li>
            <li>It is a little runny and you need a good bit to actually get it all through your hair.</li>
            <li>I read many reviews and just like everything you have good and bad.</li>
            <li>After about a week and a half using this product there is more &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; while in the shower.</li>
            <li>The more I used it (various different day)</li>
            <li>A little while later my hair is feeling pretty nice</li>
            <li>a bit or product runs out of the squirt top, making a mess of my shower shelf and also wasting product.</li>
            <li>I was over the high price and having to be on a shipment plan with WEN.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this instead of Wen.</li>
            <li>and I find the smell a little overwhelming, but not the case here.</li>
            <li>So soft and so much stronger than what it was.</li>
            <li>my hair is naturally curly and this along with the leave in conditioner gave it so much body.  </li>
            <li>I lost so much hair from the coconut cream conditioner AND coconut milk shampoo that I saw an Endocrinologist thinking I had developed a hormonal problem.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and manageable, and I have some very think curly hair.</li>
            <li>I will re-try this once things return to normal.</li>
            <li>I like this product better, but I&#x27;ll make a few comparisons here.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll buy any more of the Renpure, though, because I really don&#x27;t like how runny the products are (or the smell of this one)</li>
            <li>my doctor said that it was my hair product line because all my tests were normal.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really hard on my hair --</li>
            <li>Bought this because I love the smell of coconut &amp; wanted a thick creamy product that would leave long hair conditioned and easy to comb.&lt;br /&gt;Smells like coconut?</li>
            <li>My hair was adjusting pretty well to the new routine -- it rarely looked oily, and especially with some extensive brushing in the evenings to help redistribute oils, etc.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try something new and found this.  </li>
            <li>I am new to the cleansing conditioners and I have never used the Wen products, but I like this line.  </li>
            <li>I personally have never tried Wen but have always been interested in doing so.</li>
            <li>So far I like it !  </li>
            <li>me personally Wen is thick and great for what my hair needs, but I personally know people that this product works for.</li>
            <li>but so far I&#x27;m HOOOKED!</li>
            <li>and, WOW!</li>
            <li>It comes no where near WEN!</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair so soft and lively.  </li>
            <li>One has super thick curly hair where you can barely brush it and the other has super fine curly hair.</li>
            <li>I had used wen previously and i will say i loved it, but my gosh the price is way too much, and just couldn&#x27;t afford it had gone back to the normal everyday shampoo and conditioners, and one day came across Renpure at Target $7.00 at the one by my house and decided why the heck</li>
            <li>My hair wasn&#x27;t weighed down and felt clean and hydrated -</li>
            <li>This smells great and left my hair feeling very silky, but since my hair is already so thin and fine, extra silkiness makes it hard to manage.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, over the last two years I&#x27;ve really wondered if WEN changed the formulation.  </li>
            <li>I also use it on my 3 year old son&#x27;s hair- makes our hair so soft.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>This one is much thinner consistency and does not give my hair the same silky result as the Wen product.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and WEN</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t keep my hands out of my hair, I was that amazed with how soft it was.</li>
            <li>No matter how much I conditioned/leave-in conditioned/sealed my hair, it always felt like straw when I got back inside from the arctic outdoors.</li>
            <li>it makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>Very oily and leaves a lot of greasiness on the hair especially after repeated use.</li>
            <li>In actuality, the pudding is much thicker and works differently because of that.  </li>
            <li>My hair has never been so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>However, my hair has been damaged looking lately, and I thought the Coconut Creme Pudding would be ok to help repair it on the weekends.</li>
            <li>My hair was so soft...</li>
            <li>I have *extremely* sensitive skin, as a rule I wouldn&#x27;t even attempt a shave on vacation.   </li>
            <li>This might work better for thinner hair (mine is thick and curly).</li>
            <li>It is not as thick as WEN, so I find myself needed to use more of this product.  </li>
            <li>Over the last two years, I found that only one WEN shampoo worked well consistently, and since it&#x27;s a discontinued Fall scent, I won&#x27;t say which one.  </li>
            <li>Those 10/11 pumps that I opted to used are probably a lot for my length and texture -- I wanted to be able to completely saturate every inch, with a little extra left over.</li>
            <li>The rest of the time, I just wet it down in the shower and use the leave in conditioner from Renpure (which I also love).  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;s 4 and has very curly, long hair.</li>
            <li>I have been &amp;#34;cowashing&amp;#34; for several years now, but I normally use WEN.  </li>
            <li>as well - but, preference and price - RenPure Coconut Creme Cleansing Pudding wins hands down.</li>
            <li>I have color-treated, medium length, wavy hair that tend to be dry and frizzes easily- much to my dismay.</li>
            <li>Although I do not use for every wash, I feel as if there is too much build up, so I use regular shampoo in between (every 3-4 washes) then use the cleansing conditioner as a replacement to conditioner, and back to just cleansing again.</li>
            <li>Smell is extremely too much!</li>
            <li>BUT - and this is a major sticking point</li>
            <li>you can barely contain it in your hand while getting it to your head of hair!  </li>
            <li>This error leads to major tangling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using cleansing conditioner regularly for over a year now and have tried several different brands, so I&#x27;m aware of how to properly use them</li>
            <li>It even takes several washes with a sudsing shampoo to completely remove it</li>
            <li>/&gt;About two months ago, I cut traditional shampoo out of my routine completely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used about 10 or 11 pumps to TOTALLY soak my shoulder length, straight hair - the bottle recommends 8-10, which sounds like a lot, but they&#x27;re pretty small pumps.</li>
            <li>First, it does the same on my hair as that other product.</li>
            <li>I used this product for a week now, the first couple times it left my hair soft, and a little greasy.</li>
            <li>I used a ton of product, left it in my hair an extra long time and rinsed very thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Here are my only issues overall, which I&#x27;d like to direct to the Renpure company:  </li>
            <li>I have no dry ends.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for so long, I buy the gallon-size from QVC early ever summer.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m loving my hair which is saying a lot because earlier in the day I&#x27;d considered chopping it all off because it was feeling very broken, dry and damaged.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t dry hair or strip natural oils from your hair.  </li>
            <li>This one is slightly thicker, but not by much.</li>
            <li>I let my hair dry naturally, and its straight/wavy texture made it look tousled, like I had a deliberately deconstructed</li>
            <li>The texture is fine, but my hair is very thick.</li>
            <li>I have wavy thin fine hair..</li>
            <li>Other cleansing conditioners are really thick, making it easy to get from your hand to your head, and they also create a creamy feel when cleansing the hair..</li>
            <li>but his sniffer is super sensitive of late due to medications he is on.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Smells great.</li>
            <li> The scent is the great, however.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if Renpure would indicate usage/recommendations/anything to help customers know which version might be best for them.  </li>
            <li> I looked into how I wanted to proceed and decided that cowashing (washing with conditioner instead of shampoo) was a great alternative.</li>

            <li> My hair is smoother than it&#x27;s been in MONTHS, looks great, smells great.</li>

            <li> I am so glad I found this!!</li>
            <li> It works just as well as my Wen and it smells AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Switched from Wen and love the savings along with this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I needed something to really be able to mix into my hair (water mixtures aren&#x27;t great for that!) and soak each strand.</li>
            <li> this cowash....price is great compared to wen and just as good on my hair.</li>
            <li> Works just as good as Wen, smells better and is a fraction of the price!!</li>
            <li> It rinses out easily and leaves my hair smelling wonderful-</li>
            <li> a bottle lasts a while and my girls love it too, my oldest bleaches her hair and anyone knows what kind of hell that does to hair, she started using this and her hair is no longer looking like straw and feels amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> ; Renpure is just as good as Wen, and cheaper too.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t find anything good to say about it.</li>
            <li> Just as good as Wen, but a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  </li>
            <li> Loved the smell but it does not detangle and I did not like the way it felt in my hair</li>
            <li> This is a good one .</li>
            <li> The price is really good.</li>
            <li> love the way it makes my hair feel and smells great</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Like it much better then WEN!  </li>
            <li> Love this cleansing cream!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more!</li>
            <li> I freaking love my hair on the pudding!  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I have wanted to get away from Shampoo/Conditioner and this is the product to be able to do that!</li>
            <li> Its great on my hair and smells super good.</li>
            <li> No greasy feeling and my hair is amazing now.</li>
            <li> this pudding stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> Still cleanses my hair, but I don&#x27;t think it is as effective as WEN.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Renpure products for many years now, the cost is good for the amount of product you get.  </li>
            <li> this one smells like a hazardous chemical processing plant in which a coconut-scented air freshener happens to be hanging.</li>
            <li> This one has kind of a spicey kind of scent to it</li>
            <li> The smell is nice, but once your hair dries it dissipates.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> All in all impressed, been using renpure for about 1.5 months now and my hair feels so much healthier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d honestly forgotten.</li>
            <li> Great product leaves hair and scalp clean.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it. :D</li>
            <li> This product wasn&#x27;t even very easy to work through my hair and doesn&#x27;t detangle well at all.</li>
            <li> My hair looked and felt beautiful and luxurious after my first use of this product, and each time thereafter.  </li>
            <li> So, I liked the coconut cowash, but I LOVE the pudding version.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try if you are looking for something cheaper, but this is a great example of &amp;</li>
            <li> This has been the best alternative to Wen that I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> For the right hair type, I think this shampoo would be great.</li>
            <li> Excellent for very curly hair, keeps the curls smooth and moisturized</li>
            <li> From an inexpensive, truly hair-friendly product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paraben free, sulfate, chloride and dye free, this &amp;#34;cleansing pudding&amp;#34; is a great option for shampoos and/or conditioners.</li>
            <li> I Love these products.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Tried it, I did, and I am more than pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> When you purchase something that is called &amp;#34;Coconut&amp;#34; bla bla bla, and Coconut is prominently displayed on the label, wouldn&#x27;t you think it would SMELL like coconut?  </li>
            <li> Still need to use conditioner after the co-wash, so make sure you purchase that as well.</li>
            <li> Love the price.  </li>
            <li> Lovely scent.</li>
            <li> Love this non-shampoo.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It also says it&#x27;s gluten free!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of coconut</li>
            <li> It is OK</li>
            <li> This was just ok.</li>
            <li> Soft coconut scent and incredible softness.</li>
            <li> I purchase this for my grand daughter.</li>
            <li> Renpure has been able to pick up the slack.</li>
            <li> I probably used more than my thinner hair needs.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use as many pumps as bottle</li>
            <li> Smells absolutely fabulous!</li>
            <li> I used this with the wen instructions and love it.</li>
            <li> Renpure Pudding smells more like coconut &amp; is thicker than the Renpure conditioning cleanser.</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> I love Wen and have used it for awhile.</li>
            <li> Love Renpure products.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s more of a chemical coconut smell that you find in tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> I think my hair is more tangled after I get out of the shower than when I got in.</li>
            <li> It says Fragrance derived, not quite sure what that means, but I was looking for something with no fragrance.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks and feels better</li>
            <li> Both versions smell identically, and while I like the smell, I don&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li> Does all it claims and more.</li>
            <li> Also, safe on color, and I like that is</li>
            <li> I like the way the pomegranate smells better, but this seems to condition more.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you rinse it longer than you think you will need.</li>
            <li> Smells much better than the pomegranate-scented version.</li>
            <li> After getting dizzy on a nightmare customer service ordeal with WEN, I tried this product and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t expect to have to use that many pumps</li>
            <li> we both just LOVE this and will buy more thank you</li>
            <li> Have used Wen for many years and thought I would try to save some money.</li>
            <li> The pros are, it leaves my hair in better condition than most cleansing conditioners.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is labeled Coconut, but to me it smells more like Play-Doh.</li>
            <li> Love the coconut sent.</li>
            <li> I read about co-washing on a Health &amp; Beauty blog that listed Renpure Coconut Creme Cleansing Pudding as one of the top products to try.</li>
            <li> - I can&#x27;t believe how healthy it&#x27;s condition with this product.</li>
            <li> I have fine, curly hair that frizzes very easily, but I also have a lot of hair....</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling clean and soft and smelling awesome!</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> Also, to be honest, I also just missed the thoroughly clean feeling you get from drenching your hair in cleansing product and rinsing it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells like coconut cake or fru fru sweet coconut of some kind.</li>
            <li> Wen is more like a dense conditioner consistency with better distribution and slippage to really clean well.</li>
            <li> I love how smooth and shiny my hair is.  </li>
            <li> The scent is light and refreshing; cleansing and relaxing.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair easy to comb?</li>
            <li> and the Cowash has a very mild, clean scent, which I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed if you shake these products up before pumping them out, they do seem a bit thicker, as most of them are almost as runny as water.</li>
            <li> I avoid oily or moisturizing hair products because with my hair type, it is easy for my hair to become greasy and stringy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overpowering, but it is strong and stays strong through the day.  </li>
            <li> Wow, this product is amazing!  </li>
            <li> (I know it takes a good amount of product to properly clean, you need to really work it in, etc.).</li>
            <li> Smells great hair soft and clean</li>
            <li> For my fine curly hair, this didn&#x27;t do well.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair use a comb and comb through my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the positive change this is having on my my hair, scalp, and daily routine.</li>
            <li> I switched from Wen for a more economical choice.</li>
            <li> That broduct is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I always thought I over-conditioned, but I guess the conditioners just weren&#x27;t as effective, or the shampoos caused too much damage for the conditioner to make up for.  </li>
            <li> I can FEEL how silky smooth my hair is.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> of course it was fantastic for my hair ..</li>
            <li> Never used a cleansing conditioner before, and I enjoy it.</li>
            <li> So much more reasonably priced and I think it works better than WEN.  </li>
            <li> It feels good, looks healthy and seemed to bring a lot of life back to my hair!</li>
            <li> Leave hair clean and smelling good days later. :)</li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair healthier and more moisturized than shampoo and condition combos ever have, and I&#x27;ve used many kinds including high end.  </li>
            <li> If you have fine hair like me, you can definitely use a cowash and, in my case, the heavier, more moisturizing version worked better and gave me more body.  </li>
            <li> I actually air-dry, or blow-dry just the top of my hair, and it looks great, from soft waves to a sexy bedroom/beachy look.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s not made for my hair type, which is super fine.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m excited.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited.</li>
            <li> I was brushing it for FUN people!</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t have a smell to it, more like a light scent.</li>
            <li> My hair and scalp feel clean using this</li>
            <li> hair seems clean when done  cleansing with this...would buy again.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t need any additional product and my hair stays clean, non-greasy and full of volume for days after co-washing.</li>
            <li> always wanted to share hair products specially for mix girls so that you know</li>
            <li> To him it is cloying and too sweet.</li>
            <li> I really like Wen, and I love the pantene cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not a bad smell, it&#x27;s just not my smell.</li>
            <li> not a bad aroma, but not something I like</li>
            <li> Not bad....</li>
            <li> Plus it gets greasy pretty easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just discovering cowashes (cleansing conditioners) and because of them I am finally able to wear my fine, wavy hair as just that - soft waves and curls.  </li>
            <li> All these factors form the perfect storm for serious tangling.</li>
            <li> Oh, and one last thing, the best compliment I can give this conditioning cleanser is that after using it for a week my friends and co workers were asking me what I was doing differently with my hair.</li>
            <li> The product is decent, but not my favorite co-wash.  </li>
            <li> Luckily I ordered this product before I noticed that it was listed as &amp;#34;multicultural&amp;#34; on the Renpure website.</li>
            <li> I have previously used WEN and it&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li> So much that I feel like my hair is easily separated, thus puffy.</li>
            <li> My hair seemed like totally different, better hair!  </li>
            <li> I followed the instructions on the bottle and used the indicated amount, but maybe that&#x27;s just too much for fine hair.</li>
            <li> When I visited Florida last Month I had a shampoo emergency and came across the #renpure line I always heard about washing your hair without shampoo and never thought it will be so amazing .</li>
            <li> Much more affordable plus has a lot of natural products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been almost three months and my curly hair is healthy soft, and manageable.</li>
            <li> Constantly getting compliments on how nice my hair looks and smells.</li>
            <li> So soft and helps detangle, not so many tears.</li>
            <li> My thought is that perhaps my hair needed far more moisture than the WEN was supplying and</li>
            <li> Thought for 1/3 price it would be worth shot.</li>
            <li> and they spent a good hour doing that brush/hair-dry thing they do</li>
            <li> It just kind of feels like your rubbing something into your hair, but not that much different than rubbing water into your hair..</li>
            <li> I really like this better than WEN, and so much cheaper too</li>
            <li> and I fell in love with it, its just as good as wen if not better and will not return to anything else!</li>
            <li> This is so much better than the other coconut cleaning conditioner they make, smells much better.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this after reading other reviews saying that it was as good as WEN.</li>
            <li> I would have been pissed if I had to re-wash my hair right out of the shower because it was greasy.</li>
            <li> I bought the coconut creme cleansing pudding and noticed results right away.  </li>
            <li> I also stopped getting super sweaty/oily/gross hair after working out, sleeping -- even walking my dog used to pretty much sabotage my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I very much wish I had purchased 4 bottles of pantene instead of wasting 20</li>
            <li> Product is very gentle on my color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and was worried about having flat hair with this type product.  </li>
            <li> I have fine color treated hair with natural wave and curl.</li>
            <li> With Renpure products, including the Coconut Creme Pudding, it is best to leave your hair very wet and very straight as you work the product through with a wide toothed comb.</li>
            <li> If you have really thick, course hair and want something to make it very silky and fine feeling, then this shampoo would be good for you.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using WEN since Chaz Dean first appeared on QVC selling it.  </li>
            <li> (I used it the second time as I wasn&#x27;t 100% sure it was this product because I used another condtioner afterwards that I hadn&#x27;t used before.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I have been looking for.  </li>
            <li> The HairOne cleansing conditioner is a similar product but seems to do a better job on my hair.</li>
            <li> says when u first try it.</li>
            <li> Really beyond my expectations!</li>
            <li> when you realize, as you&#x27;re first seeing, or tasting, or experiencing something, that you can&#x27;t wait to tell everyone you know about what</li>
            <li> Trying many co washes recently.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have even given it one star except that it works ok to remove the chlorine from my hair daily.</li>
            <li> The best part, however, is the end result of using this, and is obvious after just one use- my hair is soft, no frizz, and not at all greasy or weighed down.</li>
            <li> One thing I learned using WEN was to rinse my hair VERY WELL and then pour a teaspoon of organic apple cider vinegar over  my hair at the end of the overall rinse and then rinse it a bit more.  </li>
            <li> Nice smelling cleansing shampoo but careful to not use too much like wen because will build up ..</li>
            <li> My hair feels like I just deep conditioned it and my hair feels super clean</li>
            <li> hair dries quicker than it has been since starting no-poo -- it&#x27;s clean!</li>
            <li> I have mostly positive things to say about the aroma.  </li>
            <li> After my first use my hair was so much softer than it is with WEN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time today and thanks to the reviews here</li>
            <li> It smells a bit like real fresh coconut mixed with drugstore fragrance base...or something to that effect.  </li>
            <li> Really like how it makes my hair soft &amp; full.</li>
            <li> so I decide to dry it a bit more and brush it</li>
            <li> Previous to this, I never was great at coaxing curl that looked good and wore my 2a/2b hair straight, dealing sort of poorly with the consequences if high humidity hit.  </li>
            <li> Yet it looked fine textured, not coarse or coated!</li>
            <li> Fast forward to three weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> Much lighter.  </li>
            <li> I really prefer this to WEN for both price and results.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t really coconut, but it&#x27;s not offensive.</li>
            <li> I do not use very often</li>
            <li> will say there&#x27;s not as much &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; to the product when you&#x27;re in the shower and using it</li>
            <li> I concur the consistency is very lthin and not at all like Wen.</li>
            <li> The cost is too much</li>
            <li> Very water and doesn&#x27;t conditions at all.</li>
            <li> (I do not know how people can skip washes, but I think they have a whole technique to it that I am not privy to).  </li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to this because I wanted coconut scent in a cleansing conditioner, even though it is twice the price of the pantene.</li>
            <li> The product was very runny.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> Have to really focus to not spill it out of my hands.</li>
            <li> , seems promising.</li>
            <li> I used a wide tooth comb in the shower to make sure it was evenly distributed and rinsed for 1-2 minutes.</li>
            <li> This one does not smell anything like coconut, though, which really disappoints me, but the Cowash really doesn&#x27;t either...</li>
            <li> (that I don&#x27;t really like)</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t really do that..</li>
            <li> It us very runny</li>
            <li> and I have to use twice as much.</li>
            <li> I think the price is extremely reasonable for what you get</li>
            <li> We really do get what we pay for and this product is not comparable to Wen.</li>
            <li> I knew to use more than the recommended amount of pumps (4 or 5 per section of scalp and then LOTS more as I worked my way down since my hair is long; about waist length).</li>
            <li> Gently cleanses your hair without stripping it; rinses cleanly and clear, leaving hair in soft, manageable condition.  </li>
            <li> I am beyond pleased, and will try other Renpure products based on my experience with it.</li>
            <li> They clean and condition the same.</li>
            <li> Not sure if that is true, but I love the way this makes my hair feel silky and its soft scent.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, mostly straight, long hair (I&#x27;m white as all hell)</li>
            <li> It is a little runny and you need a good bit to actually get it all through your hair.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews and just like everything you have good and bad.</li>
            <li> After about a week and a half using this product there is more &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; while in the shower.</li>
            <li> The more I used it (various different day)</li>
            <li> A little while later my hair is feeling pretty nice</li>
            <li> a bit or product runs out of the squirt top, making a mess of my shower shelf and also wasting product.</li>
            <li> I was over the high price and having to be on a shipment plan with WEN.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this instead of Wen.</li>
            <li> and I find the smell a little overwhelming, but not the case here.</li>
            <li> So soft and so much stronger than what it was.</li>
            <li> my hair is naturally curly and this along with the leave in conditioner gave it so much body.  </li>
            <li> I lost so much hair from the coconut cream conditioner AND coconut milk shampoo that I saw an Endocrinologist thinking I had developed a hormonal problem.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and manageable, and I have some very think curly hair.</li>
            <li> I will re-try this once things return to normal.</li>
            <li> I like this product better, but I&#x27;ll make a few comparisons here.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll buy any more of the Renpure, though, because I really don&#x27;t like how runny the products are (or the smell of this one)</li>
            <li> my doctor said that it was my hair product line because all my tests were normal.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really hard on my hair --</li>
            <li> Bought this because I love the smell of coconut &amp; wanted a thick creamy product that would leave long hair conditioned and easy to comb.&lt;br /&gt;Smells like coconut?</li>
            <li> My hair was adjusting pretty well to the new routine -- it rarely looked oily, and especially with some extensive brushing in the evenings to help redistribute oils, etc.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something new and found this.  </li>
            <li> I am new to the cleansing conditioners and I have never used the Wen products, but I like this line.  </li>
            <li> I personally have never tried Wen but have always been interested in doing so.</li>
            <li> So far I like it !  </li>
            <li> me personally Wen is thick and great for what my hair needs, but I personally know people that this product works for.</li>
            <li> but so far I&#x27;m HOOOKED!</li>
            <li> and, WOW!</li>
            <li> It comes no where near WEN!</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair so soft and lively.  </li>
            <li> One has super thick curly hair where you can barely brush it and the other has super fine curly hair.</li>
            <li> I had used wen previously and i will say i loved it, but my gosh the price is way too much, and just couldn&#x27;t afford it had gone back to the normal everyday shampoo and conditioners, and one day came across Renpure at Target $7.00 at the one by my house and decided why the heck</li>
            <li> My hair wasn&#x27;t weighed down and felt clean and hydrated -</li>
            <li> This smells great and left my hair feeling very silky, but since my hair is already so thin and fine, extra silkiness makes it hard to manage.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, over the last two years I&#x27;ve really wondered if WEN changed the formulation.  </li>
            <li> I also use it on my 3 year old son&#x27;s hair- makes our hair so soft.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> This one is much thinner consistency and does not give my hair the same silky result as the Wen product.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and WEN</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t keep my hands out of my hair, I was that amazed with how soft it was.</li>
            <li> No matter how much I conditioned/leave-in conditioned/sealed my hair, it always felt like straw when I got back inside from the arctic outdoors.</li>
            <li> it makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> Very oily and leaves a lot of greasiness on the hair especially after repeated use.</li>
            <li> In actuality, the pudding is much thicker and works differently because of that.  </li>
            <li> My hair has never been so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> However, my hair has been damaged looking lately, and I thought the Coconut Creme Pudding would be ok to help repair it on the weekends.</li>
            <li> My hair was so soft...</li>
            <li> I have *extremely* sensitive skin, as a rule I wouldn&#x27;t even attempt a shave on vacation.   </li>
            <li> This might work better for thinner hair (mine is thick and curly).</li>
            <li> It is not as thick as WEN, so I find myself needed to use more of this product.  </li>
            <li> Over the last two years, I found that only one WEN shampoo worked well consistently, and since it&#x27;s a discontinued Fall scent, I won&#x27;t say which one.  </li>
            <li> Those 10/11 pumps that I opted to used are probably a lot for my length and texture -- I wanted to be able to completely saturate every inch, with a little extra left over.</li>
            <li> The rest of the time, I just wet it down in the shower and use the leave in conditioner from Renpure (which I also love).  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s 4 and has very curly, long hair.</li>
            <li> I have been &amp;#34;cowashing&amp;#34; for several years now, but I normally use WEN.  </li>
            <li> as well - but, preference and price - RenPure Coconut Creme Cleansing Pudding wins hands down.</li>
            <li> I have color-treated, medium length, wavy hair that tend to be dry and frizzes easily- much to my dismay.</li>
            <li> Although I do not use for every wash, I feel as if there is too much build up, so I use regular shampoo in between (every 3-4 washes) then use the cleansing conditioner as a replacement to conditioner, and back to just cleansing again.</li>
            <li> Smell is extremely too much!</li>
            <li> BUT - and this is a major sticking point</li>
            <li> you can barely contain it in your hand while getting it to your head of hair!  </li>
            <li> This error leads to major tangling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using cleansing conditioner regularly for over a year now and have tried several different brands, so I&#x27;m aware of how to properly use them</li>
            <li> It even takes several washes with a sudsing shampoo to completely remove it</li>
            <li> /&gt;About two months ago, I cut traditional shampoo out of my routine completely.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used about 10 or 11 pumps to TOTALLY soak my shoulder length, straight hair - the bottle recommends 8-10, which sounds like a lot, but they&#x27;re pretty small pumps.</li>
            <li> First, it does the same on my hair as that other product.</li>
            <li> I used this product for a week now, the first couple times it left my hair soft, and a little greasy.</li>
            <li> I used a ton of product, left it in my hair an extra long time and rinsed very thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Here are my only issues overall, which I&#x27;d like to direct to the Renpure company:  </li>
            <li> I have no dry ends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for so long, I buy the gallon-size from QVC early ever summer.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m loving my hair which is saying a lot because earlier in the day I&#x27;d considered chopping it all off because it was feeling very broken, dry and damaged.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t dry hair or strip natural oils from your hair.  </li>
            <li> This one is slightly thicker, but not by much.</li>
            <li> I let my hair dry naturally, and its straight/wavy texture made it look tousled, like I had a deliberately deconstructed</li>
            <li> The texture is fine, but my hair is very thick.</li>
            <li> I have wavy thin fine hair..</li>
            <li> Other cleansing conditioners are really thick, making it easy to get from your hand to your head, and they also create a creamy feel when cleansing the hair..</li>
            <li> but his sniffer is super sensitive of late due to medications he is on.</li>
            <li> If I didn&#x27;t rave about this product sufficiently in my previous post, please let me add a new praise: while on vacation out of the country last month, I traveled with this one product in my kitbag / toiletry bag -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had compliments from other people just being near me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like putting lotion on your hair, and it&#x27;s so thin in consistency that I have to use a ton of it to get my hair clean.</li>
            <li> We did use wen was tired of paying the cost, we tried this and love it my hair is down to my waist</li>
            <li> I used it for a few weeks and my hair returned back to normal but then once it was soft and moisturized again, it weighed my hair down.</li>
            <li> I was becoming a Wen girl, but it&#x27;s so expensive.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really not, especially if you have long hair.</li>
            <li> No greasiness, no stringiness, and the cuticles of my hair were coated so that they lay flat</li>
            <li> This stuff keeps the frizzies down on old lady hair.  </li>
            <li> The Renpure left my hair feeling dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> makes your hair dry going back to wen</li>
            <li> However I will keep this around for next winter or even for summer when beachy saltwater and chlorine pool water dry my hair out.</li>
            <li> I tried the coconut Cowash and the Coconut Cleansing Pudding of the same brand simply because I was curious about Wen, but the price and &#x27;subscription&#x27; service tripped my scam/cheapskate alarms.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fine with the smell, but mostly I am bored of it.  </li>
            <li> After getting my hair Keratin Treated I had very limited choices in terms of what hair products I could use so that the treatment would last the longest.</li>
            <li> I try not to wash it too often but unless it&#x27;s a hat day I have to at least wash my bangs for a ponytail day or my whole head for a hair-down day.</li>
            <li> Long hair.</li>
            <li> Once this bottle runs out (which at the rate I am having to use it, won&#x27;t be long now)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been an exercise in patience to grow it long since combing it</li>
            <li> I am Cuban mixed black Cuban and white Cuban what we call a Mestiza .</li>
            <li> I barely ran a round brush through it because I haaaaaate brushing wet hair and hearing it break or watching the big knot grow in the underneath hair.</li>
            <li> I used this, then did an after- rinse with Apple cider vinegar, and there is only luxurious feeling strands after the blow dry, no need for other products...</li>
            <li> I follow with a vinegar rinse, since this doesn&#x27;t prevent my scalp from getting dry</li>
            <li> She said: Living in Hawaii, I&#x27;m in the ocean a lot and my hair gets really dry and knotty.</li>
            <li> Suddenly my hair was starting to lose body again, because it was heavy and</li>
            <li> Stands up to every claim - far and exceeds any haircare product I have used in the past dozens of years.  </li>
            <li> Leave it on 3-5 minutes and rinse by letting the water pour straight down on your head; do not flip your head when rinsing, at least not if you have long hair that tangles.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Over the years of heavily shampooing my hair, it had gotten thin,&lt;br /&gt;completely lacked shape or body, got excessively sweaty and oily with minimal physical activity, and I had to wash it once or twice a day to look decent.</li>
            <li> I also needed to address the drying ends, and give my hair back the life it had been developing before getting (literally) weighed down.</li>
            <li> I can actually let it air dry and not have a frizzy mess on my hands.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it started to become evident that ALL the excessive oil/dirt was never really being washed out by my baking soda wash, and it was starting to get a little heavy.</li>
            <li> I have type 2a hair with only a slight waviness; it could be type 1.5 if that were a type.</li>
            <li> Each time I used the soda wash, it was cleaner than it had been, but probably not really clean enough.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I didn&#x27;t listen to the bad.</li>
            <li> I followed Renpure&#x27;s directions for how to apply, and used a wide tooth comb in the shower to distribute it evenly throughout my hair.</li>
            <li> Not very scientific, but that&#x27;s been my experience.</li>
            <li> Any issues with this can be solved by using a toner after your shower, or following up with a dab of soap behind the ears and back of the neck to get any residue left on your skin after you&#x27;ve rinsed your hair.  </li>
            <li> Not really like Wen as others have stated.</li>
            <li> I expected my hair to look greasy, but figured it was not a problem since I was staying at home anyway.</li>
            <li> 2nd time used half of that!</li>
            <li> I was really afraid my scalp would feel itchy and greasy, but it leaves my scalp feeling really clean without stripping my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked off and on for an alternative to give me the same, if not better, results as WEN and have had no luck until I tried the Renpure Coconut Cr&amp;egrave;me Cleansing Pudding.</li>
            <li> I look forward to trying some of the other cleansing conditioners and hair products by Renpure.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when I switched back to my usual Renpure Rosemary Mint Cleansing Conditioner.</li>
            <li> As compared to other WEN-like products, I&#x27;d still pick this over Hair-One.</li>
            <li> If I can send it back I will, but Im not sure on the return policy.......</li>
            <li> I let it sit as I went about my other business in the shower.</li>
            <li> I intend to try the other cleansing conditioners because I like variety -</li>
            <li> I intend to try the other cleansing conditioners because I like variety -</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s painful and it breaks easily.</li>
            <li> This is thin, not slick and rich...and it doesnt even smell like coconut.</li>
            <li> Not good, left my hair feeling dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not normally a fan of coconut scented body products; they&#x27;re usually pretty artificial</li>
            <li> At first, none of the cleansing conditioners worked as well as Wen and I was beginning to think I would have to tuck my tail and go back to using their (Wen) products (despite my anger at their sleazy sales tactics) when I tried Renpure Coconut Creme Cleansing and sang &amp;#34;Hallelujah!&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a negative review on here before, but I just had to after using this product for the second time.</li>
            <li> As far as the smell goes, well it&#x27;s not great.</li>
            <li> It claims to be less damaging to hair, since you comb it into your hair, instead of using the typical &#x27;shampooing&#x27; technique.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m spending less time styling it.  </li>
            <li> a tangled mess</li>
            <li> so I was concerned that I would have a tangled mess when I was done.</li>
            <li> and I think I produce slightly less oil, though I still use this everyday</li>
            <li> however the price was a little too steep</li>
            <li> I do wish it were a little thicker.</li>
            <li> I like the way my hair looks after using the Renpure cleansing conditioners, but I wish the product was a little thicker..</li>
            <li> I do apply a little conditioner to my ends after using the co-wash and then I don&#x27;t need any de-frizz product or leave-in conditioner afterwards.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m not completely impressed with this product and doubt I&#x27;d buy it again, but I&#x27;ll hang on to the bottles I do have and use them during the winter when my hair gets really dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> which is saying a lot because earlier in the day I&#x27;d considered chopping it all off because it was feeling very broken, dry and damaged.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair heavy and a bit greasy</li>
            <li> Some of his conditioning shampoos leave my hair heavy and greasy, others have not.  </li>
            <li> I also had trouble with the Renpure pump....</li>
            <li> For example my mom has thin  wavy blonde hair</li>
            <li> Nope not Wen, dried my hair out, tangled and no body.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money just because of the name on the bottle.</li>
            <li> While this cleanser definitely leaves my hair feeling soft and silky, it also tends to leave it a bit greasy near the scalp, and by day 2, it looks terrible.</li>
            <li> Found this to feel like heavy conditioner.</li>
            <li> As a side note, I have noticed that this will clog pores that I didn&#x27;t have an issues with before, such as the pores behind my ears.  </li>
            <li> DONT Waste your money.</li>
            <li> I used half the amount !</li>
            <li> I personally would not buy it again, but am not sure if there is something wrong with the formula or if my hair is just difficult and high maintenance.</li>
            <li> My hair does seem calmer (I have very thick, curly, long hair), and I do see a difference when looking in the mirror..</li>
            <li> The coconut scent is pleasing, it&#x27;s not overwhelming at all like a few have mentioned here in the reviews.  </li>
            <li> This did not perform as expected and the smell was not pleasant at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy when you have to shop for a replacement for your favorite product, however after having a horrible customer experience with Wen, I decided to use my consumer purchasing power elsewhere.</li>
            <li> The ends were drying out from the soda wash, but the roots were heavy and thick.</li>
            <li> I would have no desire to use a designated shampoo using this product, irrelevant of my relatively new-found dedication to no-poo.</li>
            <li> (I have hard water).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to keep this product in your hand when it&#x27;s so runny..</li>
            <li> Not nearly as nice as Wen.</li>
            <li> Too thick for me.</li>
            <li> Renpure, please make other flavors of Pudding!!!!  </li>
            <li> I gave it a shot anyway, and it does smell divine, and it works just like Wen, if not better, and less expensive.  </li>
            <li> When I got out I just dried my bangs (which is my custom because otherwise they tend to get crazy) and a little bit of my crown.</li>
            <li> I know this is less expensive but</li>
            <li> I have been using WEN for years and wanted to try to find a less expensive product, so I tried the Coconut Crème Cleansing Pudding.  </li>
            <li> and I was sick of dealing with the build up that WEN always left in my hair.  </li>
            <li> So I got this during the worst winter on record in Boston when the city was easily in negative temperatures and the high wind speed made it almost unbearable.</li>
            <li> Cutting back on sulfate-laden shampoo was my solution, but I had no patience for a gradual transition, so I quit cold</li>
            <li> The pump was broken off and the product leaked all over the box and everything in the box.</li>
            <li> made my scalp burn not great its nothing like wen</li>
            <li> (this 16oz pump-bottle also lasts FOREVER... seriously!).</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sorry I ever tried it.</li>
            <li> It was getting really expensive</li>
            <li> However, it is outrageously expensive, BEFORE shipping.</li>
            <li> Sorry Wen.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately this is not it.</li>
            <li> it has a weird barbershop smell.</li>
            <li> Absurd.</li>
            <li> No good :(</li>
            <li> It does not clean as well as WEN, in fact it leaves a film on my hair and makes my hair terribly frizzy.  </li>
            <li> That was my biggest disappointment with this.  </li>
            <li> It knots like CRAZY.</li>
            <li> Sorry!</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I&#x27;ve never used a cleansing conditioner and was very wary.</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> IT SMELLS SO BAD</li>
            <li> While this smells HEAVENLY, I was disappointed in the fact that my hair still looked and felt as frizzy as it did before using this product.</li>
            <li> this stuff is crap.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate the smell, but it&#x27;s not pleasing at all.</li>
            <li> It leaves a nasty, greasy/</li>
            <li> AWFUL!!!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff was horrible, smells nothing like coconut and made my hair fall out.</li>
            <li> This is terrible.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s not easy when you have to shop for a replacement for your favorite product, however after having a horrible customer experience with Wen, I decided to use my consumer purchasing power elsewhere. At first, none of the cleansing conditioners worked as well as Wen and I was beginning to think I would have to tuck my tail and go back to using their (Wen) products (despite my anger at their sleazy sales tactics) when I tried Renpure Coconut Creme Cleansing and sang &amp;#34;Hallelujah!&amp;#34; Renpure is just as good as Wen, and cheaper too. My only con is that I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell, it&#x27;s not a bad smell, it&#x27;s just not my smell. I&#x27;m hoping that there will be different scents in the same brand and look forward to trying those out! Oh, and one last thing, the best compliment I can give this conditioning cleanser is that after using it for a week my friends and co workers were asking me what I was doing differently with my hair. When people notice your hair looking healthier and shinier, you know it works!</li>
            <li> I Love these products. Long hair. The best and fastest way to beautiful hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay. doesn&#x27;t detangle well.</li>
            <li> Smell is extremely too much!</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair heavy and a bit greasy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using WEN since Chaz Dean first appeared on QVC selling it.  I&#x27;ve been using it for so long, I buy the gallon-size from QVC early ever summer.  Some of his conditioning shampoos leave my hair heavy and greasy, others have not.  Over the last two years, I found that only one WEN shampoo worked well consistently, and since it&#x27;s a discontinued Fall scent, I won&#x27;t say which one.  Anyway, over the last two years I&#x27;ve really wondered if WEN changed the formulation.  Fast forward to three weeks ago.  I was looking at WEN products on Amazon, and lo and behold, I came across Renpure Coconut Creme Cleansing Pudding.  I found I had nothing to lose but to try it. Tried it, I did, and I am more than pleased with the product.  The coconut scent is pleasing, it&#x27;s not overwhelming at all like a few have mentioned here in the reviews.  One thing I learned using WEN was to rinse my hair VERY WELL and then pour a teaspoon of organic apple cider vinegar over  my hair at the end of the overall rinse and then rinse it a bit more.  It always got rid of extra &amp;#34;greasiness&amp;#34; with WEN products. I don&#x27;t have to do this with Renpure.  My hair looked and felt beautiful and luxurious after my first use of this product, and each time thereafter.  I am beyond pleased, and will try other Renpure products based on my experience with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a negative review on here before, but I just had to after using this product for the second time. It leaves a nasty, greasy/literally waxy feel on my hair after I use it (I used it the second time as I wasn&#x27;t 100% sure it was this product because I used another condtioner afterwards that I hadn&#x27;t used before. I regret giving it the second chance). I&#x27;ve been using cleansing conditioner regularly for over a year now and have tried several different brands, so I&#x27;m aware of how to properly use them (I know it takes a good amount of product to properly clean, you need to really work it in, etc.). This one just doesn&#x27;t feel like it cleans and then it leaves that film. It even takes several washes with a sudsing shampoo to completely remove it and I have to put up with the look and feel until I manage to remove it all. I&#x27;ve never seen/felt anything like it. It&#x27;s a nightmare. This product wasn&#x27;t even very easy to work through my hair and doesn&#x27;t detangle well at all. I just can&#x27;t find anything good to say about it. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone and I&#x27;m sorry I ever tried it.</li>
            <li> Wow, this product is amazing!  Exactly what I have been looking for.  I used this, then did an after- rinse with Apple cider vinegar, and there is only luxurious feeling strands after the blow dry, no need for other products...no frizzies. No heaviness, either.  Yay!</li>
            <li> All things considered - price and quality this destroys Wen.</li>
            <li> Excellent for very curly hair, keeps the curls smooth and moisturized</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  I have very fine hair and was worried about having flat hair with this type product.  I have been using using WEN products for about a year.  I was over the high price and having to be on a shipment plan with WEN.  I read the reviews and took a chance on the Renpure product.  I love it!! My hair is shinier and fuller with this product than with WEN.  Smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as nice as Wen. I tried to find a Wen replacement so I went with the Renpure cleansing pudding, and it just didn&#x27;t do it for me. It&#x27;s like putting lotion on your hair, and it&#x27;s so thin in consistency that I have to use a ton of it to get my hair clean. Wen is more like a dense conditioner consistency with better distribution and slippage to really clean well. This might work better for thinner hair (mine is thick and curly). I also had trouble with the Renpure pump....I actually put my Wen pump on it instead. I won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> When you purchase something that is called &amp;#34;Coconut&amp;#34; bla bla bla, and Coconut is prominently displayed on the label, wouldn&#x27;t you think it would SMELL like coconut?  That was my biggest disappointment with this.  The product is decent, but not my favorite co-wash.  I like the dispenser, but it doesn&#x27;t provide enough slip. Still need to use conditioner after the co-wash, so make sure you purchase that as well. posted a picture of the ingredients</li>
            <li> Hi  mom of two here with. I time for washing and conditioning or styling . When I visited Florida last Month I had a shampoo emergency and came across the #renpure line I always heard about washing your hair without shampoo and never thought it will be so amazing . I tried it and loved it so I can now cleans and condition all in one  victory !!!!!!  So dis my wash stay tune for my GO product .&lt;br /&gt;I always wanted to share hair products specially for mix girls so that you know no I am not Indian I am Cuban mixed black Cuban and white Cuban what we call a Mestiza .</li>
            <li> This is o.k.  It does the job but not as well as Wen.  Love the price.  I thought it would smell of coconut but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Nice smelling cleansing shampoo but careful to not use too much like wen because will build up ..</li>
            <li> I use this product instead of WEN Products. Much more affordable plus has a lot of natural products.</li>
            <li> I personally have never tried Wen but have always been interested in doing so. After getting my hair Keratin Treated I had very limited choices in terms of what hair products I could use so that the treatment would last the longest. After doing my research (Keratin treated hair cannot have any products containing Sulfates or Sodium Chloride) I was going to try Wen however the price was a little too steep so I found Renpure and haven&#x27;t looked back since. It&#x27;s been almost three months and my curly hair is healthy soft, and manageable. I can&#x27;t say how it works on those with thinner hair. For example my mom has thin  wavy blonde hair and I can&#x27;t see this working well for her but for us girls with curls this is a God send!</li>
            <li> Smells great hair soft and clean</li>
            <li> Bought this after looking at Wen on QVC, which is just too pricey for me. I read on another website that someone recommended this product as an alternative to Wen, so I decided to give it a try. I have color-treated, medium length, wavy hair that tend to be dry and frizzes easily- much to my dismay. I have tried all kinds of conditioners, and always find I have to use a lot of product to get the desired smoothness and softness. I followed Renpure&#x27;s directions for how to apply, and used a wide tooth comb in the shower to distribute it evenly throughout my hair. It rinses out easily and leaves my hair smelling wonderful- I&#x27;ve had compliments from other people just being near me. The best part, however, is the end result of using this, and is obvious after just one use- my hair is soft, no frizz, and not at all greasy or weighed down. I recommend following the instructions closely, as I can imagine doing otherwise might not produce the desired result. I will definitely be reordering this product!</li>
            <li> Works just as good as Wen, smells better and is a fraction of the price!! I like this conditioning cleanser.</li>
            <li> It works just as well as my Wen and it smells AMAZING! Smells like coconut cake or fru fru sweet coconut of some kind. Constantly getting compliments on how nice my hair looks and smells. I also use it on my 3 year old son&#x27;s hair- makes our hair so soft.</li>
            <li> Love it! Works well and not costly.</li>
            <li> Like it much better then WEN!  Much lighter.  Leaves my hair so soft and lively.  Lovely scent.</li>
            <li> Love this non-shampoo.  It cleans without stripping and drying.</li>
            <li> Bought this because I love the smell of coconut &amp; wanted a thick creamy product that would leave long hair conditioned and easy to comb.&lt;br /&gt;Smells like coconut? NOPE ..not a bad aroma, but not something I like&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair easy to comb? NOPE ..a tangled mess&lt;br /&gt;Thick &amp; creamy? &amp;#34;pudding&amp;#34; is in the name. NOPE ..thinner consistency than standard shampoo&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 2 stars because it has no sulfates or parabens &amp; not tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;It also says it&#x27;s gluten free! Was I supposed to eat it?&lt;br /&gt;Cleansing Pudding, huh.. I&#x27;ll be pudding on my dogs for their next bath</li>
            <li> Its great on my hair and smells super good.</li>
            <li> I really prefer this to WEN for both price and results. I have fine color treated hair with natural wave and curl. My hair wasn&#x27;t weighed down and felt clean and hydrated - BUT - and this is a major sticking point - my husband HATES the smell. To him it is cloying and too sweet. I love the smell of coconut so it doesn&#x27;t bother me but his sniffer is super sensitive of late due to medications he is on. I will re-try this once things return to normal.</li>
            <li> I have been &amp;#34;cowashing&amp;#34; for several years now, but I normally use WEN.  It was getting really expensive and I was sick of dealing with the build up that WEN always left in my hair.  I wanted to try something new and found this.  So much more reasonably priced and I think it works better than WEN.  This leaves my hair feeling cleaner, but still moisturized and I haven&#x27;t noticed any build up yet.  I have fine, curly hair that frizzes very easily, but I also have a lot of hair....I only cowash it a couple times a week.  The rest of the time, I just wet it down in the shower and use the leave in conditioner from Renpure (which I also love).  The smell isn&#x27;t really coconut, but it&#x27;s not offensive.</li>
            <li> Brought this in a store and tried this on my daughters hair ages 2 and 4. One has super thick curly hair where you can barely brush it and the other has super fine curly hair. It left their hair stringy and frizzy. Does not compare to Wen. Do not waste your money. By the time you by all these products trying to save money so you don&#x27;t buy Wen you could have just brought Wen and saved money!</li>
            <li> After researching how damaging the chemicals in shampoos are, I began using this product. After just a couple days my hair and scalp no longer gets oily/greasy by the end of the day and I can even skip washing it daily if I want. I&#x27;m very happy with the positive change this is having on my my hair, scalp, and daily routine.</li>
            <li> Great lower cost replacement for Wen.  I do not use very often but it seems to do what it should and simliar results to Wen</li>
            <li> It is OK but I prefer Wen product.  This one is much thinner consistency and does not give my hair the same silky result as the Wen product.  I know this is less expensive but in this case, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I switched from Wen for a more economical choice. For my fine curly hair, this didn&#x27;t do well. For now, going back to Wen.</li>
            <li> This was just ok. The HairOne cleansing conditioner is a similar product but seems to do a better job on my hair. The Renpure left my hair feeling dry and frizzy. I personally would not buy it again, but am not sure if there is something wrong with the formula or if my hair is just difficult and high maintenance. I went with 3 stars in case it&#x27;s the latter.</li>
            <li> Soft coconut scent and incredible softness.</li>
            <li> makes your hair dry going back to wen</li>
            <li> I purchase this for my grand daughter. She&#x27;s 4 and has very curly, long hair. It works great. She even loves how her hair feels after using it. So soft and helps detangle, not so many tears. Great product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to try this product yet because it arrived defective. The pump was broken off and the product leaked all over the box and everything in the box.</li>
            <li> I have exclusively used WEN for years now. I have naturally curly hair and WEN is a wonderful product. However, it is outrageously expensive, BEFORE shipping. I&#x27;ve looked off and on for an alternative to give me the same, if not better, results as WEN and have had no luck until I tried the Renpure Coconut Cr&amp;egrave;me Cleansing Pudding. After my first use my hair was so much softer than it is with WEN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say there&#x27;s not as much &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; to the product when you&#x27;re in the shower and using it so I was concerned that I would have a tangled mess when I was done. I couldn&#x27;t keep my hands out of my hair, I was that amazed with how soft it was. After about a week and a half using this product there is more &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; while in the shower. My thought is that perhaps my hair needed far more moisture than the WEN was supplying and Renpure has been able to pick up the slack. Not very scientific, but that&#x27;s been my experience. I look forward to trying some of the other cleansing conditioners and hair products by Renpure.</li>
            <li> While this smells HEAVENLY, I was disappointed in the fact that my hair still looked and felt as frizzy as it did before using this product. I&#x27;ve been through the entire bottle of cleansing pudding and there has been zero improvement.</li>
            <li> Too thick for me. So I got this during the worst winter on record in Boston when the city was easily in negative temperatures and the high wind speed made it almost unbearable. No matter how much I conditioned/leave-in conditioned/sealed my hair, it always felt like straw when I got back inside from the arctic outdoors. I will say, in those conditioners, this worked wonders. I used it for a few weeks and my hair returned back to normal but then once it was soft and moisturized again, it weighed my hair down. That&#x27;s when I switched back to my usual Renpure Rosemary Mint Cleansing Conditioner. However I will keep this around for next winter or even for summer when beachy saltwater and chlorine pool water dry my hair out.</li>
            <li> Not Wen...I tried it and hoped for best. Thought for 1/3 price it would be worth shot. Nope not Wen, dried my hair out, tangled and no body. I have wavy thin fine hair..Too bad. I wanted to like it. I concur the consistency is very lthin and not at all like Wen. Sorry! No good :(</li>
            <li> Just as good as Wen, but a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> Love this cleansing cream! Leaves my hair feeling clean and soft and smelling awesome!</li>
            <li> Not good, left my hair feeling dry and I bought the leave in conditioner to go with it. Go with Panteen ultra deep cleanser. That broduct is fantastic.</li>
            <li> AWFUL!!!!! IT SMELLS SO BAD AND SO STONG I COULDNT EVEN BRING MYSELF TO USE IT!!  I THREW IT AWAY IT WAS THAT BAD.DIDNT EVEN WANT TO SPEND ANOTHER PENNY ON IT TO SEND IT BACK.LADIES DONT BOTHER WASTING YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> This is so much better than the other coconut cleaning conditioner they make, smells much better. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> So far I like it !  I probably used more than my thinner hair needs. Don&#x27;t use as many pumps as bottle says when u first try it. I used half the amount ! 2nd time used half of that! Today I am just going to use one -two pumps.! You don&#x27;t need a lot and I didn&#x27;t need conditioner. It feels good, looks healthy and seemed to bring a lot of life back to my hair! It doesn&#x27;t look fuzzy!. Will update again.</li>
            <li> Smells absolutely fabulous! I will try it in the morning and will post how it does with my hair compared to Wen.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I used this with the wen instructions and love it. No greasy feeling and my hair is amazing now. So soft and so much stronger than what it was. I can actually let it air dry and not have a frizzy mess on my hands.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Just beginning to use, so we&#x27;ll see. So far so good!</li>
            <li> this stuff is crap. it left my hair frizzier than when i use shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about two weeks and I love it! it makes my hair so soft. It is a little runny and you need a good bit to actually get it all through your hair. It really doesn&#x27;t have a smell to it, more like a light scent. I will be purchasing more!</li>
            <li> Whoa! Really beyond my expectations! I have 3a-b hair and this leave it so silky. So much that I feel like my hair is easily separated, thus puffy. This is great when paired w/the perfect LOC method.</li>
            <li> Renpure Pudding smells more like coconut &amp; is thicker than the Renpure conditioning cleanser. Really like how it makes my hair soft &amp; full. Seems to make my highlights brighter,</li>
            <li> This is legit the best hair cleanser I have ever used. I highly recommend it. :D</li>
            <li> certainly NOT similar to WEN as advertised.  I don&#x27;t know why they call this &amp;#34;pudding&amp;#34; it is so runny you can barely contain it in your hand while getting it to your head of hair!  It does not clean as well as WEN, in fact it leaves a film on my hair and makes my hair terribly frizzy.  The scent is the great, however. It&#x27;s not overpowering, but it is strong and stays strong through the day.  As compared to other WEN-like products, I&#x27;d still pick this over Hair-One. But it&#x27;s not WEN.</li>
            <li> Very nice smelling, great cleanability, yet keeps your hair managable!  LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I love Wen and have used it for awhile. The cost is too much and I had to find something else. I am so glad I found this!! I read many reviews and just like everything you have good and bad. I am so glad I didn&#x27;t listen to the bad. This makes my hair feel just like I used Wen!!! Highly recommend this instead of Wen. Don&#x27;t waste your money just because of the name on the bottle.</li>
            <li> Love Renpure products.  This stuff keeps the frizzies down on old lady hair.  I can&#x27;t find this product in stores locally; I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for three months now and I&#x27;m still on the fence. While this cleanser definitely leaves my hair feeling soft and silky, it also tends to leave it a bit greasy near the scalp, and by day 2, it looks terrible. Perhaps it&#x27;s not made for my hair type, which is super fine. I followed the instructions on the bottle and used the indicated amount, but maybe that&#x27;s just too much for fine hair. As far as the smell goes, well it&#x27;s not great. There is only a hint of coconut but it&#x27;s more of a chemical coconut smell that you find in tanning lotions. I don&#x27;t hate the smell, but it&#x27;s not pleasing at all. Overall, I&#x27;m not completely impressed with this product and doubt I&#x27;d buy it again, but I&#x27;ll hang on to the bottles I do have and use them during the winter when my hair gets really dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> Very water and doesn&#x27;t conditions at all. I think my hair is more tangled after I get out of the shower than when I got in.</li>
            <li> Very oily and leaves a lot of greasiness on the hair especially after repeated use.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  I was becoming a Wen girl, but it&#x27;s so expensive.  I saw Renpure when some others posted they use this instead.  I looked at the ingredients on another site and they are very similar to Wen.  It says Fragrance derived, not quite sure what that means, but I was looking for something with no fragrance.  I gave it a shot anyway, and it does smell divine, and it works just like Wen, if not better, and less expensive.  My hair is even softer. I wash and rinse my hair twice (2x a week), and on Saturdays, I leave this on as a hair mask underneath a shower cap all day.  I love how smooth and shiny my hair is.  Sorry Wen.  Moving on!</li>
            <li> love the way it makes my hair feel and smells great</li>
            <li> It claims to be less damaging to hair, since you comb it into your hair, instead of using the typical &#x27;shampooing&#x27; technique. Not sure if that is true, but I love the way this makes my hair feel silky and its soft scent. I also use Renpure Co-Wash, which has a very similar smell and result. It takes about five pumps for my medium length hair to get cleaned. I follow with a vinegar rinse, since this doesn&#x27;t prevent my scalp from getting dry (I have hard water). Amazon has a competitive price - or it did when I bought it. Plan to buy again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Found this to feel like heavy conditioner. And doesn&#x27;t rinse as well as Wen. My hair didn&#x27;t feel the same as Wen either. But I too was looking for a cheaper alternative for Wen...but unfortunately this is not it. I give up...and will pay the big bucks for Wen.</li>
            <li> Loved the smell but it does not detangle and I did not like the way it felt in my hair BUT I did like the result after I rinsed the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me personally Wen is thick and great for what my hair needs, but I personally know people that this product works for. For the price I say try it.</li>
            <li> This stuff was horrible, smells nothing like coconut and made my hair fall out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just discovering cowashes (cleansing conditioners) and because of them I am finally able to wear my fine, wavy hair as just that - soft waves and curls.  Previous to this, I never was great at coaxing curl that looked good and wore my 2a/2b hair straight, dealing sort of poorly with the consequences if high humidity hit.  I tried the coconut Cowash and the Coconut Cleansing Pudding of the same brand simply because I was curious about Wen, but the price and &#x27;subscription&#x27; service tripped my scam/cheapskate alarms.  So, I&#x27;ve never tried Wen but I&#x27;m thankful it exists, because before hearing about it I never knew that cowashing existed!  Side note:  I left a similar, but not identical review, for the coconut cowash.  I like this product better, but I&#x27;ll make a few comparisons here.  On to my actual experience with the product -- My hair and scalp feel clean using this and I think I produce slightly less oil, though I still use this everyday (I do not know how people can skip washes, but I think they have a whole technique to it that I am not privy to).  This product leaves my hair healthier and more moisturized than shampoo and condition combos ever have, and I&#x27;ve used many kinds including high end.  I&#x27;m not really hard on my hair -- I air-dry or blow-dry, but don&#x27;t color, straighten or use curling irons -- and this still improved the way my hair felt.  I never realized that it had a bit of dryness to it!  I always thought I over-conditioned, but I guess the conditioners just weren&#x27;t as effective, or the shampoos caused too much damage for the conditioner to make up for.  So, I liked the coconut cowash, but I LOVE the pudding version.  The pudding does everything this cowash does, except it takes it to ELEVEN!  Hair is fully quenched with moisture, softness, shine, frizz is locked out, and my curl appears out of nowhere.  I freaking love my hair on the pudding!  I can air-dry without looking like a frizzenstein experiment and without product.  I actually air-dry, or blow-dry just the top of my hair, and it looks great, from soft waves to a sexy bedroom/beachy look.  My hair looks and feels better and I&#x27;m spending less time styling it.  If you have fine hair like me, you can definitely use a cowash and, in my case, the heavier, more moisturizing version worked better and gave me more body.  My hair seemed like totally different, better hair!  As a side note, I have noticed that this will clog pores that I didn&#x27;t have an issues with before, such as the pores behind my ears.  Any issues with this can be solved by using a toner after your shower, or following up with a dab of soap behind the ears and back of the neck to get any residue left on your skin after you&#x27;ve rinsed your hair.  So blah blah blah... this pudding stuff is amazing.  Here are my only issues overall, which I&#x27;d like to direct to the Renpure company:  1)  The difference between the pudding and the cowash is not at all explained on the packaging.  If you look at the ingredients, they appear to be the same.  In actuality, the pudding is much thicker and works differently because of that.  It would be nice if Renpure would indicate usage/recommendations/anything to help customers know which version might be best for them.  This also goes for the differences, if any, between the different varieties/scents of cowash. 2)  I have mostly positive things to say about the aroma.  Both versions smell identically, and while I like the smell, I don&#x27;t love it.  It smells a bit like real fresh coconut mixed with drugstore fragrance base...or something to that effect.  I&#x27;m fine with the smell, but mostly I am bored of it.  Renpure, please make other flavors of Pudding!!!!  If you prefer the cowash to the pudding, they have already got you covered in this area.</li>
            <li> Does all it claims and more.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Leave hair clean and smelling good days later. :)</li>
            <li> Not bad.... Definitely not Wen!!!</li>
            <li> This is terrible. I really like Wen, and I love the pantene cleansing conditioner. I was really looking forward to this because I wanted coconut scent in a cleansing conditioner, even though it is twice the price of the pantene. This is thin, not slick and rich...and it doesnt even smell like coconut. it has a weird barbershop smell. I very much wish I had purchased 4 bottles of pantene instead of wasting 20+ bucks on 2 bottles of this. If I can send it back I will, but Im not sure on the return policy.......</li>
            <li> This smells great and left my hair feeling very silky, but since my hair is already so thin and fine, extra silkiness makes it hard to manage.  If you have really thick, course hair and want something to make it very silky and fine feeling, then this shampoo would be good for you.  For the right hair type, I think this shampoo would be great.</li>
            <li> I have been using WEN for years and wanted to try to find a less expensive product, so I tried the Coconut Crème Cleansing Pudding.  It is not as thick as WEN, so I find myself needed to use more of this product.  Still cleanses my hair, but I don&#x27;t think it is as effective as WEN.  It&#x27;s worth a try if you are looking for something cheaper, but this is a great example of &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;.  Once this bottle runs out (which at the rate I am having to use it, won&#x27;t be long now) I will go back to WEN.</li>
            <li> Not really like Wen as others have stated. The product was very runny. This did not perform as expected and the smell was not pleasant at all. I went back to Wen.</li>
            <li> I had used wen previously and i will say i loved it, but my gosh the price is way too much, and just couldn&#x27;t afford it had gone back to the normal everyday shampoo and conditioners, and one day came across Renpure at Target $7.00 at the one by my house and decided why the heck not and I fell in love with it, its just as good as wen if not better and will not return to anything else! a bottle lasts a while and my girls love it too, my oldest bleaches her hair and anyone knows what kind of hell that does to hair, she started using this and her hair is no longer looking like straw and feels amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> it has a wonderful smell and it is not overpowering..... hair seems clean when done  cleansing with this...would buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Renpure products for many years now, the cost is good for the amount of product you get.  Also, safe on color, and I like that is doesn&#x27;t dry hair or strip natural oils from your hair.  I&#x27;ve will continue to refer the Renpure products to everyone.</li>
            <li> I am new to the cleansing conditioners and I have never used the Wen products, but I like this line.  I bought this and the pomegranate.  I like the way the pomegranate smells better, but this seems to condition more.  I was really afraid my scalp would feel itchy and greasy, but it leaves my scalp feeling really clean without stripping my hair.  I will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much. I have fine hair use a comb and comb through my hair., leave it in, wash it out. Make sure you rinse it longer than you think you will need.</li>
            <li> Smells much better than the pomegranate-scented version.</li>
            <li> After getting dizzy on a nightmare customer service ordeal with WEN, I tried this product and I am so glad I did. First, it does the same on my hair as that other product. I like it a lot and the smell is wonderful. I do wish it were a little thicker. Have to really focus to not spill it out of my hands. I say for the price, give it a try.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!  Switched from Wen and love the savings along with this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Do you ever have that feeling... when you realize, as you&#x27;re first seeing, or tasting, or experiencing something, that you can&#x27;t wait to tell everyone you know about what it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS CREME IS THAT FOR ME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About two months ago, I cut traditional shampoo out of my routine completely. Over the years of heavily shampooing my hair, it had gotten thin,&lt;br /&gt;completely lacked shape or body, got excessively sweaty and oily with minimal physical activity, and I had to wash it once or twice a day to look decent. Absurd. Cutting back on sulfate-laden shampoo was my solution, but I had no patience for a gradual transition, so I quit cold turkey!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used baking soda and water once or twice a week, depending on my schedule. My hair was adjusting pretty well to the new routine -- it rarely looked oily, and especially with some extensive brushing in the evenings to help redistribute oils, etc., I had body that I never used to have, and my hair felt and looked thicker and healthier. I also stopped getting super sweaty/oily/gross hair after working out, sleeping -- even walking my dog used to pretty much sabotage my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it started to become evident that ALL the excessive oil/dirt was never really being washed out by my baking soda wash, and it was starting to get a little heavy. Each time I used the soda wash, it was cleaner than it had been, but probably not really clean enough. The ends were drying out from the soda wash, but the roots were heavy and thick. Suddenly my hair was starting to lose body again, because it was heavy and dense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I looked into how I wanted to proceed and decided that cowashing (washing with conditioner instead of shampoo) was a great alternative. I needed something to really be able to mix into my hair (water mixtures aren&#x27;t great for that!) and soak each strand. I also needed to address the drying ends, and give my hair back the life it had been developing before getting (literally) weighed down. Also, to be honest, I also just missed the thoroughly clean feeling you get from drenching your hair in cleansing product and rinsing it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I found Repure&#x27;s Coconut Creme Cleansing Pudding -- in a pump bottle, nonetheless! I&#x27;m not normally a fan of coconut scented body products; they&#x27;re usually pretty artificial and I find the smell a little overwhelming, but not the case here. The scent is light and refreshing; cleansing and relaxing. Natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used about 10 or 11 pumps to TOTALLY soak my shoulder length, straight hair - the bottle recommends 8-10, which sounds like a lot, but they&#x27;re pretty small pumps. Those 10/11 pumps that I opted to used are probably a lot for my length and texture -- I wanted to be able to completely saturate every inch, with a little extra left over. I wouldn&#x27;t expect to have to use that many pumps every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I&#x27;m rubbing it in, I&#x27;m excited. Smells great, feels great, seems promising. I let it sit as I went about my other business in the shower. Started rinsing it out. I can FEEL how silky smooth my hair is. I&#x27;m excited. This is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair dries quicker than it has been since starting no-poo -- it&#x27;s clean! It&#x27;s totally clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It finishes drying -- I have body. I have no excess oil. I have no dry ends. My hair is smoother than it&#x27;s been in MONTHS, looks great, smells great. From an inexpensive, truly hair-friendly product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paraben free, sulfate, chloride and dye free, this &amp;#34;cleansing pudding&amp;#34; is a great option for shampoos and/or conditioners. I would have no desire to use a designated shampoo using this product, irrelevant of my relatively new-found dedication to no-poo.</li>
            <li> I have wanted to get away from Shampoo/Conditioner and this is the product to be able to do that! My hair has never been so soft and manageable. I don&#x27;t ever want to go back to shampoo/conditioner.  .</li>
            <li> Luckily I ordered this product before I noticed that it was listed as &amp;#34;multicultural&amp;#34; on the Renpure website. I probably wouldn&#x27;t have ordered it if I&#x27;d seen that, thinking it wasn&#x27;t for my hair. But, oh YES, it is! I used it for the first time today and thanks to the reviews here I knew to use more than the recommended amount of pumps (4 or 5 per section of scalp and then LOTS more as I worked my way down since my hair is long; about waist length). I have to admit, I&#x27;ve never used a cleansing conditioner and was very wary. I have very fine, mostly straight, long hair (I&#x27;m white as all hell) and there&#x27;s not a ton of it. It knots like CRAZY. It&#x27;s been an exercise in patience to grow it long since combing it takes forever, it&#x27;s painful and it breaks easily. Plus it gets greasy pretty easily. I try not to wash it too often but unless it&#x27;s a hat day I have to at least wash my bangs for a ponytail day or my whole head for a hair-down day. I&#x27;ll update in the coming weeks/months to see how it goes but so far I&#x27;m HOOOKED! I used a ton of product, left it in my hair an extra long time and rinsed very thoroughly. When I got out I just dried my bangs (which is my custom because otherwise they tend to get crazy) and a little bit of my crown. I barely ran a round brush through it because I haaaaaate brushing wet hair and hearing it break or watching the big knot grow in the underneath hair. A little while later my hair is feeling pretty nice so I decide to dry it a bit more and brush it and, WOW! My hair feels like I went to the salon and they spent a good hour doing that brush/hair-dry thing they do that I don&#x27;t have the patience for. I was brushing it for FUN people! All you tender-heads out there will understand how awesome that is. My hair feels like I just deep conditioned it and my hair feels super clean which is the part I was worried about. I would have been pissed if I had to re-wash my hair right out of the shower because it was greasy. So far I&#x27;m loving my hair which is saying a lot because earlier in the day I&#x27;d considered chopping it all off because it was feeling very broken, dry and damaged. I intend to try the other cleansing conditioners because I like variety - I just hope they work as well as the &amp;#34;multicultural&amp;#34; coconut creme pudding does!r which is saying a lot because earlier in the day I&#x27;d considered chopping it all off because it was feeling very broken, dry and damaged.

            <li> My wife bought this and loves it. She said: Living in Hawaii, I&#x27;m in the ocean a lot and my hair gets really dry and knotty. I looked into buying Wen, but it was way too pricey. I bought the coconut creme cleansing pudding and noticed results right away.  Use the recommended amount of pumps, 8-10 sounds like a lot but it&#x27;s really not, especially if you have long hair. I used a wide tooth comb in the shower to make sure it was evenly distributed and rinsed for 1-2 minutes. The smell is great and my hair was not tangled at all afterwards! I may never use shampoo ever again!</li>
            <li> We did use wen was tired of paying the cost, we tried this and love it my hair is down to my waist and my husbands is in the middle of his Bach we both just LOVE this and will buy more thank you</li>
            <li> this one smells like a hazardous chemical processing plant in which a coconut-scented air freshener happens to be hanging.</li>
            <li> Renpure Coconut creme pudding 16oz&lt;br /&gt;Love this cowash....price is great compared to wen and just as good on my hair. Have used Wen for many years and thought I would try to save some money. Trying many co washes recently. This is a good one . Only wish it actually smelled like coconut. It does not.</li>
            <li> I like the way my hair looks after using the Renpure cleansing conditioners, but I wish the product was a little thicker.. This one is actually a bit thicker than the Cleansing Cowash..I wondered what the difference between the Coconut Creme Cleansing Pudding and the Coconut Cream Cowash Cleansing Conditioner was, so I purchased both...This one is slightly thicker, but not by much. They clean and condition the same. This one does not smell anything like coconut, though, which really disappoints me, but the Cowash really doesn&#x27;t either... This one has kind of a spicey kind of scent to it (that I don&#x27;t really like) and the Cowash has a very mild, clean scent, which I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed if you shake these products up before pumping them out, they do seem a bit thicker, as most of them are almost as runny as water. It&#x27;s hard to keep this product in your hand when it&#x27;s so runny.. Other cleansing conditioners are really thick, making it easy to get from your hand to your head, and they also create a creamy feel when cleansing the hair.. This product doesn&#x27;t really do that.. It just kind of feels like your rubbing something into your hair, but not that much different than rubbing water into your hair.. and yet, the end results are impressive.. My hair does seem calmer (I have very thick, curly, long hair), and I do see a difference when looking in the mirror..&lt;br /&gt;I have now tried four different brands of cleansing conditioners. The cons to this one is the runniness of the product, the smell that isn&#x27;t anything like coconut and the fact that for whatever reason, the bottles &amp;#34;leak&amp;#34;..(I have three bottles of Renpure and they all do the same thing). I have to unscrew the cap a bit or product runs out of the squirt top, making a mess of my shower shelf and also wasting product. The pros are, it leaves my hair in better condition than most cleansing conditioners. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll buy any more of the Renpure, though, because I really don&#x27;t like how runny the products are (or the smell of this one)..(or the smell of this one)..</li>
            <li> I have type 2a hair with only a slight waviness; it could be type 1.5 if that were a type. My hair is colored to cover about 25% gray. The texture is fine, but my hair is very thick. All these factors form the perfect storm for serious tangling. From using the Renpure BB cleanser and conditioner, I learned that with these emollient based hair care products you must NEVER lather by wadding your hair in a stack as they show in shampoo commercials. This error leads to major tangling. With Renpure products, including the Coconut Creme Pudding, it is best to leave your hair very wet and very straight as you work the product through with a wide toothed comb. Leave it on 3-5 minutes and rinse by letting the water pour straight down on your head; do not flip your head when rinsing, at least not if you have long hair that tangles.&lt;br /&gt;Usually I avoid oily or moisturizing hair products because with my hair type, it is easy for my hair to become greasy and stringy. However, my hair has been damaged looking lately, and I thought the Coconut Creme Pudding would be ok to help repair it on the weekends. I expected my hair to look greasy, but figured it was not a problem since I was staying at home anyway. However, after just one shampoo with this product, my hair was transformed! No greasiness, no stringiness, and the cuticles of my hair were coated so that they lay flat and my hair appeared to have shine. Yet it looked fine textured, not coarse or coated! I let my hair dry naturally, and its straight/wavy texture made it look tousled, like I had a deliberately deconstructed style.&lt;br /&gt;It is labeled Coconut, but to me it smells more like Play-Doh. The smell is nice, but once your hair dries it dissipates.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My hair was so soft...my hair is naturally curly and this along with the leave in conditioner gave it so much body.  We have also tried the Lavender and Mint.  It works great for kids with &amp;#34;tangly&amp;#34; hair.  All in all impressed, been using renpure for about 1.5 months now and my hair feels so much healthier.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this after reading other reviews saying that it was as good as WEN. It comes no where near WEN! It us very runny and I have to use twice as much. I wouldn&#x27;t have even given it one star except that it works ok to remove the chlorine from my hair daily.</li>
            <li> Love the coconut sent. Product is very gentle on my color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I read about co-washing on a Health &amp; Beauty blog that listed Renpure Coconut Creme Cleansing Pudding as one of the top products to try. Now I use this product every time I wash my hair and it&#x27;s amazing (this 16oz pump-bottle also lasts FOREVER... seriously!). I do apply a little conditioner to my ends after using the co-wash and then I don&#x27;t need any de-frizz product or leave-in conditioner afterwards. When I was using traditional shampoo and conditioner, my hair used to get greasy within 1-2 days of washing it and I had to use extra products to detangle and de-frizz my wavy hair. Now I don&#x27;t need any additional product and my hair stays clean, non-greasy and full of volume for days after co-washing. I think the price is extremely reasonable for what you get and I recommend this product to literally everyone.</li>
            <li> Smells great, but couldnt get it all out of my hair. Maybe my hair is too thick?&lt;br /&gt;So hair looks greasy</li>
            <li> This has been the best alternative to Wen that I&#x27;ve found so far. The price is really good.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. Stands up to every claim - far and exceeds any haircare product I have used in the past dozens of years.  Look no further, this is it! Gently cleanses your hair without stripping it; rinses cleanly and clear, leaving hair in soft, manageable condition.  My hair feels like it did back when I was a pre-teen and teenager  - I can&#x27;t believe how healthy it&#x27;s condition with this product. My hair feels like hair again .. I&#x27;d honestly forgotten. I have previously used WEN and it&#x27;s a great product as well - but, preference and price - RenPure Coconut Creme Cleansing Pudding wins hands down. I&#x27;m stocking up on this winner!  ** Update 11/23/2015 - If I didn&#x27;t rave about this product sufficiently in my previous post, please let me add a new praise: while on vacation out of the country last month, I traveled with this one product in my kitbag / toiletry bag - of course it was fantastic for my hair .. BUT, I found that I needed to shave and had forgotten my shave cream. I have *extremely* sensitive skin, as a rule I wouldn&#x27;t even attempt a shave on vacation.   Not having the proper shave cream, I thought, &amp;#34;why not, let me try&amp;#34; and used the Coconut Creme Cleansing Pudding to shave with … it was terrific as a shave cream! No irritation and the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever had - I was amazed!  This stuff is GREAT</li>
            <li> DONT Waste your money. I lost so much hair from the coconut cream conditioner AND coconut milk shampoo that I saw an Endocrinologist thinking I had developed a hormonal problem. After a battery of tests and hundreds of dollars my doctor said that it was my hair product line because all my tests were normal.  I didn&#x27;t believe her but went back to the Wen and my hair instantly stopped falling out. In one wash I could see the difference.  We really do get what we pay for and this product is not comparable to Wen.</li>
            <li> I used this product for a week now, the first couple times it left my hair soft, and a little greasy. The more I used it (various different day) it left my hair limp and really greasy, where I ended up stop using it and using something else. I didn&#x27;t like how greasy my hair looked and felt. It smells great however it didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this better than WEN, and so much cheaper too</li>
            <li> made my scalp burn not great its nothing like wen</li>
            <li> Great product leaves hair and scalp clean.</li>
            <li> Never used a cleansing conditioner before, and I enjoy it. Makes my hair soft and manageable, and I have some very think curly hair. Although I do not use for every wash, I feel as if there is too much build up, so I use regular shampoo in between (every 3-4 washes) then use the cleansing conditioner as a replacement to conditioner, and back to just cleansing again.</li>
