            <li>The good thing about this product, is the meshing.</li>
            <li>very pleased with the item.</li>
            <li>A good product as described and speedy delivery, making me a fully satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>It kind of starts to break up</li>
            <li>somehow i picked up two of these with good expectation and was not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li>I purchased two because that&#x27;s what I like most about these caps</li>
            <li>The material was more durable than the mesh</li>
            <li>I will say, however, that their response time to my emails was outstanding.</li>
            <li>It was easy to use and even worked better than a weaving cap.</li>
            <li>The elastic band makes sure it&#x27;s secure, and it doesn&#x27;t give me a headache.</li>
            <li>It allows you to easily place bobby pins to secure the weave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The caps were fine but</li>
            <li>The every cheaply made...</li>
            <li>It fit my head like a glove.</li>
            <li>This is a cheap knock off they are sending out</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, returning the item to the seller would result in my wasting more money (which is exactly what I believe they bank on {customers not returning the items &#x3D; they pocket your money}), so I&#x27;ll attempt to stitch an elastic band into it.</li>
            <li>Fits my medium/large sized head great (with a little room at the top).  </li>
            <li>So good luck getting your money back.</li>
            <li>Very nice product thought it wud be too small for my head</li>
            <li>I have bought this product many times but this time it came without the elastic band and the cap is tiny for any adults head.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend to anybody who are interested in buying this dome cap.</li>
            <li>, the cap does not hold up pretty well.</li>
            <li>If your head is tje size of a small child, good purchase.</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>how close knit it is, Doesn&#x27;t really allow my scalp to breathe.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product as I purchased 3 of each</li>
            <li>There is no elastic band around the cap which was my main reason for purchasing not one but 2.</li>
            <li>I have bought this exact same cap in the beauty supply stores and this one from Amazon is not the same one.</li>
            <li>The band was not too tight (fits just right).  </li>
            <li>I was first emailed their return policy and instructions, then later and email stating I&#x27;d be eligible for a partial refund and that the discrepancy in the cap was a change / error made by the manufacturer.</li>

            <li> It down at have the elastic band anymore.</li>
            <li> The every cheaply made...the stitching came unraveled at the seams the elastic is not a real elastic band because it to came unraveled just like knitted sweater</li>
            <li> I have bought this exact same cap in the beauty supply stores and this one from Amazon is not the same one. It does not have the elastic band around the head and it is really small. This is almost like a knock off!  I am not happy. I have used this cap several times but this one is so different and is a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> somehow i picked up two of these with good expectation and was not disappointed at all. fast shipping. and great for my wig making</li>
            <li> Low quality and weak elastic band</li>
            <li> This dome cap is NOT as pictured. The elastic band around the cap is missing.  I purchased two because that&#x27;s what I like most about these caps but it&#x27;s not what I got :-/</li>
            <li> The cap was perfect for making a wig. It fit my head like a glove. It was easy to use and even worked better than a weaving cap. Who would have thought.</li>
            <li> Horrible ! Not as pictured there is no band on the outside. Buy the cap from eBay as an alternative. Oh and this places is a scam the phone number goes to some ones personal line and they don&#x27;t pick up or answer voice mails. So good luck getting your money back. I know what this cap is supposed to look like and what they gave me was a heck no !</li>
            <li> I used if for my wig and I just don&#x27;t like how close knit it is, Doesn&#x27;t really allow my scalp to breathe. I did like the elastic band on the cap, very handy.</li>
            <li> If I could give no stars!!! I would this product is not as described at all! This is a cheap knock off they are sending out and now I have to go purchase a real one these people are scam artists and cheaps and they give amazon a bad name they should be kicked off.</li>
            <li> I use these to make my wigs &amp; they are great. The mesh makes the wigs breathable. The elastic band makes sure it&#x27;s secure, and it doesn&#x27;t give me a headache.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product many times but this time it came without the elastic band and the cap is tiny for any adults head. I contacted the company and they had the nerve to say to talk to the manufacture meanwhile they are the one false advertising with the old pictures not the &amp;#34;new design&amp;#34; will never buy anything from them and neither should you. Waste of my money</li>
            <li> This dome cap is NOT as pictured or described.  There is no elastic band around the cap which was my main reason for purchasing not one but 2. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> A good product as described and speedy delivery, making me a fully satisfied customer. I&#x27;d recommend to anybody who are interested in buying this dome cap.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t have the band. Very small and poor quality.</li>
            <li> When I opened it,it was already tearing. I could tell that it was not going to be durable so I had to sew that line again myself.</li>
            <li> Very nice product thought it wud be too small for my head but it was good, very good for upart wigs</li>
            <li> very pleased with the item.</li>
            <li> If your head is tje size of a small child, good purchase. Entirely too small.</li>
            <li> I ordered it in error. The good thing about this product, is the meshing. It allows you to easily place bobby pins to secure the weave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The down side, is if you make a mistake while sewing the weft on the mesh cap and you want to un-sew the weft, the cap does not hold up pretty well. It kind of starts to break up slightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This works well as a wig cap, it was a little too big but its sturdy and will last long</li>
            <li> The caps were fine but $$$$ for shipping was a complete rip-off. I ordered a qty of 10 caps and was charged shipping for EACH item instead of flat-rate shipping for the entire order. I was in a bind and needed the caps desperately so I had to get them. Otherwise, buy elsewhere. This seller is price gouging.</li>
            <li> The material was more durable than the mesh but the size was way small compared to other brands. The elastic band should be thinner as to avoid edge friction. I really wanted to like this product as I purchased 3 of each but that&#x27;s the risk I took.</li>
            <li> Arrived 2 days before delivery due date across the country.  Fits my medium/large sized head great (with a little room at the top).  The band was not too tight (fits just right).  Using this dome cap to create a half wig.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for the item in the photo, DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER! The item advertise has an elastic band - the one they sell and ship does not. I purchased two and, upon receipt, contacted the seller of the discrepancy. I was first emailed their return policy and instructions, then later and email stating I&#x27;d be eligible for a partial refund and that the discrepancy in the cap was a change / error made by the manufacturer. Why partial? I did my part by paying - the error is between the manufacturer and or the seller. Nonetheless, returning the item to the seller would result in my wasting more money (which is exactly what I believe they bank on {customers not returning the items &#x3D; they pocket your money}), so I&#x27;ll attempt to stitch an elastic band into it. Save your money and the frustration. I will say, however, that their response time to my emails was outstanding.</li>
