            <li> Great moisturizer, great smell.</li>
            <li> this is a light lotion that absorbs well and I am crazy about the fragrance.  If it doesn&#x27;t smell good to me I won&#x27;t use it....I have used the Malibu-Hemp for years and really like it.</li>
            <li> love this one the best!! and so did my boyfriend!</li>

            <li> Love it  and bitches love it ...u can get it at Walmart but to lazy lol</li>
            <li> Feels great, smells great. Just started using it, but I think I will continue to do so. $5 @ Walmart too instead of $15 on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I know the point of shopping online is so you don&#x27;t have to go to the store, but its for it for this product!  The best Lotion I have ever used.  You can but the 18 oz bottle at walmart for under 5 dollars!!!  It just doesnt make sense to me how its being sold for so much more here!  My local walmart was out so I decided to look online.  When I saw the price here on Amazon I decided to wait until Walmart had it in stock again!</li>
            <li> Good for dry skin and great smell</li>
            <li> I love this body lotion!!! It&#x27;s not readily available in most local stores. I was at a friend home on vacation in Miami and they bought it from BJ&#x27;s warehouse. Love the scent and how light it is.  Love it!</li>
            <li> You can get this same lotion and the same size at walmart for $4.97. Just FYI. I absolutely love this lotion and use it daily.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive legs after I shave. I never could put lotion on because it stings and turns red. I can put this on and I&#x27;m OK! It moisturizes without feeling greasy and smells so good. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I get extremely dry skin on my legs. It gets so bad at times my legs get sores on them and break open,  This lotion has cleared it up.  I use this once or twice a day and the legs are all cleared up.  It is wonderful.  The lotion here is over priced I paid $4.97 at Walmart and got an extra 6 ounces .</li>
            <li> Great product...great smell.</li>
            <li> Live in CA so need great lotion.</li>
            <li> LOVE this lotion. Light, pleasant scent, and leaves my hands super soft without feeling greasy. I do get it cheaper from Walmart, though.</li>

I actually use this now all the time.</li>
            <li> This lotion with hemp oil and other oils really moisturizes. It has healed my babies&#x27; diaper rash. I love it.</li>
