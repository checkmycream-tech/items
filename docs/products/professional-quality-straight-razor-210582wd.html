    <ol>
            <li>So I purchased this one based on the ratings and he is very happy to have this.</li>
            <li>Beautifully crafted!</li>
            <li>and I LOVED IT!</li>
            <li>Looks good, but makes no difference if it doesn&#x27;t manage to shave one hair off!</li>
            <li>This is the best butter knife I own.  </li>
            <li>This was a great buy.</li>
            <li>Also makes a great travel razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In a nutshell, for the price, this is a great blade for beginners to practice sharpening and honing.</li>
            <li>Very nice design for the scales/handle.  </li>
            <li>It did, however, arrive in good shape and in an acceptable amount of time.</li>
            <li>Good price .</li>
            <li>Needed some honing on a strop with chromium oxide, then a dip in the Barbicide, and gave good results.  </li>
            <li>Also, stropping just doesn&#x27;t replace a good hone.</li>
            <li>If you want a good razor and shave though do not buy this.</li>
            <li>A good knife (again, not a razor).</li>
            <li>This is a good letter opener but not something I want to shave my face with.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t ever get rid of it because it is a good blade.</li>
            <li>The seller was prompt, very kind and considerate, and gave an honest description.</li>
            <li>Good product, very pleased.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice for a knife collection</li>
            <li>Nice Product.</li>
            <li>get a nice stone and a strop</li>
            <li>Came quickly, looked great, nice finish. ..</li>
            <li>My son just uses it as a display now as it is a very attractive razor, but as far as usefulness</li>
            <li>The wood and stainless steel are beautiful.</li>
            <li>The company that makes these razors make them more for a knife value thana shaving value.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It sharpened well and keeps and edge (IMPORTANT !)  </li>
            <li>I purchased this razor a month or so ago and still have not been able to shave with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You&#x27;re better off throwing it at targets in your backyard.</li>
            <li>Well it looks kind of cool, but this blade is junk.</li>
            <li>It has a good feel and weight and is a good razor for starting.</li>
            <li>Best shave I could get was very mediocre at best.</li>
            <li>I should add that my beard is anything BUT easy to shave.</li>
            <li>If your beard is easy to shave, you might be in luck with this</li>
            <li>Looks great, good weight, sharp right out of the box.</li>
            <li>The razor needed to be sharpened a little more but it worked very nicely and the style is suitable for any man.</li>
            <li>I have always liked the look and feel of a straight razor.</li>
            <li>It does have a nice feel in the hand and seems to be very sturdy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a sturdy construction, a well balanced feel, and a nice classic look to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Another great thing about this razor is if you screw this one up the price is cheap and the lesson you learned cost you a few bucks, Screw up a good dovo razor and your out big bucks, this is a good learner razor to use before you advance to a higher priced razor</li>
            <li>This peice is at best decorative, not appropriate for use as a razor.</li>
            <li>No cuts from it on my face, but it just would not shave my face clean.</li>
            <li>Keep them clean and oil because they will rust from the oils from you skin.</li>
            <li>this razor is stainless which hopefully stands up to water better than carbon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true in this case, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Now that I finally have a good edge on it</li>
            <li>Nicely made just needed sharpening, which is normal for first time use.  </li>
            <li>Sharpened it, examined it under a microscope for proper sharpened edge, check for folding of the edge, stropped the edge to make sure it was nice and straight.</li>
            <li>Its clearly not the sharpest blade ever, its just stainless steel, but for the price its a great starter blade.  </li>
            <li>cheap, functional, presentable, and very usable blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My advice is to not waste your money on this instrument, buy a better quality one.</li>
            <li>I read the other reviews for this item and decided it would be a good buy.   </li>
            <li>but I have notice the edge giving way at times in divots a perfect sign or cheap dirty steel.</li>
            <li>Actually, i&#x27;d have better luck shaving with a butter knife than this junk.</li>
            <li>A heavy, well made device - surprising, for the cost.  </li>
            <li>Nice and sharp but needs to be honed before use.  </li>
            <li>Takes a bit of effort to get shave ready, but I think it will be worth it as a travel straight razor.</li>
            <li>One positive note for this unattractive razor is the fact that TSA agents haven&#x27;t tried to steal it from my checked luggage yet.</li>
            <li>Strong enough to even pry with.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking to get into straight edge shaving for a long period, this is a good starter, but you&#x27;ll likely want something nicer in the longrun.</li>
            <li>The razor had a good feel to it, but despite sharpening, the blade always seemed a bit dull for me.</li>
            <li>When a person sees a straight razor...</li>
            <li>The metal is stainless steel made in china and cannot hold an edge at all.  </li>
            <li>This is a stainless steel razor from China.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s stainless.  </li>
            <li>Spend the money on a real razor(dovo).</li>
            <li>fast shippping</li>
            <li>it flakes off when I try to strop it straight.</li>
            <li>For a starter blade, I would just recommend looking into the disposable blade straight razors.</li>
            <li>I have learned that you don&#x27;t buy Stainless Steel Straight Razors.</li>
            <li>I would recommend a sturdy straight razor with disposable blades over this.</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t know it at the time, but this razor has a stainless steel blade.  </li>
            <li>Will try to buy a better quality razor from Amazon in the near future.</li>
            <li>I bought this to get my fingers wet on sharpening straight razors and hoping it would be good enough.</li>
            <li>It left little stubble that I could shave off with a good safety razor by going over my face again.</li>
            <li>It is well finished, but just too soft to sharpen properly for a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li>After receiving it, I remembered what had been said in the other reviews about sharpening it, and set about to doing it myself with a good quality wet stone I had purchased</li>
            <li>Practice honning and stropping those, if you can use a disposable blade long term with proper upkeep, keep it as a travel razor and get yourself something nice for proper shaving after you have perfected honing and stropping.</li>
            <li>but i am glad i practiced stropping and honing on a cheap razor rather than learning an expensive lesson.</li>
            <li>The blade is unhoned, and to thick to sharpen to a true shave worthy edge.</li>
            <li>they are like wow!</li>
            <li>First off, the blade was very sharp right out of the box.</li>
            <li>My low rating is the steel is very cheap and the blade edge and back edge are not straight.</li>
            <li>Sharp enough to shave my arm hair easily.</li>
            <li>I knew that I was asking for trouble by purchasing a blade this cheap.  </li>
            <li>I have coarse hair and require a much sharper blade.</li>
            <li>The shipping and handling was almost as much as the razor, which was my only regret with the product.  </li>
            <li>I think its possible to get this to the absolute minimum of shaving quality and hence &amp;#34;usable&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Blade is solid stainless steel.  </li>
            <li>I was really surprised by the quality and weight of this blade.</li>
            <li>I need to shave everyday, and I&#x27;ll give this thing some time, but due to its price, I just may buy one or two more!</li>
            <li>Bought this as my first razor, i did plenty of research about straight razors, shaving, stropping, and honing, and I still managed to mess it up.</li>
            <li>The straight razor was of decent quality, sharpened well, but I am not good at hitting certain places on my face with a straight razor.  </li>
            <li>This is very heavy, it does not have a cheap plastic handle, it folds like a knife</li>
            <li>I had recently ordered a straight razor for my boyfriend that was different than this one.</li>
            <li>Not Sharp at all.</li>
            <li>I have spent many hours with 200-800 grain diamond sharpeners doing major grinding and currently working it with 4000/8000 japanese wet stone.</li>
            <li>I took it to get completely re-honed, hoping that would help, but in no time at all it was back to a cull edge.  </li>
            <li>Just to reiterate, the steel is too soft to sharpen to a proper edge.</li>
            <li>Yea it looks pretty, but if it doesn&#x27;t work it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li>He has tried unsuccessfully to sharpen it himself and then took it to a professional who tried but told him to forget it as it would not sharpen to the level needed to actually shave.  </li>
            <li>My face on the other hand, not so much.</li>
            <li>I then decided to take it downtown to a store that professionally sharpens strait razor and there I was told that the blade itself is too thick to hold an edge for very long and it wasn&#x27;t worth the price to sharpen it as the edge would soon be gone.     </li>

            <li> Spend a little extra and get a decent razor.</li>
            <li> Their are few people that really know how to sharpen and use a straight razor properly, and not  many places on the web gives you all the facts you need to know.</li>
            <li> Looks can be deceiving came sharp but not sharp enough shave</li>
            <li> and I have quite a few old carbon steel razors that I have to keep an eye on that they don&#x27;t rust.</li>
            <li> I wound up sending the other back and purchasing this one</li>
            <li> It tuggs at the hair because it does not come sharp enough.</li>
            <li> doesnt come sharp enough to shave with.</li>
            <li> I did finally succeed in getting a sharp edge on the razor and now I use it to shave my head.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my husband on our 1st wedding anniversary, he has been wanting one for a very long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, heavy, sharp (enough to cut fabrics but not to shave with), and stainless.</li>
            <li> The joint is so tight that it takes and unreasonable amount of fouce to open it.</li>
            <li> Stainless blades are very hard to sharpen and then hold an edge</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great buy for beginners or the curious</li>
            <li> I am NOT rating for its lack of an edge by default because no straight razors out there have this.</li>
            <li> Some of the edge is now border line minimal shaving quality</li>
            <li> The blade is heavy enough to tackle the hair on my noggin and not lose the edge before I finish shaving.</li>
            <li> my fault for not checking further or missing it if it was listed in the description.  </li>
            <li> But, not shaving sharp.</li>
            <li> I can press my thumb on the blade and drag it across with no sign of an injury!  </li>
            <li> If they come sharp</li>
            <li> but it was still too dull to shave with after several tries.     </li>
            <li> Dull, even after sharpening and honing multiple times, unusable.</li>
            <li> The item I received will never hold a proper fin, as the blade it too thick, and any time I come close to forming a fin</li>
            <li> and it is very sharp.</li>
            <li> &quot; half-hollow ground Dovo&#x27;s pin bent and plastic handle broke off after less than 6 months.</li>
            <li> well if I mess up the blade, so what.</li>
            <li> As of now I am now looking for a new razor as this one is totally useless.</li>
            <li> Waste of money, but</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> And even then it tugged and pulled and generally did a mediocre job.  </li>
            <li> I said, not a great razor for long term every day use;</li>
            <li> It is stainless steel and very difficult to hone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed with this, especially watching my husband so excited trying to use it and trying to hide his disappointment in my Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your hard earned money.</li>
            <li> Very dull blade and the handle is heavy</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really hard to re-sharpen them.</li>
            <li> The hollow-grind is too shallow, and the steel is too brittle.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all.</li>
            <li> No issues with shipping other than the stupid USPS losing my package for a week, but that had nothing to do with the shipper.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s no Dovo, but my 5/8\\</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just an awkward knife.</li>
            <li> im a beginner user, but I still feel that this was a bad buy.</li>
            <li> This thing is crap and will not hold an edge!</li>

            <li> This is the best butter knife I own.  Actually, i&#x27;d have better luck shaving with a butter knife than this junk. Waste of money, but I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my husband on our 1st wedding anniversary, he has been wanting one for a very long time. So I purchased this one based on the ratings and he is very happy to have this. The razor needed to be sharpened a little more but it worked very nicely and the style is suitable for any man.</li>
            <li> I have always liked the look and feel of a straight razor. When a person sees a straight razor...they are like wow! The company that makes these razors make them more for a knife value thana shaving value. This is very heavy, it does not have a cheap plastic handle, it folds like a knife would and it is very sharp. But, not shaving sharp. It&#x27;s nice for a knife collection and you can&#x27;t beat the price. I simply like holding it and feeling the weight and quality of it. I love it.</li>
            <li> Well, you get what you pay for I suppose.  I knew that I was asking for trouble by purchasing a blade this cheap.  The metal is stainless steel made in china and cannot hold an edge at all.  If I want to shave with this razor I must constantly sharpen it before and after.  And even then it tugged and pulled and generally did a mediocre job.  I took it to get completely re-honed, hoping that would help, but in no time at all it was back to a cull edge.  It looks like a razor, but I&#x27;m thinking about using it as a butter knife.</li>
            <li> Came quickly, looked great, nice finish. .. This is a stainless steel razor from China. It is well finished, but just too soft to sharpen properly for a comfortable shave. This instrument shaves like a a used safety razor that your wife (or mine) has used to shave both of her legs. No cuts from it on my face, but it just would not shave my face clean. It left little stubble that I could shave off with a good safety razor by going over my face again. Sharpened it, examined it under a microscope for proper sharpened edge, check for folding of the edge, stropped the edge to make sure it was nice and straight. .. Best shave I could get was very mediocre at best. Just to reiterate, the steel is too soft to sharpen to a proper edge. it tears rather than sharpens. Will try to buy a better quality razor from Amazon in the near future. My advice is to not waste your money on this instrument, buy a better quality one. I should add that my beard is anything BUT easy to shave. I have coarse hair and require a much sharper blade. If your beard is easy to shave, you might be in luck with this instrument.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards, D. Paganelli</li>
            <li> Their are few people that really know how to sharpen and use a straight razor properly, and not  many places on the web gives you all the facts you need to know. one great thing about this razor is that it is stainless, water is a razors worst enemy and I have quite a few old carbon steel razors that I have to keep an eye on that they don&#x27;t rust. this razor is stainless which hopefully stands up to water better than carbon.Another great thing about this razor is if you screw this one up the price is cheap and the lesson you learned cost you a few bucks, Screw up a good dovo razor and your out big bucks, this is a good learner razor to use before you advance to a higher priced razor</li>
            <li> I bought this item to try and save money and hassles with throw away safety razors.  The straight razor was of decent quality, sharpened well, but I am not good at hitting certain places on my face with a straight razor.  Haven&#x27;t cut myself \\&quot;yet\\&quot; but I think I&#x27;ll quit while I&#x27;m ahead.  The shipping and handling was almost as much as the razor, which was my only regret with the product.  It did, however, arrive in good shape and in an acceptable amount of time.</li>
            <li> I had recently ordered a straight razor for my boyfriend that was different than this one. I wound up sending the other back and purchasing this one and I LOVED IT! Beautifully crafted! The wood and stainless steel are beautiful. I highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> This was a great buy. It sharpened well and keeps and edge (IMPORTANT !)  Good price . no problems and it is well made too.</li>
            <li> Nicely made just needed sharpening, which is normal for first time use.  Nice Product.</li>
            <li> 4 out of 5: Overall the quality isn&#x27;t going to turn any heads, but it&#x27;s a cheap, functional, presentable, and very usable blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking to get into straight edge shaving for a long period, this is a good starter, but you&#x27;ll likely want something nicer in the longrun. Also makes a great travel razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, it can&#x27;t be beat. It&#x27;s got a sturdy construction, a well balanced feel, and a nice classic look to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, not a great razor for long term every day use; but I can&#x27;t complain for the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great buy for beginners or the curious</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews for this item and decided it would be a good buy.   After receiving it, I remembered what had been said in the other reviews about sharpening it, and set about to doing it myself with a good quality wet stone I had purchased but it was still too dull to shave with after several tries.     I then decided to take it downtown to a store that professionally sharpens strait razor and there I was told that the blade itself is too thick to hold an edge for very long and it wasn&#x27;t worth the price to sharpen it as the edge would soon be gone.     As of now I am now looking for a new razor as this one is totally useless.</li>
            <li> So, if you are going to buy this, you will need to hone it, and hone it a lot.  It is duller than a butter knife.  I can press my thumb on the blade and drag it across with no sign of an injury!  However, I did cut my hand yesterday with a butter knife in my kitchen.  Not happy at all.</li>
            <li> A heavy, well made device - surprising, for the cost.  Needed some honing on a strop with chromium oxide, then a dip in the Barbicide, and gave good results.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s no Dovo, but my 5/8\\&quot; half-hollow ground Dovo&#x27;s pin bent and plastic handle broke off after less than 6 months. This thing is built like a tank in weight comparison!  Plus it&#x27;s stainless.  I need to shave everyday, and I&#x27;ll give this thing some time, but due to its price, I just may buy one or two more!</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp but needs to be honed before use.  Also, stropping just doesn&#x27;t replace a good hone. It does have a nice feel in the hand and seems to be very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Spend the money on a real razor(dovo). This thing is crap and will not hold an edge! I will be dropping the money on something that will actually shave and counting the money lost on this as a lesson learned.</li>
            <li> The product was in terrific condition. The seller was prompt, very kind and considerate, and gave an honest description. Would definitely do business again!</li>
            <li> Looks good, but makes no difference if it doesn&#x27;t manage to shave one hair off! Paid $10 to have it sharpened at a cutlery sharpening store in the shops of willow bend in Dallas, still did not shave at all. I&#x27;m so disappointed with this, especially watching my husband so excited trying to use it and trying to hide his disappointment in my Christmas gift. Don&#x27;t waste your hard earned money.</li>
            <li> Its clearly not the sharpest blade ever, its just stainless steel, but for the price its a great starter blade.  fast shippping</li>
            <li> I bought this to get my fingers wet on sharpening straight razors and hoping it would be good enough. I am NOT rating for its lack of an edge by default because no straight razors out there have this. My low rating is the steel is very cheap and the blade edge and back edge are not straight. I have spent many hours with 200-800 grain diamond sharpeners doing major grinding and currently working it with 4000/8000 japanese wet stone. Some of the edge is now border line minimal shaving quality but I have notice the edge giving way at times in divots a perfect sign or cheap dirty steel. I think its possible to get this to the absolute minimum of shaving quality and hence &amp;#34;usable&amp;#34;. If you want a good razor and shave though do not buy this.</li>
            <li> The hollow-grind is too shallow, and the steel is too brittle. The item I received will never hold a proper fin, as the blade it too thick, and any time I come close to forming a fin it flakes off when I try to strop it straight. It&#x27;s just an awkward knife.</li>
            <li> This is not a shaving razor.  I did not buy it to shave with.  I bought it for and use as a utility knife..  It&#x27;s thick, heavy, sharp (enough to cut fabrics but not to shave with), and stainless. Strong enough to even pry with.  A good knife (again, not a razor).</li>
            <li> The razor had a good feel to it, but despite sharpening, the blade always seemed a bit dull for me. For a starter blade, I would just recommend looking into the disposable blade straight razors.</li>
            <li> Looks can be deceiving came sharp but not sharp enough shave tried to shave with it but didn&#x27;t work . So I bought different type of sharpeners waist of time . Just left it in box</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor a month or so ago and still have not been able to shave with it. It has no edge on it. I have tried sharpening it but no luck. Do not waist your money on it. It&#x27;s true in this case, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Good product, very pleased. Would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Not Sharp at all. I have learned that you don&#x27;t buy Stainless Steel Straight Razors. If they come sharp it&#x27;s really hard to re-sharpen them. Stick with Carbon Steel Razors. Keep them clean and oil because they will rust from the oils from you skin.</li>
            <li> Dull, even after sharpening and honing multiple times, unusable. Do not buy this razor. Waste of money. Spend a little extra and get a decent razor.</li>
            <li> Bought this as my first razor, i did plenty of research about straight razors, shaving, stropping, and honing, and I still managed to mess it up. It tuggs at the hair because it does not come sharp enough. I ruined the blade trying to sharpen it but i am glad i practiced stropping and honing on a cheap razor rather than learning an expensive lesson. It has a good feel and weight and is a good razor for starting. I would recommend a sturdy straight razor with disposable blades over this. Practice honning and stropping those, if you can use a disposable blade long term with proper upkeep, keep it as a travel razor and get yourself something nice for proper shaving after you have perfected honing and stropping.</li>
            <li> This is a good letter opener but not something I want to shave my face with. Don&#x27;t waist your money on this.</li>
            <li> Very nice design for the scales/handle.  Blade is solid stainless steel.  Takes a bit of effort to get shave ready, but I think it will be worth it as a travel straight razor.</li>
            <li> Razer was dauler than a butter knofe I don&#x27;t even know if it can be sharpened to hold a razor edge</li>
            <li> I was really surprised by the quality and weight of this blade. I purchased this blade to practice sharpening, thinking, well if I mess up the blade, so what. First off, the blade was very sharp right out of the box. Sharp enough to shave my arm hair easily. My face on the other hand, not so much. I purchased another blade in the same price range that doesn&#x27;t even compare to this one. In a nutshell, for the price, this is a great blade for beginners to practice sharpening and honing. Looks great, good weight, sharp right out of the box. No issues with shipping other than the stupid USPS losing my package for a week, but that had nothing to do with the shipper.</li>
            <li> im a beginner user, but I still feel that this was a bad buy. Very dull blade and the handle is heavy</li>
            <li> Well it looks kind of cool, but this blade is junk. It can not be sharpened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re better off throwing it at targets in your backyard.</li>
            <li> doesnt come sharp enough to shave with. just FYI. get a nice stone and a strop</li>
            <li> The joint is so tight that it takes and unreasonable amount of fouce to open it. The blade is a knifes edge not a razors edge. Yea it looks pretty, but if it doesn&#x27;t work it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor in 2012. It is stainless steel and very difficult to hone. I did finally succeed in getting a sharp edge on the razor and now I use it to shave my head. I use a Dovo and a Gold Dollar 208 to shave my face. The blade is heavy enough to tackle the hair on my noggin and not lose the edge before I finish shaving. Now that I finally have a good edge on it I won&#x27;t ever get rid of it because it is a good blade. One positive note for this unattractive razor is the fact that TSA agents haven&#x27;t tried to steal it from my checked luggage yet.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t know it at the time, but this razor has a stainless steel blade.  my fault for not checking further or missing it if it was listed in the description.  Stainless blades are very hard to sharpen and then hold an edge and this one was a gift for my son.  He has tried unsuccessfully to sharpen it himself and then took it to a professional who tried but told him to forget it as it would not sharpen to the level needed to actually shave.  My son just uses it as a display now as it is a very attractive razor, but as far as usefulness i&#x27;d give it a &amp;#34;0&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This peice is at best decorative, not appropriate for use as a razor. The blade is unhoned, and to thick to sharpen to a true shave worthy edge.</li>
