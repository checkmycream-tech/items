            <li>The perfumy smell was overwhelming.</li>

            <li>These people need to better.</li>
            <li>love them</li>
            <li>I was hoping for more with these.  </li>
            <li>I used it two times, and yes I felt my eyes more relaxed.</li>
            <li>and I love them.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>so I bought more</li>
            <li>I had to cut the mask to be able to see.  </li>
            <li>this is good one, but I find other one the price is lower, also is very good for skin.</li>
            <li>This product does a great job super moisturizing the upper lid (creases all but gone now) and greatly reduced puffy under-eye bags.</li>
            <li>This mask is good, I found it very relaxing.</li>
            <li>Their attitude is good and respond email fast .</li>
            <li>I liked this product as it is easy to use and it has good price comparing doing the same mask at beauty salon</li>
            <li>They weren&#x27;t something I&#x27;d normally buy, but the feedback was good.</li>
            <li>I guess if you have to lie down that would be fine, but I was not that impressed.</li>
            <li>I guess it works fine.</li>
            <li>The quality is fine but the shape isn&#x27;t made to fit every eye.</li>
            <li>This is a HUGE plus.</li>
            <li>Fabulous product</li>
            <li>and I have really enjoy using them.  </li>
            <li>i am 45 do far so good</li>
            <li>Still using it , but so far so good .</li>
            <li>and it significantly reduces any puffiness and swelling around my eyes.</li>
            <li>It is comfy to put under the eyes, but I did not see any significant differences before and after using it.</li>
            <li>I will use it three times in a week and my eye area looks and feels soft and amazing.</li>
            <li>I also have the full face ones which work wonders.</li>
            <li>These eye masks looked really cool</li>
            <li>The full face ones do the trick, and I like those a lot</li>
            <li>, my eyes felt good the next morning.</li>
            <li>If I was buying one mask I would not expect to get something for just one eye therefore in this instance I do not expect to get 5, I expect the full 10</li>
            <li>If I was buying one mask I would not expect to get something for just one eye therefore in this instance I do not expect to get 5, I expect the full 10 masks.</li>
            <li>Really cooling and refreshing when you use them cooled.</li>
            <li>It would have saved me ordering money &amp; time if there was full disclosure of all</li>
            <li>They fit just right and did everything article said they would do.</li>
            <li>that you can CUT these to fit the right SIZE of your EYE</li>
            <li>The whole point of these is to have a relaxing experience and that was ruined by that strong smell.</li>
            <li>works fine, might orders some more in the near future, will recommend to friends and family members, price is ok</li>
            <li>As far as how effective I really can&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are fun and relaxing for a home spa day, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li>When you wake up in the morning your face looks dewey and fresh.  </li>
            <li>This item gave me a cool stimulation when I first applied them...</li>
            <li>i noticed the differences right away</li>
            <li>This is an interesting product that has a good concept behind it.  </li>
            <li>how super fast they work</li>
            <li>Product was exactly what it said it was.  </li>
            <li>I think they are worth a try for anyone with allergy issues, very soothing.</li>
            <li>I could not monitor ganges from the first package ,because of my friends they consume them all.</li>
            <li>, I think they are pretty overpriced.</li>
            <li>The products could be much better if it had a bigger hole for the eye.  </li>
            <li>however, I did not see any recognizable change in the appearance of how my under eye looked (after using all five pairs).</li>
            <li>If you really need one for your eyes, this is the right one.</li>
            <li>I used this product so far 2 times and really like it, product makes eye area very fresh.</li>
            <li>These are really good they are hard to stay in spot.  </li>
            <li>I feel my eyes look much nicer.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do much and doesn&#x27;t stay on very well.</li>
            <li>Very soothing....</li>
            <li>I also worry about what is really in these.  </li>
            <li>I really like these.  </li>
            <li>I really like these masks.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>After questioning the seller, they are very polite and re-send another package without asking for a proof.  </li>
            <li>They have a very cooling feeling on the eyes.</li>
            <li>Product description is misleading, you are not getting 10 whole masks you are getting 5..</li>
            <li>Product description is misleading, you are not getting 10 whole masks you are getting 5..</li>
            <li>the masks work very well</li>
            <li>LIKE SO MUCH</li>
            <li>I had to cut them to fit my big eyes.</li>
            <li>And since I bought the full face pads of the same composition, I didn&#x27;t really need these.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to having something cool to cover your eyes anyway, after a long hard day of looking at the computer.</li>
            <li>They do much more for the puffiness then the dark circles, though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unable to locate a full ingredient list disclosure before purchasing the product, &amp; one of the ingredients I intentionally sought to avoid was present, the xenoestrogen paraben family&#x27;s methylparaben.</li>
            <li>Made me feel like a whole new man.</li>
            <li>Messy and there are better products out there.</li>
            <li>Even if I only got one use out of it - it would be worth it.</li>
            <li>If everyone becomes educated on product ingredients detrimental to the human body, it will help with disorder &amp; disease so many people don&#x27;t have to learn through the long route of troublesome trial-and-error.</li>
            <li>I have only just started using this product, I liked the way it helped the puffiness go down.</li>
            <li>so I could get free shipping with my other items but let me tell you to start that it says &amp;#34;10 masks&amp;#34</li>
            <li>They are tough to get into postion, but your eyes feel great the next morning.</li>
            <li>i was very surprised</li>
            <li>Definitely buying more when I can and other products as well.</li>
            <li>They have lots of clear juice in the package that keeps these things hydrated</li>
            <li>ordered some for my daughter who is 27 years old this month can&#x27;t wait to hear what you think</li>
            <li>so far I haven&#x27;t noticed any drastic changes</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I use natural progesterone (Progestelle)</li>
            <li>They are floppy and goopy, so have a towel or paper towel near you when using this product.</li>
            <li>It would be better to leave this out of products because it sends a signal a high dosage of estrogen was received, setting off an enormous chain reaction in the body: as in my case before I was educated on the paraben xenoestrogens/hormone disrupters, I had repeated endometriosis (among other estrogen-dominance related things going on at the same time).</li>
            <li>silky soft.i have fine lines after just 1 use no more lines..</li>
            <li>The only reason I ordered this product was to complete an order over $35</li>
            <li>now regularly to keep estrogen-dominance issues in check, but the detrimental effects of using the known xenoestrogens like the paraben families cannot be overcome with just natural progesterone.</li>
            <li>I feel that my eyes benefit from them when they are tired and need refreshing.</li>
            <li>worked very well with my dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth risking trying again, because of the labeling on the package being so amateur.</li>

            <li> After questioning the seller, they are very polite and re-send another package without asking for a proof.  </li>
            <li> They have a very cooling feeling on the eyes.</li>
            <li> Product description is misleading, you are not getting 10 whole masks you are getting 5..</li>
            <li> Product description is misleading, you are not getting 10 whole masks you are getting 5..</li>
            <li> the masks work very well</li>
            <li> LIKE SO MUCH</li>
            <li> I had to cut them to fit my big eyes.</li>
            <li> And since I bought the full face pads of the same composition, I didn&#x27;t really need these.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to having something cool to cover your eyes anyway, after a long hard day of looking at the computer.</li>
            <li> They do much more for the puffiness then the dark circles, though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unable to locate a full ingredient list disclosure before purchasing the product, &amp; one of the ingredients I intentionally sought to avoid was present, the xenoestrogen paraben family&#x27;s methylparaben.</li>
            <li> Made me feel like a whole new man.</li>
            <li> Messy and there are better products out there.</li>
            <li> Even if I only got one use out of it - it would be worth it.</li>
            <li> If everyone becomes educated on product ingredients detrimental to the human body, it will help with disorder &amp; disease so many people don&#x27;t have to learn through the long route of troublesome trial-and-error.</li>
            <li> I have only just started using this product, I liked the way it helped the puffiness go down.</li>
            <li> so I could get free shipping with my other items but let me tell you to start that it says &amp;#34;10 masks&amp;#34</li>
            <li> They are tough to get into postion, but your eyes feel great the next morning.</li>
            <li> i was very surprised</li>
            <li> Definitely buying more when I can and other products as well.</li>
            <li> They have lots of clear juice in the package that keeps these things hydrated</li>
            <li> ordered some for my daughter who is 27 years old this month can&#x27;t wait to hear what you think</li>
            <li> so far I haven&#x27;t noticed any drastic changes</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I use natural progesterone (Progestelle)</li>
            <li> They are floppy and goopy, so have a towel or paper towel near you when using this product.</li>
            <li> It would be better to leave this out of products because it sends a signal a high dosage of estrogen was received, setting off an enormous chain reaction in the body: as in my case before I was educated on the paraben xenoestrogens/hormone disrupters, I had repeated endometriosis (among other estrogen-dominance related things going on at the same time).</li>
            <li> silky soft.i have fine lines after just 1 use no more lines..</li>
            <li> The only reason I ordered this product was to complete an order over $35</li>
            <li> now regularly to keep estrogen-dominance issues in check, but the detrimental effects of using the known xenoestrogens like the paraben families cannot be overcome with just natural progesterone.</li>
            <li> I feel that my eyes benefit from them when they are tired and need refreshing.</li>
            <li> worked very well with my dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth risking trying again, because of the labeling on the package being so amateur.</li>
            <li> I would probably use them once or twice a week if they were less expensive, but I can&#x27;t justify the expense and use them before special occasions when I want to look fresh and awake at night.</li>
            <li> I am an Asian mix 50 year old with slightly, droopy upper-lid and puffy under-eye bags.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure what role the patches really play.  </li>
            <li> so if you&#x27;re careful when you open it and store it lying flat, the juice will stay in the trays and you can out these back in for the next time you want to use it.</li>
            <li> The instructions in the package are not clear, need improvements.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but this is actually quite funny &amp; should be addressed for those of us that are into skin care, but aren&#x27;t asian.</li>
            <li> The product works as expected, but end up cutting the top part.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it helps with the dark circles, but two out of three, especially at this price.</li>
            <li> but once you have them on you really do not notice.</li>
            <li> I promptly returned the facial mask, fearing I would suffocate in that heavy smell.</li>
            <li> Not sure they have any actual benefit beyond just feeling pampered when you use them.</li>
            <li> , I cut where they were too small to accommodate my larger cat shaped eyes.</li>
            <li> There are other eye masks I&#x27;d recommend before this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other eye patches that you can wear around (who has 30 mins to just lie down?)</li>
            <li> I tried other expensive product didn&#x27;t do as much job as this one did.</li>
            <li> Dark circles were cleared and the area was hydrated .</li>
            <li> I have NEVER had allergy issues, but this year, I find myself with itchy eyes, bags and dark circles.  </li>
            <li> Others had complained about them being messy but, having used similar before, I expected that.</li>
            <li> I have dark circles below my eyes.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of gel eye masks &amp; have been trying different varieties lately.  </li>
            <li> None the less</li>
            <li> I put them on for about a half hour</li>
            <li> (of course this is much less relaxing.)</li>
            <li> I also feel the description is a little misleading.</li>
            <li> Stung my eye a little</li>
            <li> But after a few minutes I had to remove them.</li>

            <li> Wondering if Amazon knows if this company selling these products that have poor English translation meets importing labeling requirements.  </li>
            <li> or they tend to slide off, though I have managed to use them sitting up if you push them up every few minutes</li>

            <li> Past review written.</li>
            <li> The enclosed oval shape of these are not appropriate unless you have small eyes which I don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> With in one use my dark circles decreased by like 50%.</li>
            <li> Very messy and hard to handle.</li>
            <li> The instructions of the packages are so bad, the translations are almost non-understandable and they aren&#x27;t even complete.</li>
            <li> These Collagen gel eye patches work miracles (well at least for  </li>
            <li> No more bags under eyes!</li>
            <li> The packages themselves are very difficult to open and if you expect to be with your eyes out like the lady from the picture advertised, you&#x27;re gonna lose my friend because the eye-hole of the mask is very small.</li>
            <li> My only negative comment is the price on these bad boys</li>
            <li> so did not expect such a painful reaction.</li>
            <li> It as difficult to get it to say on - kept sliding off and did not fit my face.</li>
            <li> The product is of poor quality and not as thick as the picture.</li>
            <li> Not sure if they are working, they a difficult to get set on your eyes</li>
            <li> The only reason I will not return this is because I hate to be going to the post office, ect but lord jesus...</li>
            <li> These were way too thin.  </li>
            <li> I am not a happy buyer and will not buy from them again.</li>
            <li> Sits weird on eyes.</li>
            <li> Disappointment......</li>
            <li> bad smell</li>

            <li> Not sure if they are working, they a difficult to get set on your eyes but once you have them on you really do not notice. As far as how effective I really can&lt;br /&gt;t say because I only use them once a week.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t wait to get more</li>
            <li> The eye holes are tiny, &amp; didn&#x27;t trust the ingredients, threw them in the trash</li>
            <li> Very good product.  I feel my eyes look much nicer.  Not the darkness I had before.  I will be purchasing more!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much and doesn&#x27;t stay on very well. Better products on the market</li>
            <li> Shipping time was awesome!  Product was exactly what it said it was.  Quality product as well and the price was very low!</li>
            <li> I seriously love this product. With in one use my dark circles decreased by like 50%. I even bought some for a friend. Will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> Great Seller, Great Product! A++++++</li>
            <li> Fabulous product I love the moisture eyes</li>
            <li> Wonderful mask! Dark circles were cleared and the area was hydrated .</li>
            <li> Feels silky soft.i have fine lines after just 1 use no more lines..i am 45 do far so good&lt;br /&gt;I ordered some for my daughter who is 27 years old this month can&#x27;t wait to hear what you think</li>
            <li> They won&#x27;t stay on and they&#x27;re too small to go around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have only just started using this product, I liked the way it helped the puffiness go down. Good price and arrived on time. Thank you</li>
            <li> Very refreshing.  I have NEVER had allergy issues, but this year, I find myself with itchy eyes, bags and dark circles.  These are VERY refreshing and I feel that they are helping with the issues that I&#x27;m having.  I wouldn&#x27;t say, OMG, it&#x27;s a miracle, but I do find that they are helping with puffiness.  I think they are worth a try for anyone with allergy issues, very soothing.</li>
            <li> Still using it , but so far so good . I could not monitor ganges from the first package ,because of my friends they consume them all. But, I&#x27;ll order another pack for sure.</li>
            <li> Very soothing....I am very happy with purchase. They fit just right and did everything article said they would do. I look forward to purchasing more</li>
            <li> I ordered these eye masks (along with the facial mask). Others had complained about them being messy but, having used similar before, I expected that. They felt great. But after a few minutes I had to remove them. The perfumy smell was overwhelming. The whole point of these is to have a relaxing experience and that was ruined by that strong smell. I promptly returned the facial mask, fearing I would suffocate in that heavy smell. Advice: test on a small package before investing.</li>
            <li> These are fun and relaxing for a home spa day, but that&#x27;s about it. Not sure they have any actual benefit beyond just feeling pampered when you use them.</li>
            <li> Only thing is every persons eye is not same shape&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have almond shaped green eyes and my eyes are large.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Know that you can CUT these to fit the right SIZE of your EYE , I cut where they were too small to accommodate my larger cat shaped eyes. they take away puffiness I use am and pm to sleep in at times too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No bad smell either I like them</li>
            <li> this is good one, but I find other one the price is lower, also is very good for skin.</li>
            <li> My eyes got very red and irritated when I used this product. Lots of liquid in package--can&#x27;t keep it from running in eyes.</li>
            <li> They are okay but tear easy&lt;br /&gt;Eyes do feel better after.&lt;br /&gt;They feel more hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep using them.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep using them.</li>
            <li> I love, love these eye masks.  They&#x27;re very relaxing, a great price and were delivered on schedule.  I use about once per week and I have really enjoy using them.  They help hydrate the eye area and relax the puffiness.  I would recommend these and expect that they&#x27;ll help with hydration in the eye area over time.</li>
            <li> Wondering if Amazon knows if this company selling these products that have poor English translation meets importing labeling requirements.  I also worry about what is really in these.  None the less, I tried it once. I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement of my skin.  It didn&#x27;t burn my eyes or anything.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth risking trying again, because of the labeling on the package being so amateur.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I love how it makes my eyes feel and look. Definitely buying more when I can and other products as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and was very disappointed. The packaging is very cheap looking. Just in a ziplock bag, not a box or anything. had to send it back</li>
            <li> I really like these.  I feel that my eyes benefit from them when they are tired and need refreshing. Usually, I will do one once a week.  It seems to work and help keep my eyes youthful.  Rasene</li>
            <li> The only reason I ordered this product was to complete an order over $35 so I could get free shipping with my other items but let me tell you to start that it says &amp;#34;10 masks&amp;#34;, they&#x27;re only 5 packages (2 each) so they say 10 to make you feel that you&#x27;re gonna have 20 but no. The instructions of the packages are so bad, the translations are almost non-understandable and they aren&#x27;t even complete. The packages themselves are very difficult to open and if you expect to be with your eyes out like the lady from the picture advertised, you&#x27;re gonna lose my friend because the eye-hole of the mask is very small. The only reason I will not return this is because I hate to be going to the post office, ect but lord jesus... These people need to better.</li>
            <li> bought the eye patches forst and loved them so much i bought the mask which is even better!!  love them</li>
            <li> works fine, might orders some more in the near future, will recommend to friends and family members, price is ok</li>
            <li> so far I haven&#x27;t noticed any drastic changes but I&#x27;ve only used it twice. Will keep trying.</li>
            <li> I have dark circles below my eyes. I used it as per the instructions given on the product but it did not work for me.......sorry!!</li>
            <li> These stung the skin around my eyes terribly after a minute or so, I had to throw them in the trash. I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin so did not expect such a painful reaction. My skin still hurt the next morning.</li>
            <li> These product was not for myself.  It was a gift for a church friend&lt;br /&gt;who lives in South America.  I purchased it for her, and carried&lt;br /&gt;it in my suitcase to Brazil.  She loves this product.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for more with these.  They didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference in my puffy eyes.  Still looking for a great alternative!</li>
            <li> The product works as expected, but end up cutting the top part. Sits weird on eyes. Works good regardless.</li>
            <li> Messy and there are better products out there.</li>
            <li> Disappointment......&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t do anything....</li>
            <li> No more bags under eyes!</li>
            <li> goes with my MASKED MARBLE outfit</li>
            <li> The product is of poor quality and not as thick as the picture. Some of them is not even in the same shape. Will never buy again</li>
            <li> These are amazing. It helps every time I use it. It says not to reuse it but I use each one about 3 times. They have lots of clear juice in the package that keeps these things hydrated so if you&#x27;re careful when you open it and store it lying flat, the juice will stay in the trays and you can out these back in for the next time you want to use it. I store it in its tray inside a plastic baggie between uses. I will use it three times in a week and my eye area looks and feels soft and amazing. Even if I only got one use out of it - it would be worth it.</li>
            <li> I really like these masks. I put them on for about a half hour and it significantly reduces any puffiness and swelling around my eyes. You will have to lie horizontally or they tend to slide off, though I have managed to use them sitting up if you push them up every few minutes (of course this is much less relaxing.) My only negative comment is the price on these bad boys, I think they are pretty overpriced. I would probably use them once or twice a week if they were less expensive, but I can&#x27;t justify the expense and use them before special occasions when I want to look fresh and awake at night. Otherwise, these are probably the best eye masks I have tried. They do much more for the puffiness then the dark circles, though.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t stay on your face too well. They tend to bunch in the packaging so one has to be extra diligent - I recommend using scissors to open the packaging.</li>
            <li> Eye masks works for puffiness on eye zone treatments.</li>
            <li> These Collagen gel eye patches work miracles (well at least for  my skin they do) especially during the winter months with the constant exposure to central heating. Which tends to suck all the moisture out of your skin. I leave these on for about 30 minutes to an hour (before going to bed) then apply your serums and nightly skin care.  When you wake up in the morning your face looks dewey and fresh.  I also have the full face ones which work wonders.</li>
            <li> Did not like this product at all. It as difficult to get it to say on - kept sliding off and did not fit my face.</li>
            <li> worked very well with my dark circles under my eyes. I tried other expensive product didn&#x27;t do as much job as this one did. No irritations and it only takes 30 minutes. great product!!!!</li>
            <li> The ingredients in the package is not the same as the owner sell it on amazon. The instructions on the package have a lot of typos. I don&#x27;t know if I can trust the veracity of the product. I used it two times, and yes I felt my eyes more relaxed. That was it.....</li>
            <li> These eye masks looked really cool but I did not see any of the results promised. I would not recommend them.</li>
            <li> I have some of the 24 carrot gold eye masks and I love them.  These were way too thin.  Surprisingly I just opened them yesterday.  A month past the return so I&#x27;m stuck with them,  I will stay with the ones in the mall, I can re use them,  you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I had trouble getting these to stay put. And since I bought the full face pads of the same composition, I didn&#x27;t really need these. The full face ones do the trick, and I like those a lot so I won&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
            <li> The products could be much better if it had a bigger hole for the eye.  The instructions in the package are not clear, need improvements.</li>
            <li> Makes my eyes feel good.</li>
            <li> This mask is good, I found it very relaxing. 😌</li>
            <li> I really like it. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product for me.  I used it twice before giving a review.  My eyes are usually puffy and dark circles under from the Spring allergy.  I am very pleased with the result after use.  The swollen is obviously reduced and skin is tightened.  I recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;I misread the expiration date on the package.  After questioning the seller, they are very polite and re-send another package without asking for a proof.  I took a picture of the package sent it to them. The contact person pointed out the problem is the shape of 6 looks like a 5.  So it looks like the product was going to expire in a month.  Their attitude is good and respond email fast .</li>
            <li> I used this product so far 2 times and really like it, product makes eye area very fresh. Recommend it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how beneficial it is yet. But, for relaxing purposes it feels great. It&#x27;s good to having something cool to cover your eyes anyway, after a long hard day of looking at the computer. These served its purpose.</li>
            <li> These are really good they are hard to stay in spot.  But, they do the work I left them on overnight, my eyes felt good the next morning.</li>
            <li> Temporary results, needs repetition. Better than nothing!</li>
            <li> Holes are very tiny and don&#x27;t stay on well. I also feel the description is a little misleading. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I used as a party favor for my 60th birthday. My guests loved them. They weren&#x27;t something I&#x27;d normally buy, but the feedback was good.</li>
            <li> They do not stay on your eyes so well.  I guess if you have to lie down that would be fine, but I was not that impressed.</li>
            <li> They are tough to get into postion, but your eyes feel great the next morning.</li>
            <li> Love them! They have a very cooling feeling on the eyes.</li>
            <li> It works! Good! I love it so I bought more</li>
            <li> Love thes Gold Eye Mask&#x27;s ! You can definetly feel and see the difference after using these for a week.</li>
            <li> Soothing, rejuvenating and wonderful!</li>
            <li> Another great buy. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Product description is misleading, you are not getting 10 whole masks you are getting 5.. they justify it by saying it is 10 pieces...very disappointed.... If I was buying one mask I would not expect to get something for just one eye therefore in this instance I do not expect to get 5, I expect the full 10 masks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did email the company and although they were prompt in their response it was not satisfactory in my mind. I am not a happy buyer and will not buy from them again.</li>

            <li> This item gave me a cool stimulation when I first applied them...however, I did not see any recognizable change in the appearance of how my under eye looked (after using all five pairs).</li>
            <li> It is comfy to put under the eyes, but I did not see any significant differences before and after using it.</li>
            <li> Really cooling and refreshing when you use them cooled. Just like the ones in the spa for 60.00 only here you get 5 pairs. Good value.</li>
            <li> Feels good around the eyes.  Refreshes the eyes</li>
            <li> This is an interesting product that has a good concept behind it.  It would have saved me ordering money &amp; time if there was full disclosure of all ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unable to locate a full ingredient list disclosure before purchasing the product, &amp; one of the ingredients I intentionally sought to avoid was present, the xenoestrogen paraben family&#x27;s methylparaben. It would be better to leave this out of products because it sends a signal a high dosage of estrogen was received, setting off an enormous chain reaction in the body: as in my case before I was educated on the paraben xenoestrogens/hormone disrupters, I had repeated endometriosis (among other estrogen-dominance related things going on at the same time). No longer now, but at the drop of a hat these estrogen-dominance issues can and do return. I use natural progesterone (Progestelle) now regularly to keep estrogen-dominance issues in check, but the detrimental effects of using the known xenoestrogens like the paraben families cannot be overcome with just natural progesterone. If everyone becomes educated on product ingredients detrimental to the human body, it will help with disorder &amp; disease so many people don&#x27;t have to learn through the long route of troublesome trial-and-error. Please see:  Endometriosis Journey by putting it into the search engine online, it will come up with a list of xenoestrogens to start with.</li>
            <li> the masks work very well i was very surprised how super fast they work i noticed the differences right away</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT RECOMMEND ME LIKE SO MUCH WITH MY FRIENDS, AMAZON SELLS CUTE THINGS AND GOOD PRICE, I AM VERY SATISFIED</li>
            <li> use once a 3 days you should see some good results</li>
            <li> Past review written. Great stuff</li>
            <li> Made me feel like a whole new man. Stung my eye a little but it stopped after a few seconds.</li>
            <li> I guess it works fine.</li>
            <li> There are other eye masks I&#x27;d recommend before this one. The quality is fine but the shape isn&#x27;t made to fit every eye. I had to cut them to fit my big eyes.</li>
            <li> I liked this product as it is easy to use and it has good price comparing doing the same mask at beauty salon</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. If you really need one for your eyes, this is the right one. HOwever i do not have enough time to use it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other eye patches that you can wear around (who has 30 mins to just lie down?) and these dont allow you to do that because they are so moise.  They come in a watery substance that gets all over and I&#x27;m not sure what role the patches really play.  I wouldnt buy these again,</li>
            <li> Very messy and hard to handle.</li>
            <li> Yes, I am a guy that uses this product. I am an Asian mix 50 year old with slightly, droopy upper-lid and puffy under-eye bags. This product does a great job super moisturizing the upper lid (creases all but gone now) and greatly reduced puffy under-eye bags. I can&#x27;t say it helps with the dark circles, but two out of three, especially at this price. I use scissors to cut ALL ends of the package, so I can lift the patches from their tray. They are floppy and goopy, so have a towel or paper towel near you when using this product. To my surprise, my super-sensitive eyes don&#x27;t get irritated by the solution that these eye patches are soaked in. This is a HUGE plus. This has been my experience after using this product six times. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of gel eye masks &amp; have been trying different varieties lately.  The enclosed oval shape of these are not appropriate unless you have small eyes which I don&#x27;t.  I had to cut the mask to be able to see.  Sorry, but this is actually quite funny &amp; should be addressed for those of us that are into skin care, but aren&#x27;t asian.</li>
