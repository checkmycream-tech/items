            <li> I found this product first at Marshall&#x27;s.  It was only $10 and thought I&#x27;d try it.  I immediately saw improvement in brightness, texture and tone!  The product&#x27;s from Poland so It&#x27;s hard to find.  I hope it gets more recognition in the states and becomes easier to access.</li>
            <li> Gives my skin a beautiful youthful, well hydrated glow!</li>
            <li> Would recommend this product. Love how it feels.</li>
            <li> Great cream. You can see and feel a diference in your skin in only a couple applications</li>
            <li> I love this, would like to find them for less money.  I have paid less at Ross store.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any difference in lines and wrinkles. Used entire jar. Will not repurchase</li>
            <li> Great product, and it does work on fighting wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for about 2 months and REALLY wanted to give it 5 stars, but I went to Amazon today to purchase some more, I decided to compare retinol creams and their ingredients.  Then it occurred to me that I never really looked at the ingredients in this cream  (I remember looking at the box when I first got it, but the ingredients I saw were in Polish and I never really looked further I guess).  I just found the English version on the bottom of the box (duh)...and was shocked.  OH NO!  ALL 4 PARABENS! ...directly from the box (Methylparaben (and) Ethylparaben (and) Butylparaben (and) Propylparaben)...well it seems to have all the parabens covered in addition to Phenoxyethanol.  Google these ingredients and you will see none of them are good for you or your skin.  The parabens are absorbed by your skin and some studies have shown links to breast cancer.  I am so sad (&amp; mad at myself for not seeing this earlier).  I really loved this cream even though it is a bit thick and greasy...took some time to absorb into my skin (thankfully?) but it seemed to be doing a great job of keeping my skin hydrated and young looking.  I loved the fragrance too.  After reading the ingredients in this cream, I ordered a different retinol cream made in the U.S. without all the harmful stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone interested, here is the full list of ingredients: ( I hate when the ingredients aren&#x27;t listed with the product)&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I have ordered this cream twice and while the outside boxes are exactly the same, I just now noticed looking at both boxes that the ingredients are varied:  (mainly the same with some minor additions/amounts)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Box 1:  expiration 6/2016&lt;br /&gt;Aqua, Mineral Oil, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Isopropyl Myristate, Bees Wax, Aqua (and) Pentylene Glycol (and) Glycerin (and) Sodium Lactate (and) Lactic Acid (and) Serine (and) Urea (and) Sorbitol (and) Sodium Chloride (and) Allantoin, Sodium Hyalauronte, Paraffin Wax, Magnesium Sulfate, Aqua (and) Glycerin (and) Proplylene Glycol (and) Lecithin (and) Carnitine (and) Ubiquinone, Retinyl Palmitate, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein (and) Propylene Glycol, PEG-8 (and) Tocopherol (and) Ascorbyl Palmitate (and) Ascorbic Acid (and) Citric Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate, Phenoxyethanol (and) Methylparaben (and Ethylparaben (and) Butylparaben (and) Propylparaben, 2-Bromo-2-Nitropropane-1,3-Diol, Parfum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Box 2:  expiration 2/2016&lt;br /&gt;Aqua, Mineral Oil,  Propylene Glycol, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Isopropyl Myristate, Aqua (and) Butylene Glycol (and) Laminaria Hyperborea Extract (Algae), Parafin Wax, Bees Wax, Aqua (and) Pentylene Glycol (and) Glycerin (and) Sodium Lactate (and) Lactic Acid (and) Serine (and) Urea (and) Sorbitol (and) Sodium Chloride (and) Allantoin, Avacado (Persea Grattissima) Oil, Aqua (and) Glycerin (and) Proplylene Glycol (and) Lecithin (and) Carnitine (and) Ubiquinone, Retinyl Palmitate, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein (and) Propylene Glycol, PEG-8 (and) Tocopherol (and) Ascorbyl Palmitate (and) Ascorbic Acid (and) Citric Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate, Phenoxyethanol (and) Methylparaben (and Ethylparaben (and) Butylparaben (and) Propylparaben, 2-Bromo-2-Nitropropane-1,3-Diol, Parfum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this is a long review, but as you can see there are obviously different formulas of this cream even though the boxes were identical.

            <li> It was more effective than the more expensive creams, even Murad. My daughter brought it home from Europe we saw and felt a difference right away. This has quality ingredients I have not found before and I have used every product you have seen on TV.  We were very happy to find it on good ol &#x27;Amazon.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cream! I have been using it for a couple weeks. Morning and night. I am 42 and I have been getting compliments on how I have less wrinkles then my friends my age. If you wear make up apply it in the morning before applying your make up. Always wash your make up off at night. And apply before bed. Do this religiously! My face feels great. Its not to thick. I break out with cream that&#x27;s to thick! I can not use night creams! Hope this helps others looking for a good cream!</li>
            <li> I love this cream.  Love the smell, love the texture, love the way my skin drinks it up. Wish I&#x27;d bought more!</li>
            <li> I first purchased this at tj maxx and i was unable to find it again.  Loved how this cream perforned</li>
            <li> I am always trying new skin products when I find them at a reduced price at shops such as TJ Maxx.&lt;br /&gt;That is how I was introduced to this product and loved it. I was sooo pleased with the results I ordered another&lt;br /&gt;bottle on line for full price. I am 74 and people guess me to be in my 50&#x27;s. My skin is smooth and&lt;br /&gt;flawless. I go out in public with just this cream on my bare face and when I do use a foundation it is no more&lt;br /&gt;than Bare Minerals. I am very impressed with the packaging as well. The way it dispenses from the jar is&lt;br /&gt;ideal, its easy with no mess and no more than you need so their is no waste. It doesn&#x27;t dry out and never&lt;br /&gt;smells rancid. This product is definately on my must have list.</li>
            <li> I NOTICED A CONSIDERABLE DECREASE IN THE WRINKLES ON MY FACE WHEN I USED THIS PRODUCT, BUT IT IS KIND OF EXPENSIVE, I DON&amp;#34;T KNOW IF i CAN CONTINUE WITH IT.  DO YOU EVER HAVE ANY SALES?</li>
            <li> Picked this up and was really excited since it has Retinol, Vitamin C and Q10 in it and was moderately priced and I&#x27;ve had really good results with European face creams in the past. Well I barely used this for a week and had one of the worst breakouts I&#x27;ve ever had. Five cystic acne and my nose was covered in blackheads practically over night. It is kind of greasy, so I went on line to check out the ingredients figuring it might just be really heavy with the mineral oil base. (mine is all in Polish.) Yes it does have a lot of Parabens, which despite the general arguement that they are preservatives that &amp;#34;should not&amp;#34; cause acne there seemed to be plenty of people online dealing with some serious breakouts and allergic reactions and quite frankly for my skin to respond so quickly I&#x27;m going to believe there is something to that. Also when I went back to my original face cream my skin calmed down and started to clear up. Strangest break out I have ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also did not help that Parabens are considered generally unhealthy for the skin. So I&#x27;m glad it didn&#x27;t cost much so I don&#x27;t feel to terrible about throwing it out. Nor do I feel bad about warning everyone not to use this product. Clearly it is made on outdated formula information.</li>
            <li> Like the eye cream, the consistency is somewhat greasy on my oily skin, but I can see a difference in my skin tone since I started using the cream at bedtime.  I&#x27;m sure someone my age (55) with dry skin would love it!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this cream. My skin feels softer. As for being firmer, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve used it long enough to make a judgement call.</li>
            <li> There is no comparison on this product. It is the best on the market!  I found this product by accident and have been using it every since. You can see immediate difference in skin tone and skin mositure. It is less expensive than most products on the market and by far works better than any of the higher priced items. They have a line of various skin products and I have used most of them. They are all great but I especially like this one.</li>
