            <li>Looks beautiful for a french manicure, water resistant.</li>
            <li>It is an off-white leaning towards grey and looks great with my cool-toned skin.</li>
            <li>Takes a really long time to chip love it!!</li>
            <li>Great for dark skin or light skin.</li>
            <li>i can wear it  for a long time..is so good.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much I have already purchased a back up.</li>
            <li>got this in the mail should be a fun color to wear.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The formula is a bit runny, so it went on streaky on the first coat.</li>
            <li>the spiderman movie which I love that movie and big critic fan of batman also opi should come out w batman colors.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a white gray.</li>
            <li>I will order one more in the same color in case of discontinuation, which Opi is known to do with their colors</li>
            <li>Very shiny!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping service too!</li>
            <li>The formula goes on pretty well too.</li>
            <li>to use and dries quickly and high quality</li>
            <li>At first glance you would think its white, but upon closer inspection you will notice its like a really light gray.</li>
            <li>Works as a base for art but soooo beautiful on its own.</li>
            <li>I gave four stars only because the polish really has more of a gray hue to it than a true white.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>It also dries fast.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know what to say about this, never got to use it.  </li>
            <li>This is very opaque and cover in one coat.  </li>
            <li>I really wish they will make it a staple in the O.P.I. line.</li>
            <li>It is universally flattering on all skin types (my friend is white and I am black and it looks great on both of us).</li>
            <li>its not a stark white but an off white color with a very subtle light gray undertone its beautiful</li>
            <li>I really like how this polish isn&#x27;t a blinding, pure white.</li>
            <li>Is a greyish white color that looks mostly white but is easier than most white polishes to apply.</li>
            <li>Which really worked for me because I didn&#x27;t want it to white.</li>
            <li>so this nailpolish is a whitish color more of a little grey in it</li>
            <li>also it looks white when you put it on , you put this white polish first on and then apply the spiderman crackle shatter the scales over it</li>
            <li>Great white for nail art and as a base coat under more sheer colors like yellow as well.  </li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t really notice the grey tone.</li>
            <li>SOMETHING DIFFERENT, SOMETHING NEW.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not a stark as teg white.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a pure white, more a just slightly grey-white, which pairs well if you are using any of Opi&#x27;s Ballet sheers for your french manicures.  </li>
            <li>It takes about two coats for full opacity, or one thick coat.</li>
            <li>It is not a flat white but has a hint of gray to it.</li>

            <li> This is not your mother&#x27;s plain old white polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a great base for other colors or layered.</li>
            <li> No better coverage really than any other white polish.</li>
            <li> I received an OLD dried out bottle of nail polish.</li>
            <li> Definitely not a pure white</li>
            <li> It has a bit of a grey tinge to it (almost like spider webs!), which makes it easier on the eyes.</li>
            <li> It does level out on the second coat, but it does need a little extra care to avoid streaks.</li>
            <li> Covered in pink its not apparent.</li>
            <li> I ordered this so I would have a basic white to use as a base for some very colorful glitter nail polish.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a slight grey color.  </li>
            <li> Usually it doesn&#x27;t require a second coat.</li>
            <li> not watery like a lot of other opi polishes.  </li>
            <li> Not too white, not too dull.</li>
            <li> it literally trickled all the way down my thumb!</li>
            <li> seriously, don&#x27;t waste your time or money with this.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with it at all.</li>
            <li> I was very very very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> OPI amazing polish. i can wear it  for a long time..is so good. i recommended this brand for everyone. thanks</li>
            <li> It is an off-white leaning towards grey and looks great with my cool-toned skin. It takes about two coats for full opacity, or one thick coat. I loved it so much I have already purchased a back up.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t know what to say, it&#x27;s one of my all time favorite polishes and I&#x27;ve been using polish for over 20+ yrs. its not a stark white but an off white color with a very subtle light gray undertone its beautiful, my go to color for the summer. I purchased another bottle already and will purchase some more I don&#x27;t want to run out of it.</li>
            <li> I really like how this polish isn&#x27;t a blinding, pure white. It has a bit of a grey tinge to it (almost like spider webs!), which makes it easier on the eyes. The formula is a bit runny, so it went on streaky on the first coat. It does level out on the second coat, but it does need a little extra care to avoid streaks. This one does work great for layering though.</li>
            <li> Just apply two coats and it pops! Great for summer on hands and toes. I even mixed it with my sparkle nail polish on some of my nails and it looks awesome.</li>
            <li> This is not your mother&#x27;s plain old white polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This color has a touch of grey which gives your manicure a softer white... No chalky white here.  Works great alone but a must have for layering and/ or nail art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And of course it has that superior OPI formula which we all know and love.</li>
            <li> so this nailpolish is a whitish color more of a little grey in it also it looks white when you put it on , you put this white polish first on and then apply the spiderman crackle shatter the scales over it and it looks really nice I put it toe nail and w sandals looks great the best part is this goes w the spiderman movie which I love that movie and big critic fan of batman also opi should come out w batman colors.</li>
            <li> Perfect for french tips. Not too white, not too dull. Usually it doesn&#x27;t require a second coat. It also dries fast. Theres the occasional streaking, but that can be resolved with a second coat. On its own it has a gray tinge to it. Covered in pink its not apparent. 10/10 would recommend for french tips.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know what to say about this, never got to use it.  I was very very very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is very opaque and cover in one coat.  It is perfect for French Manicures.  Easy to use / apply.</li>
            <li> It was what I hoped for. Nothing wrong with it at all. Love the color. It&#x27;s more of a white gray.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a grayish white then opi my boyfriend scales walls is the color for you. At first glance you would think its white, but upon closer inspection you will notice its like a really light gray. Which really worked for me because I didn&#x27;t want it to white. I didn&#x27;t experience any issues with it turning colors either. It stayed the same shade until I took it off.</li>
            <li> Great quality product and fast shipping. Best place on the net to get o p I products that are not in stores.</li>
            <li> No better coverage really than any other white polish. Needed three coats minimum.</li>
            <li> Great buy and shipped fast  Looks just as it shows in the picture and it&#x27;s a sort of chalky white polish</li>
            <li> Thought it was originally a white polish, but it wasn&#x27;t and I loved it anyway!!! I LOVE OPI!!! It makes even coats and doesn&#x27;t take much to make it look like a great polish!</li>
            <li> I received an OLD dried out bottle of nail polish. Plus it is not the same color on your nails as it is in the picture.</li>
            <li> great color, unique, applies easily, looks great, really happy with this purchase.  I will order one more in the same color in case of discontinuation, which Opi is known to do with their colors</li>
            <li> I love this white lacquer, beautiful color. Looks beautiful for a french manicure, water resistant.</li>
            <li> Love this color!.. Very shiny! Fast shipping service too!</li>
            <li> I like this oh-so-slightly gray color. Definitely not a pure white but it&#x27;s a great base for other colors or layered. The formula goes on pretty well too.</li>
            <li> this shit&#x27;s really runny and streaky. it&#x27;s so runny it literally trickled all the way down my thumb! i&#x27;m just glad i got it on clearance for $3. seriously, don&#x27;t waste your time or money with this.</li>
            <li> OPI nail polishes are my second fave, doesn&#x27;t chip on me for about a week and this color is so great for the summer!</li>
            <li> Love this polish. Is a greyish white color that looks mostly white but is easier than most white polishes to apply. Love it on my fingers. Takes a really long time to chip love it!!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite colors from O.P.I.  I really wish they will make it a staple in the O.P.I. line.</li>
            <li> This is a great polish, you will need more than two coats to achieve a full color.  I gave four stars only because the polish really has more of a gray hue to it than a true white.</li>
            <li> I ordered this so I would have a basic white to use as a base for some very colorful glitter nail polish.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Perfect off white.  It&#x27;s a slight grey color.  Great for dark skin or light skin. Works as a base for art but soooo beautiful on its own. It&#x27;s nice cause it&#x27;s not a stark as teg white.  Must have.  Will def repurchase</li>
            <li> got this in the mail should be a fun color to wear.&lt;br /&gt;I order this got this in the mail in 3days.</li>
            <li> not watery like a lot of other opi polishes.  two coats and it&#x27;s as opaque as white out.  love it!</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of this Opi shade.  It&#x27;s perfect for french manicures, nicely opaque and super smooth finish after 1-2 coats.  It&#x27;s not a pure white, more a just slightly grey-white, which pairs well if you are using any of Opi&#x27;s Ballet sheers for your french manicures.  Great white for nail art and as a base coat under more sheer colors like yellow as well.  You won&#x27;t really notice the grey tone.</li>
            <li> DEFINITELY AN INTERESTING COLOR. SOMETHING DIFFERENT, SOMETHING NEW. I LIKE IT.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine loaned me this color awhile ago and I fell in love with it. It is the perfect white polish in my opinion. It is not a flat white but has a hint of gray to it. It is universally flattering on all skin types (my friend is white and I am black and it looks great on both of us).</li>
            <li> Gorgeous and beautiful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved this very company&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and dries quickly and high quality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Appropriate prices&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
