            <li>perfect color every time.</li>
            <li>It looked great!</li>
            <li>I have  used another Roux conditioner and it worked perfectly unlike this one.</li>
            <li>I am Lisenced and need it for work, it is wonderful after I give perms, or hair coloring..</li>
            <li>The Roux Porosity Control Corrector and Conditioner is perfect for the times after you just get your hair Permed</li>
            <li>Product moisturizes beautifully and is so lightweight.  </li>
            <li>I have a beautiful shine to my hair now which lasts longer than a couple of days.</li>
            <li>I have been getting great results from it.  </li>
            <li>but my roots did not appear relaxed but were happily moisturedized,</li>
            <li>Please don&#x27;t discontinue this great product..</li>
            <li>This product is great.  </li>
            <li>I tried this along with the Shampoo and this is great.</li>
            <li>Great for the price too</li>
            <li>This is one of the best 30 seconds conditioner that I have ever tried, I love it.  </li>
            <li>Love it and very happy to find it here.</li>
            <li>FLOATED!!I am so pleased and happy that I have found this product!!</li>
            <li>FLOATED!!I am so pleased and happy that I have found this product!!</li>
            <li>Works good.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use these products as I&#x27;m seeing good results with them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now been using this once a week for about 3 weeks and my hair floats happily at the top when I do a porosity test now.  </li>
            <li>I also love the leave in spray as it has a really nice smell and does add a very nice sheen to my hair.</li>
            <li>Great product / Great Seller - arrived safe and sound - would buy from again</li>
            <li>I believe you&#x27;ll find the results much better than using the conditioner alone!</li>
            <li>IT IS REALLY AN AMAZING PRODUCT....</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t detangle my hair as well as I would have liked.  </li>
            <li>But I must say that it is good to put in a moisturizing conditioner or leave in conditioner after it is used to locking more moisture and conditioning effect.</li>
            <li>ALSO IT WORKS WONDERS WITH YOUR OWN CONDITIONER</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m confident this time around, with this product in my arsenal, I&#x27;ll be able to keep my hair in a healthy state.</li>
            <li>My relaxed ends curl in the presumed healthy s-curl pattern.</li>
            <li>I question if this product was authentic.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have used this product many years</li>
            <li>a satisfied customer..</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT...</li>
            <li>but I really liked how smooth it was on my hair.</li>
            <li>I read about this on many hair websites.</li>
            <li>I love it  </li>
            <li>The shampoo is okay</li>
            <li>I notice that my hair holds moisture better than before</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve found the results to be much better than using the conditioner alone.</li>
            <li>I believe you&#x27;ll find the results much better than using the conditioner alone!conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve found the results to be much better than using the conditioner alone.</li>
            <li>Within a week my bleached, dyed hair felt 80% better when I coupled this conditioner with moisture and protein treatments.  </li>
            <li>, I haven&#x27;t really used it as much as I don&#x27;t shampoo my hair that often however the conditioner is great!</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend buying both the shampoo and the conditioner and using them togther</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend buying both the shampoo and the conditioner and using them togther</li>
            <li>Her hair is growing back nicely and feels much better than it has in years!</li>
            <li>This is a replacement to a L&#x27;oreal product that is no longer available.</li>
            <li>This actually makes my hair feel great.  </li>
            <li>I like the way it makes my hair feel silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I wish I had more success with this product like others did.  </li>
            <li>love this conditioner very much i use it twice a week, help with the moisture retaintion</li>
            <li>and I have to give it one star instead of the original 5 stars I gave it before.</li>
            <li>I saw a significant decrease in breakage.</li>
            <li>I use this on my whole head before I color;  for the greys at the roots because they are porous and for the rest because it is also porous because of coloring and my color is more even.</li>
            <li>I am IMPRESSED with the results and would HIGHLY  recommend this products and the other Roux products to repair your hair.</li>
            <li>Perhaps results are better when used by a professional.  </li>
            <li>Great product.... leaves hair really soft, however I only use this product after I perm my hair to provide ph balance and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and really makes my color treated (at home)hair frizz-less, healthier and soft.</li>
            <li>and not to mention soft and more manageable.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money, will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>Not after using this, it&#x27;s almost immediate, no little beads of moisturizer sitting on top of the cuticle layer.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for prompt service!</li>
            <li>THE NEXXUS PROTEIN TREATMENT FIRST</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with the stuff, I only purchased one bottle</li>
            <li>What really helps to intensify this is the aPHogee product line as well!</li>
            <li>Roux Mendex Mending Treatment really improved my porous hair after the first treatment.</li>
            <li>THE NEXXUS PROTEIN TREATMENT MADE IT EXTREMELY STRONG INSTANTLY</li>
            <li>It is very watery and feels like Shampoo not conditioner.</li>
            <li>I am so very thankful I got some of the Prosity Control.</li>
            <li>AND IT IS VERY POROUS.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to all the curly girls.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>This product really normalizes my hair and takes away that &amp;#34;over processed&amp;#34; look.  </li>
            <li>Been using this every other week on my 3 year olds dry high porosity hair with great results.</li>
            <li>I probably won&#x27;t use the conditioner as my main conditioner for too much longer because once your hair is restored you dont&#x27; need to use as much</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products in hopes that my hair will respond the way I&#x27;ve seen products work for other people but to no avail.</li>
            <li>now I&#x27;m back to buy several more.</li>
            <li>Now there is hardly any( like 2 or 3) and that seems pretty normal, and my hair feels STRONG!</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product if you think your hair is damaged beyond repair.</li>
            <li>this is a great product sorry to see it taken out of the store here</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if I care for the Mendex treatment, I will use it a few more times and monitor how my hair feels with it verses without it.</li>
            <li>I am a new user for the Roux line of products and I will stick with them.</li>
            <li>if it is not selling it is only because the hairdressers aren&#x27;t aware of it..</li>
            <li>Like the two of the reviewers at the time of my review stated, Roux left my hair tangled So very tangled.</li>
            <li>Soft shiny hair.</li>
            <li>The lid was completely busted.</li>
            <li>I CANNOT BELIEVE HOW EXTREMELY SOFT AND</li>
            <li>I treat my hair after each wash and this makes it really soft and manageable</li>
            <li>I am completely natural,</li>
            <li>I am AA with 4 a/b type hair and I have been on natural hair journey since July of this year.</li>
            <li>and so far this makes my hair feel like silk and adds shine and a fuller, healthier look.  </li>
            <li>The eczema completely changed the texture of her hair.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it enough to really see a major difference yet.</li>
            <li>have to change my original review of this product because when I used this new formula, I found that it made my hair hard and unmanageable.</li>
            <li>is my only guess, as it&#x27;s a new experience for me.  </li>
            <li>I live in a very dry climate and my hair is prone to drying out after conditioning, this combined with my normal conditioner</li>
            <li>It is well known that black people tend to have very porous hair and therefore need to use certain products to restore or correct the porosity level so that hair will grow and respond properly to products.</li>
            <li>I have thick dry AA natural hair and this stuff left my hair very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Hair is left soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve only used this product 2x so far.</li>
            <li>I noticed a slight difference after first use and have noticed my hair improving each week since purchasing and using it.</li>
            <li>So after doing the porosity test (place a few strands of freshly washed hair to room temperature water, let it sit for 2-3 mins and check to see if it has floated or sunk to the bottom) and finding out that I have high porosity hair one of the products suggested to restore balance is this product along with two other products.</li>
            <li>After shampooing and rinsing I put the conditioner on for 30 secs as recommended(more like a minute or 2 because it takes a little while to cover whole head) and then I rinse out and deep condition with a moisturing conditioner (Suave Coconut or Herbal Essence Hello Hydration)mixed with coconut or olive oil and leave on for 30 mins under my heating cap.</li>

            <li> I just wish and I do have long, mid back, hair, that it detangles.</li>
            <li> My hair now drinks up the Shea butter mixture I make for myself, not that it didn&#x27;t before, but it would usually take like a couple of hours to really soak in.</li>
            <li> this product left my hair dry and brittle after using it.</li>
            <li> The texture was not neither soft or harsh.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this is a great product sorry to see it taken out of the store here</li>
            <li> Great product / Great Seller - arrived safe and sound - would buy from again</li>
            <li> This product literally changed the porosity of my hair in one use.  I did the hair porosity test and my weak, curly hair strands sank straight to the bottom immediately.  I&#x27;ve now been using this once a week for about 3 weeks and my hair floats happily at the top when I do a porosity test now.  I&#x27;ve have struggled to get and keep my kinky curly hair in shape.  I&#x27;ve literally done the big chop atlease 3 times.  I&#x27;m confident this time around, with this product in my arsenal, I&#x27;ll be able to keep my hair in a healthy state.</li>
            <li> I did my research for correcting my porous hair after bleaching. I am a new user for the Roux line of products and I will stick with them. This product used with the Roux Porosity Control Shampoo, Roux Mendex Mending Treatment really improved my porous hair after the first treatment. I HIGHLY recommend this product if you think your hair is damaged beyond repair. I am IMPRESSED with the results and would HIGHLY  recommend this products and the other Roux products to repair your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairdresser and I use this all the time..</li>
            <li> love this conditioner very much i use it twice a week, help with the moisture retaintion</li>
            <li> My hair stylist suggested this product.  However, I am not impressed.  Perhaps results are better when used by a professional.  The product left a residue on my hair which I had to wash several times to remove.  Using the shampoo and conditioner combo only made it much more difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t detangle my hair as well as I would have liked.  Works good. I haven&#x27;t used it enough to really see a major difference yet.</li>
            <li> Great product.... leaves hair really soft, however I only use this product after I perm my hair to provide ph balance and conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement to a L&#x27;oreal product that is no longer available. I use this on my whole head before I color;  for the greys at the roots because they are porous and for the rest because it is also porous because of coloring and my color is more even. I have to color my roots every 4 weeks so going to a salon is out of the question because I can&#x27;t afford the time or money.</li>
            <li> This product works for thick, coarse black hair. I suggest hair mayo treatment and Mendex treatment. Do this once a week and you will have 4-6 inches of added length in a year. Your hair will not shed or break off. No more need to trim your hair.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best 30 seconds conditioner that I have ever tried, I love it.  Both my daughter and I have been getting great results from it.  But I must say that it is good to put in a moisturizing conditioner or leave in conditioner after it is used to locking more moisture and conditioning effect. It makes a big difference in balancing the porosity of our hair. I only use it once a week and for me this is definitely a keeper.</li>
            <li> I use this every time before my hair dresser colors my hair. No grabbing at the ends....perfect color every time.</li>
            <li> I used two weeks before a relaxer during a 17 week stretch, and I relaxed four days ago. Like the two of the reviewers at the time of my review stated, Roux left my hair tangled So very tangled. I slept with conditioner Gabriel Banana smoothie overnight which is not a big deal, as I always leave conditioner overnight but it doesn&#x27;t take the Gabriel hours to detangle my hair. It detangles on contact. Post washing my hair, my hair felt different. It was not soft, but it wasn&#x27;t bad. It looked great! My hair was so very long. It seemed less coarse, if that make sense, not relaxed (before the touch up) but my roots did not appear relaxed but were happily moisturedized, is my only guess, as it&#x27;s a new experience for me.  My hair post detangling was like the hair I always wanted. I&#x27;m still not sure about the product. But I also can&#x27;t stop using it. I just wish and I do have long, mid back, hair, that it detangles. The texture was not neither soft or harsh. My relaxed ends curl in the presumed healthy s-curl pattern. My hair seemed longer and moisturized just tangled as.ucked. I gave this rambling description because I can&#x27;t be alone in having this experience. Keep in mind, my thick, long hair is self relaxed. So it&#x27;s likely I have bits and patches of hair that occasionally misses one of the three times a year touch ups.</li>
            <li> Love it and very happy to find it here.</li>
            <li> Did not work for my hair at all. It is very watery and feels like Shampoo not conditioner. I question if this product was authentic. I have  used another Roux conditioner and it worked perfectly unlike this one.</li>
            <li> Soft shiny hair. Recommended to me years ago by beautician after a bad home perm.  Smells nice and really makes my color treated (at home)hair frizz-less, healthier and soft.</li>
            <li> This actually makes my hair feel great.  My only complaint would be with the shipping.  It was shipped from California in a padded envelope.  The lid was completely busted.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. I have kinky hair and sometimes it can be very hard to detangle. I would mix some of this with some other conditioner like vo5 Moisture Milks conditioner and work it through my hair. I would leave it in for about 7-10 minutes then proceed to detangle and it works swimmingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to change my original review of this product because when I used this new formula, I found that it made my hair hard and unmanageable. It is definitely not the same and I have to give it one star instead of the original 5 stars I gave it before. Why are these companies constantly changing formulas of products that work to absolute crap is beyond me.</li>
            <li> I have used this product many years and when I&#x27;d go to Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply, they kept telling me that they  the Roux Company are no longer making this product! so I thought I&#x27;d try on line..I am so very thankful I got some of the Prosity Control. I am Lisenced and need it for work, it is wonderful after I give perms, or hair coloring..I am lost with out it. Please don&#x27;t discontinue this great product..if it is not selling it is only because the hairdressers aren&#x27;t aware of it..Thank you so much for prompt service! a satisfied customer..Roux Porosity Control Corrector and Condidtioner..</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF HAS CHANGED MY HAIR&#x27;S FUTURE FORREAL!!!!... - I AM AN AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN WITH RELAXED HAIR. WELL, AFTER A PERM MISHAP AND LACK OF PROTEIN N MY HAIR REGIMEN. YO GUESSED IT.... IT ALL CAME TUMBLING DOWN. MY HAIR WAS &amp;#34;BSL&amp;#34; AND I ENDED UP HAVING TO CUT IT TO NECK LENGTH &amp;#34;nl&amp;#34;.  I FOUND THIS PRODUCT ON YOUTUBE AND DID THE POROSITY TEST ON MY HAIR AND IT IS VERY POROUS.  THEN I ORDERED TWO PRODUCTS.. NEXXUS EMERGENCEE FOR IMMEDIATE PROTEIN RECONSTRUCTION AND ROUX POROSITY CORRECTOR TO CONTROL THE POROSITY.  WELL, I DID THE NEXXUS PROTEIN TREATMENT FIRST AND THEN APPLIED THE ROUX POROSITY CORRECTOR. .... DRUMROLL PLEASE...I CANNOT BELIEVE HOW EXTREMELY SOFT AND WELL MOISTURIZED MY BRITTLE, BROKEN AND BEATDOWN HAIR WAS.  THE NEXXUS PROTEIN TREATMENT MADE IT EXTREMELY STRONG INSTANTLY AND THE ROUX POROSITY CORRECTOR MADE THE CONDITIONING DIFFERENCE... I WILL ALWAYS RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO PEOPLE THAT HAVE RELAXED POROUS HAIR.  I LOVE IT... ALSO IT WORKS WONDERS WITH YOUR OWN CONDITIONER ALSO.  IT IS REALLY AN AMAZING PRODUCT.... GET IF YOU NEED IT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with the stuff, I only purchased one bottle now I&#x27;m back to buy several more. I have thick dry AA natural hair and this stuff left my hair very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this one time but I really liked how smooth it was on my hair. It seems like all of the effect rinsed out but I don&#x27;t know yet.</li>
            <li> The Roux Porosity Control Corrector and Conditioner is perfect for the times after you just get your hair Permed (chemically straightened)and you wash it at home. My hair doesn&#x27;t get that almost stringy and thinning look anymore after I added this and a few other products to my regimen.  What really helps to intensify this is the aPHogee product line as well!</li>
            <li> I like the way it makes my hair feel silky and smooth.  I wish i found this earlier I read about this on many hair websites. Thanks to all the curly girls.</li>
            <li> Product moisturizes beautifully and is so lightweight.  I saw a significant decrease in breakage. Hair is left soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I used to look down after combing out my hair and see hundreds of little broken bits of hair, even with a wide toothed comb! Now there is hardly any( like 2 or 3) and that seems pretty normal, and my hair feels STRONG! and not to mention soft and more manageable.  I live in a very dry climate and my hair is prone to drying out after conditioning, this combined with my normal conditioner works wonders!</li>
            <li> Worth the money, will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  I love it  I treat my hair after each wash and this makes it really soft and manageable</li>
            <li> I tried this along with the Shampoo and this is great. I have a beautiful shine to my hair now which lasts longer than a couple of days. I am completely natural, no relaxer and I&#x27;ve only used this product 2x so far. My hair now drinks up the Shea butter mixture I make for myself, not that it didn&#x27;t before, but it would usually take like a couple of hours to really soak in. Not after using this, it&#x27;s almost immediate, no little beads of moisturizer sitting on top of the cuticle layer. And usually I don&#x27;t have to apply my mixture for about 2-3 days, but now after using the Roux combo, my hair could go for a week without needing to be re-moisturized. I would definitely recommend these products for anyone experiencing dryness, damage or just in need of a boost.</li>
            <li> I am AA with 4 a/b type hair and I have been on natural hair journey since July of this year. I have tried so many products in hopes that my hair will respond the way I&#x27;ve seen products work for other people but to no avail. I then read up on reasons why hair may not hold moisture or be dull etc. on blackhairscience.com and one of the reasons given was the porosity of hair. It is well known that black people tend to have very porous hair and therefore need to use certain products to restore or correct the porosity level so that hair will grow and respond properly to products. So after doing the porosity test (place a few strands of freshly washed hair to room temperature water, let it sit for 2-3 mins and check to see if it has floated or sunk to the bottom) and finding out that I have high porosity hair one of the products suggested to restore balance is this product along with two other products. So I bought this product, along with the shampoo, mendex treatment and the leave in spray (yellow bottle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if I care for the Mendex treatment, I will use it a few more times and monitor how my hair feels with it verses without it. The shampoo is okay, I haven&#x27;t really used it as much as I don&#x27;t shampoo my hair that often however the conditioner is great! I noticed a slight difference after first use and have noticed my hair improving each week since purchasing and using it. I notice that my hair holds moisture better than before and it&#x27;s not as dull as before. I did a porosity test my last wash and a few of my hairs floated!!! I also love the leave in spray as it has a really nice smell and does add a very nice sheen to my hair. I will continue to use these products as I&#x27;m seeing good results with them. I probably won&#x27;t use the conditioner as my main conditioner for too much longer because once your hair is restored you dont&#x27; need to use as much so I will probably continue use for another month and then after that I will just add a tbsp to my deep conditioning treatment. As for the leave in I will continue to use this product and will make it a staple product for my hair. I&#x27;ll do another update in another month or so about the Mendex treatment but the conditioner and leave in gets 5 stars from me!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**10/22 Update**&lt;br /&gt;For the past 2 weeks I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo and conditioner together and I&#x27;ve found the results to be much better than using the conditioner alone. After shampooing and rinsing I put the conditioner on for 30 secs as recommended(more like a minute or 2 because it takes a little while to cover whole head) and then I rinse out and deep condition with a moisturing conditioner (Suave Coconut or Herbal Essence Hello Hydration)mixed with coconut or olive oil and leave on for 30 mins under my heating cap. My hair has been softer and shinier and I just did a strand test again this morning and as opposed to a few weeks ago when just a few of the strands I put from different sections in my hair floated this time \\&quot;ALL\\&quot; of my hairs FLOATED!!I am so pleased and happy that I have found this product!! I strongly recommend buying both the shampoo and the conditioner and using them togther I believe you&#x27;ll find the results much better than using the conditioner alone!conditioning treatment.

            <li> Within a week my bleached, dyed hair felt 80% better when I coupled this conditioner with moisture and protein treatments.  I&#x27;m trying to go no poo for awhile and so far this makes my hair feel like silk and adds shine and a fuller, healthier look.  Great for the price too</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I have serious gray hair, which my stylist colors, and my hair is also foiled every 4 months to give contrast to my color.  This product really normalizes my hair and takes away that &amp;#34;over processed&amp;#34; look.  I often mix it with my conditioner to provide moisture to my hair.  The product also has a very low odor, which I appreciate.</li>
            <li> smells and works well for curly hair</li>
            <li> I wish I had more success with this product like others did.  this product left my hair dry and brittle after using it. I ended up throwing this product, away.</li>
            <li> Been using this every other week on my 3 year olds dry high porosity hair with great results. Eczema caused her hair to fall out several times over the past 2 years and it has been a nightmare. The eczema completely changed the texture of her hair. I now cowash weekly, shampoo once a month and use this every other week after a cowash then pour aloe vera juice over her hair and scalp as a final rinse. Her hair is growing back nicely and feels much better than it has in years!</li>
