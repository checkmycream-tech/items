            <li>This bottle was more fragrant than the &amp;#34;Max Focus&amp;#34; blend by the same</li>
            <li>the company placed ingredients on the bottle I would be much more likely to buy again in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>This is a great company I have a few essential oils from them and its a company I trust.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>and this has been helping so much</li>
            <li>I also tried it when I had just a normal headache</li>
            <li>The oil itself has hardly no smell at all.</li>
            <li>So far so good not a strong smell which I need especially when I have a headache</li>
            <li>I suspect not pure essential oils, more like synthetic fragrance oils.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use no more than 2 drops or it will have the reverse effect on you.</li>
            <li>Within 15-20 minutes he already noticed a considerable difference.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is toxic mess and smells like nothing. DO NOT BUY.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier using this with diffusers in the bedroom. Especially when I have  a migraine.</li>
            <li> My son gets migraines a lot and has prescription meds to help that don&#x27;t really work. I had him try this and he looked at me like I was crazy. I told him to just try it. Well, let me just say he thought I was a miracle worker and wanted to know what I just gave him. He applied to his temples and side and back of neck. Within 15-20 minutes he already noticed a considerable difference. His migraine completely subsided after an hour. He said he will not go without this now. I also tried it when I had just a normal headache as I hate taking aspirin or any pills for that matter. Only 1 aspirin has ever come close to working for when I get a headache. I have to say after applying the oil, it was gone in a half hour. Very impressed with this. I have received this product without charge to write an honest review, I have received no instruction and the opinions expressed are my own</li>
            <li> Honestly I haven&#x27;t used this oil because there aren&#x27;t any ingredients or oils listed on the bottle. The oil itself has hardly no smell at all.</li>
            <li> *i HAVE RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT WITHOUT CHARGE TO WRITE AN HONEST REVIEW, I HAVE RECEIVED NO INSTRUCTION AND THE OPINIONS EXPRESSED ARE MY OWN.*&lt;br /&gt;As a migraine sufferer, I was looking for something that would help; without having to take a bunch of medicine. This product helps a lot.</li>
            <li> I gave this to a friend of mine who gets migraines constantly and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I get migraines all the time and this really helps them.</li>
            <li> smells nice but does not work for me, did not stop headaches.Sad to say another thing did not work for me.</li>
            <li> This oil is great, I get frequent migrains and having used this oil it has helped. I put a little on my temples. Life saver ;)&lt;br /&gt;I received the product free in return for a review of the item. I  not given directions on how to use the product or how to write my review. I was not told how to rate the product.</li>
            <li> The pros:&lt;br /&gt;- This bottle was more fragrant than the &amp;#34;Max Focus&amp;#34; blend by the same company.&lt;br /&gt;- It worked for me. I used this product while I was suffering from a tension migraine and it seemed to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons:&lt;br /&gt;- No ingredients listed on the bottle. This made me question the oil and cautious to try it. I am still not sure how I feel about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the company placed ingredients on the bottle I would be much more likely to buy again in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this oil for free in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> So far so good not a strong smell which I need especially when I have a headache</li>
            <li> this was free for a review. it has significantly helped ease the pain associated with my migraines i want and need more</li>
            <li> My favorite. I like smelling this on myself just before and during my workouts.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle in a bottle!  Really helps with headaches.  I put a little on the bottoms of my feet and on my wrists and temples...boom...headache gone within 30 mins.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this oil due to the number of good reviews. Sadly these are poor quality and I suspect not pure essential oils, more like synthetic fragrance oils.</li>
            <li> This works very well for migraines. I usually use Head ease (which is great also) but this one is my second best! I won both in a giveaway. Make sure you use no more than 2 drops or it will have the reverse effect on you. Too much of a good thing is bad. But with a couple of drops for a brief moment clears stress and headaches!</li>
            <li> This is a great essential oil! I suffer from migraines a lot. As soon as I feel one starting I rub a few drops on my head where I feel most of the pain and it really works. I hate taking medication if I don&#x27;t have to so this is a great alternative. It is a very very light scent which is great when you have a headache. This is a great company I have a few essential oils from them and its a company I trust.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> There are no oils listed on the label, so I am not sure what the blend is made from. There is not much smell. I tried it when I had a headache and it didn&#x27;t do anything. I ended up using another blend I had instead. I got this oil for free.</li>
            <li> Smells good and clears up a headache when nothing else works. Put this in your diffuser or rub a little on your wrists!</li>
            <li> Multiple oils from this company have been tested and have proven to be adulterated and NOT pure essential oils. Regarding their &amp;#34;Lavender&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Peppermint&amp;#34;:&lt;br /&gt;These two oils were both adulterated with synthetics. They are not pure oils.&lt;br /&gt;The Peppermint testing states: &amp;#34;The sample was cut with over 50% of synthetic benzyl benzoate.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;The Lavender testing states: &amp;#34;This sample of Lavender shows heavy adulteration with synthetic linalyl acetate. A dead giveaway is the presence of dihydro linalyl acetate which is an impurity that does not occur in nature but arises from the process of synthetic linalyl acetate production.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Most people purchasing essential oils are using them therapeutically and try to stay away from synthetic chemicals. These &amp;#34;oils&amp;#34; are FULL of synthetics. These are NOT pure essential oils!</li>
            <li> helps when i have headache</li>
            <li> I see a lot of people saying they are unhappy because the scent isn&#x27;t strong. I prefer that the scent be light when I&#x27;m suffering a migraine. I think They hit the nail right on the head with this migraine relief remedy. I hate taking medications, and am always looking for safe, effective products. The key with clear head is to not over-do it. A few drops is all it takes for it to get to work. Don&#x27;t let the light scent fool you, just because its not a strong smell doesn&#x27;t mean its not a strong product. I&#x27;d recommend this for anyone looking for a safe natural way to combat migraines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product free of charge, to share my thoughts and opinions on it.</li>
            <li> When you need to free yourself from distractions and focus on a project, this stuff is awesome. It smells good too!&lt;br /&gt;For maximum benefits, apply generously, rolling on in a circular motion, 5x each, to temples, side and back of neck. Inhale deeply after each application. Reapply frequently throughout the day to promote concentration. Also try in a diffuser! Best not to use within 2 hours of bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;*I have received this product without charge to write an honest review, I have received no instruction and the opinions expressed are my own.</li>
            <li> I get really bad migraines and this has been helping so much im glad i gave it a chance</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the essential oil game. I get tension headaches and migraines fairly often. I&#x27;ve read so much about how essential oils can help. I think that this could have helped but the scent was so faint I could never tell if my diffuser was actually working or not.</li>
