            <li>My dog loves to lick it off my skin which is perfectly acceptable as it is a natural product and can be taken internally.  </li>
            <li>It might be good for the skin; but it would get all over everything, especially if I were to put it on before going to bed - Ugh!</li>
            <li>I was a size 7 when I got pregnant.</li>
            <li>Now I paint my nails red and love to wear sandals!  </li>
            <li>just before going to bed, take a warm shower to open pores and immediately apply this emu oil on   and when you get up take a shower without using soap</li>

            <li>It for sure lasts a long time</li>
            <li>Must have for dry skin and those who love using oils for moisturizing their skin.</li>
            <li>this stuff is literally pure gold in a bottle.  </li>
            <li>by using this product  daily you can greatly reduce your use of expensive creams as well as botox treatments which makes this a great  beauty investment that&#x27;ll save you lots of money over the long term.</li>
            <li>Nothing is a miracle for acne and for old scars but emu oil is such a wonderful product, I will continue to use it for a long, long time.</li>
            <li>a is  a real winner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very greasy (oily).  </li>
            <li>how well it really works for scar reduction.</li>
            <li>Thanks to c niezgoda for correcting my measuring methods.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still use it, but very dissapointed.  </li>
            <li>With a good quantity of Emu Gold left, I started using it in the mornings as an all over moisturizer (I need just a few drops) and around my eyes at night.</li>
            <li>I gained my weight near the end of my pregnancy, not over the entire (gulp) 10 months, so I ballooned out quickly.</li>
            <li>Just a small amount (dime-size) is enough to cover the entire face and this wonderful oil immediately sinks into the skin.</li>
            <li>The pump did not work, luckily I had an old empty bottle of Emu Oil and switched the pumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Within a few weeks all of the fine lines around my eyes were gone, and my persistent rosacea had all but disappeared.</li>
            <li>After a 6 month ravaging acne attack on my face, I&#x27;ve decided to switch to mostly natural approach to my skin care.</li>
            <li>I also use it on my face and it leaves it soft without any stickiness.</li>
            <li>I think someone who isn&#x27;t acne prone who has dry skin could really benefit from using Emu Oil.</li>
            <li>In general, nothing fights clogged pores, acne, and razor burn like emu oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>;) this product helps with your feet ankles achy muscles, don&#x27;t forget it helps with minor cuts and dry skin!</li>

            <li> WE ARE PLEASED WITH THE RESULTS WITH HER THIN, DRY SKIN</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and prefer using natural oils as moisturizer.</li>
            <li> 4oz bottle lasts me about 3 months, and besides using it as a moisturizer I apply it to minor burns and cuts my husband gets while working in restaurants.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess we will have to wait and see long term</li>
            <li> Will definitely continue using emu oil and will try some other brads as well.</li>
            <li> I use it every single day.  </li>
            <li> My scars have lightened, the pores have tightened, I even use it around my eyes and it&#x27;s the loveliest moisturizer for such thin, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not certain which consistency is proof of a truer/better quality emu oil, but Emu Gold is thinner and easier to work with.  </li>
            <li> THAT MY MOTHER HAD NOT HAD MET BY ANY OTHER PRODUCT WE HAVE USED.</li>
            <li> I can wait a couple of minutes, apply my foundation and not worry about having a grease slick all over my face later in the day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve removed my video review, due to my method of measuring the volume, which should be for liquids and not solids.  </li>
            <li> Probably will not order again, will try other products.</li>
            <li> So much less $ than the other creams</li>
            <li> to whoever has read/seen my previous review.  </li>
            <li> quality of oil, it has little chunks in it and is not smooth, like previous orders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would advise if you have balance problems or are elderly to be extremely careful as it tens to be very slick and could cause you to fall down.</li>
            <li> THE EMUS WERE KILLED</li>
            <li> Within a few applications, the spots of eczema had cleared up.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil to name a few.  </li>
            <li> I am 67 years old (diabetic) and used to have ugly toes -- dry and cracked cuticles and toe tips, calloused and cracked heels, fungus toenails, ingrown toenails -- so embarrassed to show anyone.  </li>
            <li> I found Emu Gold online and ordered a small bottle.</li>
            <li> I have extremely acne-prone, oily, very pale skin (so all scars show up immediately and heal very slowly).</li>
            <li> I bought this after my 18month old daughter was badly burned.</li>
            <li> and so definitely regret encouraging others to use it :( .</li>
            <li> It has skin saving properties but unfortunately my skin did not agree with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even tried the shea butter crap, which sucked.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have eczema and have a horrible time in the winter.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> THIS EMU OIL SEEMS TO BE HELPING MY ELDERLY MOTHER&#x27;S VARIED SKIN PROBLEMS. WE ARE PLEASED WITH THE RESULTS WITH HER THIN, DRY SKIN THAT BRUISES EASILY AND HAS SOME PSORIASIS LIKE LESIONS AS WELL AS SOME HARDENED KERATIN SPOTS. I DON&#x27;T LIKE THAT THE EMUS WERE KILLED BUT THIS PRODUCT SEEMS TO FILL A MEDICAL NEED THAT MY MOTHER HAD NOT HAD MET BY ANY OTHER PRODUCT WE HAVE USED. IT SEEMS TO BE WORKING TOWARD NORMALIZING THE SKIN AND TO HAVE NO NOTICEABLE SIDE EFFECTS. ALSO, IT DOES NOT PREVENT THE SKIN FROM BREATHING OR GIVE THE SKIN A HARDENED, WAXY APPEARANCE AS DO ALL OF THE PRODUCTS CONTAINING PETROLEUM PRODUCTS. I DO NOT USE IT ALONE, COMBINING IT WITH A COUPLE OF EXCELLENT MOISTURIZING PLANT OILS. BUT THIS EMU IS A BIG HELP TO HER AND THE DISPENSER BOTTLE IS EASY TO USE-- MUCH MORE SO THAN THE OTHER EMU OIL PACKAGING I HAVE USED IN THE PAST FROM OTHER COMPANIES.DR</li>
            <li> Oh emu oil, how I love thee. Absolutely the best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made for my face. I have extremely acne-prone, oily, very pale skin (so all scars show up immediately and heal very slowly). After a 6 month ravaging acne attack on my face, I&#x27;ve decided to switch to mostly natural approach to my skin care. Emu oil has played a huge part in healing my face. Just a small amount (dime-size) is enough to cover the entire face and this wonderful oil immediately sinks into the skin. It&#x27;s quite amazing. I can wait a couple of minutes, apply my foundation and not worry about having a grease slick all over my face later in the day. My scars have lightened, the pores have tightened, I even use it around my eyes and it&#x27;s the loveliest moisturizer for such thin, sensitive skin. I am so excited I found something that can help my skin heal naturally and yet quickly. Nothing is a miracle for acne and for old scars but emu oil is such a wonderful product, I will continue to use it for a long, long time.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any flareups of eczema on my elbows since I started using emu oil on them. I also use it on my face and it leaves it soft without any stickiness.</li>
            <li> fast delivery, great product.</li>
            <li> if great looking skin including your face as well as looking younger is your top priorty, this emu grade a is  a real winner. just before going to bed, take a warm shower to open pores and immediately apply this emu oil on   and when you get up take a shower without using soap and you&#x27;re guaranteed to like the results. make sure you shake  the bottle very good prior to each use and always store in a cool place out of any sunlight. by using this product  daily you can greatly reduce your use of expensive creams as well as botox treatments which makes this a great  beauty investment that&#x27;ll save you lots of money over the long term. my only regret was that i bought the 4 oz  instead of the 8 oz which would have been a better deal so don&#x27;t make the same mistake i made, just buy the 8 oz  since you&#x27;ll save money as opposed to buying (2) 4 oz bottles.</li>
            <li> About five years ago, my acupuncturist recommended emu oil as an alternative to steroid creams for her eczema.  I found Emu Gold online and ordered a small bottle. Within a few applications, the spots of eczema had cleared up. Shortly thereafter, I ran out of moisturizer and eye cream. With a good quantity of Emu Gold left, I started using it in the mornings as an all over moisturizer (I need just a few drops) and around my eyes at night. Within a few weeks all of the fine lines around my eyes were gone, and my persistent rosacea had all but disappeared. Today is my 43rd birthday, and people regularly comment that I look about 10 years younger than I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 4oz bottle lasts me about 3 months, and besides using it as a moisturizer I apply it to minor burns and cuts my husband gets while working in restaurants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used this product is quite some time.  Forget I ordered it from Amazon.  It&#x27;s very greasy (oily).  I would be afraid of getting this oil on everything I own.  It might be good for the skin; but it would get all over everything, especially if I were to put it on before going to bed - Ugh!</li>
            <li> I bought this after my 18month old daughter was badly burned. I guess we will have to wait and see long term how well it really works for scar reduction. The amazon purchase was great as usual.</li>
            <li> I am 67 years old (diabetic) and used to have ugly toes -- dry and cracked cuticles and toe tips, calloused and cracked heels, fungus toenails, ingrown toenails -- so embarrassed to show anyone.  Now I paint my nails red and love to wear sandals!  Love emu oil!</li>
            <li> Love this product , it has no smell, will buy again!</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!;) this product helps with your feet ankles achy muscles, don&#x27;t forget it helps with minor cuts and dry skin! Makes it all better Emu Gold is awesome!!</li>
            <li> This brand emu oil is easier for me to work with compared to another brand I&#x27;ve bought and used, which is thicker.  I&#x27;m not certain which consistency is proof of a truer/better quality emu oil, but Emu Gold is thinner and easier to work with.  In general, nothing fights clogged pores, acne, and razor burn like emu oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve removed my video review, due to my method of measuring the volume, which should be for liquids and not solids.  I could measure for liquid ounces, but that would no doubt cause me to lose some of the costly emu oil.  But, I do kind of owe that to whoever has read/seen my previous review.  If I decide to do that, I&#x27;ll post an updated review.  Thanks to c niezgoda for correcting my measuring methods.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me, along with copper peptide, to prevent red bruising on my arms. I got them from the slightest pressure. After just a week or so, my arms stopped bruising! I am amazed.</li>
            <li> I love emu oil. I was so happy when I received my product. Helps great with people that have dry skin. Wish the product was shipped faster. It took a while to get to me.</li>
            <li> My daughter has severe eczema and heard that emu oil works great.  It turned her skin red and I returned it.  Amazon was very easy to deal with for the return.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using emu oil. I have eczema and have a horrible time in the winter. Mixing this with my fragrance free lotion seems to be a great combo so far.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Emu Gold oil is the best emu oil out there, in my opinion.  It absorbs nicely and fairly quickly into my dry skin.  I use it under my eyes very lightly daily under my eye makeup and it seems to help keep the wrinkles flatter.  I also use it all over after showering.  My dog loves to lick it off my skin which is perfectly acceptable as it is a natural product and can be taken internally.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Emu Gold for my wife because I wanted the best quality for her.&lt;br /&gt;Emu oil was highly recommended by our Daughter-In-Law, Kim, for she was very impressed with the results she had experienced in using it. My wife had used some of the Emu oil from Kim and was favorably impressed.&lt;br /&gt;We would recommend the use of Emu oil for those with health issues concerning their skin.</li>
            <li> I use this every day.  Love it</li>
            <li> This is a very great quality emu oil. It comes with beautiful glass bottle and a pump. I am an oil person and love using oils for moisturizing my face. I have very dry skin and prefer using natural oils as moisturizer. It moisturizes my skin beautifully without leaving any oily residue and adds glow to my face. I use it twice daily on my skin and once a week on my hair. I am totally in love with this emu oil. My husband has problem of hair fall and I am using this oil on his hair as well. It had greatly reduced his hair fall and they look more thicker and fuller. Must have for dry skin and those who love using oils for moisturizing their skin. Great quality oil but I feel it more on expensive side. Will definitely continue using emu oil and will try some other brads as well. Just wanted to mention that it comes from emu bird and so definitely regret encouraging others to use it :( . I wish it was a plant based oil.</li>
            <li> Emu Oil is great for arthritis.  Used on knees gives relief.  I would recommend emu oil for that reason.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try.</li>
            <li> Great at moisturizing the skin, however, it broke me out several occasions. I think someone who isn&#x27;t acne prone who has dry skin could really benefit from using Emu Oil. It has skin saving properties but unfortunately my skin did not agree with it.</li>
            <li> Got very fast relief.  Friend recommended and  I was thrilled with the resulting lessening of my pain level., Try it and see. It is is over the counter.</li>
            <li> I use this on my dry cracked feet, it really works good. I would advise if you have balance problems or are elderly to be extremely careful as it tens to be very slick and could cause you to fall down. works great though.</li>
            <li> My skin never looked and felt better</li>
            <li> The pump did not work, luckily I had an old empty bottle of Emu Oil and switched the pumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poor quality of oil, it has little chunks in it and is not smooth, like previous orders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still use it, but very dissapointed.  Probably will not order again, will try other products.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff!! I was a size 7 when I got pregnant. I put on 60 pounds and now a size 11/13. I gained my weight near the end of my pregnancy, not over the entire (gulp) 10 months, so I ballooned out quickly. I have NO stretch marks! I owe it to this fabulous Emu oil. So much less $ than the other creams/oils out there. I will be getting more for my next pregnancy. Also makes a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have used many moisturizers over the years.  Cetaphil to name a few.  I&#x27;ve even tried the shea butter crap, which sucked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now this stuff is literally pure gold in a bottle.  It&#x27;s perfect for it&#x27;s job.  I&#x27;ve had it for 4 months now and there is still a lot left in the 4 oz bottle.  I use it every single day.  It for sure lasts a long time and I didn&#x27;t expect it to.  Great purchase.</li>
            <li> Love it! Effective product!</li>
            <li> I LIE THIS  EMU OIL IT HAS A GOOD FEELING ON THE SKIN ,I USE IT AT BEDTIME . GREAT BUY</li>
