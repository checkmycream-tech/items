            <li>Based on the picture of the sock - it makes it look like there is a 1 1/2&amp;#34; to 2&amp;#34; frill around the top of the sock and there is not so</li>
            <li>I think they&#x27;re recommended for wearing around the house and at night in bed as overnight moisturizing therapy, but I even wore them during the day when I was out running errands since they are so comfortable that I didn&#x27;t want to take them off!  </li>

            <li>but I didn&#x27;t find that they softened my feet any better than using my own foot cream with a regular sock.</li>
            <li>I also love the silver-grey color, since I tend to wear a lot of grey anyway, so they look nice with my outfits.</li>
            <li>They are warm and soft.  </li>
            <li>I experienced a little variation in the thickness and cozyness.</li>

            <li> Because I realized that out, in a store, I could have found them cheaper, at half price that the one pair I bought through internet.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Too small for me</li>
            <li> Worthless!  </li>

            <li> Love em!! Super soft and cozy!</li>
            <li> I wore these in a pair of boots and they actually fell apart!  I was shocked because I have other pairs that I loved.</li>
            <li> I gave these socks to all my friends for Christmas as a &amp;#34;one of my favorite things&amp;#34;. Everyone commented that the Aloe socks are now one of their favorite things.</li>
            <li> Heaven! The item was as described, well packaged, and promptly shipped. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I was given a pair of these socks as a gift and wanted some for my daughter.  They are warm and soft.  Some of the best I have ever worn</li>
            <li> The aloe socks have done wondeers for my old tired aching feet.  They are warm and moisturized, perfect for dry skin.</li>
            <li> These socks made my friend going through breast cancer treatment very happy!</li>
            <li> Based on the picture of the sock - it makes it look like there is a 1 1/2&amp;#34; to 2&amp;#34; frill around the top of the sock and there is not so the socks are a bit shorter than anticipated. They are incredibly soft which is a plus. I wore them for 4-5 nights in a row  but I didn&#x27;t find that they softened my feet any better than using my own foot cream with a regular sock. The socks are not expensive and this is one instance that you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> These are great socks.  Winter in Michigan lends itself to dry air and dry skin.  I wear aloe/moisturing socks every day during the winter months to keep my feet smooth and moisturized.  I specifically buy these types of socks so that even when the product wears out inside, I can still use them when covering my feet in baby oil and body butter.  They prevent the grease from getting onto my sheets, which makes me a happy girl.  I recommend this purchase.</li>
            <li> Because I realized that out, in a store, I could have found them cheaper, at half price that the one pair I bought through internet.</li>
            <li> Worthless!  Too small for me and my feet couldn&#x27;t breathe.  As such my feet sweat a lot, and they did nothing to soften my skin.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> These feel very good on your feet-- extremely soft &amp; comfortable!  I think they&#x27;re recommended for wearing around the house and at night in bed as overnight moisturizing therapy, but I even wore them during the day when I was out running errands since they are so comfortable that I didn&#x27;t want to take them off!  I also love the silver-grey color, since I tend to wear a lot of grey anyway, so they look nice with my outfits.</li>
            <li> These have to be some of the softest socks ever made! The moisturizer inside the socks make my feet feel wonderful. Good price and prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> This is something new to us, socks that are Aloe moisturized. My wife puts them on at night and it helps to keep her dry feet moist.&lt;br /&gt;What a find. Will luxuries never quit. This makes keep feet moisturized so much easier for someone with back issues especially&lt;br /&gt;We heartily recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love these socks use them all the time, have given for gifts and was so please to see them in Grey for the men in my life!!</li>
            <li> good product info and shipping</li>
            <li> Bought these for house socks, especially the dark color...liked &#x27;em so much this is my second order!!</li>
            <li> what can you say about a sock.  Works as intended</li>
            <li> My husband loves these socks.  They are soft, well sized and comfy!  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to pick up another pair as needed...</li>
            <li> The socks are good! This is the first time I ordered other color that wasn&#x27;t blue or pink (this were the only ones I found at the supermarket).I was surprised thay  I experienced a little variation in the thickness and cozyness. I felt The gray ones a little bit thinner but even though very soft as usual!</li>
            <li> Ordered from Hardbody.  Socks feel cheap and used.  This is my seventh pair and nothing like the pairs I&#x27;ve bought from other sellers/stores.  Will not order again.</li>
            <li> I have these socks in black, gray, and pink. These are so incredibly soft and silky, they feel wonderful on the feet plus they keep the feet warm. These are perfect for sleeping in, the ones with the rubber treads I find harder to sleep in. The only downside is we don&#x27;t have carpet and they can be a bit slippery, but that&#x27;s why I have ET&#x27;s socks with the rubber treads (also amazing socks!). I love giving these as gifts, the women in my life love them. I only wish they came in bigger sizes as I know my dad would love a pair. These wear well and wash well and I&#x27;ve had one pair for a couple of years. Also, another bonus is they are lightweight enough to comfortably wear with shoes.</li>
