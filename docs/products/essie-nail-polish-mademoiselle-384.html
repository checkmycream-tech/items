            <li>My favorite!</li>
            <li>to have my own bottle to bring with me to salon when getting my nails done.</li>
            <li>I do my own nails, so over the years I&#x27;ve purchased every brand of polish out there, and for natural, non-acrylic nails, Essie is the best.  </li>
            <li>This color is a great color, very complimenting!</li>
            <li>the color was very light</li>
            <li>This color is just lovely.</li>
            <li>More if you want the color as shown on the bottle.</li>
            <li>LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>If you want to paint your nails fir a nice event or just a color that isn&#x27;t so loud then this is a great color.</li>
            <li>The price was phenomenal and was cheaper than retail even with the shipping and handling.  </li>
            <li>I like to wear three coats for a slightly more opaque effect.  </li>
            <li>The shade is customizable, depending on how many coats you use.</li>
            <li>This colour looks chic and sophisticated on my fingers.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>but this really produces great results.</li>
            <li>This polish is a lovely neutral color that accentuates the creaminess of your skin.</li>
            <li>I love Essie polishes because of their strength.</li>
            <li>I love it-</li>
            <li>I get compliments on this color. :)</li>
            <li>Perfect for a french manicure or by itself.</li>
            <li>Have to spply a few coats to get any color but its still a great nailpolish at a great price.</li>
            <li>It is sophisticated and light.</li>
            <li>I love Essie nail polishes, but the color is too light.</li>
            <li>I love this Essie nail polish Mademoiselle , it makes me feel like a Mademoiselle when I wear it ,it is a beautiful color sheer looking and kept my nails</li>
            <li>It did not chip or peel and it was easy to put on.</li>
            <li>Be sure to add a top coat to keep it looking fresh.</li>
            <li>strong everyone noticed my nails when I went to visit my friend at a hospital the nurses kept coming in and out of the room noticing my nails</li>
            <li>This was a beautiful nail polish, however it is definitely not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>The quality is very good but not the shade that I had expected.  </li>
            <li>This is a great summery shade, or for people who like to wear polish without having it be too obvious.</li>
            <li>This color is too light for me.</li>
            <li>wonder it was so cheap.</li>
            <li>The Essie formula is great, no streakiness whatsoever, even though it is so sheer.</li>
            <li>I liked this product for the professional women who may not be able to wear a bright color to work, but wants more than clear polish.</li>
            <li>I love this color, along with Essie&#x27;s  white shade called \\&quot; marshmallow\\&quot; for the perfect French manicure.  </li>
            <li>:) I absolutely ADORE mademoiselle from Essie!</li>
            <li>This color is pretty sheer, so keep that in mind, but it&#x27;s a really beautiful neutral polish.</li>
            <li>Nails look good for 3 to 5 days, but I&#x27;ve never found polish to last longer than that any brand.</li>
            <li>This polish goes on effortlessly, dries quickly and evenly.  </li>
            <li>received this product quickly</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a more opaque version of this, I highly recommend Fiji.</li>
            <li>My friend has dark olive skin and it looks just as great on her as well.</li>
            <li>I can put 2 coats for a very clear look or add 2 more layers for a matte style.  </li>
            <li>The consistency is not sticky or too thin, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>,one of the nurses was a male he even liked the color kept starring at my nails.amazon</li>
            <li>Two or more coats adds just a touch more of a pink hue.</li>
            <li>Processing and shipping was faster than expected and the product was in good condition.</li>
            <li>Like many have said, the first coat is clear.</li>
            <li>love essie nail polish in general</li>
            <li>This shade is great year round!</li>
            <li>I was expecting more pinkish but a nice soft pink with a COLOR in it..........</li>
            <li>A fresh bottle works/lasts sooo much longer on the nails than older/thinned out bottles at salons.</li>
            <li>anybody else have better results with a pre-coat of white polish?</li>
            <li>, so it came out looking elegantly pretty.</li>
            <li>The shipping was also incredibly fast!</li>
            <li>I dont know why ppl said this one is good the wear everyday????</li>
            <li>It is an all year long color for sure.</li>
            <li>At first I thought this was very blah.  </li>
            <li>However, after the 3 coats I like to apply Seche top coat in order to quickly dry my manicure.  </li>
            <li>A fabulous product for everyday or special occasions.  </li>
            <li>They may take forever to fully dry, but once they do they make your nails really strong.</li>
            <li>Essie polishes are very high quality and don&#x27;t really need a top coat to last and last.  </li>
            <li>One coat looks clear, two coats look a bit more pink, but if you really want the color to show like it does in the bottle, you need three to four coats.</li>
            <li>One coat looks pretty, and natural.</li>
            <li>This is a classic I will continue to wear for years.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>i was expecting it to be a little more</li>
            <li>It really does look like clear nail polish.</li>
            <li>However its much lighter than what is pictured...almost clear.</li>
            <li>I love this shade for everyday wear.</li>
            <li>The second, however, gives a nice nude color for French manicures and a third a pinkish color like shown.</li>
            <li>One or two will get you a slight sheen to your regular color, and 4 will get you a beautiful pink shade.</li>
            <li>Quick to dry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice pink but not to pink neutral shade.</li>
            <li>is very near flesh and natural.</li>
            <li>and I still have more than half left.</li>
            <li>Only complaint is that it chips a little quickly, other than that this natural colour is great for women who just want to blend in and have a clean pure manicure.</li>
            <li>Pretty and clean, pink but not too pink.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pretty, a pale translucent pale pink that&#x27;s great for French manicures or to wear alone.  </li>
            <li>This color is basically clear it does not come out in this color</li>
            <li>This polish is practically a tinted clear coat.</li>
            <li>One or two coats for a natural look.</li>
            <li>The color is perfection if you&#x27;re looking for a natural look.  </li>
            <li>it is a wow color</li>
            <li>It goes from jeans to an evening gown with no trouble and it lasts well.  </li>
            <li>This is the perfect polish for a &amp;#34;naked&amp;#34; nail base with a glossy look.</li>
            <li>The trick to get a color out of this nail polish is to do another coat AFTER the first one is mostly dry.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something a little more pink and still polished try Essie Sugar Daddy.</li>
            <li>Apply just one coat for a simple and subtle shine that highlights the natural color of your nails, or two coats for even more color and gloss.  </li>
            <li>I have had problems with it chipping, but I think that&#x27;s probably more because I&#x27;m tough on my nails than the nail polish itself.</li>
            <li>It is even worse than my cheaper top coat.</li>
            <li>I expected more of a solid, visible, PALE pink to show up on my nails, rather than just a sheen that didn&#x27;t have much depth to it.</li>
            <li>It is so sheer, you can barely see it.</li>

            <li> It is so sheer, you can barely see it.</li>
            <li> Final color once dry (with one coat of color)</li>
            <li> One coat is a really shiny clear but you need at least two coats for the typical French manicure pink.</li>
            <li> The color is like baby doll pink.</li>
            <li> I would purchase other colours if It were to be worn alone</li>
            <li> I will probably just buy online from now on, because I can&#x27;t find it retail for less than $8 a bottle.</li>
            <li> Why go through the trouble of painting my nails if they look a lot like they did before?</li>
            <li> I have pale skin</li>
            <li> I read somewhere that Essie herself usually wears this color to work.  </li>
            <li> I received the polish in 3 days, which is almost unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> While I adore this brand, I really was disappointed by the sheerness of this color.</li>
            <li> Essie polish is hard to beat and this color is so hard to beat.  </li>
            <li> It is feminine and delicate.</li>
            <li> I like a nail polish color that is subtle, that can give a translucent color and glow.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However the color itself was too thin for me to use.</li>
            <li> I even tried using a white base and it was still to thin.</li>
            <li> It goes with everything - from casual to dress up to tuxes and wedding dresses.</li>
            <li> Also no worries about the chips making the manicure look bad after a day or two.  </li>
            <li> I use a ridge filling base coat, two coats of Mademoiselle followed by Essie</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in my purchase.</li>

            <li> This color is basically clear it does not come out in this color you can&#x27;t even tell you have on polish</li>
            <li> This polish is practically a tinted clear coat. I had to put four coats on to get the color to show. I&#x27;m very disappointed in my purchase.</li>
            <li> This nail polish brand is excellent. This color is just lovely. One or two coats for a natural look. More if you want the color as shown on the bottle. It goes with everything - from casual to dress up to tuxes and wedding dresses. I do declare - you don&#x27;t need another color once you have this. I even use on my toes. LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I stock up on it. One coat is a really shiny clear but you need at least two coats for the typical French manicure pink. Quick to dry. Durable. Inexpensive. LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I love this color, along with Essie&#x27;s  white shade called \\&quot; marshmallow\\&quot; for the perfect French manicure.  I do my own nails, so over the years I&#x27;ve purchased every brand of polish out there, and for natural, non-acrylic nails, Essie is the best.  I will probably just buy online from now on, because I can&#x27;t find it retail for less than $8 a bottle.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect color for professionals to wear during the week.  It adds just enough color to make your nails look \\&quot;done\\&quot; without calling attention to them.  I read somewhere that Essie herself usually wears this color to work.  This is a classic I will continue to wear for years.</li>
            <li> I love this shade for everyday wear. It&#x27;s a nice pink but not to pink neutral shade. I have had problems with it chipping, but I think that&#x27;s probably more because I&#x27;m tough on my nails than the nail polish itself.</li>
            <li> This color is a great color, very complimenting! It is an all year long color for sure. If you want to paint your nails fir a nice event or just a color that isn&#x27;t so loud then this is a great color.</li>
            <li> This polish goes on effortlessly, dries quickly and evenly.  The color is perfection if you&#x27;re looking for a natural look.  I can put 2 coats for a very clear look or add 2 more layers for a matte style.  It always dries, even with 4-5 coats.  The price was phenomenal and was cheaper than retail even with the shipping and handling.  I received the polish in 3 days, which is almost unbelievable.  I will definitely order again and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This color flatters all skin colors.  It&#x27;s very pretty, a pale translucent pale pink that&#x27;s great for French manicures or to wear alone.  Apply just one coat for a simple and subtle shine that highlights the natural color of your nails, or two coats for even more color and gloss.  I like to wear three coats for a slightly more opaque effect.  Essie polishes are very high quality and don&#x27;t really need a top coat to last and last.  However, after the 3 coats I like to apply Seche top coat in order to quickly dry my manicure.  I have pale skin and it makes my hands look great.  My friend has dark olive skin and it looks just as great on her as well.</li>
            <li> the color was very light i was expecting it to be a little more noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;I love essie nail polish in general just the color wasn&#x27;t the greatest!</li>
            <li> A fabulous product for everyday or special occasions.  I like the translucent color.  The polish viscosity is perfect for application.  A staple polish!</li>
            <li> This is a great summery shade, or for people who like to wear polish without having it be too obvious. The shade is customizable, depending on how many coats you use. One or two will get you a slight sheen to your regular color, and 4 will get you a beautiful pink shade.</li>
            <li> This colour looks chic and sophisticated on my fingers. I love it. Since its initial use, my nails are stronger and look healthier. Of course I still file and massage cuticle oil into my nails as well but this really produces great results. Only complaint is that it chips a little quickly, other than that this natural colour is great for women who just want to blend in and have a clean pure manicure.</li>
            <li> This color is too light for me. It really does look like clear nail polish. If you&#x27;re looking for something a little more pink and still polished try Essie Sugar Daddy.</li>
            <li> I love this color from Essie! It is sophisticated and light. The color is like baby doll pink. One coat looks clear, two coats look a bit more pink, but if you really want the color to show like it does in the bottle, you need three to four coats. I use about three coats when I use it and I still have more than half left. The consistency is not sticky or too thin, it&#x27;s perfect. It also doesn&#x27;t chip! This shade is great year round! You can&#x27;t help but feel French wearing it. :) I absolutely ADORE mademoiselle from Essie! For sure buy it!</li>
            <li> This polish is a lovely neutral color that accentuates the creaminess of your skin. It did not chip or peel and it was easy to put on.</li>
            <li> I love Essie nail polishes, but the color is too light. Why go through the trouble of painting my nails if they look a lot like they did before?</li>
            <li> I love Essie polishes because of their strength. They may take forever to fully dry, but once they do they make your nails really strong. This color is pretty sheer, so keep that in mind, but it&#x27;s a really beautiful neutral polish.</li>
            <li> I love this Essie nail polish Mademoiselle , it makes me feel like a Mademoiselle when I wear it ,it is a beautiful color sheer looking and kept my nails strong everyone noticed my nails when I went to visit my friend at a hospital the nurses kept coming in and out of the room noticing my nails finally I told them it&#x27;s Essie nail polish Mademoiselle they all went wow,I said yeah it is a wow color,one of the nurses was a male he even liked the color kept starring at my nails.amazon thank you as always for bringing us the customers great products for lower prices,and I told the nurses get it at amazon they have the best prices.</li>
            <li> It is not even a nail polish, no color in it. It doesnt even shine after 2 coats!!! I dont know why ppl said this one is good the wear everyday???? I was expecting more pinkish but a nice soft pink with a COLOR in it..........&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like I did not take care of my nail at all and put nothing on it! It is even worse than my cheaper top coat. I thought Essie has good polishes, but i dont know why they even manufacture this kind of trash?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No wonder it was so cheap. But in fact it was not, 3.85 plus shipping plus tax&#x3D; cost me $7 almost same as stores. If it was a good product i then would not be regret.</li>
            <li> Essie polish is hard to beat and this color is so hard to beat.  It goes from jeans to an evening gown with no trouble and it lasts well.  Definitely recommended.  Be sure to add a top coat to keep it looking fresh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for polish that makes my nails look awesome and this is it!! Pretty and clean, pink but not too pink.  Also no worries about the chips making the manicure look bad after a day or two.  I use a ridge filling base coat, two coats of Mademoiselle followed by Essie No Chips Ahead.  Nails look good for 3 to 5 days, but I&#x27;ve never found polish to last longer than that any brand.</li>
            <li> without all the work.  At first I thought this was very blah.  It has grown on me and now is one of my favorites.  It lasts until I take it off.</li>
            <li> I love it- It looks like an American french tip when I apply three coats of it!! I get compliments on this color. :)</li>
            <li> The quality is very good but not the shade that I had expected.  But a good product and goes on great</li>
            <li> to have my own bottle to bring with me to salon when getting my nails done. A fresh bottle works/lasts sooo much longer on the nails than older/thinned out bottles at salons. Final color once dry (with one coat of color) is very near flesh and natural.</li>
            <li> While I adore this brand, I really was disappointed by the sheerness of this color. I expected more of a solid, visible, PALE pink to show up on my nails, rather than just a sheen that didn&#x27;t have much depth to it. Perhaps applying a layer of white polish beforehand would solve this problem... anybody else have better results with a pre-coat of white polish?</li>
            <li> I like a nail polish color that is subtle, that can give a translucent color and glow.  This is perfect.</li>
            <li> Like many have said, the first coat is clear. The second, however, gives a nice nude color for French manicures and a third a pinkish color like shown. The trick to get a color out of this nail polish is to do another coat AFTER the first one is mostly dry. If you do it before you get no color.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product quickly and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I liked this product for the professional women who may not be able to wear a bright color to work, but wants more than clear polish. Very elegant!</li>
            <li> This was a beautiful nail polish, however it is definitely not what I was expecting. It is so sheer, you can barely see it. I did not deduct stars for this because if I would&#x27;ve read the reviews I would have known it is not opaque. I used it with three coats and I have a tan, so it came out looking elegantly pretty. Perfect for a french manicure or by itself. If you&#x27;re looking for a more opaque version of this, I highly recommend Fiji. The Essie formula is great, no streakiness whatsoever, even though it is so sheer. The shipping was also incredibly fast!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect polish for a &amp;#34;naked&amp;#34; nail base with a glossy look. It is feminine and delicate. One coat looks pretty, and natural. Two or more coats adds just a touch more of a pink hue. My favorite!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great color. However its much lighter than what is pictured...almost clear. Have to spply a few coats to get any color but its still a great nailpolish at a great price.</li>
            <li> Processing and shipping was faster than expected and the product was in good condition. I would consider ordering from this company again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However the color itself was too thin for me to use. Even with multiple coats. I even tried using a white base and it was still to thin.</li>
            <li> The colour is too sheer, however it makes a great base for a French manicure. I would purchase other colours if It were to be worn alone</li>
