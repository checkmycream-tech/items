            <li>Arrived quickly, perfect condition and was cheap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall nothing but good things about this.</li>
            <li>Works good, and I like that it&#x27;s a plug-in, so</li>
            <li>It feels well made with good quality parts.  </li>
            <li>Not bad, but not the best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Very satisfied with this product</li>
            <li>This is the first trimmer that I bought and it is wonderful is</li>
            <li>I am so glad someone still makes something with a cord!</li>
            <li>No pulling, nice that it has the guards</li>
            <li>a cinch.&lt;br /&gt;Also, me and my girlfriend kind of got gutsy with it</li>
            <li>This is an effective trimmer if you want to maintain your beard and mustache.  </li>
            <li>Works really nice for mustache and sideburn trimming. . . .</li>
            <li>Nifty trimmer -- 1st electric  trimmer (scissors before) for me -- nice heft</li>
            <li>It does the job nicely</li>
            <li>I originally bought this trimmer at a discount department store and was really happy that it was AC powered.</li>
            <li>Attachments fit nicely!</li>
            <li>No complaint here, It works perfectly</li>
            <li>So now I have a practically new, perfectly working trimmer than I can&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li>Will not mix up good deal with cheap again.</li>
            <li>but i guess it is a good buy for how cheap it costs</li>
            <li>I travel a lot and cordless is nice, but I was using way too many batteries.</li>
            <li>He says it works great , has no complaints &amp; price was just right.</li>
            <li>Always good power, clean trim and no pulling or tugging.  </li>
            <li>Even with a cord it is very light and gives you the type of trim you get at the barber.  </li>
            <li>What a difference, the Conair cuts better and closer.</li>
            <li>But in the end, this thing cuts way better.</li>
            <li>Works well, much more power than the battery ones.</li>
            <li>Well pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I have used battery operated ones for years and these plug in ones work a lot better.  </li>
            <li>Looks cheap, but works amazingly well.  </li>
            <li>wish there was a couple more attachments to use.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that</li>
            <li>This is a great clipper at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Love the cord...</li>
            <li>I love the sliding head because I can pack it along with the trimmer as a one piece unit in my overnight bag.</li>
            <li>So far this works incredibly well.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t give a better review star than 4.</li>
            <li>he seems to love it and uses it often</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than those battery operated models that never stay charged.</li>
            <li>And, this one is priced a lot better than most of the others.  </li>
            <li>/feel in hand -- appears solidly made -- excellent product/price.</li>
            <li>Excellent trimmer especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I love not having to worry about charging and batteries.</li>
            <li>That was more convenient, but after a while the battery had shorter and shorter</li>
            <li>for the price, i was pleased with the quality of this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Glad I&#x27;m not using a rechargeable anymore.</li>
            <li>Glad to have switched to this corded one.</li>
            <li>just what I expected, good brand, good quality, easy to use, the cord had a good length and allow you to manipulate easily.</li>
            <li>worked pretty good</li>
            <li>This trimmer always has full power, and does an outstanding job at an outstanding price.</li>
            <li>I was surprised it was not as great a product as the reviews it received</li>
            <li>Works easily, and the attachments are easy to use.</li>
            <li>They run steady and do a good job.</li>
            <li>Cord is of ample length and motor seems strong.</li>
            <li>The trimmer works fine.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer itself is just fine, and I prefer the corded version since I bought this to replace a rechargeable one that wasn&#x27;t working anymore.  </li>
            <li>its light weight and easy to use, and</li>
            <li>That works fine for me, but I know others may not like that.</li>
            <li>Easy &amp; straightforward to use.  </li>
            <li>I luv the price, package was wrapped really secure</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Im happy with it especially for the price.</li>
            <li>The included combs don&#x27;t feel cheap and fit on the trimmer well.  </li>
            <li>And, of course it does a great job when trimming my facial hair which is why I purchased it.</li>
            <li>Trimmer is great however, my husband said the settings the manual says to use are too short for his liking.</li>
            <li>they felt cheap but for 10 bucks, I knew that would probably be the case,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and leaves clean results.</li>
            <li>And the accesssories and parts from y battery powered model fit this.  </li>
            <li>This is more powerful than a battery one IMO and never needs batteries.</li>
            <li>Trimmer is tiny and cuts very nicely.</li>
            <li>I replaced an older cordless model of this Conair Trimmer and it works great as the older model no longer held a charge.</li>
            <li>Well worth it!</li>
            <li>After going on two separate long flights, and my rechargeable&#x27;s for some reason always quit working, this is the answer with great results.</li>
            <li>Bought for my husband who has pretty healthy stubble.</li>
            <li>and so far I&#x27;m very satisfied with the performance of the blades.</li>
            <li>Works well and trims a lot better and consistent than battery operated trimmers.</li>
            <li>This small, plug-in razor is perfect.  </li>
            <li>but the attachments don&#x27;t have as many different lengths as I would have liked</li>
            <li>These clippers are really cool.  </li>
            <li>overall, a good product, though I don&#x27;t use it a lot</li>
            <li>works well, ez to use, and dont have to recharge it to make sure it&#x27;s ready for use..</li>
            <li>These fit the bill and the price was right.</li>
            <li>The Wahl has more curves and it simply felt better to use.  </li>
            <li>Quickly and effortlessly adjusts to any desired length.  </li>
            <li>works quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li>After many a battery trimmer left me hanging with a scruffy beard, I went searching for a good old fashioned plug in trimmer.</li>
            <li>Quite powerful.</li>
            <li>Trust me try it out, for the price it is worth it.</li>
            <li>I purchased this corded beard trimmer for my husband, after his rechargeable beard trimmer died, since I decided that a corded trimmer would be more convenient for him than replacing the old one with another rechargeable model.  </li>
            <li>Buy this if you are tired of buying batteries and need a great inexpensive trimmer!</li>
            <li>I purchased this model due to it&#x27;s name, (a good reputation in beauty products) and price.  </li>
            <li>I use it without attachments for the edging and the attachments for keeping mustache at the right length.  </li>
            <li>the right attachments.</li>
            <li>After going through many battery and cordless trimmers, all of which quickly lost power and eventually died, I decided to go back to basics.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what I wanted, and the price is right.  </li>
            <li>I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t come with enough length accessories, but it has three sizes for shorter facial hair that have worked great, as well as an longer adjustable size attachment that I haven&#x27;t used.</li>
            <li>The cutter moves very fast so it cuts evenly.  </li>
            <li>will not trim my stash at all and is really quiet indicating no power had a great trimmer that fell into the toilet</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good little trimmer.  </li>
            <li>at first lasted maybe 6 weeks .</li>
            <li>Works great, cord is long enough and don&#x27;t have to change batteries.</li>
            <li>I bought my first one and it grabbed my hairs on the first use.</li>
            <li>By the time it arrived, he had spawned a pretty hefty beard.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what I want it to do.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used It I was amazed how it felt in hand.  </li>
            <li>So, user beware to go even longer on the suggested longest setting when first using it.</li>
            <li>For a trim it pretty much have him a close shave the first time.</li>
            <li>hair but this is used to keep my beard clean and general manscaping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems a little under powered for a plug in unit, but still trims whiskers nicely.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really beat it for the price.</li>
            <li>Got this for my guy as a replacement for a cheap panasonic one he accidentally left when we were on holiday.</li>
            <li>no battery power -- still very convenient.</li>
            <li>The blades cuts really well.</li>
            <li>Not too much to complain about it.</li>
            <li>I wish my cordless razor had this much power.</li>
            <li>Much to my horror i ripped off the whole metal assembly trying to get the plastic piece off.</li>
            <li>I came very close to just throwing it in the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It serves the purpose, but the problem is its not very useful because it is not waterproof, and you can&#x27;t use it in the shower, which would be a lot more convenient.</li>
            <li>They started getting very loud and hot</li>
            <li>He doesnt mind the cord at all - most sinks have an outlet nearby!</li>
            <li>It is ok for the price, but there are other machines that cut shorter.</li>
            <li>i was able to snap it back together, however it took 20 minutes of frustration that I will never get back.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a couple rechargeable trimmers that weren&#x27;t powerful enough or died prematurely (although perhaps more expensive ones perform better).  </li>
            <li>I was tired of my other razor running out of power, now I don&#x27;t have to worry about it with this corded model and it trims awesome with the additional combs.</li>
            <li>It only pulled one time while I was shaving his neck, and he said that overall, it was more comfortable than the other (inexpensive) trimmer we had been using.</li>
            <li>This trimmer was a great value for the money, and it&#x27;s also a dependable time-saver, so I highly recommend it for anyone who is tired of waiting for a rechargeable trimmer to recharge!</li>
            <li>After about 5 months of normal use, the comb broke.  </li>
            <li>My husband has a super coarse, thick beard, so even though it doesn&#x27;t just glide through the hair easily, it keeps up pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Came with all the pieces in brand new package.</li>
            <li>They will bog down in the most thick parts, but still power through better then their battery counter parts.</li>
            <li>First day i opened it and popped on the plastic heads, trying out the different ones.</li>
            <li>I am giving two stars because they might be ok for the average person that only uses once a week</li>
            <li>No batteries to mess with and cheap too boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does the job, not super versatile, but it is corded and is way better than the cordless ones that never last.</li>
            <li>far I like the power and it trims well.  </li>
            <li>but they are not for a professional</li>
            <li>but this week it made a loud pop while shaving</li>
            <li>So far the adapters have given me options that I like.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s held up thus far.</li>
            <li>I chipped a tooth off my old one - my fault</li>
            <li>It is powerful, so be careful.</li>
            <li>and that seemed to work at first, but it only last a couple of uses before it broke again.  </li>
            <li>I am still willing to buy another one even though it came to an abrupt end.</li>
            <li>will not cut as close as others, not sharp, pulls hairs..</li>
            <li>This was to replace an old corded Wahl trimmer I left at a hotel.  </li>
            <li>The sound made my grandma almost ill. 0 from 10, pure piece of s</li>
            <li>I need to shave multiple times a week to keep my neck and face bare.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent much more money on far worse trimmers.</li>
            <li>Though my hair isn&#x27;t super thick.</li>
            <li>Dropped one star because the fixed trim attachments are limited, and I don&#x27;t like the bulk of the adjustable one.</li>

            <li> What a difference, the Conair cuts better and closer.</li>
            <li> But in the end, this thing cuts way better.</li>
            <li> Works well, much more power than the battery ones.</li>
            <li> Well pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I have used battery operated ones for years and these plug in ones work a lot better.  </li>
            <li> Looks cheap, but works amazingly well.  </li>
            <li> wish there was a couple more attachments to use.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that</li>
            <li> This is a great clipper at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Love the cord...</li>
            <li> I love the sliding head because I can pack it along with the trimmer as a one piece unit in my overnight bag.</li>
            <li> So far this works incredibly well.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t give a better review star than 4.</li>
            <li> he seems to love it and uses it often</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than those battery operated models that never stay charged.</li>
            <li> And, this one is priced a lot better than most of the others.  </li>
            <li> /feel in hand -- appears solidly made -- excellent product/price.</li>
            <li> Excellent trimmer especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I love not having to worry about charging and batteries.</li>
            <li> That was more convenient, but after a while the battery had shorter and shorter</li>
            <li> for the price, i was pleased with the quality of this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Glad I&#x27;m not using a rechargeable anymore.</li>
            <li> Glad to have switched to this corded one.</li>
            <li> just what I expected, good brand, good quality, easy to use, the cord had a good length and allow you to manipulate easily.</li>
            <li> worked pretty good</li>
            <li> This trimmer always has full power, and does an outstanding job at an outstanding price.</li>
            <li> I was surprised it was not as great a product as the reviews it received</li>
            <li> Works easily, and the attachments are easy to use.</li>
            <li> They run steady and do a good job.</li>
            <li> Cord is of ample length and motor seems strong.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works fine.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer itself is just fine, and I prefer the corded version since I bought this to replace a rechargeable one that wasn&#x27;t working anymore.  </li>
            <li> its light weight and easy to use, and</li>
            <li> That works fine for me, but I know others may not like that.</li>
            <li> Easy &amp; straightforward to use.  </li>
            <li> I luv the price, package was wrapped really secure</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Im happy with it especially for the price.</li>
            <li> The included combs don&#x27;t feel cheap and fit on the trimmer well.  </li>
            <li> And, of course it does a great job when trimming my facial hair which is why I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Trimmer is great however, my husband said the settings the manual says to use are too short for his liking.</li>
            <li> they felt cheap but for 10 bucks, I knew that would probably be the case,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and leaves clean results.</li>
            <li> And the accesssories and parts from y battery powered model fit this.  </li>
            <li> This is more powerful than a battery one IMO and never needs batteries.</li>
            <li> Trimmer is tiny and cuts very nicely.</li>
            <li> I replaced an older cordless model of this Conair Trimmer and it works great as the older model no longer held a charge.</li>
            <li> Well worth it!</li>
            <li> After going on two separate long flights, and my rechargeable&#x27;s for some reason always quit working, this is the answer with great results.</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband who has pretty healthy stubble.</li>
            <li> and so far I&#x27;m very satisfied with the performance of the blades.</li>
            <li> Works well and trims a lot better and consistent than battery operated trimmers.</li>
            <li> This small, plug-in razor is perfect.  </li>
            <li> but the attachments don&#x27;t have as many different lengths as I would have liked</li>
            <li> These clippers are really cool.  </li>
            <li> overall, a good product, though I don&#x27;t use it a lot</li>
            <li> works well, ez to use, and dont have to recharge it to make sure it&#x27;s ready for use..</li>
            <li> These fit the bill and the price was right.</li>
            <li> The Wahl has more curves and it simply felt better to use.  </li>
            <li> Quickly and effortlessly adjusts to any desired length.  </li>
            <li> works quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li> After many a battery trimmer left me hanging with a scruffy beard, I went searching for a good old fashioned plug in trimmer.</li>
            <li> Quite powerful.</li>
            <li> Trust me try it out, for the price it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this corded beard trimmer for my husband, after his rechargeable beard trimmer died, since I decided that a corded trimmer would be more convenient for him than replacing the old one with another rechargeable model.  </li>
            <li> Buy this if you are tired of buying batteries and need a great inexpensive trimmer!</li>
            <li> I purchased this model due to it&#x27;s name, (a good reputation in beauty products) and price.  </li>
            <li> I use it without attachments for the edging and the attachments for keeping mustache at the right length.  </li>
            <li> the right attachments.</li>
            <li> After going through many battery and cordless trimmers, all of which quickly lost power and eventually died, I decided to go back to basics.  </li>
            <li> Does exactly what I wanted, and the price is right.  </li>
            <li> I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t come with enough length accessories, but it has three sizes for shorter facial hair that have worked great, as well as an longer adjustable size attachment that I haven&#x27;t used.</li>
            <li> The cutter moves very fast so it cuts evenly.  </li>
            <li> will not trim my stash at all and is really quiet indicating no power had a great trimmer that fell into the toilet</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good little trimmer.  </li>
            <li> at first lasted maybe 6 weeks .</li>
            <li> Works great, cord is long enough and don&#x27;t have to change batteries.</li>
            <li> I bought my first one and it grabbed my hairs on the first use.</li>
            <li> By the time it arrived, he had spawned a pretty hefty beard.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what I want it to do.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used It I was amazed how it felt in hand.  </li>
            <li> So, user beware to go even longer on the suggested longest setting when first using it.</li>
            <li> For a trim it pretty much have him a close shave the first time.</li>
            <li> hair but this is used to keep my beard clean and general manscaping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems a little under powered for a plug in unit, but still trims whiskers nicely.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really beat it for the price.</li>
            <li> Got this for my guy as a replacement for a cheap panasonic one he accidentally left when we were on holiday.</li>
            <li> no battery power -- still very convenient.</li>
            <li> The blades cuts really well.</li>
            <li> Not too much to complain about it.</li>
            <li> I wish my cordless razor had this much power.</li>
            <li> Much to my horror i ripped off the whole metal assembly trying to get the plastic piece off.</li>
            <li> I came very close to just throwing it in the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It serves the purpose, but the problem is its not very useful because it is not waterproof, and you can&#x27;t use it in the shower, which would be a lot more convenient.</li>
            <li> They started getting very loud and hot</li>
            <li> He doesnt mind the cord at all - most sinks have an outlet nearby!</li>
            <li> It is ok for the price, but there are other machines that cut shorter.</li>
            <li> i was able to snap it back together, however it took 20 minutes of frustration that I will never get back.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a couple rechargeable trimmers that weren&#x27;t powerful enough or died prematurely (although perhaps more expensive ones perform better).  </li>
            <li> I was tired of my other razor running out of power, now I don&#x27;t have to worry about it with this corded model and it trims awesome with the additional combs.</li>
            <li> It only pulled one time while I was shaving his neck, and he said that overall, it was more comfortable than the other (inexpensive) trimmer we had been using.</li>
            <li> This trimmer was a great value for the money, and it&#x27;s also a dependable time-saver, so I highly recommend it for anyone who is tired of waiting for a rechargeable trimmer to recharge!</li>
            <li> After about 5 months of normal use, the comb broke.  </li>
            <li> My husband has a super coarse, thick beard, so even though it doesn&#x27;t just glide through the hair easily, it keeps up pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Came with all the pieces in brand new package.</li>
            <li> They will bog down in the most thick parts, but still power through better then their battery counter parts.</li>
            <li> First day i opened it and popped on the plastic heads, trying out the different ones.</li>
            <li> I am giving two stars because they might be ok for the average person that only uses once a week</li>
            <li> No batteries to mess with and cheap too boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does the job, not super versatile, but it is corded and is way better than the cordless ones that never last.</li>
            <li> far I like the power and it trims well.  </li>
            <li> but they are not for a professional</li>
            <li> but this week it made a loud pop while shaving</li>
            <li> So far the adapters have given me options that I like.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s held up thus far.</li>
            <li> I chipped a tooth off my old one - my fault</li>
            <li> It is powerful, so be careful.</li>
            <li> and that seemed to work at first, but it only last a couple of uses before it broke again.  </li>
            <li> I am still willing to buy another one even though it came to an abrupt end.</li>
            <li> will not cut as close as others, not sharp, pulls hairs..</li>
            <li> This was to replace an old corded Wahl trimmer I left at a hotel.  </li>
            <li> The sound made my grandma almost ill. 0 from 10, pure piece of s</li>
            <li> I need to shave multiple times a week to keep my neck and face bare.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent much more money on far worse trimmers.</li>
            <li> Though my hair isn&#x27;t super thick.</li>
            <li> Dropped one star because the fixed trim attachments are limited, and I don&#x27;t like the bulk of the adjustable one.</li>
            <li> If you got a outlet handy, you can&#x27;t go wrong with these!</li>
            <li> cant tell you how many battery powered trimmers I have been thru.half the time their dead in the drawer when you go to use them.their weak power</li>
            <li> (His beard is white, so I always tell him that he looks like Santa Claus when it gets too long!).  </li>
            <li> So now, as long as there is no EMP attack, I will have power for my beard trimmer</li>
            <li> ( I have done with other trimmers before) and a spring and the blade flung out I gatheted the peices but would not go back together.</li>
            <li> Limited functionality, but the price was unbeatable.</li>
            <li> Bought this trimmer b/c I had used a similar, previous model.</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d purchased one long ago instead of spending 20 years hacking at my face with all manner of sharp instruments.  </li>
            <li> minimal  maintenance needed.</li>
            <li> It works, as expected.</li>
            <li> Cutting is clean and efficient.</li>
            <li> Its not hella sharp but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> For the price, it is a sharp tool for those trimming needs.  </li>
            <li> I suspect other trimmers might as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since then, i have been very careful with unhooking the plastic heads.</li>
            <li> Not fun.</li>
            <li> it is an average cut.  </li>
            <li> This took all of 5 minutes to get it trimmed down to a manageable length.</li>
            <li> It is very sharp.  </li>
            <li> I previously used a Remington cordless where you could adjust the length by turning a wheel.  </li>
            <li> The attachments are little hard to keep track of.</li>
            <li> I have very little &amp;#34;top&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> no more battery&#x27;s to die.</li>
            <li> If I were to buy one again, I would definitely look for waterproof, because it is uncomfortable otherwise.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and does what it supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Only things I don&#x27;t care for are the adjustable guard (doesn&#x27;t seem to square itself up with the cutting surface almost like it&#x27;s cocked sideways) and the feel of it in the hand.  </li>
            <li> I tried to crazy glue it back together</li>
            <li> Plastic adapters work well for cutting to various heights.</li>
            <li> But I got tired of the battery always being dead</li>
            <li> I rated this trimmer four stars because I found the length-adjusting Combs a little inconvenient to work with.  </li>
            <li> The secret is the power cord.  </li>
            <li> I got tired of it being under powered, having to change the batteries, and being a bit noisy to the ear.  </li>
            <li> and for the price you cant go wrong</li>
            <li> I was skeptical before buying it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll do the job in an emergency but at the expense of cutting you like mad and giving you scratches that&#x27;ll stay for a day or two.</li>
            <li> so you need not use a comb or mad skills.</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t a bad purchase.</li>
            <li> Got sick of battery operated trimmers dying halfway through shaving.</li>
            <li> You wont be disappointed for the price!</li>

            <li> Works well.  Can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
            <li> Its not hella sharp but it gets the job done. I luv the price, package was wrapped really secure n shipping took no time @ all. Plus, no damn batteries 2 change, gotta luv that</li>
            <li> I had a battery operated trimmer before I bought the Conair trimmer.  What a difference, the Conair cuts better and closer. I would recommend to a friend.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m Very satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> Well pleased with this product. Good quality, and great price!!!</li>
            <li> I am a hairdresser so I do a lot of mens haircuts daily worked pretty good at first lasted maybe 6 weeks . They started getting very loud and hot I tried to take it apart ( I have done with other trimmers before) and a spring and the blade flung out I gatheted the peices but would not go back together. I am giving two stars because they might be ok for the average person that only uses once a week but they are not for a professional</li>
            <li> These clippers are really cool.  I have used battery operated ones for years and these plug in ones work a lot better.  They run steady and do a good job.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really beat it for the price. It&#x27;ll do the job in an emergency but at the expense of cutting you like mad and giving you scratches that&#x27;ll stay for a day or two. I&#x27;d recommend getting a nicer version instead.</li>
            <li> Looks cheap, but works amazingly well.  I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Trimmer is tiny and cuts very nicely. Dropped one star because the fixed trim attachments are limited, and I don&#x27;t like the bulk of the adjustable one.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Has been working wonderfully and amazing value :)</li>
            <li> I originally bought this trimmer at a discount department store and was really happy that it was AC powered. I just couldn&#x27;t deal with rechargeable trimmers. It worked flawlessly for about 4 years but this week it made a loud pop while shaving and  I guess it was fired. I am still willing to buy another one even though it came to an abrupt end.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, perfect condition and was cheap. Works awesome but the attachments don&#x27;t have as many different lengths as I would have liked but I use it often and it&#x27;s perfect for beard and body hair trims.</li>
            <li> Bought this trimmer for my husband.  He loves it.</li>
            <li> cudos for performance and price!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, and he loves it! He doesn&#x27;t have to worry about charging his trimmer a day before using it. This trimmer is constantly working. It doesn&#x27;t die mid-way of use. It has one setting, but that is what he needs.</li>
            <li> Works great, cord is long enough and don&#x27;t have to change batteries.</li>
            <li> Works great, no worries of the battery dying.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fairly quiet and fits in my hand well.&lt;br /&gt;Just wish there was a couple more attachments to use.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this item. It trims my hair with ease. Although, I would like to see replacement blades offered for this item.</li>
            <li> will not trim my stash at all and is really quiet indicating no power had a great trimmer that fell into the toilet I guess I should put this there too</li>
            <li> I bought my first one and it grabbed my hairs on the first use. Not fun. Returned it and got another, same thing: pulled my hairs. Will not mix up good deal with cheap again.</li>
            <li> This is a great clipper at a reasonable price.  Works easily, and the attachments are easy to use. Beats hacking my beard with sizzors.</li>
            <li> I was tired of my other razor running out of power, now I don&#x27;t have to worry about it with this corded model and it trims awesome with the additional combs.</li>
            <li> No gimmicks. Reliable, does an awesome job. I&#x27;ve hand mine for months now. Love the cord...no more battery&#x27;s to die. Solidly constructed. Would by again if lost etc...</li>
            <li> Got this for my guy as a replacement for a cheap panasonic one he accidentally left when we were on holiday. By the time it arrived, he had spawned a pretty hefty beard. This took all of 5 minutes to get it trimmed down to a manageable length. No pulling, nice that it has the guards so you need not use a comb or mad skills. It didn&#x27;t come with clipper oil, but whatever.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do! It&#x27;s quiet. Attachments fit nicely! You wont be disappointed for the price! Well worth it!</li>
            <li> Hubby loves it - zip - zip and his beard and mustache are trimmed. He doesnt mind the cord at all - most sinks have an outlet nearby! Quite powerful.</li>
            <li> Why did I only want to use a cordless beard trimmer all those years.  Yet again my battery stopped holding a charge.  A friend recommended this trimmer to me.  It is very sharp.  The cutter moves very fast so it cuts evenly.  Even with a cord it is very light and gives you the type of trim you get at the barber.  Trust me try it out, for the price it is worth it.</li>
            <li> This trimmer simply does what it says it will do and does it well.  For the price, I find it to be an excellent bargain. I love the sliding head because I can pack it along with the trimmer as a one piece unit in my overnight bag.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is amazing! The guards on it make trimming your beard a cinch.&lt;br /&gt;Also, me and my girlfriend kind of got gutsy with it and she gave me a haircut.&lt;br /&gt;That also turned out great - looks like I will be saving 20 bucks a month now.&lt;br /&gt;Overall nothing but good things about this.</li>
            <li> This is an effective trimmer if you want to maintain your beard and mustache.  I am disatisfied with how close of a shave it provides without the attachment.  I need to shave multiple times a week to keep my neck and face bare.  Overall it isn&#x27;t a bad purchase.</li>
            <li> I shopped all over to find a corded (electric) trimmer. I have used it and it works great, nothing fancy but does everythin g and then some that I need it for. Quality is very good, all in all very satisfied!</li>
            <li> The trimmer works fine.  It seems a little under powered for a plug in unit, but still trims whiskers nicely.</li>
            <li> The trimmer itself is just fine, and I prefer the corded version since I bought this to replace a rechargeable one that wasn&#x27;t working anymore.  The issue is with the adjustable comb that comes with it.  After about 5 months of normal use, the comb broke.  I tried to crazy glue it back together and that seemed to work at first, but it only last a couple of uses before it broke again.  After several emails and a phone call with Conair, I was told that they don&#x27;t sell a replacement part, but I could &amp;#34;try Amazon&amp;#34;.  Ummm, if you&#x27;re the company that makes the part and you&#x27;re telling me that you don&#x27;t sell the part, then how am I supposed to find the part on Amazon?  So now I have a practically new, perfectly working trimmer than I can&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> its light weight and easy to use, and i like that you can plug it in and never have to worry about recharging the battery.  and for the price you cant go wrong</li>
            <li> Does the job, not super versatile, but it is corded and is way better than the cordless ones that never last.</li>
            <li> I gave up on rechargeable trimmers. This trimmer always has full power, and does an outstanding job at an outstanding price. After going on two separate long flights, and my rechargeable&#x27;s for some reason always quit working, this is the answer with great results.</li>
            <li> Works really nice for mustache and sideburn trimming. . . . I use it without attachments for the edging and the attachments for keeping mustache at the right length.  Works good, and I like that it&#x27;s a plug-in, so no battery power -- still very convenient.</li>
            <li> Got this because the battery on my last mustache trimmer died.  So far this works incredibly well.  I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t come with enough length accessories, but it has three sizes for shorter facial hair that have worked great, as well as an longer adjustable size attachment that I haven&#x27;t used.</li>
            <li> I purchased this corded beard trimmer for my husband, after his rechargeable beard trimmer died, since I decided that a corded trimmer would be more convenient for him than replacing the old one with another rechargeable model.  He would always have to plug the rechargeable trimmer in- hours prior to needing to use it- and he didn&#x27;t always remember to do that, resulting in having to go out looking &amp;#34;scruffy&amp;#34;!  (His beard is white, so I always tell him that he looks like Santa Claus when it gets too long!).  With a corded trimmer, it only needs to be plugged into a wall outlet, and then it can be used immediately...no waiting involved!  This trimmer was a great value for the money, and it&#x27;s also a dependable time-saver, so I highly recommend it for anyone who is tired of waiting for a rechargeable trimmer to recharge!</li>
            <li> bought it for my birthday. can&#x27;t give a better review star than 4. i don&#x27;t use it he does. he seems to love it and uses it often</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband who has pretty healthy stubble. He says it works great , has no complaints &amp; price was just right.</li>
            <li> This is the first trimmer that I bought and it is wonderful is just what I expected, good brand, good quality, easy to use, the cord had a good length and allow you to manipulate easily. The blades cuts really well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a couple months and so far I&#x27;m very satisfied with the performance of the blades. I&#x27;ve spent much more money on far worse trimmers.</li>
            <li> Bought this trimmer b/c I had used a similar, previous model. Works well and trims a lot better and consistent than battery operated trimmers. Just use a drop or two of mineral oil now and then and it works like a champ! Solid warranty too.</li>
            <li> Works great no worry about charging.&lt;br /&gt;All the right attachments. Easy to clean. Just wish it came with the oil for the blade</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than those battery operated models that never stay charged. Not too much to complain about it. The attachments are little hard to keep track of.</li>
            <li> After going through many battery and cordless trimmers, all of which quickly lost power and eventually died, I decided to go back to basics.  This small, plug-in razor is perfect.  Always good power, clean trim and no pulling or tugging.  Quickly and effortlessly adjusts to any desired length.  Great price for great product.</li>
            <li> Husband loves it. Still working well..</li>
            <li> It serves the purpose, but the problem is its not very useful because it is not waterproof, and you can&#x27;t use it in the shower, which would be a lot more convenient. If I were to buy one again, I would definitely look for waterproof, because it is uncomfortable otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;But overall, a good product, though I don&#x27;t use it a lot</li>
            <li> I wish my cordless razor had this much power. Great product for even trim on my mustache and beard.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what I want it to do.  The only thing that may concern some is that it does trim your beard rather short - even on the longest setting.  That works fine for me, but I know others may not like that.</li>
            <li> The secret is the power cord.  The ones with the batteries just do not have the juice to do the job.  And, this one is priced a lot better than most of the others.  This one works great.  Get a can of Wahl&#x27;s blade oil to service this thing.  Amazon is selling it for under two bucks.</li>
            <li> it sheers through my chunky beard.  So far the adapters have given me options that I like.  I would recommend this clipper. It&#x27;s a great deal for the money.</li>
            <li> Good value and a great product.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I was surprised it was not as great a product as the reviews it received but i guess it is a good buy for how cheap it costs</li>
            <li> Big bang for the buck.  Works great and attachment gives you great trimming range.</li>
            <li> As Advertised and Delivered. Thumbs Up.</li>
            <li> No complaint here, It works perfectly</li>
            <li> It is ok for the price, but there are other machines that cut shorter. it is an average cut.  Not bad, but not the best.</li>
            <li> works quickly and efficiently. minimal  maintenance needed. only drawback is  having just 2 settings. for price,   a bargain.</li>
            <li> Has plenty power but a bit noisy. Im happy with it especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Great beard / mustache trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;I like it&#x27;s corded vs needing to be charged. I just keep it in my drawer until needed. A charger type would need to be plugged in 24/7 and I don&#x27;t have room for that.. Works very good.. A+</li>
            <li> Great trimmer for the price.  Does what it&#x27;s supposed to &amp; the included attachments work well, providing options for length.  I&#x27;ve had a couple rechargeable trimmers that weren&#x27;t powerful enough or died prematurely (although perhaps more expensive ones perform better).  I prefer corded ones now.  I bought two of these &amp; gave one to my son, &amp; he&#x27;s happy with his also.</li>
            <li> I owned a Vidal Sassoon battery operated trimmer for years.  I got tired of it being under powered, having to change the batteries, and being a bit noisy to the ear.  I looked into a corded model.  I purchased this model due to it&#x27;s name, (a good reputation in beauty products) and price.  The first time I used It I was amazed how it felt in hand.  It feels well made with good quality parts.  The included combs don&#x27;t feel cheap and fit on the trimmer well.  I was amazed how quiet the trimmer was too when I flipped on the switch, compared it to my battery model.  I feel this was a very good value for the money...</li>
            <li> Nifty trimmer -- 1st electric  trimmer (scissors before) for me -- nice heft/feel in hand -- appears solidly made -- excellent product/price.</li>
            <li> Excellent trimmer especially for the price.  Easy &amp; straightforward to use.  Plastic adapters work well for cutting to various heights.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this trimmer.  I can leave it for weeks at a time and I do not have to worry about charging the battery.  And, of course it does a great job when trimming my facial hair which is why I purchased it.</li>
            <li> will not cut as close as others, not sharp, pulls hairs..</li>
            <li> works well, ez to use, and dont have to recharge it to make sure it&#x27;s ready for use..</li>
            <li> I replaced an older cordless model of this Conair Trimmer and it works great as the older model no longer held a charge.</li>
            <li> Works great! I have not had any issues with this pulling my hair. Though my hair isn&#x27;t super thick. I love not having to worry about charging and batteries.</li>
            <li> For the price, it is a sharp tool for those trimming needs.  Forget the cordless stuff that dies on you.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I wanted, and the price is right.  Why would anyone need a cordless to trim a beard?</li>
            <li> cant tell you how many battery powered trimmers I have been thru.half the time their dead in the drawer when you go to use them.their weak power wise.this corded unit is the way to go.see for yourself, I dare ya!!!!! lol</li>
            <li> I rated this trimmer four stars because I found the length-adjusting Combs a little inconvenient to work with.  I previously used a Remington cordless where you could adjust the length by turning a wheel.  That was more convenient, but after a while the battery had shorter and shorter life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this corded trimmer.</li>
            <li> First day i opened it and popped on the plastic heads, trying out the different ones. Much to my horror i ripped off the whole metal assembly trying to get the plastic piece off. i was able to snap it back together, however it took 20 minutes of frustration that I will never get back.  I came very close to just throwing it in the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then, i have been very careful with unhooking the plastic heads. It works, as expected.</li>
            <li> Trimmer is great however, my husband said the settings the manual says to use are too short for his liking. For a trim it pretty much have him a close shave the first time. So, user beware to go even longer on the suggested longest setting when first using it.</li>
            <li> for the price, i was pleased with the quality of this trimmer.  the only thing that was &amp;#34;eh&amp;#34; about was the plastic attachments. they felt cheap but for 10 bucks, I knew that would probably be the case,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and does what it supposed to do. I was skeptical before buying it. But after i tried it, i recommend it.</li>
            <li> This thing is the bomb.  I wish I&#x27;d purchased one long ago instead of spending 20 years hacking at my face with all manner of sharp instruments.  Not only does it trim things evenly, it&#x27;s taken about five years off the way I look.</li>
            <li> The best product i took, but the thing that i don&#x27;t like on it, that it&#x27;s not wireless.</li>
            <li> After many a battery trimmer left me hanging with a scruffy beard, I went searching for a good old fashioned plug in trimmer. These fit the bill and the price was right. Cord is of ample length and motor seems strong. Cutting is clean and efficient. They will bog down in the most thick parts, but still power through better then their battery counter parts. If you got a outlet handy, you can&#x27;t go wrong with these!</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer for the price. It&#x27;s easy to use and leaves clean results. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good little trimmer.  My husband has a super coarse, thick beard, so even though it doesn&#x27;t just glide through the hair easily, it keeps up pretty well.  It only pulled one time while I was shaving his neck, and he said that overall, it was more comfortable than the other (inexpensive) trimmer we had been using.</li>
            <li> It is powerful, so be careful. I never had plug into the wall one before and can tell the power difference then recharge battery. Came with all the pieces in brand new package.</li>
            <li> After i unpacked it and tried to turn it on, it just flashed and broked. The sound made my grandma almost ill. 0 from 10, pure piece of s***.</li>
            <li> This was a VERY good product. I would definitely recommend this seller to others.</li>
            <li> Great product, good price.</li>
            <li> This is an electric version of a battery powered model I have.  But I got tired of the battery always being dead and so  i bought this. And the accesssories and parts from y battery powered model fit this.  So now, as long as there is no EMP attack, I will have power for my beard trimmer</li>
            <li> As advertised. This thing gets the job done. No batteries to mess with and cheap too boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only possible problem is that it struggles while trimming longer hair. I suspect other trimmers might as well.</li>
            <li> Limited functionality, but the price was unbeatable. It&#x27;s held up thus far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extra quiet. Glad I&#x27;m not using a rechargeable anymore.</li>
            <li> I am so glad someone still makes something with a cord! I travel a lot and cordless is nice, but I was using way too many batteries. This is more powerful than a battery one IMO and never needs batteries. I chipped a tooth off my old one - my fault, that&#x27;s the only reason I bought another. It still ran great! Buy this if you are tired of buying batteries and need a great inexpensive trimmer!</li>
            <li> Got sick of battery operated trimmers dying halfway through shaving. Dont buy this expecting a razor close shave. Not gonna happen. It does what its supposed to, trim and shape facial hair.</li>
            <li> came on time, works great!</li>
            <li> I have always used cordless trimmers before. Glad to have switched to this corded one. It does the job nicely</li>
