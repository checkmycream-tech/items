            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>good price and quality</li>
            <li>Good traveling comb.</li>

            <li>I kinda fell in love with it</li>
            <li>I love aluminum combs.</li>
            <li>OK comb.</li>

            <li>This is a well made come and strong for aluminum.</li>
            <li>Really easy to clean.</li>
            <li>They are durable and easy to maintain clean.</li>
            <li>The teeth aren&#x27;t fit to go through hair.</li>
            <li>like that it is aluminum and light</li>
            <li>this if fantastic</li>
            <li>This comb is perfect, I wish metal combs were easier to find since i lost a stainless steel one i had, i do occasionally feel like i&#x27;m going to overstress the aluminum but other than having to keep in mind</li>
            <li>Run it under hot water to help hold your style</li>
            <li>Comb bends if you appy too much pressure but that never happens.</li>
            <li>It is a pity they don&#x27;t have it in more sizes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have any inch markings which would have been very helpful, but I can add those.&lt;br /&gt;However</li>
            <li>Arrived very bent.</li>
            <li>so I was ok not happy but ok with getting on amazon  this style tail comb 1.19 here 2.99 plus 1.99 s&amp;h so 5 buck upside</li>
            <li>Other than the possibility to bend this was a good choice and will last me a long time.</li>
            <li>I was searching for a heavy metal comb, but it is light as plastic.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to replace a plastic comb I&#x27;ve used since 1978, this is sturdy enough, although it&#x27;s easy enough to bend so be careful.</li>
            <li>(Accurate weight comparison-&amp;#62; at least a pencil&#x27;s weight.)&lt;br /&gt;Upside</li>

            <li> (Accurate weight comparison-&amp;#62; at least a pencil&#x27;s weight.)&lt;br /&gt;Upside</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe it will bend easily as long as your not trying to force it or sit on it.</li>
            <li> Teeth are sharp enough to grab hair.</li>
            <li> This size is not very portable to have it with you in a pocket.</li>
            <li> Average &#x3D; 4.</li>
            <li> not sure why the teeth are as wide as they are, being aluminum</li>
            <li> The comb arrived a little bent.</li>
            <li> so it is a little hard to use</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in how thick/wide the teeth are, it makes it difficult to get the comb into the hair to smooth it out or pick it up for cutting.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> That said, it is thick</li>
            <li> Very thin afraid it might break and teeth will bend</li>
            <li> Annie Cutting Aluminum Thermal Comb could not get this combs at any sally  </li>
            <li> This comb is awful.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Really easy to clean. Works well when I comb my hair. Comb bends if you appy too much pressure but that never happens. Arrived qucikly.</li>
            <li> I had a comb for years this one was not as heavy as i thought it would be but fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This is a well made come and strong for aluminum. That said, it is thick so it is a little hard to use and it is not tapered like most combs.  So that is 5 stars for quality and 3 stars for preference.  Average &#x3D; 4.</li>
            <li> My son asked me to get him a &amp;#34;metal&amp;#34; comb.  I was happy to find this one on Amazon.com.  He likes it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my beard because I keep breaking plastic ones and this aluminum one just bends all over and hurts my skin because the teeth are not pointed so it&#x27;s like dragging a spoon over bread.</li>
            <li> Very light and Strong. I don&#x27;t believe it will bend easily as long as your not trying to force it or sit on it. I got this because my gf wanted a metal comb and could not find one anywhere else. I kinda fell in love with it so i bought one for my self :D</li>
            <li> This is a great comb. I love aluminum combs. They are durable and easy to maintain clean. It is a pity they don&#x27;t have it in more sizes. This size is not very portable to have it with you in a pocket.</li>
            <li> good price and quality</li>
            <li> Good traveling comb. Teeth are sharp enough to grab hair.</li>
            <li> Works great. Run it under hot water to help hold your style</li>
            <li> Annie Cutting Aluminum Thermal Comb could not get this combs at any sally  in my area so I was ok not happy but ok with getting on amazon  this style tail comb 1.19 here 2.99 plus 1.99 s&amp;h so 5 buck upside I will never have to replace it.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a heavy metal comb, but it is light as plastic. (Accurate weight comparison-&amp;#62; at least a pencil&#x27;s weight.)&lt;br /&gt;Upside: It is aluminum. Downside: Bends easily.&lt;br /&gt;(*You can still comb your hair with a bent comb) However the flexible property, it does not break.&lt;br /&gt;Warning: Don&#x27;t bend to the maximum. All things have a breaking point.</li>
            <li> Bent out of the package. The teeth aren&#x27;t fit to go through hair. This comb is awful.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a non-plastic comb to cut hair with, so I ordered this comb hoping it would work for me.&lt;br /&gt;I like that it is aluminum and light weight.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have any inch markings which would have been very helpful, but I can add those.&lt;br /&gt;However I am disappointed in how thick/wide the teeth are, it makes it difficult to get the comb into the hair to smooth it out or pick it up for cutting.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure why the teeth are as wide as they are, being aluminum they could be a lot finer.</li>
            <li> The comb arrived a little bent.</li>
            <li> This comb is perfect, I wish metal combs were easier to find since i lost a stainless steel one i had, i do occasionally feel like i&#x27;m going to overstress the aluminum but other than having to keep in mind it&#x27;s not steel this if fantastic</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace a plastic comb I&#x27;ve used since 1978, this is sturdy enough, although it&#x27;s easy enough to bend so be careful. Other than the possibility to bend this was a good choice and will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> Very thin afraid it might break and teeth will bend</li>
            <li> OK comb. Arrived very bent.</li>
