            <li>Love!!</li>
            <li>My daughters and I love this polish!!  </li>
            <li>Totally Satisfied!!</li>
            <li>It was amazing!</li>
            <li>It works best on top of lighter polishes.</li>
            <li>Be sure to put on three coats to get the best effect though.  </li>
            <li>So nice, I bought it twice!  </li>
            <li>The product came at the appropriate time listed and it works great!</li>
            <li>I noticed that on darker polishes the glow was not as bright.</li>
            <li>, it was bright.</li>
            <li>For best results, immediately put your hands up to the light to allow the nail polish to work.</li>
            <li>Good glow.</li>
            <li>it works really good, after like 3 coats though</li>
            <li>But besides that its a fantastic product :D takes a couple layers to glow</li>
            <li>Good value,</li>
            <li>I was able to salvage some to use and I love it!!</li>
            <li>I painted monsters on my nails for Halloween and they sure did glow when the lights went out!</li>
            <li>I love this polish!</li>
            <li>Item arrived in perfect condition, exactly as described, on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this polish!</li>
            <li>I love the glow!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of glow nailpolish and this one is my favorite!</li>
            <li>This nail polish is perfect, it came in quick and they wrapped it up and put it into a zip lock bag and in a box to make sure it wouldn&#x27;t break</li>
            <li>Apply 2-3 coats and charge it under a bright light and, ta-da!</li>
            <li>It has nice packaging, and it&#x27;s not overly garish in the bottle.</li>
            <li>I also liked putting it under decals for the nails.  </li>
            <li>I also find that the polish chips faster than some of the others that I own.</li>
            <li>and then more of this, THEN i went tanning and that sure helped!</li>
            <li>Love this top coat!</li>
            <li>super bright but</li>
            <li>I had to buy more.</li>
            <li>I like that you can use it as a top coat over any polish and it doesn&#x27;t look milky at all like it does in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>would recommend this to a friend. :)</li>
            <li>overall great product!</li>
            <li>I am going with FOUR OR MORE COATS for sure the day I use this polish.</li>
            <li>FANTASTiC!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Noticeably tints the color of the varnish when you layer on this top coat</li>
            <li>I did notice that they glow brighter if you put a top coat on top of this nail polish.</li>
            <li>it works but I have to add so many coats</li>
            <li>I still recommend it, but I would say much better with stiffer nails.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>So glad I purchased.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve really enjoyed the glowing effect.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was going to work</li>
            <li>This can be applied over most colored polishes.</li>
            <li>and it glowed like a flash light!</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s all in good fun.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soooo cute</li>
            <li>It glows but you need more than one coat.</li>
            <li>the better the glow.</li>
            <li>but when applied on top of nail polish he makes it chip dont use as a top coat</li>
            <li>Dries extremely fast, glows bright, has no color making it perfect over any nail color as a clear coat.</li>
            <li>I love it, and def.</li>
            <li>will be buying more.</li>
            <li>and I know I&#x27;ll be using this a lot! :)</li>
            <li>Not my favorite.</li>
            <li>Love this nail polish</li>
            <li>I really loved it and it came right on time.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty bright.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty bright, so you can make it to your preference.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and in great condition, thanks!</li>
            <li>This is a very cool nail polish.</li>
            <li>but then it is very cool.  </li>
            <li>The best glow in the dark nail top coat out there.  </li>
            <li>It really works and it looks so good.</li>
            <li>it is a really good product and it does glow very well</li>
            <li>Of course when i woke up the glow was gone, but it was cool!</li>
            <li>This is a really cool nail polish!</li>
            <li>Very bright, especially after holding it under a lamp or light source.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This glows so nicely over most anything without giving much (if any) color.  </li>
            <li>Easy to put on and not streaky at all.  </li>
            <li>It glows strong after putting 5 layers.</li>
            <li>It is very bright and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>It kind of freaked me out the first couple of times because I had forgotten about it.</li>
            <li>My nails glow so pretty at night and my son even liked when I painted his thumb nail</li>
            <li>It is activated in light (which it got a dose of when I turned off my bedside lamp).</li>
            <li>When I got this I excepted it to be campy and cheap</li>
            <li>but if you expose the polish to a light for about 30 seconds</li>
            <li>Fun for kids and parents :)</li>
            <li>It really glows and lasts!!!</li>
            <li>and it really glows!!!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>Texture is subtle - top coat over it smoothed it out perfectly.</li>
            <li>A bit of fun for Halloween nail varnish!</li>
            <li>Fun!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot of fun!  </li>
            <li>this is the first one that has satisfied us.</li>
            <li>It will be fun on Halloween!</li>
            <li>and so do my raving buddies ^.^ WORTH THE MONEY!</li>
            <li>This is so fun to use!</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth it!</li>
            <li>It is a nice touch around Halloween, or really any time you want to have a fun, unique look.</li>
            <li>It does glow but not very long or bright.</li>
            <li>so my nails look great in light or dark.</li>
            <li>Cool for dance night.</li>
            <li>They thought it was cool.</li>
            <li>Works great, lots of fun if you&#x27;re headed to somewhere with dark light rides.</li>
            <li>It shipped relativly quickly but the packaging was a bit busted.  </li>
            <li>, it goes for awhile and you only need some kind of light to make it glow.</li>
            <li>It has to charge in the light first.</li>
            <li>but when I first got it I had no idea that you had to put it under the light for it to glow.</li>
            <li>great glow in the dark polish</li>
            <li>Upon opening the package I walked into a dark room and this bottle of polish glowed fairly well without having been under any light at all but a one coat application produced virtually zero results.</li>
            <li>Super fun to have.</li>
            <li>One final note, your nail polish (underneath this glow top coat) will not appear as pretty as it does without the top coat.</li>
            <li>I put it on top of a regular nail polish and it worked fine.</li>
            <li>, my little brother cant sleep without the night light, but not any more his room lights up at night now :)</li>
            <li>overall its amazing</li>
            <li>Fun product.</li>
            <li>so if you are looking for a clear top coat, this is not for you</li>
            <li>Fun to use.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s fun to play around with.</li>
            <li>This polish is so fun.</li>
            <li>It is fun and not just for Halloween.</li>
            <li>Okay first of all u need a light color like white</li>
            <li>And the price is right.</li>
            <li>it peels right off.</li>
            <li>I love glow in the dark things, and this works as a top coat for any color.</li>
            <li>The quality was better than most glow in the dark polish.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t change the underlying color, but the glow is more a general glow and not a color glow.</li>
            <li>Even without alot of exposure to light it works dimly, but when you charge it in front of our kitchen light fixture for a couple minutes, it REALLY goes to town.  </li>
            <li>bottle glows really bright in the dark</li>
            <li>:) It only glows for a few seconds but it&#x27;s great for sleepovers and camping.</li>
            <li>Loved it,glows in the dark.</li>
            <li>It works great and if you put a clear coat on top will last a long time.</li>
            <li>Needs to be pretty dark in order for this to glow, but all in all a good product.</li>
            <li>I would have liked it to last longer, though I know that there are limits to how much it can glow.  </li>
            <li>love this nail polish but the glow in the dark isn&#x27;t that strong unless you put 2 coats</li>
            <li>Item came very fast too</li>
            <li>The glow doesn&#x27;t last super long, as previous reviewers have stated, but I bought it for use under black light, so it is bright and perfect for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not awful or anything, but it&#x27;s no longer truly white.</li>
            <li>It also dries pretty</li>
            <li>I put on two coats over a mint green and it glowed obsurdly bright, the glow gets dimmer as the colors of your manicure get darker</li>
            <li>Not bad if you just want to put over normal color</li>
            <li>I purchased this initially for Halloween designs, but because it is virtually clear, it can be used as a top coat anytime!</li>
            <li>My 18 year old niece uses it as a clear top coat and loves it.</li>
            <li>It dries very quickly, and is basically clear, so I can use it over my normal manicure</li>
            <li>REALLY well you actually need to hold your hands right up to a light first.</li>
            <li>The only problem that I have is that it chips off so easily.</li>
            <li>but it was a clear coat in normal light.</li>
            <li>Still happy with it for the price, and much better than some other glow in the dark nail colors I&#x27;ve had in the past. :)</li>
            <li>looks cool right after you turn off the lights, but 5 minutes later all of the glow is gone.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for Halloween, and it came amazingly fast; it came in two days and it was supposed to arrive in a week or so.</li>
            <li>The glow polish has an opaque yellowish tint, but I guess you can apply a layer or two over another polish and it won&#x27;t affect the color that much.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t have much effect on the coloring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Requires multiple coats and lots of exposure to light.</li>
            <li>and I expected more.</li>
            <li>But it looks really wicked.</li>
            <li>It did glow after exposing to a light source and then in total darkness, but not without &amp;#34;charging with light&amp;#34; before expecting it to glow.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s kind of an off-white color and goes unnoticed during the daytime).</li>
            <li>It glows nicely, but doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li>I had looked everywhere for a good glow in the dark nail polish, and I finally found it in China Glaze Ghoulish Glow.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly, and with a little exposure to light, it will glow vibrantly when you turn out the lights.</li>
            <li>I did a one coat test and the white on my nails glowed more than anything else, did a second coat and the whole nail was glowing</li>
            <li>I love that this glows in the dark.  </li>
            <li>My nails actually glowed for the full week</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had glow in the dark polish before that glowed well with one coat and better with two.</li>
            <li>China Glaze is a decent brand</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for raves, parties, and Holloween.</li>
            <li>you do have to use 2 coats to really be able to see it glow in the dark!</li>
            <li>It stayed on great and worked forever with manicured nails, you know fake ones, but once I ripped those off it wouldn&#x27;t stay on my nails anymore.</li>
            <li>It glows green/yellow, the normal glow color.</li>
            <li>My young Nieces love to see their fingers glow in the dark at night</li>
            <li>so, I have used it several times just for fun</li>
            <li>I even top coated it with clear polish and it still glowed in the dark.</li>
            <li>the color is pale, and looks good over a lot of colors, but I usually have to put a few layers on in order to get a really bright glow.</li>
            <li>I was almost distracted by it while driving home from the tanning place last night, then when i went to bed and saw it it startled me at first.</li>
            <li>and it glows vividly.</li>
            <li>it does not absorb the light then glows in the dark.</li>
            <li>(even my nephews wanted to paint their fingers and toes for a night time glow (ages 3, 7, 9, 10)),  and because it&#x27;s almost clear</li>
            <li>(but there are no clear drying glow in the dark top coats).</li>
            <li>The only high quality nail polish I&#x27;ve found so far that does just what I want it to do - G L O W!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last super long</li>
            <li>You can apply this polish plain, or over another color, and it applies evenly and accurately.</li>
            <li>Finally found something that actually glowed in the dark, my daughter loves it and you can wear over any color as a top coat</li>
            <li>Painted nails must be exposed directly to a light bulb for thirty seconds or so to work in the dark only.  </li>
            <li>This polish literally glows in the dark, especially when im too lazy to turn on the light my toes light up</li>
            <li>Worth the $5 to have something that MIGHT work in the dark.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d imagine they&#x27;d last a little longer with a UV light.</li>
            <li>This polish didn&#x27;t glow very well or very long.</li>
            <li>Goes on clear and only glows in a backlight atmosphere.</li>
            <li>It does glow in the dark, but it isn&#x27;t that pretty</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t glow in the dark much!</li>
            <li>I had painted the glow in the dark topcoat over my color coat and the top coat muted the color quite a bit, but at least it looked cool in the dark.</li>
            <li>REALLY glows in the dark.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not ideal as a top coat.</li>
            <li>It really glows in the dark!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I painted monsters on my nails for Halloween and they sure did glow when the lights went out!</li>
            <li> I love this polish!</li>
            <li> Item arrived in perfect condition, exactly as described, on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this polish!</li>
            <li> I love the glow!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of glow nailpolish and this one is my favorite!</li>
            <li> This nail polish is perfect, it came in quick and they wrapped it up and put it into a zip lock bag and in a box to make sure it wouldn&#x27;t break</li>
            <li> Apply 2-3 coats and charge it under a bright light and, ta-da!</li>
            <li> It has nice packaging, and it&#x27;s not overly garish in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I also liked putting it under decals for the nails.  </li>
            <li> I also find that the polish chips faster than some of the others that I own.</li>
            <li> and then more of this, THEN i went tanning and that sure helped!</li>
            <li> Love this top coat!</li>
            <li> super bright but</li>
            <li> I had to buy more.</li>
            <li> I like that you can use it as a top coat over any polish and it doesn&#x27;t look milky at all like it does in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> would recommend this to a friend. :)</li>
            <li> overall great product!</li>
            <li> I am going with FOUR OR MORE COATS for sure the day I use this polish.</li>
            <li> FANTASTiC!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Noticeably tints the color of the varnish when you layer on this top coat</li>
            <li> I did notice that they glow brighter if you put a top coat on top of this nail polish.</li>
            <li> it works but I have to add so many coats</li>
            <li> I still recommend it, but I would say much better with stiffer nails.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> So glad I purchased.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve really enjoyed the glowing effect.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was going to work</li>
            <li> This can be applied over most colored polishes.</li>
            <li> and it glowed like a flash light!</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s all in good fun.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soooo cute</li>
            <li> It glows but you need more than one coat.</li>
            <li> the better the glow.</li>
            <li> but when applied on top of nail polish he makes it chip dont use as a top coat</li>
            <li> Dries extremely fast, glows bright, has no color making it perfect over any nail color as a clear coat.</li>
            <li> I love it, and def.</li>
            <li> will be buying more.</li>
            <li> and I know I&#x27;ll be using this a lot! :)</li>
            <li> Not my favorite.</li>
            <li> Love this nail polish</li>
            <li> I really loved it and it came right on time.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty bright.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty bright, so you can make it to your preference.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and in great condition, thanks!</li>
            <li> This is a very cool nail polish.</li>
            <li> but then it is very cool.  </li>
            <li> The best glow in the dark nail top coat out there.  </li>
            <li> It really works and it looks so good.</li>
            <li> it is a really good product and it does glow very well</li>
            <li> Of course when i woke up the glow was gone, but it was cool!</li>
            <li> This is a really cool nail polish!</li>
            <li> Very bright, especially after holding it under a lamp or light source.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> This glows so nicely over most anything without giving much (if any) color.  </li>
            <li> Easy to put on and not streaky at all.  </li>
            <li> It glows strong after putting 5 layers.</li>
            <li> It is very bright and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It kind of freaked me out the first couple of times because I had forgotten about it.</li>
            <li> My nails glow so pretty at night and my son even liked when I painted his thumb nail</li>
            <li> It is activated in light (which it got a dose of when I turned off my bedside lamp).</li>
            <li> When I got this I excepted it to be campy and cheap</li>
            <li> but if you expose the polish to a light for about 30 seconds</li>
            <li> Fun for kids and parents :)</li>
            <li> It really glows and lasts!!!</li>
            <li> and it really glows!!!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Texture is subtle - top coat over it smoothed it out perfectly.</li>
            <li> A bit of fun for Halloween nail varnish!</li>
            <li> Fun!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot of fun!  </li>
            <li> this is the first one that has satisfied us.</li>
            <li> It will be fun on Halloween!</li>
            <li> and so do my raving buddies ^.^ WORTH THE MONEY!</li>
            <li> This is so fun to use!</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth it!</li>
            <li> It is a nice touch around Halloween, or really any time you want to have a fun, unique look.</li>
            <li> It does glow but not very long or bright.</li>
            <li> so my nails look great in light or dark.</li>
            <li> Cool for dance night.</li>
            <li> They thought it was cool.</li>
            <li> Works great, lots of fun if you&#x27;re headed to somewhere with dark light rides.</li>
            <li> It shipped relativly quickly but the packaging was a bit busted.  </li>
            <li> , it goes for awhile and you only need some kind of light to make it glow.</li>
            <li> It has to charge in the light first.</li>
            <li> but when I first got it I had no idea that you had to put it under the light for it to glow.</li>
            <li> great glow in the dark polish</li>
            <li> Upon opening the package I walked into a dark room and this bottle of polish glowed fairly well without having been under any light at all but a one coat application produced virtually zero results.</li>
            <li> Super fun to have.</li>
            <li> One final note, your nail polish (underneath this glow top coat) will not appear as pretty as it does without the top coat.</li>
            <li> I put it on top of a regular nail polish and it worked fine.</li>
            <li> , my little brother cant sleep without the night light, but not any more his room lights up at night now :)</li>
            <li> overall its amazing</li>
            <li> Fun product.</li>
            <li> so if you are looking for a clear top coat, this is not for you</li>
            <li> Fun to use.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s fun to play around with.</li>
            <li> This polish is so fun.</li>
            <li> It is fun and not just for Halloween.</li>
            <li> Okay first of all u need a light color like white</li>
            <li> And the price is right.</li>
            <li> it peels right off.</li>
            <li> I love glow in the dark things, and this works as a top coat for any color.</li>
            <li> The quality was better than most glow in the dark polish.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t change the underlying color, but the glow is more a general glow and not a color glow.</li>
            <li> Even without alot of exposure to light it works dimly, but when you charge it in front of our kitchen light fixture for a couple minutes, it REALLY goes to town.  </li>
            <li> bottle glows really bright in the dark</li>
            <li> :) It only glows for a few seconds but it&#x27;s great for sleepovers and camping.</li>
            <li> Loved it,glows in the dark.</li>
            <li> It works great and if you put a clear coat on top will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Needs to be pretty dark in order for this to glow, but all in all a good product.</li>
            <li> I would have liked it to last longer, though I know that there are limits to how much it can glow.  </li>
            <li> love this nail polish but the glow in the dark isn&#x27;t that strong unless you put 2 coats</li>
            <li> Item came very fast too</li>
            <li> The glow doesn&#x27;t last super long, as previous reviewers have stated, but I bought it for use under black light, so it is bright and perfect for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not awful or anything, but it&#x27;s no longer truly white.</li>
            <li> It also dries pretty</li>
            <li> I put on two coats over a mint green and it glowed obsurdly bright, the glow gets dimmer as the colors of your manicure get darker</li>
            <li> Not bad if you just want to put over normal color</li>
            <li> I purchased this initially for Halloween designs, but because it is virtually clear, it can be used as a top coat anytime!</li>
            <li> My 18 year old niece uses it as a clear top coat and loves it.</li>
            <li> It dries very quickly, and is basically clear, so I can use it over my normal manicure</li>
            <li> REALLY well you actually need to hold your hands right up to a light first.</li>
            <li> The only problem that I have is that it chips off so easily.</li>
            <li> but it was a clear coat in normal light.</li>
            <li> Still happy with it for the price, and much better than some other glow in the dark nail colors I&#x27;ve had in the past. :)</li>
            <li> looks cool right after you turn off the lights, but 5 minutes later all of the glow is gone.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for Halloween, and it came amazingly fast; it came in two days and it was supposed to arrive in a week or so.</li>
            <li> The glow polish has an opaque yellowish tint, but I guess you can apply a layer or two over another polish and it won&#x27;t affect the color that much.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t have much effect on the coloring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Requires multiple coats and lots of exposure to light.</li>
            <li> and I expected more.</li>
            <li> But it looks really wicked.</li>
            <li> It did glow after exposing to a light source and then in total darkness, but not without &amp;#34;charging with light&amp;#34; before expecting it to glow.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s kind of an off-white color and goes unnoticed during the daytime).</li>
            <li> It glows nicely, but doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> I had looked everywhere for a good glow in the dark nail polish, and I finally found it in China Glaze Ghoulish Glow.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly, and with a little exposure to light, it will glow vibrantly when you turn out the lights.</li>
            <li> I did a one coat test and the white on my nails glowed more than anything else, did a second coat and the whole nail was glowing</li>
            <li> I love that this glows in the dark.  </li>
            <li> My nails actually glowed for the full week</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had glow in the dark polish before that glowed well with one coat and better with two.</li>
            <li> China Glaze is a decent brand</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for raves, parties, and Holloween.</li>
            <li> you do have to use 2 coats to really be able to see it glow in the dark!</li>
            <li> It stayed on great and worked forever with manicured nails, you know fake ones, but once I ripped those off it wouldn&#x27;t stay on my nails anymore.</li>
            <li> It glows green/yellow, the normal glow color.</li>
            <li> My young Nieces love to see their fingers glow in the dark at night</li>
            <li> so, I have used it several times just for fun</li>
            <li> I even top coated it with clear polish and it still glowed in the dark.</li>
            <li> the color is pale, and looks good over a lot of colors, but I usually have to put a few layers on in order to get a really bright glow.</li>
            <li> I was almost distracted by it while driving home from the tanning place last night, then when i went to bed and saw it it startled me at first.</li>
            <li> and it glows vividly.</li>
            <li> it does not absorb the light then glows in the dark.</li>
            <li> (even my nephews wanted to paint their fingers and toes for a night time glow (ages 3, 7, 9, 10)),  and because it&#x27;s almost clear</li>
            <li> (but there are no clear drying glow in the dark top coats).</li>
            <li> The only high quality nail polish I&#x27;ve found so far that does just what I want it to do - G L O W!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last super long</li>
            <li> You can apply this polish plain, or over another color, and it applies evenly and accurately.</li>
            <li> Finally found something that actually glowed in the dark, my daughter loves it and you can wear over any color as a top coat</li>
            <li> Painted nails must be exposed directly to a light bulb for thirty seconds or so to work in the dark only.  </li>
            <li> This polish literally glows in the dark, especially when im too lazy to turn on the light my toes light up</li>
            <li> Worth the $5 to have something that MIGHT work in the dark.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d imagine they&#x27;d last a little longer with a UV light.</li>
            <li> This polish didn&#x27;t glow very well or very long.</li>
            <li> Goes on clear and only glows in a backlight atmosphere.</li>
            <li> It does glow in the dark, but it isn&#x27;t that pretty</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t glow in the dark much!</li>
            <li> I had painted the glow in the dark topcoat over my color coat and the top coat muted the color quite a bit, but at least it looked cool in the dark.</li>
            <li> REALLY glows in the dark.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not ideal as a top coat.</li>
            <li> It really glows in the dark!</li>
            <li> The first glow in the dark polish I&#x27;ve had that actually GLOWS in the dark!</li>
            <li> i was skeptical about how much it would really glow, and i put it over two coats of dark yellow and then a clear coat</li>
            <li> : It doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> The glow does not last very long.</li>
            <li> I think the charge time took a while and the resulting glow didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I think the key here is to be patient and allow each coat to dry thoroughly and apply another.</li>
            <li> I cant even remember when i ordered this because its been that long</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not completely clear -</li>
            <li> This time I really put on a thick coat.</li>
            <li> I used a very thin layer in between my gel manicure dark color and top coats</li>
            <li> Also it changed the color of my polish in regular light, so that was disappointing.</li>
            <li> Miraculously, we have finally found glow in the dark nail polish that GLOWED.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always wanted a glow in the dark polish that actually glows</li>
            <li> As much as I liked the product, I was a bit disappointed to see that it looked chalky when applied to your nails.</li>
            <li> only worked if it was pitch black</li>
            <li> Have to apply about 3 coats for it to really work- definitely recommend using a while base coat first.</li>
            <li> This nail polish definitely glows in the dark!</li>
            <li> It glows, but only for a little bit.</li>
            <li> I also put a coat of this over any neon polish and had instant colored glow in the dark nails!  </li>
            <li> did not really glow in the dark.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the extra nail polish made a difference</li>
            <li> i can wear it over other polishes.</li>
            <li> but it dulls the design a lot!</li>
            <li> (only wanted a small line to show the hit of them).</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> It was still slightly visible, but up against the other lighter bases, it could not compare.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s slightly thicker than my other China Glaze polishes but nothing gloppy or unmanagable.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little creepy the first time your nail polish glows in the dark</li>
            <li> It glows every time it is dark</li>
            <li> It glows but, it has to be pitch dark to see it glow.</li>
            <li> so u can see the glow in dark effect</li>
            <li> It does glow in the dark but not as noticeable as I wanted.</li>
            <li> Glow in the dark nail</li>
            <li> I was sitting in the dark waiting for the thing to glow forever.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this glow in the dark polish.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shine in the dark.  </li>
            <li> It has to be pitch black to see your nails glow.  </li>
            <li> It is invisible in the daylight, although it does slightly change the undertone of my nail polish.</li>
            <li> ( a slight &#x27;foggy&#x27; tint to it), they did without it looking like their nails were painted.  </li>
            <li> Guess it needs a black.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t glow very much at all, which was a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> The glow itself is quite pale if you just walk into a dark room</li>
            <li> The glow fades after a few minutes</li>
            <li> Was worried that this polish would have a green tint.</li>
            <li> It gradually fades after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m going to try applying a green polish under this one and see if it glows brighter.</li>
            <li> In fact, I find it usually comes off within one day, as it seems air pockets form under the polish and</li>
            <li> I did read the review and tips before purchasing but was just not satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li> but it does dull a bit.</li>
            <li> Leaves a creamy, dull film</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t glow for very long so that was disappointing</li>
            <li> After a few coats it starts to look really weird though.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t wear it very long before I got sick of it.</li>
            <li> Very slow shipping...needed it in 3-5 days.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is a bad product, I just did not like the rough matte finish it put over my polish.</li>
            <li> Came broken and spilled everywhere.</li>
            <li> Just one thin coat and it works, and if you use 2-3 layers</li>
            <li> Ill be canceling my order sadly.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li> They broke, shockingly.</li>
            <li> Do not buy, this nail polish it is horrible and does not work at all, i regret buying this item</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I absolutely love this!! And the price is right. I do have to warn you, don&#x27;t drop it with another nail polish. My daughter accidentally slid off the bed where two nail polish were and they both rolled off and fell onto carpet. They broke, shockingly. I was able to salvage some to use and I love it!! I had to buy more.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly. I put it on top of a regular nail polish and it worked fine. Great for halloween :D</li>
            <li> The nail polish is great! You will have to apply this nail polish as a coat over another color because it looks if applied by itself. Also, one coat will not be suffice. You should apply 2-3 coats. For best results, immediately put your hands up to the light to allow the nail polish to work.</li>
            <li> It has to be pitch black to see your nails glow.  I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> A bit of fun for Halloween nail varnish! Perhaps good for clubbing!</li>
            <li> did not really glow in the dark.</li>
            <li> The best glow in the dark nail top coat out there.  Painted nails must be exposed directly to a light bulb for thirty seconds or so to work in the dark only.  Fun product.</li>
            <li> This nail polish definitely glows in the dark! It has nice packaging, and it&#x27;s not overly garish in the bottle.</li>
            <li> Omg I bought this polish for a friend and she loves it! It really glows in the dark! She swatched it on this blog [...] you can see pictures of the polish there and how it works!</li>
            <li> i was skeptical about how much it would really glow, and i put it over two coats of dark yellow and then a clear coat and then more of this, THEN i went tanning and that sure helped! It was amazing! I was almost distracted by it while driving home from the tanning place last night, then when i went to bed and saw it it startled me at first. Of course when i woke up the glow was gone, but it was cool! Not sure if the extra nail polish made a difference but i could see how it could help.</li>
            <li> This is a very cool nail polish. I like that you can use it as a top coat over any polish and it doesn&#x27;t look milky at all like it does in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is that the glow only lasts for a couple of minutes before they start fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am quite happy with this nail polish, and will be using it for Halloween coming up, concerts, and anything else where I will be in the dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to a friend. :)</li>
            <li> Fun! It really glows and lasts!!!</li>
            <li> Loved it,glows in the dark. Happy with purchase. I like that i can wear it over other polishes. Great for Halloween.</li>
            <li> it came like the next day! i like it...you do have to use 2 coats to really be able to see it glow in the dark! overall great product!</li>
            <li> I ordered this specifically for an upcoming glorun event in my town. From placing my order to arrival in my mailbox was 6 days via  U.S.P.S. I have never ordered anything and received it any faster so this was sufficient to me. Upon opening the package I walked into a dark room and this bottle of polish glowed fairly well without having been under any light at all but a one coat application produced virtually zero results. There wasn&#x27;t even a hint of a glow on any of my nails. Second coat, hey there is a hint of glowing! But only a hint. I am optimistic the third coat will be the charm. This time I really put on a thick coat. Finally there is a glow of substance. I think the key here is to be patient and allow each coat to dry thoroughly and apply another. I am going with FOUR OR MORE COATS for sure the day I use this polish. One final note, your nail polish (underneath this glow top coat) will not appear as pretty as it does without the top coat. I hope this review is somewhat helpful to you!</li>
            <li> This is a really cool nail polish! I painted monsters on my nails for Halloween and they sure did glow when the lights went out! It kind of freaked me out the first couple of times because I had forgotten about it. It works best on top of lighter polishes. I noticed that on darker polishes the glow was not as bright. It was still slightly visible, but up against the other lighter bases, it could not compare. If you put it on a white polish, it turns it a bit yellow. It&#x27;s not awful or anything, but it&#x27;s no longer truly white.</li>
            <li> It glows nicely, but doesn&#x27;t last long at all. In fact, I find it usually comes off within one day, as it seems air pockets form under the polish and it peels right off.</li>
            <li> FANTASTiC! The only high quality nail polish I&#x27;ve found so far that does just what I want it to do - G L O W!</li>
            <li> It does glow but not very long or bright. You can put over a design but it dulls the design a lot! Not bad if you just want to put over normal color but it does dull a bit.</li>
            <li> I love this polish! The glow doesn&#x27;t last super long, as previous reviewers have stated, but I bought it for use under black light, so it is bright and perfect for me. It dries very quickly, and is basically clear, so I can use it over my normal manicure so my nails look great in light or dark. Love!!</li>
            <li> Item arrived in perfect condition, exactly as described, on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noticeably tints the color of the varnish when you layer on this top coat so if you are looking for a clear top coat, this is not for you (but there are no clear drying glow in the dark top coats). I &amp;#34;charge&amp;#34; mine by holding them up to the desk lamp for ~10 seconds and it glows vividly. The glow fades after a few minutes but I&#x27;d imagine they&#x27;d last a little longer with a UV light.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little creepy the first time your nail polish glows in the dark but then it is very cool.  It doesn&#x27;t change the underlying color, but the glow is more a general glow and not a color glow.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t glow for very long so that was disappointing but it does glow. I did notice that they glow brighter if you put a top coat on top of this nail polish.</li>
            <li> It glows, but only for a little bit.</li>
            <li> I love this polish! It glows wonderfully even with just one coat and does not change the color of the under polish when it is applied.</li>
            <li> Was worried that this polish would have a green tint. It doesn&#x27;t. Goes on clear and only glows in a backlight atmosphere. it does not absorb the light then glows in the dark. Cool for dance night. Item came very fast too</li>
            <li> Fun to use.  Easy to use.  Needs to be pretty dark in order for this to glow, but all in all a good product.</li>
            <li> it works but I have to add so many coats n then after a while my nails start to have a melted look to them.</li>
            <li> I love the glow! It is very bright and lasts a long time. The only problem that I have is that it chips off so easily. It stayed on great and worked forever with manicured nails, you know fake ones, but once I ripped those off it wouldn&#x27;t stay on my nails anymore. Chips off within a day. I still recommend it, but I would say much better with stiffer nails.</li>
            <li> It does glow in the dark, but it isn&#x27;t that pretty and it does chip some. i didn&#x27;t wear it very long before I got sick of it.</li>
            <li> It really works and it looks so good. It was brighter than I thought it would be. And it&#x27;s fun to play around with. I recommend this product</li>
            <li> My daughters and I love this polish!!  Glow is awesome, makes a great topcoat.  Definitely would recommend!</li>
            <li> I love it. I used a very thin layer in between my gel manicure dark color and top coats and it worked wonderfully. It is invisible in the daylight, although it does slightly change the undertone of my nail polish. Texture is subtle - top coat over it smoothed it out perfectly. Good glow. So glad I purchased.</li>
            <li> This glows so nicely over most anything without giving much (if any) color.  I&#x27;ve used it over several colors and I&#x27;ve really enjoyed the glowing effect.  It&#x27;s a lot of fun!  Buy it, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> Miraculously, we have finally found glow in the dark nail polish that GLOWED.  Even without alot of exposure to light it works dimly, but when you charge it in front of our kitchen light fixture for a couple minutes, it REALLY goes to town.  My daughter has tried ALOT of these products ... this is the first one that has satisfied us.</li>
            <li> i bought this to combine the stars into their constellations on my daughter&#x27;s ceiling, worked great (only wanted a small line to show the hit of them).</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was going to work but it did. It glows every time it is dark and it takes me by surprise everytime. It has to charge in the light first.</li>
            <li> While searching for glow in the dark and neon products for my daughter&#x27;s costume this year, we decided glow in the dark nail polish would be fun. After reading the reviews, I decided this was the one to buy and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. Works great!</li>
            <li> arrived on time and as advertised</li>
            <li> Perfect stocking stuffer!!!</li>
            <li> The bottle of polish glowed but my nails didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This polish didn&#x27;t glow very well or very long.</li>
            <li> it works really good, after like 3 coats though</li>
            <li> This polish is so fun. I immediately applied it when I received it. I promptly forgot about it (it&#x27;s kind of an off-white color and goes unnoticed during the daytime). When I went to bed at night I was freaked out. I had forgotten I put it on earlier in the day and man, it was bright. It is activated in light (which it got a dose of when I turned off my bedside lamp). This can be applied over most colored polishes. I highly recommend it. It will be fun on Halloween!</li>
            <li> It glows but, it has to be pitch dark to see it glow.</li>
            <li> When I got this I excepted it to be campy and cheap however I did a glow test with just the bottle and it glowed like a flash light! I did a one coat test and the white on my nails glowed more than anything else, did a second coat and the whole nail was glowing but it was a clear coat in normal light. It glows green/yellow, the normal glow color. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> I bought this for Halloween, and it came amazingly fast; it came in two days and it was supposed to arrive in a week or so. I bought it from the seller One41 beauty by the way, and shipping was free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It does work! Apply 2-3 coats and charge it under a bright light and, ta-da! It also dries pretty fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It doesn&#x27;t last long. It gradually fades after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to try applying a green polish under this one and see if it glows brighter. I&#x27;ll also try charging it for longer to see if that makes it last longer. The glow polish has an opaque yellowish tint, but I guess you can apply a layer or two over another polish and it won&#x27;t affect the color that much. I will update soon!</li>
            <li> Okay first of all u need a light color like white so u can see the glow in dark effect</li>
            <li> To get it to glow REALLY well you actually need to hold your hands right up to a light first. But it&#x27;s all in good fun. I bought it for an event. Worth the $5 to have something that MIGHT work in the dark. If it doesn&#x27;t I&#x27;m going to paint is all over a bunch of stuff. Because why not?!</li>
            <li> Love this top coat! My nails glow so pretty at night and my son even liked when I painted his thumb nail and it glowed!</li>
            <li> Very slow shipping...needed it in 3-5 days. I got it in 7. But besides that its a fantastic product :D takes a couple layers to glow super bright but overall its amazing I love it and so do my raving buddies ^.^ WORTH THE MONEY!</li>
            <li> I love that this glows in the dark.  Be sure to put on three coats to get the best effect though.  I also liked putting it under decals for the nails.  It is fun and not just for Halloween.</li>
            <li> I really loved it and it came right on time. It&#x27;s soooo cute and it really glows!!!</li>
            <li> It glows but you need more than one coat. After a few coats it starts to look really weird though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 20s and I&#x27;ve always wanted a glow in the dark polish that actually glows and I&#x27;ve finally ended my search.  It shipped relativly quickly but the packaging was a bit busted.  Other than that I have NO complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s slightly thicker than my other China Glaze polishes but nothing gloppy or unmanagable.  It&#x27;s not completely clear - it goes on with a hint of green/yellow but it&#x27;s not overpowering.  I put it over a leopard manicure and it didn&#x27;t have much effect on the coloring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle glows really bright in the dark so I was expecting it to be a bit of a dud on my nails.  I put on two coats over a mint green and it glowed obsurdly bright, the glow gets dimmer as the colors of your manicure get darker but it still glows once it&#x27;s charged.  The glow itself is quite pale if you just walk into a dark room but if you expose the polish to a light for about 30 seconds it&#x27;s pretty bright.  It doesn&#x27;t last super long but it takes a while to fade out completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I&#x27;m planning on buying another bottle when this runs out.</li>
            <li> I purchased this initially for Halloween designs, but because it is virtually clear, it can be used as a top coat anytime! My young Nieces love to see their fingers glow in the dark at night so, I have used it several times just for fun (even my nephews wanted to paint their fingers and toes for a night time glow (ages 3, 7, 9, 10)),  and because it&#x27;s almost clear ( a slight &#x27;foggy&#x27; tint to it), they did without it looking like their nails were painted.  I would recommend this product to any nail polish enthusiast .</li>
            <li> Leaves a creamy, dull film so it&#x27;s not ideal as a top coat.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t glow in the dark much! I will not repurchase this product!</li>
            <li> Buy it! I love glow in the dark things, and this works as a top coat for any color. Love it!</li>
            <li> Came broken and spilled everywhere. And didnt glow very bright only worked if it was pitch black</li>
            <li> Well, it does work kinda. Requires multiple coats and lots of exposure to light. The glow does not last very long. I bought this to play with the kids. They thought it was cool.</li>
            <li> It does glow in the dark but not as noticeable as I wanted. I recommend you charging the polish on your fingers for several hours prior to night. The quality was better than most glow in the dark polish. I even top coated it with clear polish and it still glowed in the dark. Darker the room the better the glow. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Glow in the dark nail polish!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks cool right after you turn off the lights, but 5 minutes later all of the glow is gone.  I would have liked it to last longer, though I know that there are limits to how much it can glow.  I also find that the polish chips faster than some of the others that I own.</li>
            <li> Have to apply about 3 coats for it to really work- definitely recommend using a while base coat first.</li>
            <li> Super fun to have. It works great and if you put a clear coat on top will last a long time. No complaints about this stuff.</li>
            <li> makes nails glow but when applied on top of nail polish he makes it chip dont use as a top coat</li>
            <li> Dries extremely fast, glows bright, has no color making it perfect over any nail color as a clear coat. I love it, and def. will be buying more.</li>
            <li> Great reviews, wish i had the product to give a great review. I cant even remember when i ordered this because its been that long and it has not even shipped. Tisk Tisk. Ill be canceling my order sadly.</li>
            <li> This did not have the glow factor I was looking for.  I did read the review and tips before purchasing but was just not satisfied with the results.  I think the charge time took a while and the resulting glow didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> THis nail polish is great but when I first got it I had no idea that you had to put it under the light for it to glow. I was sitting in the dark waiting for the thing to glow forever. :) It only glows for a few seconds but it&#x27;s great for sleepovers and camping.</li>
            <li> Easy to put on and not streaky at all.  It didn&#x27;t glow very much at all, which was a disappointment.  China Glaze is a decent brand and I expected more.</li>
            <li> This is so fun to use! My nails actually glowed for the full week I had it on. It glowed brighter on some days than others though. As much as I liked the product, I was a bit disappointed to see that it looked chalky when applied to your nails. I had painted the glow in the dark topcoat over my color coat and the top coat muted the color quite a bit, but at least it looked cool in the dark.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this glow in the dark polish. He uses it on his gun and rifle sights to make it easier to see.</li>
            <li> This works! I forgot I had it on, woke up during the night and scared myself wondering what was glowing on my bed!  That was awesome! It works till you remove it, will buy again!</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth it! REALLY glows in the dark.  I also put a coat of this over any neon polish and had instant colored glow in the dark nails!  So nice, I bought it twice!  GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> it is a really good product and it does glow very well, i wear it all the time and it goes with everything</li>
            <li> Works just as I&#x27;d hoped and wanted. Just one thin coat and it works, and if you use 2-3 layers it&#x27;s pretty bright, so you can make it to your preference. Good value, and I know I&#x27;ll be using this a lot! :) Arrived quickly and in great condition, thanks!</li>
            <li> the color is pale, and looks good over a lot of colors, but I usually have to put a few layers on in order to get a really bright glow. Still happy with it for the price, and much better than some other glow in the dark nail colors I&#x27;ve had in the past. :)</li>
            <li> Do not buy, this nail polish it is horrible and does not work at all, i regret buying this item</li>
            <li> It glows strong after putting 5 layers. But it looks really wicked. I highly recommend this for raves, parties, and Holloween.</li>
            <li> Works great, lots of fun if you&#x27;re headed to somewhere with dark light rides. Fun for kids and parents :)</li>
            <li> This nail polish is perfect, it came in quick and they wrapped it up and put it into a zip lock bag and in a box to make sure it wouldn&#x27;t break, it goes for awhile and you only need some kind of light to make it glow. Al I can say is that is perfect and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is a bad product, I just did not like the rough matte finish it put over my polish. Also it changed the color of my polish in regular light, so that was disappointing. It did glow after exposing to a light source and then in total darkness, but not without &amp;#34;charging with light&amp;#34; before expecting it to glow. Not my favorite. I&#x27;ll keep looking.</li>
            <li> love this nail polish but the glow in the dark isn&#x27;t that strong unless you put 2 coats</li>
            <li> This polish literally glows in the dark, especially when im too lazy to turn on the light my toes light up lol!!!! Love this nail polish i also wrote some stuff on the wall with it, my little brother cant sleep without the night light, but not any more his room lights up at night now :)</li>
            <li> Totally Satisfied!! Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> The product came at the appropriate time listed and it works great! I&#x27;ve tried a lot of glow nailpolish and this one is my favorite!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift. My 18 year old niece uses it as a clear top coat and loves it.</li>
            <li> Finally found something that actually glowed in the dark, my daughter loves it and you can wear over any color as a top coat</li>
            <li> I had looked everywhere for a good glow in the dark nail polish, and I finally found it in China Glaze Ghoulish Glow. You can apply this polish plain, or over another color, and it applies evenly and accurately. It dries quickly, and with a little exposure to light, it will glow vibrantly when you turn out the lights. It is a nice touch around Halloween, or really any time you want to have a fun, unique look.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shine in the dark.  Guess it needs a black.</li>
            <li> great glow in the dark polish</li>
            <li> The first glow in the dark polish I&#x27;ve had that actually GLOWS in the dark! Very bright, especially after holding it under a lamp or light source. Gonna buy another as soon as i run out.</li>
            <li> It glows in the bottle, but once used the nails do not glow. I&#x27;ve had glow in the dark polish before that glowed well with one coat and better with two. This one is not even visible with three.</li>
