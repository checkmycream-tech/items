            <li> a great value for a good soap!</li>
            <li> Love olay soap. Leaves my skin feeling very smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice bar of soap that cleans well but seems to leave my skin feeling a little dried out.</li>
            <li> These are very simple soaps.I keep them in the house for emergency. I thought these are smaller size, because the price is so much better than the drugstores. Will prop ably melt a couple into handsoap.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and last much longer than dove.</li>
            <li> Great item Great price Quick shipping</li>
            <li> I have dry skin but I hate using body washes and a loofah; too much fuss and takes too long.  I like using bar soaps, so I try to use ones that are moisturizing like ANY Dove bars or Olay Ultra Moisture or the Olay Age Defy bars.  These ones are not like that.  These are actually hard to get to soap out of them relative to Dove and Olay Moisturizing bars.  If you&#x27;re like me, DON&#x27;T get the &amp;#34;SIMPLY&amp;#34; Olay bar soaps; they are worth the extra money...</li>
            <li> I hate trashy Walmart stores and thank you Amazon for offering value for us. Is a decent soap good enough for a man. The women won&#x27;t gripe about it like they do the Irish Spring.</li>
            <li> It leaves skin smooth and feeling fresh.&lt;br /&gt;It will not dry powdery or cause itching.</li>
            <li> I love Olay and Dove soaps.  This one smelled pretty good.  But I noticed it is more drying than other Olay soaps.  This soaps leaves that squeaky clean feeling when you are finished.  Not that soft skin I am use to with other Olay and Dove soaps.  No complaints from my girls.  They liked it very much.  But I need something with more moisturizer in it.  I would buy it again, but only for my girls.</li>
            <li> the quality is very bad .. I have a doubt whether these are real olay or not .. better buy it from walmart or drug store</li>
            <li> Clean and refreshing sent</li>
            <li> Blue bar instead of white I wasn&#x27;t happy at all</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s blue, it&#x27;s fresh, it smells like nature</li>
            <li> Ok, but lacks lather.</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong with this. It&#x27;s soap, smells okay, but it last&#x27;s a long time. It&#x27;s soap, but good bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> These soaps dry up your skin. Absolutely no moisture at all. Accidentally purchased it and regret it.</li>
            <li> the smell was very disappointing.</li>
