    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>LOVE!!!!</li>
            <li>For me, it was a trial that didn&#x27;t work, so if I can save you from making a $20 mistake, I&#x27;m happy to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The most wonderful invention of all!  </li>
            <li>The product is nothing more than a cheap piece of string with patches on it!!</li>
            <li>the name of this thing is hilarious...</li>
            <li>It can be adjusted so it fits most face.</li>
            <li>Easy to sleep in.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable.</li>
            <li>However, I didn&#x27;t have any problem with my nasal pillows leaking, the only happy surprise to this strap.</li>
            <li>I wear it every night and feel so comfortable.</li>
            <li>I just tie a bandana through each &amp;#34;ear loop&amp;#34; and tie that at the crown of my head every night, so it stays on all night, comfortably, without strain on my ears.</li>
            <li>I could not wear this device because even just putting it on to fit it to my face, hurt my ears.  </li>
            <li>Nice Product, Simple but effective.</li>
            <li>Now I am glad I bought this, but, really, why design it so the straps go on the ears?</li>
            <li>First thought on buying: I should have listened to the reviews and invested in something else.</li>
            <li>Could not possible say enough good things.  </li>
            <li>The mouth strap is great for keeping my mouth closed preventing dry mouth while using the CPAP machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t wear it at night because it really hurt my ears...</li>
            <li>Was very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Purchased because this was the only real cotton mouth strap I could find - all the others seem to be made from synthetic material, which I don&#x27;t really want near my mouth, so I was determined to make it work, and so I did!</li>
            <li>It does hurt a bit around the ears, however I sewed some soft cotton cloth on the straps which helps.  </li>
            <li>This is hand made and offers no support for which it was designed.</li>
            <li>The idea seems good - I was desperate to use something smaller to keep my mouth shut while using my cpap -</li>
            <li>She say it hurts her ears too much even though she did not make it too tight.</li>

            <li> I have dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I use dry moth gel, and dry mouth mints.  </li>
            <li> Too flimsy, would not keep mouth closed at all or stay in place.  </li>
            <li> It did NOTHING to hold my mouth closed as I</li>
            <li> If you have a problem with your mouth opening during sleep, these stretchy bands will not hold it closed.  </li>
            <li> my mouth doesn&#x27;t stay closed all night.  </li>
            <li> The mouth strap arrived smelling like laundry detergent, &amp; I had to wash &amp;air dry a few times before the smell came out.</li>
            <li> Did not hold mouth closed but was too tight for comfort.</li>
            <li> I complained to the seller and they refunded my money..., but you&#x27;d be better off just not buying it and saving yourself from a painful situation.</li>
            <li> A waste of money.do not buy or you&#x27;ll be throwing your money away.</li>
            <li> Clumsy, uncomfy, odd looking,</li>
            <li> Started to put a small pillow under my chin to keep my lips together.  </li>
            <li> Unless you like to feel like your lips are being &#x27;crushed&#x27; together and painful, I&#x27;d definitely skip this Mouth Strap!</li>
            <li> If you have to put any tension on the cord at all, the cord will dig in behind your ears, not to mention for me, since my ears are ridiculously flat to my head, sleeping on my side with that cord behind the ears caused problems, too.</li>
            <li> WASTE YOUR MONEY!!</li>
            <li> Not a good combination.  </li>
            <li> Had trouble with this product unfortunately.</li>
            <li> and it is not good.</li>
            <li> but it will kill you behind the ears.</li>
            <li> THIS ISN&#x27;T COMFORT TO SLEEP WITH IT HURTS BEHIND THE EARS</li>
            <li> Weak structure , flimsy, uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Completely useless.</li>
            <li> it is useless.</li>
            <li> it almost makes you afraid of ordering it for fear of being consumed by it during the night.</li>
            <li> it is so ugly.</li>
            <li> Too painful to wear so</li>

            <li> I have dry mouth. Plus when I sleep my mouth slacks open and that makes me a mouth breather when asleep.  Not a good combination.  I use dry moth gel, and dry mouth mints.  Both help, but I still suffered.  Started to put a small pillow under my chin to keep my lips together.  Then I found THE MOUTH STRAP.  The most wonderful invention of all!  Put it on and your lips stay together.  Easy to sleep in.  Comfortable. Could not possible say enough good things.  Once it is on you do not even feel it.  LOVE!!!!</li>
            <li> The idea seems good - I was desperate to use something smaller to keep my mouth shut while using my cpap - but it will kill you behind the ears. If you have to put any tension on the cord at all, the cord will dig in behind your ears, not to mention for me, since my ears are ridiculously flat to my head, sleeping on my side with that cord behind the ears caused problems, too. I like the idea of something to keep the bottom lip in place, but it wasn&#x27;t this. However, I didn&#x27;t have any problem with my nasal pillows leaking, the only happy surprise to this strap. Maybe with a different face shape or ear configuration, this might work for you. For me, it was a trial that didn&#x27;t work, so if I can save you from making a $20 mistake, I&#x27;m happy to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. the name of this thing is hilarious...it almost makes you afraid of ordering it for fear of being consumed by it during the night.</li>
            <li> Completely useless. It&#x27;s just a shoelace and a couple of rubber bands.</li>
            <li> THIS ISN&#x27;T COMFORT TO SLEEP WITH IT HURTS BEHIND THE EARS THAT I AWAKE TO REMOVE IT.WILL TRY SOMETHING ELSE</li>
            <li> Too flimsy, would not keep mouth closed at all or stay in place.  Do not order&lt;br /&gt;this item.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> Had trouble with this product unfortunately. Weak structure , flimsy, uncomfortable. Did not hold mouth closed but was too tight for comfort.</li>
            <li> The mouth strap is great for keeping my mouth closed preventing dry mouth while using the CPAP machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not like the strap around my ears because it make my them sore</li>
            <li> The product is nothing more than a cheap piece of string with patches on it!! It did NOTHING to hold my mouth closed as I sleep!&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife but after two nights she stopped using it already. She say it hurts her ears too much even though she did not make it too tight. I also bought the over the head type but that comes off while sleeping and it is not good.</li>
            <li> Nice Product, Simple but effective.</li>
            <li> If you have a problem with your mouth opening during sleep, these stretchy bands will not hold it closed.  somone needs to make this device without elastic cords.</li>
            <li> Unless you like to feel like your lips are being &#x27;crushed&#x27; together and painful, I&#x27;d definitely skip this Mouth Strap! After about 1 hour of sleeping, I was awakened to my lips in a lot of pain! I complained to the seller and they refunded my money..., but you&#x27;d be better off just not buying it and saving yourself from a painful situation.</li>
            <li> would never wear this piece of stuff. no woman would... it is so ugly. why would any man want to see you in that?</li>
            <li> I wear it every night and feel so comfortable. I can figure out every morning that It works as stated. It can be adjusted so it fits most face. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Clumsy, uncomfy, odd looking,</li>
            <li> I like this mouth strap, however it does have some problems for me.  Somehow I take it off while sleeping, so my mouth doesn&#x27;t stay closed all night.  It does hurt a bit around the ears, however I sewed some soft cotton cloth on the straps which helps.  I will be trying the Devilbliss chin strap, which has a cotton chin cup, and will review on that.</li>
            <li> This is hand made and offers no support for which it was designed. A waste of money.do not buy or you&#x27;ll be throwing your money away.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
            <li> First thought on buying: I should have listened to the reviews and invested in something else. The mouth strap arrived smelling like laundry detergent, &amp; I had to wash &amp;air dry a few times before the smell came out. Couldn&#x27;t wear it at night because it really hurt my ears...
