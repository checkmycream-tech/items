            <li>This is a magic tool, every girl should spoil herself with it.</li>
            <li>It exfoliates, leaves skin smooth, and comes with a nice storage case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, to say that either one is a Clarisonic dupe is just stretching it.</li>
            <li>After that I use a moisturizing lotion and my skin feels incredibly smooth and soft and my foundation looks flawless when I put it on.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I was also impressed by the different attachment brush</li>
            <li>My skin is smoother, softer , and feel sooooo clean!</li>
            <li>i will tell my friends and sisters to get it cuz it&#x27;s easy to use it and gd prise also</li>
            <li>It is a smart tool that, for me, is something not so popular here in my region.</li>
            <li>It seems to help clean and keep skin smooth .</li>
            <li>It seems to help clean and keep my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Gorgeous and I would advise buy it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suitable price and quality high&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gorgeous and unique and inexpensive</li>
            <li>My face feels so clean</li>
            <li>i feel like my skin is so fresh and smooth after using it</li>
            <li>Maybe after a full month I&#x27;ll have my full results?</li>
            <li>to clean  -ships quickly  </li>
            <li>Your skin will feel clean and smooth after the first use.</li>
            <li>Does mild exfloriation.</li>
            <li>Used my new sigma tool and at first it seemed a bit abrasive even with the soft tool, but my skin did feel great after.</li>
            <li>Having  the three different attachments was a nice touch-</li>
            <li>Do not buy from BIGFLYSPORTS you can go to the sigma makeup site and get this for 39.00 BIGFLYSPORTS should not have the right to sell sigma makeup products</li>
            <li>I love this product, it really helps to clear the skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is very oily and I need to make a super cleaning twice a week.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is kind of the same comparison that you&#x27;d face with a high end Sonicare toothbrush vs. a Crest spinbrush.</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time today</li>
            <li>first experience with brushes of this type was with the Sun Body Polishing Tool ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I was a fan of the Sun brush when I first used it.</li>
            <li>I find this product to be exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>The Mia uses more of a high speed vibration, and the spin of the brush is quite different.</li>
            <li>I like that it comes with three brushes, and the case is very practical.</li>
            <li>like that its a waterproof and exfoliate for real.</li>
            <li>I recommend anyone who wants to have a well-groomed horoshuyub skin without acne.</li>
            <li>Much like the Sigma cleansing brush, it was a device that rotates attachable brush heads.</li>
            <li>Thanks for your support</li>
            <li>Like it so much ...</li>
            <li>it so much ...</li>
            <li>Well I really wanted to like this brush.</li>
            <li>I bought this item a couple years ago, and I had high hopes for it.</li>
            <li>but if they add a hard brush instead of the massage head, it will be better.</li>
            <li>and I like it so far.</li>
            <li>Overall, I really like it and would recommend it.  </li>
            <li>After a while the brushes developed a smell</li>
            <li>and then the rest of the week I switch off between the soft and medium brush heads.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t put my face soap directly on the brush as it says to.  </li>
            <li>I so far have not had any problem at all with it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, I have actually ordered several items and this is my first time to purchase Sigma products.</li>
            <li>The bristles of the toothbrush that we normally use is almost similar to the white color brush.</li>
            <li>-could be a little sturdier, but for $40, it&#x27;s sufficient   -would be nice if the little plastic box it is stored in had holes or some sort of way for air to get in so that it wasn&#x27;t necessary to allow the head to dry completely before putting it back in the box  </li>

            <li> In addition to the face brush, it also had a few other attachments: pumice stone, large body brush, &amp; moisturizer brush.</li>
            <li> It comes with three different brushes,white brush has the harshest texture, pink &amp; white brush is softer than the white brush and the pink one is the softest.</li>
            <li> Not too long after I purchased my Sigma Cleansing tool, I went ahead and threw some money into a Clarisonic Mia.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why it took me so long to get it!</li>
            <li> but i feel my skin become dry of using it.</li>
            <li> Only one out of three brushes weren&#x27;t harsh enough to use on my face.</li>
            <li> At the time, my wallet was not ready to commit to the price of a Clarisonic brush, so I went ahead and picked up the Sigma Cleansing and Polishing tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing I dislike about this is that it&#x27;s really hard to get under your eyes because of the tugging and the sides of the nose.</li>
            <li> I find it easier to apply it to my face and then to have the polishing tool massage the soap into my skin for less then a minute then rinse.</li>
            <li> The firmest brush can be too harsh</li>
            <li> This product provides a cleaning without harming the skin and in a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> and I thought it would break after a few uses.</li>
            <li> This product has made such a dramatic difference in my skin</li>
            <li> so you need 2 AA and the attachment was hard to take off, no instructions came with it</li>
            <li> but you basically just pull them off hard..</li>
            <li> , it is very slow</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any dramatic improvements in my skin, but it does feel softer and I like using it.</li>
            <li> is a product I recommend blindly.</li>
            <li> annoying, but I don&#x27;t know how that could be helped</li>
            <li> , You can&#x27;t go wrong with the price !!!</li>

            <li> i really love this cleaning and polish tool... i feel like my skin is so fresh and smooth after using it</li>
            <li> I  Sigma Beauty cleansing and polishing tool in a good organized parcel, I have actually ordered several items and this is my first time to purchase Sigma products. It is a smart tool that, for me, is something not so popular here in my region. I liked the intensity and softness of the brushes, and the fact that it is cordless! great for traveling and for gift.</li>
            <li> This product has made such a dramatic difference in my skin and I am so happy i got it! My skin is smoother, softer , and feel sooooo clean! I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time today and I don&#x27;t regret buying it ! It&#x27;s gentle with the skin but feels like doing a really good job !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving my sigma :D And the package is so pinky and girly! I like that it comes with three brushes, and the case is very practical.</li>
            <li> This is a magic tool, every girl should spoil herself with it. It comes with three different brushes,white brush has the harshest texture, pink &amp; white brush is softer than the white brush and the pink one is the softest. The bristles of the toothbrush that we normally use is almost similar to the white color brush. So you&#x27;d imagine how soft the pink is. I suffer a bit on how to open the battery but i got it all after just two seconds with brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that its a waterproof and exfoliate for real. Final point, You can&#x27;t go wrong with the price !!!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase! I use it for 1 month, my skin got excellent quality. I can compare this device with  Clarisonic, and I can say that I like Sigma much more! I recommend anyone who wants to have a well-groomed horoshuyub skin without acne.</li>
            <li> I bought this item a couple years ago, and I had high hopes for it. I read a lot of reviews saying that it was a great alternative for a Clarisonic face brush. At the time, my wallet was not ready to commit to the price of a Clarisonic brush, so I went ahead and picked up the Sigma Cleansing and Polishing tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first experience with brushes of this type was with the Sun Body Polishing Tool ([[ASIN:B002P4NQC8 Sun 75843225023 Body Polisher]] Much like the Sigma cleansing brush, it was a device that rotates attachable brush heads. I was a fan of the Sun brush when I first used it. In addition to the face brush, it also had a few other attachments: pumice stone, large body brush, &amp; moisturizer brush. All in all, it was a good buy. The Sigma Cleansing and Polishing Tool is similar in that it&#x27;s a spinning facial brush. It exfoliates, leaves skin smooth, and comes with a nice storage case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, to say that either one is a Clarisonic dupe is just stretching it. Not too long after I purchased my Sigma Cleansing tool, I went ahead and threw some money into a Clarisonic Mia. They&#x27;re definitely not the same. The Mia uses more of a high speed vibration, and the spin of the brush is quite different. There is virtually no \\&quot;tug\\&quot; at the skin, whereas the Sigma does kind of pull when pressure is applied. Also, there&#x27;s the hassle of battery replacement (Sigma) whereas the Mia is rechargeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is kind of the same comparison that you&#x27;d face with a high end Sonicare toothbrush vs. a Crest spinbrush. Crest gets the job done well, but a Sonicare takes it to another level... for a price. I would definitely say to give the Sigma Cleansing Tool a try, though. Your skin will feel clean and smooth after the first use.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice nice nice i will tell my friends and sisters to get it cuz it&#x27;s easy to use it and gd prise also the skin need it ....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about two weeks and I like it so far. I haven&#x27;t seen any dramatic improvements in my skin, but it does feel softer and I like using it. Maybe after a full month I&#x27;ll have my full results? Overall, I really like it and would recommend it.  PROS  -water resistant - I can take it into the shower with me to exfoliate my upper arms  -nice price   -very cute with cute packaging  -two speed options  -easy to clean  -ships quickly  CONS  -could be a little sturdier, but for $40, it&#x27;s sufficient   -would be nice if the little plastic box it is stored in had holes or some sort of way for air to get in so that it wasn&#x27;t necessary to allow the head to dry completely before putting it back in the box  -it flings soap all over when you are cleansing your face. annoying, but I don&#x27;t know how that could be helped</li>
            <li> Amei  meu sigma beauty cleansing e polishing tool!!!minha pele  ta  cada vez mais limpa  e maciaaaaaa</li>
            <li> I have ordered 10 pieces of this product but one of the pieces do not work well, it is very slow it seems that there is a defect by the manufacturers.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my wife. It is nice but if they add a hard brush instead of the massage head, it will be better. Moreover, if they make it rechargeable it will be perfect.</li>
            <li> I used it with cream to cleanse my face.  Does mild exfloriation. I&#x27;ve since given it to my granddaughter (13) and she likes it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but i feel my skin become dry of using it. So i turn the using of it to the message after apply the creams</li>
            <li> Only one out of three brushes weren&#x27;t harsh enough to use on my face. After a while the brushes developed a smell</li>

            <li> Sigma excellent device for ravenously I have benefited a lot from him I will recommend my friends Thank you very much</li>
            <li> I love this product, it really helps to clear the skin.</li>
            <li> Used my new sigma tool and at first it seemed a bit abrasive even with the soft tool, but my skin did feel great after. Didnt realize it was battery operated so you need 2 AA and the attachment was hard to take off, no instructions came with it but you basically just pull them off hard..I have never used clarisonic so I cant compare the quality i bought this one based on reviews and the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to buy this product for a while and i finally bought one after my sister convicted me to. This is incredible and I&#x27;m glad I bought it.  The firmest brush can be too harsh so I use it once a week and then the rest of the week I switch off between the soft and medium brush heads.  I don&#x27;t put my face soap directly on the brush as it says to.  I find it easier to apply it to my face and then to have the polishing tool massage the soap into my skin for less then a minute then rinse. After that I use a moisturizing lotion and my skin feels incredibly smooth and soft and my foundation looks flawless when I put it on.  The only thing I dislike about this is that it&#x27;s really hard to get under your eyes because of the tugging and the sides of the nose.</li>
            <li> excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a few weeks ago that I bought and I am very contanta of purchase.is as described. is a product I recommend blindly.</li>

            <li> Loving this! My face feels so clean can&#x27;t go a day without it!! Don&#x27;t know why it took me so long to get it!</li>
            <li> I love it. It seems to help clean and keep my skin smooth. My husband even uses it. Already bought all the different scrubbers</li>
            <li> Thanks for your support</li>
            <li> I find this product to be exactly as described. I so far have not had any problem at all with it.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a tool to exfoliate my face that actually moved and rotated, as opposed to vibrate. I was also impressed by the different attachment brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very pleased with the product and the price.</li>
            <li> Like it so much ... They are really beautiful ... definitely I will ask again&lt;br /&gt;Like it so much ... They are really beautiful ... definitely I will ask again</li>
            <li> My skin is very oily and I need to make a super cleaning twice a week. This product provides a cleaning without harming the skin and in a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;This product delivers what it promises</li>
            <li> Well I really wanted to like this brush. But I just couldnt....It just felt low quality. Having  the three different attachments was a nice touch- but I just didnt care for the product- the tool itself felt cheap/ and I thought it would break after a few uses. Returned.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my friend and she says it works great. Does exactly what it says. She&#x27;s been using it for the last five days and She&#x27;s seeing a vast improvement. Would recommend it.</li>
