            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>Great product when you don&#x27;t feel like washing your hair.  </li>

            <li>This is great for refreshing your style.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for end of the day before heading out right from the office.</li>
            <li>Product does nothing to my hair, it smells good, doesn&#x27;t do any damage but does nothing to make it look better.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>One if my favorite products.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I have used Nick Chavez products for many years.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>better than any others that are available on the market.  </li>
            <li>The price is reasonable and good to have when traveling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and saves a hair-do.  </li>
            <li>Just a great product, does what it is supposed to, does not leave hair heavy, greasy or sticky and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>A COMB.&lt;br /&gt;VERY LIGHT &amp; NOT STICKY.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sometimes I just do a light spray all over my head to give my hair fragrance boost.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise , I find that this product can be used to lightly dampen your hair and allow you to re-style it.  </li>
            <li>First of all , I love the fresh smell of this product !  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sticky and leaves your hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li>and it makes you hair feel clean with no buildup.  </li>
            <li>Love this product so much.  </li>
            <li>The smell is clean and fresh without being perfumy</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my hair feel in between shampoos - soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>Wish this was still available for purchase on Nick Chavez&#x27;s website because I love the way this product gives my hair body and hold on the second day after washing my hair.</li>
            <li>It has a very light \\&quot;stiffness\\&quot; to it as it dries, so it will actually hold the style in place.  </li>
            <li>Most other refresher sprays are nothing but powder in a can that take the shine out of my hair, but this leaves my hair smelling and looking great - not weighed down and chalky.</li>
            <li>The curly hair that is loose on the top maintains that just washed look</li>
            <li>Pay a little more And buy a nice dry shampoo like kerastase or oribe.</li>
            <li>I really like Nick Chavez hair products.  </li>
            <li>i have thin, fine, straight hair that is fairly easy to work.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li>Just spritz with Revamp, do a quick blow dry</li>
            <li>It is great for us lazy folks who don&#x27;t want to wash our hair everyday!  </li>
            <li>I like how it makes my hair feel like it was just washed - soft yet holds a curl - even on day 2 or 3</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair and use it to style my hair on the days I don&#x27;t shampoo.  </li>

            <li> You can restyle it and it feels soft not full of products.</li>
            <li> It definitely reactivates any products I may have used the day earlier on my hair, so my hair is not weighed down with a lot of chemicals.</li>
            <li> Prefer this over dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> It actually is a dry shampoo ....</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair and use this product every other day in between washes.</li>
            <li> it sprays on wet and sticky and flattens hair out.</li>
            <li> Now I have to use it about every other day to &amp;#34;save&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I used many dry shampoos And this is definitely one of the worst ones.</li>
            <li> however, any attempts at improving limp hair in sore need of a refresh only rendered the overall look worse.</li>
            <li> leaves hair slightly sticky and looking greasy.  </li>
            <li> I spray, flip my head upside down shake it a few times</li>
            <li> It allows me to go without washing my hair everyday.  </li>
            <li> maybe it was my false assumption that a restyling &amp;#34;refresher&amp;#34; spray would have elements of a dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> His products always do wonders for my extremely thick hair.</li>
            <li> this stuff is so bad, i&#x27;m not sure if i can bring myself to using it for a fourth time.  </li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why this product is difficult to find.  </li>
            <li> WAS NOT TOO CRAZY ABOUT THE SCENT</li>

            <li> I LOVE IT BECAUSE I CAN SPRAY IT ON MY HAIR AFTER 2 DAYS A FTER WASHING &amp; I CAN STYLE IT AGAIN WITH MY HANDS &amp;/OR A COMB.&lt;br /&gt;VERY LIGHT &amp; NOT STICKY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BARB</li>
            <li> One if my favorite products. A go to when traveling.</li>
            <li> This simply does nothing for your hair. it sprays on wet and sticky and flattens hair out.</li>
            <li> Most other refresher sprays are nothing but powder in a can that take the shine out of my hair, but this leaves my hair smelling and looking great - not weighed down and chalky. Perfect for end of the day before heading out right from the office. I spray, flip my head upside down shake it a few times and I get all the volume back that I&#x27;ve lost throughout the day. The smell is clean and fresh without being perfumy</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I have been using it for years. I have long curly hair and use this product every other day in between washes. I spray it all over my hair and run my fingers through it and put my hair up. The curly hair that is loose on the top maintains that just washed look and you can also use the blow dryer for touch ups.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It allows me to go without washing my hair everyday.  It gives my hair a boost of volume and calms any frizz that I may have.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t do a thing.  i have thin, fine, straight hair that is fairly easy to work.  this stuff is so bad, i&#x27;m not sure if i can bring myself to using it for a fourth time.  leaves hair slightly sticky and looking greasy.  maybe it was my false assumption that a restyling &amp;#34;refresher&amp;#34; spray would have elements of a dry shampoo.  however, any attempts at improving limp hair in sore need of a refresh only rendered the overall look worse.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years.  I really like Nick Chavez hair products.  This is great for refreshing your style.  It&#x27;s not sticky and leaves your hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Reactivates the product in your hair when you don&#x27;t have time to wash.</li>
            <li> Love this product so much.  Don&#x27;t know why they quit selling it.  Now I have to use it about every other day to &amp;#34;save&amp;#34; it.  Not good.</li>
            <li> I used many dry shampoos And this is definitely one of the worst ones. Pay a little more And buy a nice dry shampoo like kerastase or oribe.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the shizz, and also smells terrific.</li>
            <li> Just a great product, does what it is supposed to, does not leave hair heavy, greasy or sticky and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> WAS NOT TOO CRAZY ABOUT THE SCENT</li>
            <li> First of all , I love the fresh smell of this product !  Sometimes I just do a light spray all over my head to give my hair fragrance boost.  Otherwise , I find that this product can be used to lightly dampen your hair and allow you to re-style it.  It has a very light \\&quot;stiffness\\&quot; to it as it dries, so it will actually hold the style in place.  I have wavy hair, but I&#x27;m a side sleeper so I spritz the sides of my flattened hair the next morning to \\&quot;re-boot\\&quot; the waves.  I could also use a hair dryer to blow it out after spraying if I decided to change the look.</li>
            <li> WON&#x27;T GO ON VACATION WITHOUT IT</li>
            <li> Works perfect and you can&#x27;t even feel it.</li>
            <li> Prefer this over dry shampoo. I have used Nick Chavez products for many years. His products always do wonders for my extremely thick hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Does what it says it will do with almost no work at all.&lt;br /&gt;All of these products are good.</li>
            <li> I like how it makes my hair feel like it was just washed - soft yet holds a curl - even on day 2 or 3</li>
            <li> Product does nothing to my hair, it smells good, doesn&#x27;t do any damage but does nothing to make it look better.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff ever.  I love how it makes my hair feel in between shampoos - soft and silky.  I have fine, thin hair and use it to style my hair on the days I don&#x27;t shampoo.  Can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li> Great product when you don&#x27;t feel like washing your hair.  It actually is a dry shampoo .... better than any others that are available on the market.  The price is reasonable and good to have when traveling.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  When you don&#x27;t have time to wash all the products like hair spray out of your hair, all you have to do is spray it with the Revamp and it makes you hair feel clean with no buildup.  You can restyle it and it feels soft not full of products. Wish I could find this in a bigger can.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s easy to use and saves a hair-do.  I don&#x27;t understand why this product is difficult to find.  It is great for us lazy folks who don&#x27;t want to wash our hair everyday!  Wake up with &amp;#34;bed head&amp;#34; ?  Just spritz with Revamp, do a quick blow dry and you are good to go.</li>
            <li> Wish this was still available for purchase on Nick Chavez&#x27;s website because I love the way this product gives my hair body and hold on the second day after washing my hair.
