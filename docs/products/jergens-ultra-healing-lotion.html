            <li>Nice and smooth....................................................................................................................</li>
            <li>Gifted to my mom</li>
            <li>I love Jergens.  </li>
            <li>and I love the triple pack that is offered.</li>
            <li>I cannot express how much I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>Great item, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>How many times to I have to tell you.  </li>
            <li>and I love Jergens Ultra Healing Lotion.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Really love it.</li>
            <li>After that, I can say it does a pretty good job.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried many lotions and found this one, for us, to be superior for adults and especially children--- great value with quick shipping.</li>
            <li>It works well and has a nice mild scent, not overpowering like some body lotions.</li>
            <li>I love the price of the product and I love how smooth it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>They took a perfectly wonderful product and made it like every other product on the market that doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>(Loved the feel and smell) but I received the new formula in the tan/beige bottle which has &amp;#34;an illuminating Hydalucence blend&amp;#34; according to the package.</li>
            <li>Please make the  white/blue formula available.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic deal</li>
            <li>Nice, gentle scent.</li>
            <li>Nice and smooth, very silk like.</li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the old one.   </li>
            <li>I was hoping this was the original lotion....</li>
            <li>I wish Jergens would still offer the original stuff because I can&#x27;t find that anywhere.  </li>
            <li>Great, inexpensive lotion for winter dry skin.  </li>
            <li>and this was a good basic summer moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>but in front of the third lotion in the middle is a another one that is sort of a to go lotion size which is Awesome!</li>
            <li>What I got was the new &#x27;even better&#x27; cream colored bottles.  </li>
            <li>very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>gets all the right places feeling soft and sexy.  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; formula was so much better, better than any of the other body lotions You probably found a way to make it cheaper</li>
            <li>This is just right and doesn&#x27;t clash with perfume.</li>
            <li>Simply the most effective daily moisturizer out there.</li>
            <li>I have used it religiously for many years, loving the way it moisturized fully but went on light and dried quickly.  </li>
            <li>I did not want the &#x27;new&#x27;!!!  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much Jergens!</li>
            <li>Moisturizes and leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Just recently I ordered and received Jergens Ultra Healing lotion and found that although many sites still show a picture of the original bottle (white), it is now a beige/gold color, and labeled \\&quot;Now Even Better\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>It came quick &amp; I was actually surprised to see 4 Lotions.</li>
            <li>I have a dry skin condition so this really does the work :)</li>
            <li>The pediatrician told me Eucerine, it did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>Purchasing them this way is much cheaper than a store where they could go for $10 each.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast but the product that I received was not the product shown in the picture.  </li>
            <li>The original photo was with the white bottles</li>
            <li>Using this daily, you will see a significant improvement in the health and appearance of your skin.</li>
            <li>I would have preferred to receive the original in the white bottles (which are shown in the picture)</li>
            <li>This is a product i have been using for sometime now, this particular one did not disappoint me.</li>
            <li>This is really good for extra dry skin, my son has eczema and this works wonders on his skin for daily use.</li>
            <li>and I received the new formula.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the smell of the new one</li>
            <li>With this new formula (added \\&quot;Hydralucence\\&quot;) I can no longer recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>What I saw and ordered was the original Jergens with the white bottle and blue caps.  </li>
            <li>You should picture what you actually have, so we know exactly what we are ordering!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In heaven with my skin is so soft!</li>
            <li>Old school stuff still works wonders for your skin</li>
            <li>My baby boy has baby soft skin again</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and moisturized all day.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling moisturized and soft for hours.</li>
            <li>Wanted the old Jergens in the picture.  </li>
            <li>I do use it occasionally, but they are mostly for my husband, who never wants any other brand but Jergens.  </li>
            <li>i had ordered 3 of the 3 pack ultra healing lotion in the blue /white container and received instead the new formula in the beige container.</li>
            <li>I ordered it from 2 different vendors who were advertising the white/blue containers and both shipped the new beige.</li>
            <li>This product really does heal dry skin.</li>
            <li>The dermatologist prescribed Desonide, it barely worked at all.</li>
            <li>His skin is back to being baby soft.</li>
            <li>This lotion really does heal the rough skin especially in the winter with the heat on.  </li>
            <li>No rough patches, no itching and no red patches.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This lotion really does heal the rough skin especially in the winter with the heat on.  </li>
            <li> No rough patches, no itching and no red patches.</li>
            <li> It is the only lotion that takes care of my dry skin without leaving a greasy residue.  </li>
            <li> I will buy this lotion for as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thicker and stickier, and therefore takes a very long time to really dry.  </li>
            <li> It has always kept my skin from being dry.  </li>
            <li> I use it every single day.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> and so do all my friends and so do the reviews of other customers.</li>
            <li> so I am using allot less Jergens</li>
            <li> Disappointed in receiving the new one when I ordered the old formula.</li>
            <li> I hate the new formula and tried desperately to find the old one without any success.</li>
            <li> My father always asked me to buy the lotion from this brand since I was a little</li>
            <li> One of the few formulas that work for me during the winter.</li>
            <li> The lotion is thick and absorbs well.  </li>
            <li> I tried Aveeno, Cetaphil, and a slew of other expensive brands and nothing touched his eczema.</li>
            <li> Very subtle scent.</li>
            <li> It is NOT better!!!  </li>
            <li> My son had nasty, red and itchy eczema patches on his skin.</li>
            <li> You never can go wrong with Jergens - and it smells like when my mother and my grandmother used.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Lots</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed if you purchase this</li>
            <li> and now it&#x27;s crap.</li>
            <li> The winter months are brutal on skin.  </li>
            <li> It is awful -does not penetrate  - stays on the skin and feels greasy.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> i had ordered 3 of the 3 pack ultra healing lotion in the blue /white container and received instead the new formula in the beige container. I hate the new formula and tried desperately to find the old one without any success. the picture is not what I received.. I ordered it from 2 different vendors who were advertising the white/blue containers and both shipped the new beige. You label it &amp;#34;New IMPROVED&amp;#34; formula I tend to differ and so do all my friends and so do the reviews of other customers.It is awful -does not penetrate  - stays on the skin and feels greasy. The &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; formula was so much better, better than any of the other body lotions You probably found a way to make it cheaper and now it&#x27;s crap. Please make the  white/blue formula available.</li>
            <li> Old school stuff still works wonders for your skin</li>
            <li> Always use this brand.</li>
            <li> My son had nasty, red and itchy eczema patches on his skin. The pediatrician told me Eucerine, it did absolutely nothing. The dermatologist prescribed Desonide, it barely worked at all. I tried Aveeno, Cetaphil, and a slew of other expensive brands and nothing touched his eczema. I tried this lotion and was blown away at the results after just 1 use. His skin is back to being baby soft. No rough patches, no itching and no red patches. My baby boy has baby soft skin again and I have Jergens to thank for it. I will buy this lotion for as long as they make it. Thank you so much Jergens!</li>
            <li> You never can go wrong with Jergens - and it smells like when my mother and my grandmother used.  So with each use memories abound.  Works great, smells good without being overpowering!!!!  Just love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Very good product, exactly what estamaos was expecting, it was very good purchase, and we have used and are fantastic, thanks</li>

            <li> when you need lotion, this is it.  gets all the right places feeling soft and sexy.  yeah... this is THE goto lotion.  can you dig it?</li>
            <li> What I saw and ordered was the original Jergens with the white bottle and blue caps.  What I got was the new &#x27;even better&#x27; cream colored bottles.  I did not want the &#x27;new&#x27;!!!  It is NOT better!!!  They took a perfectly wonderful product and made it like every other product on the market that doesn&#x27;t work.  Why a company would do that is just beyond reason..So I did not want the &amp;#34;new and &#x27;so called&#x27; improved&amp;#34;.  I was hoping to find some of their originals, which is what was shown in the listing.  You should picture what you actually have, so we know exactly what we are ordering!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Thank You,  Lois</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and I love this lotion! The price is great too for the amount you get!</li>
            <li> Gifted to my mom and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I love Jergens.  It is the only lotion that takes care of my dry skin without leaving a greasy residue.  I have used Jergens for years and I love the triple pack that is offered.</li>
            <li> I cannot express how much I love this lotion. It is the ONLY lotion I will buy at a store like Wal-Mart, Target etc. It smells very good (but not the cherry almond smell...it doesn&#x27;t sit well with me for some reason) and does not leave a sticky residue on my skin. It leaves my skin feeling moisturized and soft for hours. Using this daily, you will see a significant improvement in the health and appearance of your skin. It is a great lotion for the price and amount of product you get. You will not be disappointed if you purchase this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Price- get you a lot of product for the price&lt;br /&gt;2. Smells nice&lt;br /&gt;3. Moisturizes and leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. The Cherry-Almond smell is not my favorite...at all.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.  Will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell!  Is affordable and keeps my body moist.  I would definitely purchase this again!  I also want to try the cherry flavor!</li>
            <li> The lotion is thick and absorbs well.  The winter months are brutal on skin.  This is just right and doesn&#x27;t clash with perfume. Purchasing them this way is much cheaper than a store where they could go for $10 each.</li>
            <li> This is a good value for the price over most stores.  I do use it occasionally, but they are mostly for my husband, who never wants any other brand but Jergens.  He says to him it is the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy. It came quick &amp; I was actually surprised to see 4 Lotions. I guess I didn&#x27;t read the description fully but in front of the third lotion in the middle is a another one that is sort of a to go lotion size which is Awesome! Thanks!</li>
            <li> My Mom loves this lotion. Couldn&#x27;t pass up this 3 piece set. And great price for all three !!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product and great price and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast but the product that I received was not the product shown in the picture.  I would have preferred to receive the original in the white bottles (which are shown in the picture) (Loved the feel and smell) but I received the new formula in the tan/beige bottle which has &amp;#34;an illuminating Hydalucence blend&amp;#34; according to the package. I don&#x27;t like the smell of the new one and it seems a bit greasy to me.</li>
            <li> One of the few formulas that work for me during the winter.</li>
            <li> Wanted the old Jergens in the picture.  Not the re-formulated version</li>
            <li> Great item, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Great love this lotion def worth it</li>
            <li> How many times to I have to tell you.  This is a fantastic deal and I love Jergens Ultra Healing Lotion.</li>
            <li> Ive been using the stuff for years.  It has always kept my skin from being dry.  I recently purchased a water softener for the home so I am using allot less Jergens but I still need it.  I use it every single day.</li>
            <li> Simply the most effective daily moisturizer out there. This product really does heal dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many otc body lotions, and have found that Jergens Ultra Healing Lotion moisturized my skin the best.  the moisturized effect lasts for about 48 hours, so it&#x27;s also cost effective.</li>
            <li> Great, inexpensive lotion for winter dry skin.  Stock up with this 3 pack.</li>
            <li> Great value. Very subtle scent. I have very dry skin and this was a good basic summer moisturizer.  Never irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a product i have been using for sometime now, this particular one did not disappoint me. I love it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Lots of it and a great product. Non greasy.</li>
            <li> My father always asked me to buy the lotion from this brand since I was a little girl.&lt;br /&gt;Really love it. Perfect lotion.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy this its not a deal</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried many lotions and found this one, for us, to be superior for adults and especially children--- great value with quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for years.  It works well and has a nice mild scent, not overpowering like some body lotions.</li>
            <li> Nice, gentle scent. Keeps us moisturized throughout the day without leaving a greasy feeling. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this was the original lotion.... it is the newer one.  Picture does not match packaging.  Returned item with no problem</li>
            <li> In heaven with my skin is so soft!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product</li>
            <li> I wrote a 5-star review for this product maybe a year ago or so.  I have used it religiously for many years, loving the way it moisturized fully but went on light and dried quickly.  Just recently I ordered and received Jergens Ultra Healing lotion and found that although many sites still show a picture of the original bottle (white), it is now a beige/gold color, and labeled \\&quot;Now Even Better\\&quot;.  NOT!!!  With this new formula (added \\&quot;Hydralucence\\&quot;) I can no longer recommend this product.  It&#x27;s thicker and stickier, and therefore takes a very long time to really dry.  After that, I can say it does a pretty good job.  But it doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the old one.   I wish Jergens would still offer the original stuff because I can&#x27;t find that anywhere.  I&#x27;ve got to find something else now.</li>
