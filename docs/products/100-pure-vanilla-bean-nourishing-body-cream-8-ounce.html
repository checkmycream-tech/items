            <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE this lotion!</li>
            <li>I loved how they were rich yet didn&#x27;t leave residue on my skin.</li>
            <li>Smells great and really moisturizes!</li>
            <li>and it applies nicely and smoothly.</li>
            <li>This tube is coming with me : )</li>
            <li>Scents are subjective, but I love the smell of this product.  </li>
            <li>I have eczema and I am allergic to many skin products.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Really in love this this  cream</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how else to put what this cream does into words but its fantastic!</li>
            <li>OK for the money....</li>
            <li>My skin sort of wanted more of it....</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and so does my daughter.</li>
            <li>Love love love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>Rather than sugar cookies, I mostly notice the cocoa butter scent which is pleasing to me.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the smell</li>
            <li>and I would describe it as more of a home spun vanilla cookie scent as oppose to a sexy night on the town vanilla scent.</li>
            <li>Love this body cream.</li>
            <li>Love all your products</li>
            <li>so I tried once more</li>
            <li>In the AM and PM is where I top out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love the smell of the vanilla bean.  </li>
            <li>love love love this cream.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s smooth, creamy, and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>it smells more like caramel than vanilla.  </li>
            <li>The smell is okay, and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll do what it&#x27;s supposed to, but it&#x27;s a thicker lotion</li>
            <li>I really love this product.  </li>
            <li>love the smell and feel of this lotion but not the fact that it still contains paraben.</li>
            <li>I love the product and the consistency.  </li>
            <li>It smells a bit strong when you first put it on, but by the time I leave the house it smells great and is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>But what I was searching for was something that smelled like rich vanilla, no musk but just yummy warm vanilla.  </li>
            <li>My ultra sensitive skin has reacted great to this product and I can even use it on my face.  </li>
            <li>love the light aroma &amp; thickness of the cream.  </li>
            <li>but I was not overly satisfied, not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Lovely soothing hand lotion with a beautiful vanilla scent that lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a strong vanilla scent, this is not your product.</li>
            <li>The previous tube I bought (not through Amazon) had a wonderful vanilla bean scent.  </li>
            <li>It is a pleasant and natural scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel really smooth.</li>
            <li>This cream has a light vanilla scent and is smooth and creamy just like name implies.</li>
            <li>and it feels silky and smooth on your skin.  </li>
            <li>I went back and bought 3 more and am giving 1 for a birthday gift to one of my good friends.  </li>
            <li>The sweet vanilla smell is so pleasant and natural.</li>
            <li>prefer Ecco Bella original organic water free vanilla body lotion.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly, smells delicious, and keeps my skin moist in harsh weather.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find a expiration date on the cream, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it expired a while ago.  </li>
            <li>Great for dry skin.</li>
            <li>I use to wear this cream back when it was still available in a lotion &amp;#34;pump&amp;#34; bottle, when I first tried it it had a strong plastic smell that nearly masks the strength of  the wonderful sweet vanilla fragrance I&#x27;d been accustomed to .</li>
            <li>I love 100% Pure</li>
            <li>The moisture lasts a full day.</li>
            <li>It definitely does smell like sugar cookies, but in a good way.</li>
            <li>It smells something like burnt sugar, but not bad.</li>
            <li>The smell is not over powering, right when you put it on you can smell it, it&#x27;s a light smell after a bit I don&#x27;t smell it unless I put my hands up to my nose.</li>
            <li>Never sticky, blends in quickly.</li>
            <li>will have to rob a bank to feed my habit though as i go through a tube fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>The lotion is thicker than most lotions I have used before, more similar to hand cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a HUGE plus that it&#x27;s 100% Pure.</li>
            <li>I got a free sample of this cream when I ordered some products from 100% Pure</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not particularly moisturizing, but it&#x27;s a nice light lotion for summer time.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural and non-greasy.</li>
            <li>This lotion is worth what you pay for and I will be buying again.  </li>
            <li>And love that is all natural</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s natural.  </li>
            <li>so so, I loved the smell of one, while the other was just so so.</li>
            <li>I rub it on right out of the shower to lock in moisture and make application easier.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been switching off between these two and am just the right amount of moisturized for the season.</li>
            <li>The scent smells like vanilla to me and it goes right into my skin with no grease.  </li>
            <li>This product smells clean and light and more like a sugar cookie (as one of the other reviewers said.)  </li>
            <li>I went straight online to amazon to buy the full sized version.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend and very rarely ever give anything 5 stars</li>
            <li>I found pure organic vanilla bean very nourishing and smooth with application.  </li>
            <li>Buttery and feels healthy, however the scent is not as strong as other vanilla body creams from bodycology or body works.  </li>
            <li>It is creamy, but light and absorbs into my skin with a lasting scent and smooth feel.</li>
            <li>I am pretty sensitive to most scented body products and I have to be very particular about what I use.  </li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t matter because it fades quickly.</li>
            <li>The body cream itself is thick and lovely, makes my skin feel really nice.</li>
            <li>The only complaints that I have for the product is that the smell is very, very strong and the price is a bit to much.</li>
            <li>Im pretty liberal when it comes to these things too....</li>
            <li>I order more of this when I&#x27;m getting low, even if I have 12 others on hand.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, moisturizes well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my overly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is all natural ingredients and the ingredients are exotic and not in many other products.  </li>
            <li>Great quality lotion with a subtle vanilla scent.</li>
            <li>If you are at all sensitive to strong fragrances, steer clear!</li>
            <li>I like 100% Pure items.</li>
            <li>I bought three creams from 100 Pure (Apple, Coconut, and Vanilla).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick and absorbs pretty good, and makes my skin so soft!!!</li>
            <li>Kind of heavy for us older girls who sweat with hot flashes.</li>
            <li>Really moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li>also thought the lotion was very watery</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not game to rub lotion on myself</li>
            <li>Sometimes I think my husband wants to eat me too.</li>
            <li>I really like this cream.</li>
            <li>This was our first attempt to find a suitable replacement and unfortunately, this is a much &amp;#34;drier&amp;#34; lotion, requiring her to use much more of it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely could not stand it and had to wash it off immediately.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky about smells and how the cream absorbs.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and soft and its all natural.  </li>
            <li>I read the ingredients and they are all real and high quality.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing - rich and completely moisturizing; smells great without being too heavy or perfumey; devoid of scary toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li>If you have really dry skin, this will fix it right up!</li>
            <li>so I limit where I apply it on my body, but overall, I love that it helps relieve my dry skin</li>
            <li>but once on your skin, it&#x27;s not overwhelming and the scent remains most of the day.</li>
            <li>One of the things she liked about the defunct Body Shop lotion was the consistency and how a little went a long way.</li>
            <li>I got a sample of this at my local 100% Pure store.  </li>
            <li>so it didnt absorb completely.</li>
            <li>Skin is so soft.</li>
            <li>Really want to try the coconut one next.</li>
            <li>I have tried plenty and like the way they keep me soft and scented.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li>It absorbs better than any thick lotion I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Like with other 100% Pure products, I adore the high quality of the creme.</li>
            <li>For an all natural lotion it isn&#x27;t runny or liquidy its thick and smooth.</li>
            <li>My husband has incredibly sensitive skin and eczema, and this is now the only thing he uses.</li>
            <li>The scent is fantastic, and the consistency of the cream is thick and luxurious.  </li>
            <li>I found it a little bit cheaper on Amazon vs going directly to 100% Pure website.  </li>
            <li>When I bought it a second time it was still creamy but the scent was barely there.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick, rich, and the scent lasts a long time.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> will have to rob a bank to feed my habit though as i go through a tube fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> The lotion is thicker than most lotions I have used before, more similar to hand cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a HUGE plus that it&#x27;s 100% Pure.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this cream when I ordered some products from 100% Pure</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not particularly moisturizing, but it&#x27;s a nice light lotion for summer time.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural and non-greasy.</li>
            <li> This lotion is worth what you pay for and I will be buying again.  </li>
            <li> And love that is all natural</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s natural.  </li>
            <li> so so, I loved the smell of one, while the other was just so so.</li>
            <li> I rub it on right out of the shower to lock in moisture and make application easier.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been switching off between these two and am just the right amount of moisturized for the season.</li>
            <li> The scent smells like vanilla to me and it goes right into my skin with no grease.  </li>
            <li> This product smells clean and light and more like a sugar cookie (as one of the other reviewers said.)  </li>
            <li> I went straight online to amazon to buy the full sized version.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend and very rarely ever give anything 5 stars</li>
            <li> I found pure organic vanilla bean very nourishing and smooth with application.  </li>
            <li> Buttery and feels healthy, however the scent is not as strong as other vanilla body creams from bodycology or body works.  </li>
            <li> It is creamy, but light and absorbs into my skin with a lasting scent and smooth feel.</li>
            <li> I am pretty sensitive to most scented body products and I have to be very particular about what I use.  </li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t matter because it fades quickly.</li>
            <li> The body cream itself is thick and lovely, makes my skin feel really nice.</li>
            <li> The only complaints that I have for the product is that the smell is very, very strong and the price is a bit to much.</li>
            <li> Im pretty liberal when it comes to these things too....</li>
            <li> I order more of this when I&#x27;m getting low, even if I have 12 others on hand.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, moisturizes well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my overly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is all natural ingredients and the ingredients are exotic and not in many other products.  </li>
            <li> Great quality lotion with a subtle vanilla scent.</li>
            <li> If you are at all sensitive to strong fragrances, steer clear!</li>
            <li> I like 100% Pure items.</li>
            <li> I bought three creams from 100 Pure (Apple, Coconut, and Vanilla).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and absorbs pretty good, and makes my skin so soft!!!</li>
            <li> Kind of heavy for us older girls who sweat with hot flashes.</li>
            <li> Really moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li> also thought the lotion was very watery</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not game to rub lotion on myself</li>
            <li> Sometimes I think my husband wants to eat me too.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream.</li>
            <li> This was our first attempt to find a suitable replacement and unfortunately, this is a much &amp;#34;drier&amp;#34; lotion, requiring her to use much more of it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely could not stand it and had to wash it off immediately.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky about smells and how the cream absorbs.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and soft and its all natural.  </li>
            <li> I read the ingredients and they are all real and high quality.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing - rich and completely moisturizing; smells great without being too heavy or perfumey; devoid of scary toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li> If you have really dry skin, this will fix it right up!</li>
            <li> so I limit where I apply it on my body, but overall, I love that it helps relieve my dry skin</li>
            <li> but once on your skin, it&#x27;s not overwhelming and the scent remains most of the day.</li>
            <li> One of the things she liked about the defunct Body Shop lotion was the consistency and how a little went a long way.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this at my local 100% Pure store.  </li>
            <li> so it didnt absorb completely.</li>
            <li> Skin is so soft.</li>
            <li> Really want to try the coconut one next.</li>
            <li> I have tried plenty and like the way they keep me soft and scented.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li> It absorbs better than any thick lotion I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Like with other 100% Pure products, I adore the high quality of the creme.</li>
            <li> For an all natural lotion it isn&#x27;t runny or liquidy its thick and smooth.</li>
            <li> My husband has incredibly sensitive skin and eczema, and this is now the only thing he uses.</li>
            <li> The scent is fantastic, and the consistency of the cream is thick and luxurious.  </li>
            <li> I found it a little bit cheaper on Amazon vs going directly to 100% Pure website.  </li>
            <li> When I bought it a second time it was still creamy but the scent was barely there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, rich, and the scent lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It works really well on typical dry skin.</li>
            <li> I am also extremely health conscious and do not use any products with harmful chemicals</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised at other reviews that were not 5 stars  </li>
            <li> I will continue to buy other items from this company as long as they do not contain  natural paraben such as japanese honeysuckle.  </li>
            <li> love the idea behind the ingredients, but its not free.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever go back to any other cream.</li>
            <li> doesnt smell like VANILLA, more like a butterscotch coffee scent (which isnt bad)</li>
            <li> Very fragrant but in a natural way, not an artificial way.</li>
            <li> just not what i expected</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I usually have to cut the bottle open and transfer the lotion into a tub to use it.</li>
            <li> It is extremely fragrant and overpowering.  </li>
            <li> But other than that I would by the product again and recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> Unlike other organic products out there, these lotion don&#x27;t smell stale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Price knocked it down a bit.....to a 55.</li>
            <li> I want to try the other scents out to!</li>
            <li> This body cream is extremely sensual!</li>
            <li> and I have bought other products from them in the past.</li>
            <li> And I get little whiffs of it throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Ecco Bella is a little much twice a day in the muggy summer heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint being that it&#x27;s hard to get out of the bottle with the supplied pump.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> not sure i like the scent.  </li>
            <li> The 2 I ordered and received have no scent at all - except a rather dull, &amp;#34;expired&amp;#34; type of scent.  </li>
            <li> Meaning it does take a little longer to rub in than a thin lotion.</li>
            <li> They were all thick, opaque, and creamy.</li>
            <li> I mix with coconut oil to conserve since it&#x27;s so thick and creamy,</li>
            <li> Wishing for a real aroma, without the nasty perfume?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I was instantly addicted.</li>
            <li> But it would be unfair if I don&#x27;t rate this vanilla bean nourishing cream too because it is soooo</li>
            <li> Im obsessed.</li>
            <li> It is just as bad for our bodies whether it is made in a lab or found in nature parabens</li>
            <li> are bad news.</li>
            <li> was disappointed with the scent of the lotion.</li>
            <li> Hated the smell - should have listened to another reviewer about that issue.  </li>
            <li> and unfortunately I&#x27;m very disappointed once again.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Smells great and really moisturizes! Kind of heavy for us older girls who sweat with hot flashes.</li>
            <li> Like with other 100% Pure products, I adore the high quality of the creme. It has a very strong smell so I limit where I apply it on my body, but overall, I love that it helps relieve my dry skin and it applies nicely and smoothly. It absorbs beautifully, too!</li>
            <li> This lotion smells amazing!!! It&#x27;s thick and absorbs pretty good, and makes my skin so soft!!! I&#x27;m definitly buying more when I run out!! The smell is not over powering, right when you put it on you can smell it, it&#x27;s a light smell after a bit I don&#x27;t smell it unless I put my hands up to my nose. I want to try the other scents out to! Going to the beach this June! This tube is coming with me : )</li>
            <li> Great quality lotion with a subtle vanilla scent. I love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural and non-greasy. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Scents are subjective, but I love the smell of this product.  I have eczema and I am allergic to many skin products.  My ultra sensitive skin has reacted great to this product and I can even use it on my face.  This works great at moisturizing my skin.  It is all natural ingredients and the ingredients are exotic and not in many other products.  This lotion is worth what you pay for and I will be buying again.  I like this company and I have bought other products from them in the past.</li>
            <li> Wishing for a real aroma, without the nasty perfume?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the solution, smell and feels great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really in love this this  cream</li>
            <li> Loved this lotion. Very fragrant but in a natural way, not an artificial way. Really moisturizes very well. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I just gave the acne product I bought from this line 2stars,well because it didn&#x27;t work! But it would be unfair if I don&#x27;t rate this vanilla bean nourishing cream too because it is soooo good!!!This is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried,it leaves my skin looking and feeling like silk! As soon as I put it on my pores seems to just disappear leaving a glasslike look on my skin! I don&#x27;t know how else to put what this cream does into words but its fantastic! I don&#x27;t think anyone can regret buying it!</li>
            <li> Smell varies....bought 2 of them.....its so so, I loved the smell of one, while the other was just so so. OK for the money....love the idea behind the ingredients, but its not free. My skin sort of wanted more of it....so it didnt absorb completely. I give it a 65 out of 100.....regardless of price. Price knocked it down a bit.....to a 55. Im pretty liberal when it comes to these things too....but I was not overly satisfied, not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and so does my daughter. It&#x27;s thick, rich, and the scent lasts a long time. It works really well on typical dry skin. Even an hour after I apply it I can still smell it, but it&#x27;s not overpowering. It smells a lot like sugar cookies.</li>
            <li> Love love love this lotion.  Smells amazing, really hydrates my skin and great for my body!!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It is creamy, but light and absorbs into my skin with a lasting scent and smooth feel. Rather than sugar cookies, I mostly notice the cocoa butter scent which is pleasing to me.</li>
            <li> Buttery and feels healthy, however the scent is not as strong as other vanilla body creams from bodycology or body works.  Scent is very light and pleasant. If you are looking for a strong vanilla scent, this is not your product.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift, shes seemed to like it so I think it&#x27;s a good product with a good price.</li>
            <li> I am pretty sensitive to most scented body products and I have to be very particular about what I use.  I found pure organic vanilla bean very nourishing and smooth with application.  I enjoyed the smell and I would describe it as more of a home spun vanilla cookie scent as oppose to a sexy night on the town vanilla scent.</li>
            <li> Hated the smell - should have listened to another reviewer about that issue.  Threw it out.</li>
            <li> Love this body cream. Smells wonderful like cotton candy to me. Never sticky, blends in quickly. Skin is so soft. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I use to wear this cream back when it was still available in a lotion &amp;#34;pump&amp;#34; bottle, when I first tried it it had a strong plastic smell that nearly masks the strength of  the wonderful sweet vanilla fragrance I&#x27;d been accustomed to . Hopefully it was just this one bottle- I plan on buying the body butter instead from now on.</li>
            <li> Im obsessed. The smell is heavenly. For an all natural lotion it isn&#x27;t runny or liquidy its thick and smooth. Will never go back to different lotion. Really want to try the coconut one next. Thank you 100% Pure!!!!!!! Love all your products</li>
            <li> was disappointed with the scent of the lotion. did not smell like the yummy vanilla scent that was reviewed. also thought the lotion was very watery</li>
            <li> The first time I bought this product I loved it for it&#x27;s creaminess and very beautiful vanilla scent. When I bought it a second time it was still creamy but the scent was barely there. I thought it may have been a fluke so I tried once more and unfortunately I&#x27;m very disappointed once again. There is no vanilla scent and in fact it smells like play doh to me. I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> This body cream is extremely sensual! It goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly, smells delicious, and keeps my skin moist in harsh weather. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I have ordered this before and it smelled wonderful.  This time the product arrived and it smells rancid!  I can&#x27;t find a expiration date on the cream, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it expired a while ago.  Need to send it back!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 3 months. It is pricely but if you have allergic problems to creams or break out problems this stuff seems to be a miracle. I am happy with this and I continue to buy.</li>
            <li> it smells great, has all good stuff in it, and feels really nice on the skin. All around good purchase.</li>
            <li> The smell, which doesn&#x27;t last much longer than it takes to rub it on, reminds me of whipped cream made with a few drops of vanilla. It is a pleasant and natural scent.&lt;br /&gt;It is not particularly moisturizing, but it&#x27;s a nice light lotion for summer time. I&#x27;m not sure I will purchase it again. I find, if I don&#x27;t supplement this lotion, I want to reapply it once or twice a day to stay hydrated. I&#x27;m not game to rub lotion on myself 3-4x a day. In the AM and PM is where I top out.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer Ecco Bella original organic water free vanilla body lotion. The sweet vanilla smell is so pleasant and natural. And I get little whiffs of it throughout the day. The moisture lasts a full day. My only complaint being that it&#x27;s hard to get out of the bottle with the supplied pump. I usually have to cut the bottle open and transfer the lotion into a tub to use it. Meaning it does take a little longer to rub in than a thin lotion. I rub it on right out of the shower to lock in moisture and make application easier. It absorbs better than any thick lotion I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s the perfect winter lotion. Ecco Bella is a little much twice a day in the muggy summer heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been switching off between these two and am just the right amount of moisturized for the season.</li>
            <li> The previous tube I bought (not through Amazon) had a wonderful vanilla bean scent.  The 2 I ordered and received have no scent at all - except a rather dull, &amp;#34;expired&amp;#34; type of scent.  I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Started using this a couple months ago.  Love the smell of the vanilla bean.  My skin feels smooth and soft and its all natural.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Good product. Recomended</li>
            <li> The scent is fantastic, and the consistency of the cream is thick and luxurious.  It makes my skin feel really smooth.</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling lotion ever!</li>
            <li> I like 100% Pure items. I have tried plenty and like the way they keep me soft and scented. Sometimes I think my husband wants to eat me too. Great scents, great moisture, and it&#x27;s natural. Go figure!?!</li>
            <li> love love love this cream.  will have to rob a bank to feed my habit though as i go through a tube fairly quickly.  love the light aroma &amp; thickness of the cream.  wish it was a bit cheaper though</li>
            <li> This vanilla lotion smells so good and it works great, too! I will def purchase this the vanilla scent again!</li>
            <li> I love 100% Pure so when I saw I could get this cream on Prime I was thrilled! This cream has a light vanilla scent and is smooth and creamy just like name implies. It&#x27;s a HUGE plus that it&#x27;s 100% Pure.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this lotion! It&#x27;s amazingly perfect...it&#x27;s smooth, creamy, and smells amazing. Just love it! Do something nice for yourself and buy it now!</li>
            <li> It smells so good and it feels silky and smooth on your skin.  If you have really dry skin, this will fix it right up!</li>
            <li> I really like this cream. The scent is sweet...kind of a mix btwn vanilla and cotton candy...but once on your skin, it&#x27;s not overwhelming and the scent remains most of the day.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to body cream. I used to dislike the scent, but I have become used to it, I guess. It smells something like burnt sugar, but not bad. It really doesn&#x27;t matter because it fades quickly. The body cream itself is thick and lovely, makes my skin feel really nice. I sometimes combine this one with one of the others. I order more of this when I&#x27;m getting low, even if I have 12 others on hand. I don&#x27;t want to be without this one.</li>
            <li> not sure i like the scent.  it smells more like caramel than vanilla.  it does feel very nice and smooth</li>
            <li> Received in a sample with Birchbox and just love, love the feel and scent! And love that is all natural</li>
            <li> I found it a little bit cheaper on Amazon vs going directly to 100% Pure website.  This is my all-time favorite lotion!  Goes on smooth, moisturizes well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my overly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My wife was looking for a replacement for a body lotion she&#x27;d used for years, but was discontinued. One of the things she liked about the defunct Body Shop lotion was the consistency and how a little went a long way. This was our first attempt to find a suitable replacement and unfortunately, this is a much &amp;#34;drier&amp;#34; lotion, requiring her to use much more of it. The smell is okay, and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll do what it&#x27;s supposed to, but it&#x27;s a thicker lotion that&#x27;s closer to a salve or creme. Meh.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this at my local 100% Pure store.  It is extremely fragrant and overpowering.  I absolutely could not stand it and had to wash it off immediately.  If you like perfume-y lotions, you will probably adore this.  If you are at all sensitive to strong fragrances, steer clear!</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this cream when I ordered some products from 100% Pure and I was instantly addicted. I went straight online to amazon to buy the full sized version. The smell is sooo yummy that everyone always asks me about it. I am also extremely health conscious and do not use any products with harmful chemicals so this product is perfect for me. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever go back to any other cream.</li>
            <li> This cream is very silky and absorbs great into the skin, not to mention how great it is for your skin. The only complaints that I have for the product is that the smell is very, very strong and the price is a bit to much. But other than that I would by the product again and recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  Wonderful ingredients.  The lotion is thicker than most lotions I have used before, more similar to hand cream. Great for dry skin. It smells a bit strong when you first put it on, but by the time I leave the house it smells great and is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Japanese honeysuckle &#x3D; paraben&lt;br /&gt;Look it up if you don&#x27;t be me.... love the smell and feel of this lotion but not the fact that it still contains paraben. I will continue to buy other items from this company as long as they do not contain  natural paraben such as japanese honeysuckle.  It is just as bad for our bodies whether it is made in a lab or found in nature parabens are bad news.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky about smells and how the cream absorbs.  The scent smells like vanilla to me and it goes right into my skin with no grease.  I&#x27;m surprised at other reviews that were not 5 stars  I went back and bought 3 more and am giving 1 for a birthday gift to one of my good friends.  I would highly recommend and very rarely ever give anything 5 stars</li>
            <li> I bought three creams from 100 Pure (Apple, Coconut, and Vanilla). I loved how they were rich yet didn&#x27;t leave residue on my skin. They were all thick, opaque, and creamy. I read the ingredients and they are all real and high quality. No synthetic fillers or any sort. Unlike other organic products out there, these lotion don&#x27;t smell stale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say this smells like vanilla mixed with coffee. It definitely does smell like sugar cookies, but in a good way. It&#x27;s not overpowering.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing - rich and completely moisturizing; smells great without being too heavy or perfumey; devoid of scary toxic ingredients. My husband has incredibly sensitive skin and eczema, and this is now the only thing he uses.</li>
            <li> doesnt smell like VANILLA, more like a butterscotch coffee scent (which isnt bad) just not what i expected</li>
            <li> Lovely soothing hand lotion with a beautiful vanilla scent that lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I received this product as a sample in beauty subscription. Loved it and bought. Smells delicious! I mix with coconut oil to conserve since it&#x27;s so thick and creamy,</li>
            <li> I love the product and the consistency.  Love that it&#x27;s natural.  But what I was searching for was something that smelled like rich vanilla, no musk but just yummy warm vanilla.  This product smells clean and light and more like a sugar cookie (as one of the other reviewers said.)  Still yummy but I&#x27;ll still be searching for another product (probably Pacifica Island Vanilla which I&#x27;ve had before.)</li>
