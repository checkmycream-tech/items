            <li>I just love it!</li>

            <li>Just lovely.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t understand why many stores no longer carry this</li>
            <li>favorite smell</li>
            <li>My husband love this perfume.</li>
            <li>being said, it is fairly pleasant, though likely not the best for someone looking for a masculine scent.</li>
            <li>Mellow, yet masculine, Eau Sauvage is a great fragrance for every man.</li>
            <li>Nice a fresh.</li>
            <li>An oldies but goodies with a unique and refreshing smell.</li>
            <li>AND EASY TRANSACTION&lt;br /&gt;PACKAGED</li>
            <li>This is my father&#x27;s perfume, he doesn&#x27;t like strong scents</li>
            <li>Fabulous, I will order again.</li>
            <li>very light - says it should be worn in evening, but seems very much a day as well.  </li>
            <li>Being an over 60 man, I find the older brands of colognes much more appropriate than those geared toward 20-somethings.</li>
            <li>Love the classic smell!!</li>
            <li>He love this cologne very much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so fresh and  clean smelling!</li>
            <li>Not too stong; just right!</li>
            <li>&quot; way) and classic, confident and self-assured.</li>
            <li>hope it does not go to quickly</li>
            <li>I have wore Christian Dior for over 30 years and it is a very elegant cologne.</li>
            <li>Light, a bit sweet (not too much), and not overbearing at all.  </li>
            <li>Something about it is just so classic, so elegant, so sophisticated and memorable that it makes it extremely enticing.</li>
            <li>It is a fantastic, fresh, authentic and traditional perfum.</li>
            <li>At first it&#x27;s a bit strong and striking, but as time progresses I can smell different \\&quot;themes\\</li>
            <li>Great daily fragrance for a guy who wants to smell good only to those who are lucky enough to get close to him!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m female, but this has been my very favorite fragrance for as long as I can remember (sort of citrusy and sandalwoody but not too strong).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad you&#x27;re back.</li>
            <li>First time I had it was some 30 years ago.</li>
            <li>A long time favorite of mine.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with the original scent scent when I happened upon a small bottle that belonged to my grandfather.</li>
            <li>I really do prefer 212 men on him...</li>
            <li>Very sensual.  </li>
            <li>Rarely use, has been my only cologne sine college--fresh citrus scent, not too sweet; masculine.</li>
            <li>Although a classic, there are pretty cheap rip offs available in the market for less than $2 which spoil the overall impact!!!</li>
            <li>The scent has become far too flowery and light, and reminiscent of talc, which can be had for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>This one is a classic and my husband has been using it for over 10 years and still saves it for occasions.  </li>
            <li>A men&#x27;s classic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is classic citrus with a hint of floral currents...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a classic -- one of the classiest colognes for men, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to characterize exactly what I find appealing about this smell.</li>
            <li>and &#x27;ol Christian was right there with me.</li>
            <li>Really like all the notes - top, middle, and bass.</li>
            <li>Perhaps those descriptions for a scent seem asinine, but to me, this scent is just so classy and classic.</li>
            <li>It is very classy.  </li>
            <li>Rare to find and stays for a long time...</li>
            <li>Not a true original product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an old fragrance by Dior and my wife and others always ask me what I have on my face?</li>
            <li>and this is the only one he ever used because it is very subtle and pleasant.</li>
            <li>but, when he wears this fragrance, it&#x27;s like we&#x27;re back in high</li>
            <li>While some scents exude sexiness, I don&#x27;t find that to be the case with this scent - I find it to be mature (but not necessarily in the \\&quot;old man\\</li>
            <li>yet discrete enough to say \\&quot;I am gentle and bring flowers, champagne, and back rubs to my lover\\&quot;.......  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t go wrong with these old school colognes, there really clean and fresh smelling and no one else will be wearing it, you can count on that.</li>
            <li>I am not sure this is the original one though.</li>
            <li>Once it settles on the skin, this scent is subtle yet distinct and could certainly serve as a signature scent.</li>
            <li>It was masculine, fresh, and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>yet they carry every Hip hop, NBA, movie star overpriced iteration of the same old \\&quot;watermelon meets rotten leather\\</li>
            <li>Absolutely what I expected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not cheap, but it&#x27;s worth every dollar that I spend on it.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I fell in love with the original scent scent when I happened upon a small bottle that belonged to my grandfather. It was masculine, fresh, and not overwhelming. Since then, this scent has changed. I had purchased a bottle, and was extremely disappointed when I tried it. The scent has become far too flowery and light, and reminiscent of talc, which can be had for a fraction of the cost. If you&#x27;re looking to find a piece of the past, this is not it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it is fairly pleasant, though likely not the best for someone looking for a masculine scent.</li>
            <li> This is spring in a bottle. This is one of my top 5 for spring and is one of the best from Dior.</li>
            <li> No doubt one of the best fragrances for men, quite and not invasive.... very distinctive. Get complements all the time.</li>
            <li> When I met my husband (back in the 80&#x27;s), this was the fragrance he was using at that time... I decided to give him this gift for Valentine&#x27;s Day.  Oh boy!  I forgot how good this smells... A fresh, citrusy scent that is good to wear any day of the week.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and not too strong.  I am not sure this is the original one though.</li>
            <li> This one is a classic and my husband has been using it for over 10 years and still saves it for occasions.  Hands down a winner.Lasts all day long.  I really do prefer 212 men on him...but he prefers this..He is the one wearing it...So might as well be his choice.</li>
            <li> My cologne for more than 50 years</li>
            <li> Found this cologne for my hubby when we lived in England in the&lt;br /&gt;early nineties.  And never could find it when we moved back to the States.&lt;br /&gt;He likes it...because I LOVE IT ON HIM!  Very sensual.  My hubby is in his&lt;br /&gt;70&#x27;s but, when he wears this fragrance, it&#x27;s like we&#x27;re back in high school.&lt;br /&gt;Need I say more!</li>
            <li> Ah—the 80&#x27;s. I knew them well and &#x27;ol Christian was right there with me. I&#x27;m glad you&#x27;re back.</li>
            <li> It is a fantastic, fresh, authentic and traditional perfum. I just love it! First time I had it was some 30 years ago. Unforgetable scent!</li>
            <li> Believe not original. Doesn&#x27;t smell the same. Package not good. Not a true original product.  I used cologne for years I now it</li>
            <li> Still the best.  A men&#x27;s classic.</li>
            <li> My husband is a Christian Dior Man ever since.He love this cologne very much.Thank you for making it affordable..</li>
            <li> Nice a fresh. Really like all the notes - top, middle, and bass. Only beef is the base note doesn&#x27;t really last that long so have to refresh.</li>
            <li> Girls love me when I wear it .</li>
            <li> Have used this for years and get compliments most days. Not too stong; just right!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to characterize exactly what I find appealing about this smell. Something about it is just so classic, so elegant, so sophisticated and memorable that it makes it extremely enticing. I find Eau Sauvage to have a nice longevity, and to my nose, it smells best on me after it settles for an hour or so on my skin. At first it&#x27;s a bit strong and striking, but as time progresses I can smell different \\&quot;themes\\&quot; in the scent, if that makes sense. While some scents exude sexiness, I don&#x27;t find that to be the case with this scent - I find it to be mature (but not necessarily in the \\&quot;old man\\&quot; way) and classic, confident and self-assured. Perhaps those descriptions for a scent seem asinine, but to me, this scent is just so classy and classic. Once it settles on the skin, this scent is subtle yet distinct and could certainly serve as a signature scent.</li>
            <li> very light - says it should be worn in evening, but seems very much a day as well.  Just lovely.</li>
            <li> This stalwart should be in EVERY man&#x27;s repertoire of grooming.  I can&#x27;t understand why many stores no longer carry this (\\&quot;they don&#x27;t make it anymore\\&quot;).... yet they carry every Hip hop, NBA, movie star overpriced iteration of the same old \\&quot;watermelon meets rotten leather\\&quot; smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is classic citrus with a hint of floral currents... buff enough to say \\&quot;I am a macho man\\&quot; yet discrete enough to say \\&quot;I am gentle and bring flowers, champagne, and back rubs to my lover\\&quot;.......  all I know my wife agrees..... and THAT is good enuf for me....</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with these old school colognes, there really clean and fresh smelling and no one else will be wearing it, you can count on that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m female, but this has been my very favorite fragrance for as long as I can remember (sort of citrusy and sandalwoody but not too strong).  It&#x27;s so fresh and  clean smelling!</li>
            <li> Using it for 40 years</li>
            <li> Rarely use, has been my only cologne sine college--fresh citrus scent, not too sweet; masculine.</li>
            <li> Since i remember, my dad always smelled like this spray.  It is still mine and my mothers favorite smell and I have considered purchasing it multiple times for myself.</li>
            <li> This was Christmas gift for my niece&#x27;s husband.  He (and she!) really liked it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a classic -- one of the classiest colognes for men, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best smelling colognes!  It is very classy.  I gave this as a gift to my dad and he loved it!</li>
            <li> A long time favorite of mine. An oldies but goodies with a unique and refreshing smell. Magnificent and not over powering.</li>
            <li> Loved it! Wasn&#x27;t the greatest scent I&#x27;ve had, but it was good.</li>
            <li> pleasent,not overwehlming. hope it does not go to quickly</li>
            <li> I have wore Christian Dior for over 30 years and it is a very elegant cologne. Also I like the fact that not everybody has it, so it gives you a different smell</li>
            <li> This one is for the wife.  She hates the standard men&#x27;s toilette sprays, but this one is different, so I just have to spend the money!</li>
            <li> This is my father&#x27;s perfume, he doesn&#x27;t like strong scents and this is the only one he ever used because it is very subtle and pleasant.</li>
            <li> My gf loved it, just perfect!!</li>
            <li> Love the classic smell!! Rare to find and stays for a long time... Although a classic, there are pretty cheap rip offs available in the market for less than $2 which spoil the overall impact!!!</li>
            <li> Mellow, yet masculine, Eau Sauvage is a great fragrance for every man. It&#x27;s not cheap, but it&#x27;s worth every dollar that I spend on it. It&#x27;s an old fragrance by Dior and my wife and others always ask me what I have on my face?</li>
            <li> Smells great, however it dissipates rather rapidly compared to my polo.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time, in the advertised condition. Fabulous, I will order again.</li>
            <li> The best, freshest and most clean smelling fragrance. Use it for years. Hope it never goes away like some other&#x27;s I have loved.</li>
            <li> Being an over 60 man, I find the older brands of colognes much more appropriate than those geared toward 20-somethings. This is one of the best - this is the one that makes you feel like a gentleman even in jeans and a sweatshirt.</li>
            <li> this fragrance is very captivating, my husband loves it! sultry and maculine. will order again. thank you!</li>
            <li> Absolutely what I expected.</li>
            <li> Light, a bit sweet (not too much), and not overbearing at all.  Great daily fragrance for a guy who wants to smell good only to those who are lucky enough to get close to him!</li>
            <li> Hi! My husband love this perfume.</li>
            <li> Came the next day and it was totally as expected</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;FAST AND EASY TRANSACTION&lt;br /&gt;PACKAGED WELL AND SHIPPED GREAT&lt;br /&gt;WOULD BUY FROM AGAIN&lt;br /&gt;THANKS SO MUCH&lt;br /&gt;GREAT JOB</li>
