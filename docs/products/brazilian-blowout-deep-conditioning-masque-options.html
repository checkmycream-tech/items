            <li>I am not sure if they love it because we lived in Brazil before or if it is a good product, but they have bought it here on Amazon because it is the best price.</li>
            <li>This conditioning mask works great to keep my hair soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>so i really need a good conditioner to smooth out the tangles after washing.  </li>
            <li>This is hands down the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>It works great on fine hair and you only have to just about a pea size.</li>
            <li>Ever since I began using this product, my hair has been smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many high quality conditioners, but this one is hands down the best.</li>
            <li>I originally bought the Brazilian Blowout shampoo and conditioner from the salon, and the products from Beauty</li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>Love this product so much I bought one for me and one for my mom.</li>
            <li>I received a sample of the Brazilian Blowout Deep Conditioning Masque in GlossyBox and loved it.</li>
            <li>No bad smell.</li>
            <li>Easy and fast</li>
            <li>Fabulous product that really tames my curly hair.</li>
            <li>and i rarely have to pull or break thru any knots just to get my hair combed through after washing it.  </li>
            <li>the next day when i rinsed it out with water my hair was smooth and silky and combed thru magically.  </li>
            <li>Love how my hair feel soft after using it</li>
            <li>this is a worthwhile investment, if you just want a fantastic deep conditioning for your hair</li>
            <li>Great product, left my hair soft and smells wonderful!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good, but not any better than other deep conditioners.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and quick.</li>
            <li>Finally frizz free shiney and silky hair!</li>
            <li>I LOVE the Deep Conditioner, it extends the life of my Brazilian Blowout!</li>
            <li>Works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I notice that it made my hair a bit more smooth and soft but after the next wash, it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li>Love this Deep Conditioner!  </li>
            <li>Really conditions your hair!</li>
            <li>) i had great success using this brazilian blowout anti frizz when i left it on clean wet hair ALL NIGHT (slept with it covered with a standard plastic hair cover).  </li>
            <li>It does not leave my hair flat, which is really important to me as I don&#x27;t care for that super straight look myself.  </li>
            <li>if a person &amp;#34;must&amp;#34; use this product to keep their brazilian blowout manageable and extend the life of that procedure, but in my opinion the Aveda Damage Remedy Conditioner is superior to this product in regards to getting rid of frizz and making hair silky (with Aveda need only leave on hair 2 minutes vs. leaving on hair all night long with this</li>

            <li>what a nightmare, after drying off out of the shower i could barely get my large tooth comb (the kind with only 8 large teeth) thru it and ended up breaking my hair to comb thru the knots.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I would say that the Aveda Damage Remedy Conditioner is far better than this product or any other product out there as far as being able to glide a comb through washed hair AND the softness and gets rid of frizz.  </li>

            <li>to do this i have to use a large tooth comb (the kind with only 5 or so large teeth), then after i comb out the rest with a large regular toothed comb.  </li>
            <li>this works very well</li>
            <li>Now I do not have a Brazilian blow out, but my hair is very processed from bleach and color.  </li>
            <li>Lots of hype but just a joke really .</li>
            <li>but I still use the products even on my very curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I have very frizzy hair</li>
            <li>It really freshens my hair?</li>
            <li>Repeated buyer of the whole product line.</li>
            <li>Will prolly order again if price stays reasonable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far, but it seems to offer more than just using the conditioner alone.</li>
            <li>I use it every other day and my hair is finally looking healthy and free of the frizzes.</li>
            <li>i had ZERO success using this as a conditioner, leaving on clean wet hair for 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live with out this product!  </li>
            <li>The normally  blowout will only last 3 months but by using this product I was able to extend the blowout for 4 months verses 3.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend the Acai Brazilian Blowout.</li>
            <li>My hair went from dry and frizzy to soft and super shiney!</li>
            <li>and I have new hair since doing them and using these products.  </li>
            <li>My Hair was very soft after using this ..</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair very soft and silky.</li>
            <li>These products keep my gray curly hair soft and shiny - can&#x27;t do without them!</li>
            <li>I like it so far!</li>
            <li>It Is are the same exact products.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair so soft!  </li>
            <li>cuz when it dried it didn&#x27;t seem as smooth as when i use my normal Aveda Damage Remedy</li>
            <li>/&gt;i have better results with massaging Nature&#x27;s Way Pure Coconut Oil for 10 minutes on my hair and sleeping with that all night and then washing and conditioning my hair the next day as usual with the Aveda Damage Remedy Conditioner, than in either case #1 or case</li>

            <li>I had put the wrong address by mistake and they sent the second order absolutely free of charge to the right address!!!</li>
            <li>I have not ever had that before unless I had it professionally blown out.</li>
            <li>Your hair is so soft and silky after use.</li>
            <li>and it makes it soft and manageable every time.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I had a Brazilian Blowout done to my hair because my hair is naturally curly and frizzy.  </li>
            <li>My hair is really soft and shiny,</li>
            <li>Do not  really like the scent, but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li>i have fine frizzy curly hair, i am a dark brunette that bleaches my hair blonde</li>
            <li>I have my hair foiled w/ low and high lights.</li>
            <li>so try the Aveda Damage Remedy.rns (a good way to get a head cold etc).  </li>
            <li>i live in arizona by the Mexican border, our climate is hot and dry and that alone keeps frizz and curliness down, so if you have frizz in Arizona</li>

            <li>I used to constantly search for and try new shampoos and conditioners and hair serums; spent TONS of money and years on my search.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if this is even to be used as a 30-minute conditioner to get the success i got by leaving it on all night, but sleeping with wet hair in the winter is not recommended for health concerns (a good way to get a head cold etc).  </li>

            <li> i live in arizona by the Mexican border, our climate is hot and dry and that alone keeps frizz and curliness down, so if you have frizz in Arizona</li>

            <li> I used to constantly search for and try new shampoos and conditioners and hair serums; spent TONS of money and years on my search.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if this is even to be used as a 30-minute conditioner to get the success i got by leaving it on all night, but sleeping with wet hair in the winter is not recommended for health concerns (a good way to get a head cold etc).  </li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it!!</li>
            <li> Last long enough.</li>
            <li> i normally use AVEDA DAMAGE REMEDY CONDITIONER, along with Aveda shampoo, this enables me to comb out my wet hair without ripping snarls and tangles from other conditioners.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i also feel that this product has a chemical feel to it, i say this based on the fact how tangled and knotted and dry it left my hair when i used it as a 30-minute conditioner.  </li>

            <li> this leads me to believe this product has either harsh chemicals and/or not softening or natural emollients in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a Brazilian treatment on my hair in a long time</li>
            <li> We live in an area of Southern California that has extremely hard water</li>
            <li> I used it per the instructions for deep conditioning, but also used a little bit of it in combination with the regular brazilian volume conditioner throughout the week.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great for dry, brittle hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down even if used daily.</li>

            <li> If you spent the money on the Brazilian Blowout treatment at the salon</li>
            <li> i also use just a tiny amount of coconut oil (like a tiny dip on my finger then rub into my hands to just deposit a small amount on my hair after it is washed and dried for any additional frizz.  </li>

            <li> Great product! Love it. Finally frizz free shiney and silky hair! I have not ever had that before unless I had it professionally blown out.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live with out this product!  And I was paying ALOT more for it via my hair dresser!  So thrilled to find it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> These products keep my gray curly hair soft and shiny - can&#x27;t do without them!</li>
            <li> Smooths hair if left on ALL NIGHT, but leaves a lot of tangles if left on just 30 minutes.  i have fine frizzy curly hair, i am a dark brunette that bleaches my hair blonde so i really need a good conditioner to smooth out the tangles after washing.  i normally use AVEDA DAMAGE REMEDY CONDITIONER, along with Aveda shampoo, this enables me to comb out my wet hair without ripping snarls and tangles from other conditioners.  to do this i have to use a large tooth comb (the kind with only 5 or so large teeth), then after i comb out the rest with a large regular toothed comb.  this works very well and i rarely have to pull or break thru any knots just to get my hair combed through after washing it.  without Aveda I cannot comb out my hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) i had great success using this brazilian blowout anti frizz when i left it on clean wet hair ALL NIGHT (slept with it covered with a standard plastic hair cover).  the next day when i rinsed it out with water my hair was smooth and silky and combed thru magically.  it was amazing.  however, my hair after i styled it didn&#x27;t seem any less frizzy than when i use AVEDA DAMAGE REMEDY CONDITIONER.  cuz when it dried it didn&#x27;t seem as smooth as when i use my normal Aveda Damage Remedy Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as a 30-minute conditioner:&lt;br /&gt;2) i had ZERO success using this as a conditioner, leaving on clean wet hair for 30 minutes.  what a nightmare, after drying off out of the shower i could barely get my large tooth comb (the kind with only 8 large teeth) thru it and ended up breaking my hair to comb thru the knots.  when it dried my hair was frizzy and just looked like i used some harsh shampoo on it.  this leads me to believe this product has either harsh chemicals and/or not softening or natural emollients in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if this is even to be used as a 30-minute conditioner to get the success i got by leaving it on all night, but sleeping with wet hair in the winter is not recommended for health concerns (a good way to get a head cold etc).  so i won&#x27;t be buying this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have better results with massaging Nature&#x27;s Way Pure Coconut Oil for 10 minutes on my hair and sleeping with that all night and then washing and conditioning my hair the next day as usual with the Aveda Damage Remedy Conditioner, than in either case #1 or case #2 outlined above.  In fact, I would say that the Aveda Damage Remedy Conditioner is far better than this product or any other product out there as far as being able to glide a comb through washed hair AND the softness and gets rid of frizz.  i&#x27;m not sure if a person &amp;#34;must&amp;#34; use this product to keep their brazilian blowout manageable and extend the life of that procedure, but in my opinion the Aveda Damage Remedy Conditioner is superior to this product in regards to getting rid of frizz and making hair silky (with Aveda need only leave on hair 2 minutes vs. leaving on hair all night long with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i also feel that this product has a chemical feel to it, i say this based on the fact how tangled and knotted and dry it left my hair when i used it as a 30-minute conditioner.  i also used a generous amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMEND: massage Nature&#x27;s Way Coconut Oil generously in hair for 10 minutes and leave on over night before you wash it the next day.  and use AVEDA DAMAGE REMEDY CONDITIONER instead of this harsh product.  i also use just a tiny amount of coconut oil (like a tiny dip on my finger then rub into my hands to just deposit a small amount on my hair after it is washed and dried for any additional frizz.  i live in arizona by the Mexican border, our climate is hot and dry and that alone keeps frizz and curliness down, so if you have frizz in Arizona then it would be 10 times worse in damper climate LIKE FLORIDA.  so try the Aveda Damage Remedy.rns (a good way to get a head cold etc).  so i won&#x27;t be buying this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have better results with massaging Nature&#x27;s Way Pure Coconut Oil for 10 minutes on my hair and sleeping with that all night and then washing and conditioning my hair the next day as usual with the Aveda Damage Remedy Conditioner, than in either case #1 or case #2 outlined above.

            <li> I had received a sample of this in my Birchbox and fell in love.  Now I do not have a Brazilian blow out, but my hair is very processed from bleach and color.  It does not leave my hair flat, which is really important to me as I don&#x27;t care for that super straight look myself.  The smell of this conditioner is amazing.</li>
            <li> It helps repair your hair</li>
            <li> Love this product so much I bought one for me and one for my mom.</li>
            <li> Lots of hype but just a joke really . I won&#x27;t be fooled again - this stuff is overpriced for no difference in hair at all though my blowout at salon did actually work as soon as I washed it it was not the same</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used! Your hair is so soft and silky after use.Try it you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE the Deep Conditioner, it extends the life of my Brazilian Blowout! I order it all the time and will continue to order.</li>
            <li> great mask, use it ry two weeks, leave it on for 20-30 minutes.</li>
            <li> My hair is like I just had it done after I use it.  Leaves my hair bouncy and shiny.  I will buy this again</li>
            <li> I color my hair and this masque was recommended to me by my beautician. I have been using it religiously ever since. It adds a good degree of moisture to my hair and conditions it much better than any drugstore brand I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Excelent!  I love this product</li>
            <li> Not worth it. Weird smell too.</li>
            <li> Best Keratin treatment I have tried!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a Brazilian treatment on my hair in a long time but I still use the products even on my very curly hair.  This conditioning mask works great to keep my hair soft and shiny! Expensive but worth it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who has actually had the blowout process done to their hair. I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far, but it seems to offer more than just using the conditioner alone.</li>
            <li> My Hair was very soft after using this ..because I dye it every month it something get dried out .. Great results</li>
            <li> Great Seller, excellent product. Highly recommend the Acai Brazilian Blowout.</li>
            <li> This mask is one of the best I have ever used.  I have very frizzy hair and it makes it soft and manageable every time.</li>
            <li> We live in an area of Southern California that has extremely hard water and we have a softener system, but my hair still suffers. I have tried many high quality conditioners, but this one is hands down the best. I use it every other day and my hair is finally looking healthy and free of the frizzes. It helps my blow out to last longer, as well. Smells fabulous!</li>
            <li> I used it per the instructions for deep conditioning, but also used a little bit of it in combination with the regular brazilian volume conditioner throughout the week. It really freshens my hair?</li>
            <li> All my life I have suffered with wavy frizzy hair. Living in Florida doesn&#x27;t help either. Ever since I began using this product, my hair has been smooth and shiny. By using this product I only have to get Brazilian Blowout every 6 months!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of the Brazilian Blowout Deep Conditioning Masque in GlossyBox and loved it. Ordered the shampoo, conditioner and masque. My hair is soft and shiny. I have my hair foiled w/ low and high lights. This stuff brings out the best in me :)</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo!  Repeated buyer of the whole product line.</li>
            <li> I had a Brazilian Blowout done to my hair because my hair is naturally curly and frizzy.  The blow out made my hair shiny and controllable with no frizz even on rainy days. I decided to try this product and I was totally amazed. The normally  blowout will only last 3 months but by using this product I was able to extend the blowout for 4 months verses 3.  It seemed to protect my hair from the straightener.  It works great on fine hair and you only have to just about a pea size.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well. Will prolly order again if price stays reasonable.</li>
            <li> Great product and even greater store! I had put the wrong address by mistake and they sent the second order absolutely free of charge to the right address!!! No questions asked. I waited until I used the product to write this review. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this product! My hair went from dry and frizzy to soft and super shiney! I have recommended it to my friends! People just reach out and want to touch my hair!!!!!</li>
            <li> It definitely made my hair softer but I&#x27;ve only used it twice so I&#x27;m not real sure about how it will hold. I like it so far!</li>
            <li> Great products my hairdresser uses them on me &amp; had to get my own set for home !</li>
            <li> The product is excellent.</li>
            <li> Love how my hair feel soft after using it</li>
            <li> This stuff is fabulous!!! If you spent the money on the Brazilian Blowout treatment at the salon this is a worthwhile investment, if you just want a fantastic deep conditioning for your hair this is it.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and quick. No issues with purchasing from seller. Easy and fast transaction.&lt;br /&gt;As for the product, I don&#x27;t care for it. I notice that it made my hair a bit more smooth and soft but after the next wash, it&#x27;s gone. Didn&#x27;t make my hair more shiny, like I was lead to believe, or improved the Brazilian blowout, as lies for me. I am one of those unfortunate people that after a month of getting the BB, my hair started falling out by the bunch...it still does. I discontinued this prodect and the shampoo &amp; conditioner.  I believe the sulfate in hair products makes the different because when I stopped these products, my loss of hair is a bit less now.</li>
            <li> more than satisfied with price and delivery timeliness.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair very soft and silky. It could be called the &amp;#34;best kept secret&amp;#34;! My hairdresser uses it on my hair when I go to see her every week. Money on this product is well spent!</li>
            <li> Great for living in high humidity!</li>
            <li> Good, but not any better than other deep conditioners.</li>
            <li> This is the only conditioner I will use! And it is literally half the cost that my hair salon was charging!</li>
            <li> My wife loves it!  Works as described. No bad smell. Last long enough. I will by it again. Nice product.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.  It makes my hair smooth and shiny.  I get regular Brazilian Blowouts (every 12-16 weeks) and I have new hair since doing them and using these products.  I used to constantly search for and try new shampoos and conditioners and hair serums; spent TONS of money and years on my search.  I tried a Brazilian Blowout, and these products about a year ago and I haven&#x27;t switched since!!  I would only recommend buying these products from &amp;#34;Beauty It Is&amp;#34; store on Amazon......I originally bought the Brazilian Blowout shampoo and conditioner from the salon, and the products from Beauty It Is are the same exact products.  I have read other reviews from different sellers that say the products are fake, so I stay away from them, but the products from Beauty It Is are legit!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Truly brings out the shine and controls frizz/waves. Do not  really like the scent, but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this product. It&#x27;s marvelous. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down even if used daily. Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> Love this Deep Conditioner!  Makes my hair so soft!  And such a great deal on Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is a great masque to use under a heat cap, for 30 minutes.  I love the way my hair feels afterwards.</li>
            <li> Got in record time and at a great price. So glad I can maintain my Blowout at a price I can afford</li>
            <li> This is something that women are going to love.  I am not sure if they love it because we lived in Brazil before or if it is a good product, but they have bought it here on Amazon because it is the best price.</li>
            <li> Great product! I would recommend to all! Really conditions your hair!</li>
            <li> Fabulous product that really tames my curly hair.</li>
            <li> 100% satisfied with purchase,  delivery and product.</li>
            <li> Great product, left my hair soft and smells wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for dry, brittle hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I use it every other day instead of shampoo.  I use shampoo every 2 weeks only, since shampoo drys the scalp.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. My hair is really soft and shiny,</li>
            <li> This is a must have for Brazilian Blowout! I have hair that isn&#x27;t frizzy even in Florida summer. I love it!</li>
