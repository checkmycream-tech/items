            <li> I must mentioned that my hair type is in the 4s, dry, tangle prone, and porous.  </li>

            <li> Unfortunately the next day hair, my hair was dry</li>
            <li> My curls are extremely defined and moisturized and stay that way for at least 4 days.</li>
            <li> After I shampooed and conditioned my hair, I was running late</li>
            <li> The price is a bit expensive but it works so well that I splurge on it.</li>

            <li> This stuff is great!!! I have super long thick curly hair, and it tames it without weighing it down :D</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is a great moisturizer.  I use it on my natural hair (no chemicals or heat needed). I love my hair:  strong, healthy and very moisturized).  My hair is the healthiest it has been in years.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used the oil of this product for a while and liked it a lot.  The custard works well too.  Good for the hair and nice smell.</li>

            <li> Nubian Heritage Grow and Strengthen Herbal Custard, Indian Hemp and Tamanu.</li>
            <li> WOW. What a find. It leaves my hair so soft and easy to take care of. This is my new go to hair custard.</li>
            <li> I received this product after my mother bought it in bulk before deciding that it was to oily for her short hair. I have been using this product, along with castor oil and gel, on my color treated 3c hair for wash and go&#x27;s and I absolutely love it! My curls are extremely defined and moisturized and stay that way for at least 4 days.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Provides moisture and my granddaughters hair is really growing. ..</li>
            <li> I love this product. I bought it when it was on clearance just to try and I wish I stocked up. The price is a bit expensive but it works so well that I splurge on it. This product takes effect on my hair right away. After using it one time I noticed less shedding and split ends.  I like a simple routine for my natural hair and this helps me maintain it. All I do is apply it to my shampooed or co-washed hair in sections and my hair is way more manageable and my ends are sealed until my next wash.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! I have tried many different products on the market and none  have been better than this one.. It really does strengthen the hair, and leaves it fully hydrated.  I can&#x27;t live without this stuff.  I just wish it were available in stores. I used to purchase this product at Walgreens, but for some reason they not longer carry it, searched high and low and finally found it on Amazon, so happy.  I hope they continue to carry this product.</li>
            <li> Awesome for thick and very dry hair. I pair it with a moisture lotion or an oil and it smooths and conditions my hair very well.. 4abc hair.</li>
            <li> Im asian and with kinda dry and damaged wavy hair from heat styling/ hair dye and I remember going to Vegas with my best friend and after we went swimming I noticed my hair was really really dry, but I didn&#x27;t take any product with me. Luckily, my best friend who happens to be half black and half white (super gorgeous curls) had this product. I thought it was just going to weigh down my waves and look greasy but I used it regardless. And boy was I wrong ! This product defined my waves so nicely and gave me volume, shine, was not greasy, and smelled so good. On top of that, it strengthens your hair. Love this.</li>
            <li> This hair cream smells so good! It provides great hold and eliminates frizz. I am not sure yet about the growth factor because I just recently started using it but it does lessen the amount of hair that comes out when I comb my hair. Its great to put on your hair after working out or for the everyday. I will have to purchase more.</li>
            <li> I have thin, brittle hair and this product really gives my hair strength &amp; elasticity.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I love the ingredients and the custard has a pleasant smell.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s helping to make my hair stronger and grow since I just started using it.  I use it as a leave in conditioner, but I rinse my hair just a bit before getting out of the shower.  I am also using the serum, and the edge taming taffy if I style my hair in a pony tail or bun.  Don&#x27;t use too much of any of the products because it will make your hair greasy -- just follow the directions.  My hair is wavy curly.  So far I like it.</li>
            <li> After trying Sooo many products in my AA natural 4c hair, this one proved to be the best.  I 1st lived the fragrance &amp; then was highly satisfied with how soft it made my hair.  It made it more manageable and it has grown quite nicely.  My money was well spent.</li>
            <li> This is one of my all time favorite hair products. It&#x27;s the perfect, non-greasy leave-in-conditioner, and just using a pea-sized amount will completely get rid of static in my hair for the day. Living in dry, snowy New York, static is a normal and frustrating part of winter, but not since I&#x27;ve been using this. I will buy it until they stop making it!</li>
            <li> Finally, a product  for my hair!!!  Being Black Creek Native American,  African American products are to heavy, to greasy, or too drying.  This product removes the need to have to purchase those oily frizzy tamers and is perfect, and I mean perfect for my hair.  I no longer need to use \\&quot;Mixed-Chics\\&quot; as a leave in conditioner!.  The product arrived on time (but does take its time), and I will remain very happy with this product.  The product sells at Target for over $20.00.  Do the math.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim because it was on clearance and the price was too good to pass up.  I only purchased one because because I didn&#x27;t want to be stuck with 10 tubes of this custard that is going to be hard to unload.  I decided to use it on my wash day and I wanted test it out.  I must mentioned that my hair type is in the 4s, dry, tangle prone, and porous.  After I shampooed and conditioned my hair, I was running late so I brushed my hair back and added this product.  Then I tied a scarf to help it lay flat.  The scent is strong but bearable but what shocked me is that this custard actually kept the frizz level to a minimal.  I like how it kept my hair soft for the whole day.  Unfortunately the next day hair, my hair was dry but I re-wetted it and it was almost as good as the first day.  I also applied it on dry hair and it still works, but not as well on freshly shampooed hair. I plan to purchase more but it looks like certain stores are discontinue carrying it.</li>
