    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The truth is that this product works well on the skin, meaning it leaves your skin beautiful..</li>
            <li>Great if you know how to use it.  </li>
            <li>I am happy at this point.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased, but after about a week I started getting irritation under my eyes and soon I started seeing wrinkles that were not there before.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have the burning/irritation nor did I have the amazing immediate results like some reviews</li>
            <li>But that evening, I noticed a good deal more burning, when I was not in the shower.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li>Whatever is in the product is making for a very light, controllable peel/sloughing off of skin.</li>
            <li>I applied it one more time.</li>
            <li>and I was noticing that I was getting more</li>
            <li>decided to try the Better Complexions Milia cream.</li>
            <li>OK.</li>
            <li>I love this cream.  </li>
            <li>It did reduce the milia so that it is not so prominent, but they are still there.  </li>
            <li>I have never been able to remove them myself.</li>
            <li>It was also the skin under my mouth where I felt this most strongly, even though I had never applied the cream there.</li>
            <li>It may be that I just got a really strong jar.</li>
            <li>It felt fine on my face.  </li>
            <li>and I felt it hadn&#x27;t changed much, but it kind of did (</li>
            <li>It is fabulous.</li>
            <li>but I was  excited to use</li>
            <li>I never use eye creams or anything rich under my eyes, but I think I got the milia by habit of rubbing my eyes when I wake, and consequently rubbing what face moisturiser I had on under the skin and trapping it there.</li>
            <li>I also have fine wrinkles under my eyes and mild \\&quot;bags,\\&quot;</li>
            <li>That helped the discomfort significantly, but nothing will heal this but time.</li>
            <li>but once you get past the peeling, skin looks great!</li>
            <li>Extremely satisfied with this product and highly recommend it !</li>
            <li>The ingredient listing of a cosmetic product is the main criterion by which we are able to judge its safety.</li>
            <li>this cream was much too strong for the area underneath my eyes.</li>
            <li>But was much too strong for my eye area .......</li>
            <li>When it first arrived I hadn&#x27;t experienced anything that the other reviewers were talking about...</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews, but had to for this product.</li>
            <li>forwhat they were, I put fresh aloe vera on my skin, and almond oil under my eyes.</li>
            <li>Powerful creams like this are to use sparingly.  </li>
            <li>I went to a dermatologist , he said that he will have to extract it and still there is no guarantee that it&#x27;ll be gone and might leave a scar because they are the flat kind</li>
            <li>/&gt;Clearly, consumers of skin care products have a right to know what they are putting on their skin.</li>
            <li>I was sceptical at first - maybe all the good reviews are from the company or its workers itself, as the Better Complexions website looked a bit outdated, unmaintained and lacked a lot of information.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been using for just over a week and my very stubborn , flat kind</li>
            <li>Honestly, it&#x27;s been around for so long I haven&#x27;t done much to get rid of them</li>
            <li>Used it consistently for four days with no troubles (ensuring I don&#x27;t rub my under eye area at all every morning) but couldn&#x27;t see any change.</li>
            <li>would suggest for people to try this, as I&#x27;ve found it does work, but just be aware</li>
            <li>Hi people, I will be honest with everyone here since I spent my money and</li>
            <li>Using great caution under the delicate under the eye area.  </li>
            <li>When I first stared using this product</li>
            <li>I have very persistent and stubborn milia right under my eyes</li>
            <li>I washed my face and applied a very gentle cream (seriously gentle--</li>
            <li>Or, it may also be that my skin is more sensitive than most, although as I said, I did not experience a reaction for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In one week it has gotten rid of a large milia I had under my eye for over a year.</li>
            <li>Before this, beside those few specks of milia, my skin was basically perfect, and now it is a mess of chemical burns.</li>
            <li>used it very sparingly, only as much as an apple seed for both my eyes and layered it across my milia and the lines as some people found it helped with their fine lines.</li>
            <li>a fairly simple, cheap solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I see it, the lancet is in fact much safer.ch safer.</li>
            <li>Very drying</li>
            <li>The company was very helpful when I spoke to them ..</li>
            <li>Today, I&#x27;ve washed my face and inspected the milia and am happy to say - it has actually gotten less noticeable!</li>
            <li>The peeling has healed and I&#x27;m hoping it will stop completely, but I&#x27;m thinking with the right care</li>
            <li>Then, on the fifth day, I noticed in the shower that my face felt sensitive to the hot water, like skin will when it has been burned.</li>
            <li>initially had mild irritation but that went away.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought it was mild enough to use as an eye cream.</li>
            <li>recommend this product highly.  </li>
            <li>Overall worth it</li>
            <li>I have like 10 of them on my right eye and like 5 on my left eye.  </li>
            <li>Not only did it work on the milia, but it is erasing the fine wrinkles on my face and I have only been using it for about week!</li>
            <li>If I had seen an accurate listing of ingredients with the strength of whatever the active ingredient is, I also would have had the knowledge to judge not to use it.</li>
            <li>First, it is possible that some of the people writing positive reviews did not care so much about the damage the product was doing to their skin as long as it got rid of the milia.</li>
            <li>This is the FIRST time I have ever left a product review on Amazon.</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s going to get worse before it gets better!</li>
            <li>My milia has only slightly improved, but I think I was better of before.</li>
            <li>However, having read one review where the poster reported that her cream seemed like a \\&quot;plain\\&quot; cream with nothing active in it which caused no irritation or beneficial effects at all, I am convinced this is true.</li>
            <li>So naturally, as there were some rave reviews, and some literally warning me not to use it, I just had to try this out for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought I would have to have it professionally removed.</li>
            <li>and it leaves skin soft</li>
            <li>So far I have one that seems to have disappeared.  </li>
            <li>I would not recommend using anywhere there is sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I kept using it and used it frequently.  </li>
            <li>There were no instructions listed on the product, and worse, no ingredients, which is actually a violation of two federal laws: the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&amp;C Act) and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA).</li>
            <li>I tried putting some lotion on so it can cool down my face</li>
            <li>the bit of Milia that I have, I am convinced that this product works if in no other way than to get rid of the dull top layer of skin to reveal a brighter and fresher face.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Updating: This cream actually burned my neck, please people do not apply this cream on your neck unless you want a red burn on it I tried applying aloe vera gel and is a little better</li>
            <li>After the first day, everything felt fine, so I began also putting a dot of thecream on a small speck on my other cheek, which looked like it could be a milia</li>
            <li>I could barely wash my face with soap because it stinged!</li>
            <li>but I have also noticed under eye bags and major puffiness.</li>
            <li>After years of trying to clear my face with dermatologist and OTC remedies, this is the only one that has worked for me.  </li>
            <li>My young son has had a milia bump on his cheek for several months.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised when it came in the mail, because it did not have any sort of box, and the label was just the title of the product glued on the plastic jar, as though it had been assembled outside of a factory--maybe in someone&#x27;s basement.</li>
            <li>I wold rather have the milia around my eyes as it used to be than bare with these wrinkles and under eye bags.</li>
            <li>it definitely has a Retin A type of action.</li>
            <li>The first few days, the skin around my eyes were peeling.  </li>
            <li>I mean honestly right after that week i completely stopped using this.</li>
            <li>know there are positive reviews of this product, and to that, I have a few things to say.</li>
            <li>I had read a few reviews and seen that people claimed good results, but unfortunately had not read enough of them to see the reports of major skin irritation.</li>
            <li>So, I read both the good and the bad reviews about this cream.  </li>
            <li>good or bad...</li>

            <li> know there are positive reviews of this product, and to that, I have a few things to say.</li>
            <li> I had read a few reviews and seen that people claimed good results, but unfortunately had not read enough of them to see the reports of major skin irritation.</li>
            <li> So, I read both the good and the bad reviews about this cream.  </li>
            <li> good or bad...</li>
            <li> Of course, this is not really surprising, since anything you put on your face will both spread around on the entire surface and be absorbed into it and distribute that way, but I thought it was something to note, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do not really understand that, but I have read at least one review where it is unquestionably true.</li>
            <li> A dermatoligist&#x27;s lancet does far less damage, and only to the smallest part of your skin at that.</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t get a hold of this product through Amazon, being in Australia, but managed to stumble across it on a local site which imported the product for me.</li>
            <li> It may help milia (I did not use it long enough to find out), but it also damages skin to one degree or another, with my case being a prime example of that.</li>
            <li> My entire face started peeling but the painful kind of peeling.</li>
            <li> Therefore, it is also possible or likely that some of us got creams of different strengths of whatever the active ingredient is, although since we don&#x27;t know the ingredients, we can&#x27;t even say what that might be.</li>
            <li> Not very professionally packaged and no ingredients listed on the package.</li>
            <li> I hoped this product would at least help, but milia are tough to get rid of, so I did not have super high hopes.</li>
            <li> feeling, however, was not intense enough for me to stop using the cream.</li>
            <li> I was using a very heavy new face cream and the Milia spread and got larger.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Mind you, I used little tiny portions on the places where I have Milia but no way it spreads throughout your entire face.</li>
            <li> While I am not completely convinced that it&#x27;s going to get rid of (without a little extra help)</li>
            <li> I had no redness or irritation, although there was no real change to the milia, either.</li>

            <li> I want to start off by saying that I never ever wirte reviews.. good or bad!!</li>
            <li> At this point, I wanted to try to remove as much of the cream as possible, but it felt like a really bad idea to rub my face with my hands or put any other cleansing agents on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this product to treat a couple of very small milia on my upper cheekbone.</li>

            <li> The packaging was also a little odd.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been two months now and the little \\&quot;bumps\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> , I woke to the same uncomfortable, rough, burning feeling.</li>

            <li> I have gotten it in my eyes and it feels like eyedrops), but that only made it worse.</li>
            <li> therefore I consider this buy a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I was hoping these wrinkles would go away after a couple of hours or days, but no, they have only gotten worse.</li>
            <li> A thin layer of my skin has been coming off since last night (the end of the 4th day using the cream)</li>

            <li> Day five comes along and I&#x27;m using my usual face toner and moisturiser (a slightly acidic product for my oily skin) and pain sets in -</li>
            <li> Still get a bit of the pain, a little bit of redness appears but nothing really serious (also, the peeling and redness appeared a bit lower on my face, about halfway down my nose on cheeks, where I didn&#x27;t apply the product)</li>

            <li> I will continue to use it until I finish the jar (wich is really small not like the picture shows) and if anything happens let everyone know</li>
            <li> This is the first time I get under eye bags and I am majorly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I told myself that it was just a little jar of cream produced by some home cosmetics maker with no understanding of the law, and it couldn&#x27;t possibly contain anything dangerous.</li>

            <li> I guess it is like a healing sunburn and youput on a product that irritates it - the pain sets in slowly but painful enough to make you go \\&quot;Ow!\\&quot; by the end of it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I hoped this product would at least help, but milia are tough to get rid of, so I did not have super high hopes. Not only did it work on the milia, but it is erasing the fine wrinkles on my face and I have only been using it for about week! Frankly, I am shocked. Whatever is in the product is making for a very light, controllable peel/sloughing off of skin. I use it twice a day rather than once because I have tough oily skin rather than sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Look, I&#x27;m simply one of those people who will do something, when you tell them not to. So naturally, as there were some rave reviews, and some literally warning me not to use it, I just had to try this out for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t get a hold of this product through Amazon, being in Australia, but managed to stumble across it on a local site which imported the product for me. I was sceptical at first - maybe all the good reviews are from the company or its workers itself, as the Better Complexions website looked a bit outdated, unmaintained and lacked a lot of information. As mentioned, this literally is just a small plastic tub with a sticker on it so no ingredient advice, warnings or directions, but I was  excited to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had milia for at least 10 years from memory - I may have possibly had it as a child. I&#x27;m now 24 and they appear quite deep under the skin so if I were to see a dermatologist, they&#x27;d probably have to dig very deep under to rid of it. I also have very deep wrinkles under my eyes. I never use eye creams or anything rich under my eyes, but I think I got the milia by habit of rubbing my eyes when I wake, and consequently rubbing what face moisturiser I had on under the skin and trapping it there. Honestly, it&#x27;s been around for so long I haven&#x27;t done much to get rid of them but I have always thought they were hideous. This appeared to be a fairly simple, cheap solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it very sparingly, only as much as an apple seed for both my eyes and layered it across my milia and the lines as some people found it helped with their fine lines. Used it consistently for four days with no troubles (ensuring I don&#x27;t rub my under eye area at all every morning) but couldn&#x27;t see any change. Day five comes along and I&#x27;m using my usual face toner and moisturiser (a slightly acidic product for my oily skin) and pain sets in - it&#x27;s that sensitive, burning pain that just slowly kicks in. I guess it is like a healing sunburn and youput on a product that irritates it - the pain sets in slowly but painful enough to make you go \\&quot;Ow!\\&quot; by the end of it. So, decided to give it a miss that night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day after, I put on my make up and find the skins peeling. Still get a bit of the pain, a little bit of redness appears but nothing really serious (also, the peeling and redness appeared a bit lower on my face, about halfway down my nose on cheeks, where I didn&#x27;t apply the product) so the pain I guess does travel. Had a feel of my milia and I felt it hadn&#x27;t changed much, but it kind of did (but maybe that was me hoping it was working) I have not used it for the past 3 days now so over a week, just waiting for the sensitivity and peeling to stop. Today, I&#x27;ve washed my face and inspected the milia and am happy to say - it has actually gotten less noticeable! what used to be BUMPS are now just slightly raised and the milia is slowly fading!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes, it does work, but there is a lot of strife to go through. From here, I may look to use it every second day only and even lower the amount I am using. The peeling has healed and I&#x27;m hoping it will stop completely, but I&#x27;m thinking with the right care this may be a solution of finally ridding myself of the milia!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest for people to try this, as I&#x27;ve found it does work, but just be aware - it&#x27;s going to get worse before it gets better!</li>
            <li> My young son has had a milia bump on his cheek for several months.  I bought this in hopes it would go away.  I have put it on the bump for a week now and it has not changed at all.  I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> I put the cream on as directed for about a week. My entire face started peeling but the painful kind of peeling. I could barely wash my face with soap because it stinged! I tried putting some lotion on so it can cool down my face but it stung so bad. I mean honestly right after that week i completely stopped using this. Mind you, I used little tiny portions on the places where I have Milia but no way it spreads throughout your entire face.</li>
            <li> I like the cream.  It felt fine on my face.  I had a milia that looked like a white pimple.  I was so embarrassed.&lt;br /&gt;After two weeks it disappeared.  I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but had to for this product. In one week it has gotten rid of a large milia I had under my eye for over a year. Just put on a bit every night for the last 7 days. I am amazed. I thought I would have to have it professionally removed.</li>
            <li> This cream did nothing for my milia. I didn&#x27;t even experience any dryness or irritation like others. It seems like a heavy cream with nothing else in it. The packaging was also a little odd. Not very professionally packaged and no ingredients listed on the package. I contacted the seller for a refund and was told this can&#x27;t be returned. I regret spending $30 on this product as it was useless.</li>
            <li> Anyone who has milia knows how discouraging it can be. Dermatologists and anesthesiologist can&#x27;t even help. But, this  milia cream has been helping me. I have the round flat type of milia that can not be pierced by a lancet. I apply Retinol Cream at night and in the morning are much less noticeable. The milia has had time to reform by nighttime and I start all over again. Until there is a permanent cure this has been the only treatment that has helped me. (I have tried almost everything else - from expensive at- home microdermabrasion appliances to pricey creams and not-so-pricey creams.) This is the ONLY one to give me temporary reduction.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to treat a couple of very small milia on my upper cheekbone. I was surprised when it came in the mail, because it did not have any sort of box, and the label was just the title of the product glued on the plastic jar, as though it had been assembled outside of a factory--maybe in someone&#x27;s basement. There were no instructions listed on the product, and worse, no ingredients, which is actually a violation of two federal laws: the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&amp;C Act) and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA). See here for details: [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clearly, consumers of skin care products have a right to know what they are putting on their skin. The ingredient listing of a cosmetic product is the main criterion by which we are able to judge its safety. Without this component, we are robbed of vital information that will allow us to make a decision whether or not to use the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, even though I have a background in science, even though I have worked in labs around chemicals for years and understand their dangers, and even though I know the theoretical product safety issues that can arise from poorly labeled substances, I chose to disregard them in this case. I told myself that it was just a little jar of cream produced by some home cosmetics maker with no understanding of the law, and it couldn&#x27;t possibly contain anything dangerous. I had read a few reviews and seen that people claimed good results, but unfortunately had not read enough of them to see the reports of major skin irritation. If I had, I would have reconsidered. If I had seen an accurate listing of ingredients with the strength of whatever the active ingredient is, I also would have had the knowledge to judge not to use it. But since I hadn&#x27;t on both counts, I decided that I would use just the smallest amount on the area containing the milia and stop if I had any problems. After the first day, everything felt fine, so I began also putting a dot of thecream on a small speck on my other cheek, which looked like it could be a milia forming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, everything was alright for about four days. I had no redness or irritation, although there was no real change to the milia, either. Then, on the fifth day, I noticed in the shower that my face felt sensitive to the hot water, like skin will when it has been burned. It was also the skin under my mouth where I felt this most strongly, even though I had never applied the cream there. Of course, this is not really surprising, since anything you put on your face will both spread around on the entire surface and be absorbed into it and distribute that way, but I thought it was something to note, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This feeling, however, was not intense enough for me to stop using the cream. I applied it one more time. But that evening, I noticed a good deal more burning, when I was not in the shower. Looking closely, I noticed redness beginning to develop in areas on my face. In addition to the burning, my skin felt tight, rough, and dry. I washed my face and applied a very gentle cream (seriously gentle--I have gotten it in my eyes and it feels like eyedrops), but that only made it worse. At this point, I wanted to try to remove as much of the cream as possible, but it felt like a really bad idea to rub my face with my hands or put any other cleansing agents on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not apply the cream again, of course, and the following morning (this morning), I woke to the same uncomfortable, rough, burning feeling. It was quite severe, and on every area of my face except my forehead. Even my lips felt chapped and ultra-sensitive. In the mirror, I can see that my skin is covered in red splotches. Before this, beside those few specks of milia, my skin was basically perfect, and now it is a mess of chemical burns. I also have fine wrinkles under my eyes and mild \\&quot;bags,\\&quot; as described by another reviewer, which were certainly not there before. Recognizing the burns forwhat they were, I put fresh aloe vera on my skin, and almond oil under my eyes. That helped the discomfort significantly, but nothing will heal this but time. Even then, I shudder to think of the damage this has done to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know there are positive reviews of this product, and to that, I have a few things to say. First, it is possible that some of the people writing positive reviews did not care so much about the damage the product was doing to their skin as long as it got rid of the milia. I do not really understand that, but I have read at least one review where it is unquestionably true. Second, as established by the unprofessional packaging and poor product labeling, it is also quite possible--even likely--that this product was produced outside a factory with proper quality control. Therefore, it is also possible or likely that some of us got creams of different strengths of whatever the active ingredient is, although since we don&#x27;t know the ingredients, we can&#x27;t even say what that might be. However, having read one review where the poster reported that her cream seemed like a \\&quot;plain\\&quot; cream with nothing active in it which caused no irritation or beneficial effects at all, I am convinced this is true. It may be that I just got a really strong jar. Or, it may also be that my skin is more sensitive than most, although as I said, I did not experience a reaction for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever the reason, I caution you that using this cream is not worth the risk. Do not let what happened to me happen to you. It may help milia (I did not use it long enough to find out), but it also damages skin to one degree or another, with my case being a prime example of that. A dermatoligist&#x27;s lancet does far less damage, and only to the smallest part of your skin at that. I bought this cream because I wanted to avoid that, but now I wish I had not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I see it, the lancet is in fact much safer.ch safer.</li>
            <li> I want to start off by saying that I never ever wirte reviews.. good or bad!! but this cream made me into a believer . I have very persistent and stubborn milia right under my eyes and I was noticing that I was getting more &gt; I went to a dermatologist , he said that he will have to extract it and still there is no guarantee that it&#x27;ll be gone and might leave a scar because they are the flat kind. I hate needles so after extensive research , I bought this cream and I&#x27;ve been using for just over a week and my very stubborn , flat kind, ugly white heads are beginning to diminish and Its a noticeable difference ... Extremely satisfied with this product and highly recommend it !</li>
            <li> This works but it has burnt/dried my face pretty bad where I applied numerous times. Overall worth it but dang.</li>
            <li> Hi people, I will be honest with everyone here since I spent my money and the product did not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The truth is that this product works well on the skin, meaning it leaves your skin beautiful..but thats it, just that it will NOT remove your milia, I bought it for undereye milia and since it didnt work for that I am using it for my face and it leaves skin soft but thats NOT what I was looking for, all I wanted was my milia removed wich by the way are not too bad imagine if it didnt work on me I suppose it wont work for you either.  For putting in my face i use Clinique (Im not from that company just trying to make a point here) therefore I consider this buy a waste of money. I will continue to use it until I finish the jar (wich is really small not like the picture shows) and if anything happens let everyone know anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updating: This cream actually burned my neck, please people do not apply this cream on your neck unless you want a red burn on it I tried applying aloe vera gel and is a little better but now it looks brown and doesnt go away :(</li>
            <li> I have lived with Milia under my eyes for years. I was using a very heavy new face cream and the Milia spread and got larger.&lt;br /&gt;I did some research and used another product that was expensive and didn&#x27;t work&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try the Better Complexions Milia cream. It is fabulous. I suggest you use it sparingly because it is quite strong.&lt;br /&gt;I initially had mild irritation but that went away.&lt;br /&gt;About half my Milia are gone after 3 days. I am thrilled with this product. It is also cheaper than the other Milia treatments advertised&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product highly.  For those who claim they are not receiving product content information, look in the box. It is printed up on a separate piece of paper.</li>
            <li> It actually works! I used it for 2 days and it removed the milia around my eyes. I have like 10 of them on my right eye and like 5 on my left eye.  But now its gotten a lot smaller and some of them are gone.</li>
            <li> Great if you know how to use it.  Powerful creams like this are to use sparingly.  Using great caution under the delicate under the eye area.  A little bit goes a very long way.  Don&#x27;t use other creams with it and use a non clogging moisturizer in the morning.  OK. To anyone reading this.  After years of trying to clear my face with dermatologist and OTC remedies, this is the only one that has worked for me.  It&#x27;s been two months now and the little \\&quot;bumps\\&quot;. On my face are almost all gone.  Retina A didn&#x27;t get rid of them and chemical peels did not get rid of them.  As a plus the lines under my eyes are gone.  I love this cream.  Sorry to those it didn&#x27;t work for.</li>
            <li> When I first stared using this product I was very pleased, but after about a week I started getting irritation under my eyes and soon I started seeing wrinkles that were not there before. I was hoping these wrinkles would go away after a couple of hours or days, but no, they have only gotten worse. Not only that but I have also noticed under eye bags and major puffiness. This is the first time I get under eye bags and I am majorly disappointed. They will not go away. My milia has only slightly improved, but I think I was better of before. I wold rather have the milia around my eyes as it used to be than bare with these wrinkles and under eye bags.</li>
            <li> This product does irritate the skin like others have mentioned.  The first few days, the skin around my eyes were peeling.  I put some vaseline around the surrounding area and that helped a bit.  It did reduce the milia so that it is not so prominent, but they are still there.  Don&#x27;t know if I have any options at this point, so I will continue to use it and see if it helps anymore.  It&#x27;s been a couple of months though already.  The skin no longer peels, but my eye always feel irritated like I have a sunburn.</li>
            <li> I bought this treatment for Milia that are in the middle of my forehead.  So far I have one that seems to have disappeared.  I am happy at this point.  It says that it also helps with wrinkles. I used some under my eye and had a reaction.  I would not recommend using anywhere there is sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So, I read both the good and the bad reviews about this cream.  When it first arrived I hadn&#x27;t experienced anything that the other reviewers were talking about...good or bad...I didn&#x27;t have the burning/irritation nor did I have the amazing immediate results like some reviews said.  I thought I had been duped, it looked like a regular pale yellow cold cream, so what did I do?  I kept using it and used it frequently.  For 3 days I put it on my forehead, cheeks and chin (as instructed, even though I only had a bit of Milia on one of my cheeks) 3 times daily.  Well, I can assure you that IT WORKS.  A thin layer of my skin has been coming off since last night (the end of the 4th day using the cream) and it&#x27;s continuing to peel.  While I am not completely convinced that it&#x27;s going to get rid of (without a little extra help) the bit of Milia that I have, I am convinced that this product works if in no other way than to get rid of the dull top layer of skin to reveal a brighter and fresher face.  Seriously.</li>
            <li> This is the FIRST time I have ever left a product review on Amazon. I have been suffering with Milia around my eyes for about 6 years. I have never been able to remove them myself. I did TONS of internet research and tried EVERYTHING. I finally came across this product....I have been using it for less than a week and almost ALL the milia is gone; I can&#x27;t believe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product...give it a try! THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!!</li>
            <li> I thought it was mild enough to use as an eye cream. Very drying but once you get past the peeling, skin looks great!</li>
            <li> this cream was much too strong for the area underneath my eyes. it created lots of problems. it definitely has a Retin A type of action. But was much too strong for my eye area .......the milia are under my eyes so this didnt work for me. The company was very helpful when I spoke to them ..but still I would not recommend this cream for under eyes.</li>
