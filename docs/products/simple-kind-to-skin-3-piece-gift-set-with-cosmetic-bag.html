            <li>but my skin feels so much better with this over leading brands.</li>
            <li>An amazing price of $10 for full size products...</li>
            <li>/&gt;The face wash is nice, its the moisturizing one, which is perfect for me as I am on retin-a, and need products that aren&#x27;t harsh.</li>
            <li>Does not over dry or over moisturized, the balance is perfect...</li>
            <li>Great for an every day moisturizer for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Nice fresh feel.</li>
            <li>First off I love these products!  </li>
            <li>Light weight on the skin.  </li>
            <li>set comes with a great bag, pretty little designs and its actually good quality.</li>
            <li>The case is beautiful and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the simple products</li>
            <li>Large size cosmetic bag...holds more than I would ever have in a cosmetic bag plus full size products!</li>
            <li>Its the perfect size for travel sized products and a few full size as well.</li>
            <li>, that is extremely temperamental with any change in product, however my skin loved these products from day one!  </li>
            <li>Great skin care products gentle for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>All you need for a perfectly clean face.  </li>
            <li>Good facial care line.</li>
            <li>Bought it and loved the items...very gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Very good for someone looking to save a few bucks!</li>
            <li>But, it works  great for everyday moisturizing for someone that doesn&#x27;t have a peeling face.</li>
            <li>that I&#x27;ve had this for six weeks, I can write an honest review of this 3 piece set of Simple products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>definitely worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a dedicated user of Simple Sensitive Wipes and in needing more I saw they were included in this set!!</li>
            <li>Pretty case</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s more than 3/4 of the bottle left.</li>
            <li>Its not heavy by any means, absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much</li>
            <li>My daughter (15) absolutely loves this and uses it morning and night.</li>
            <li>really like the face wash</li>
            <li>My husband appreciated the kit as well.</li>
            <li>It works great, not too big or small for what I need to include.</li>
            <li>I should have done my research first as my face felt stingy and got red right away.</li>
            <li>Decent size.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bag is nice and big and I add a couple of other skin care products in there and throw it in my suitcase</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used almost the whole bottle of the face wash, and it cleared my face up within two weeks, and it has stayed clear.</li>
            <li>This is one of the few moisturizers I have been able to use on my combination skin that doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li>However, I was very pleasantly surprised that these wipes are moist, soft and super gentle, yet remove every last drop of makeup, mascara, shadow, everything!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This cute little bag set is supposed to be for sensitive skin with \\&quot;no harsh irritants&#x27;  as it says on the outside of the box</li>
            <li>They completely melt the waterproof mascara off my eyes within seconds.</li>
            <li>I have pretty dry to oily skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Simple skincare line of products.</li>
            <li>I am 30 years old, female, combination oily/dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The generous bottle of Sensitive lotion by Simple also goes on all over!!</li>
            <li>Buyers should be aware that Ingredients in the facial wash and facial wipes both include Methylparaben, though some of this brand&#x27;s other products do not.</li>

            <li> its been a year since i bought this and im still using the moisturizer and the case it came in i use for all my makeup now :D its great definatly a good starter kit</li>
            <li> Great skin care products gentle for sensitive skin.  Bag is generous size for travel.  I highly recommend the Simple skincare line of products.</li>
            <li> First off I love these products!  Thank you so much</li>
            <li> This is perfect for travel as a mini skin care regimen when you need to take off makeup and moisturize. The wipes take off everything and I wear a lot of makeup so I appreciate it and the cleanser is effective. This is one of the few moisturizers I have been able to use on my combination skin that doesn&#x27;t break me out. The bag is nice and big and I add a couple of other skin care products in there and throw it in my suitcase and I am good to go. Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect pack for traveling!  It has facial wash, face wipes and moisturizer.  All you need for a perfectly clean face.  The wipes are great to use on the go in your purse or gym bag.</li>
            <li> I am a dedicated user of Simple Sensitive Wipes and in needing more I saw they were included in this set!! The generous sized Sensitive Skin cleanser was included and it has become the best shower cleanser for all over. The generous bottle of Sensitive lotion by Simple also goes on all over!! The best my skin has been!! I ordered another set!! Pretty case it comes in fits in the side of my chair abd holds my phone, remote, pens etc. Very good quality and pretty!</li>
            <li> I am 30 years old, female, combination oily/dry sensitive skin. I am currently on retin-a for severe cystic acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;ve had this for six weeks, I can write an honest review of this 3 piece set of Simple products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set comes with a great bag, pretty little designs and its actually good quality. Great for a makeup bag or to travel with your skincare. Decent size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The face wash is nice, its the moisturizing one, which is perfect for me as I am on retin-a, and need products that aren&#x27;t harsh. When my skin is just to tender for anything else, this face washis my go to. WWorks great with a clarisonic as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer is ok. Its not heavy by any means, absorbs quickly. Great for an every day moisturizer for sensitive skin. As I mentioned before, I&#x27;m on retin-a, so I need a really heavy moisturizer, and this one is not quite emollient enough for seriously dry skin. But, it works  great for everyday moisturizing for someone that doesn&#x27;t have a peeling face. My daughter (15) absolutely loves this and uses it morning and night. Its been 6 weeks and there&#x27;s more than 3/4 of the bottle left. So it will last a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The makeup wipes are my HG makeup wipes from now on. They have zero burning even on my terribly dry skin. I&#x27;ve never found a makeup wipe before Simple that didn&#x27;t burn. And I&#x27;ve also tried their other makeup wipes, which burned and felt too dry. However, I was very pleasantly surprised that these wipes are moist, soft and super gentle, yet remove every last drop of makeup, mascara, shadow, everything! They completely melt the waterproof mascara off my eyes within seconds. Absolutely wonderful. I&#x27;ll never buy a different makeup wipe again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all im very pleased with this purchase. An amazing price of $10 for full size products...definitely worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my acne, by itself I&#x27;m not sure these helped, as the retin-a is what I believe is making my acne dissapear. But, the products in this set aren&#x27;t making my acne worse :) and for anyone using harsh products, like me, hopefully this will help you decide if this set or one of the included products will work for you!</li>
            <li> Love the bag,  I use it a lot for travel.  Its the perfect size for travel sized products and a few full size as well.</li>
            <li> really like the face wash but personally didn&#x27;t care for the smell of the moisturizer so I passed it to my daughter.</li>
            <li> On a business trip I forgot my toiletries case and drugstore happened to have a smaller size of this product. Bought it and loved the items...very gentle on my sensitive skin. Found this and bought two of them. Very pleased with purchase! Large size cosmetic bag...holds more than I would ever have in a cosmetic bag plus full size products! Great deal!</li>
            <li> Great face wash. I would recommend it to anyone that has issues with breakouts. Cleanser doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out. Nice fresh feel.</li>
            <li> The case is beautiful and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the simple products</li>
            <li> Good facial care line. Not oily and leaves skin feeling smooth and refreshed!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, that is extremely temperamental with any change in product, however my skin loved these products from day one!  This product is fantastic! Light weight on the skin.  Does not over dry or over moisturized, the balance is perfect...it&#x27;s simple...does not cause skin irritation.  Product comes in well made/constructed cosmetic bag that is cute and versatile.</li>
            <li> I bought this for traveling. It works great, not too big or small for what I need to include. Simple is GOOD!!</li>
            <li> This product is less expensive than comparable products in stores but my skin feels so much better with this over leading brands.</li>

            <li> Buyers should be aware that Ingredients in the facial wash and facial wipes both include Methylparaben, though some of this brand&#x27;s other products do not. This cute little bag set is supposed to be for sensitive skin with \\&quot;no harsh irritants&#x27;  as it says on the outside of the box and I mistakenly assumed it would not contain parabens.  I should have done my research first as my face felt stingy and got red right away. (I used the wash.) Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Best skincare line ever! I have pretty dry to oily skin. I&#x27;ve used almost the whole bottle of the face wash, and it cleared my face up within two weeks, and it has stayed clear. I do struggle with lightweight acne, so this is great. The wipes are great for taking makeup of, and the moisturizer does an amazing job, my face still feels Dewey in the morning and I love that! Very good for someone looking to save a few bucks!</li>
