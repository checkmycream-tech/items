            <li>Good item.</li>
            <li>Good product at a good price.</li>
            <li>Price is right and it&#x27;s the perfect size.</li>
            <li>Excellent product and very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>On the positive side, this fits my Col. Conks 2.25 oz shave soap perfectly.  </li>
            <li>it seems kind of plastic too.  </li>
            <li>He says it does not grab the shaving cream like ceramic and the bubbles just don&#x27;t form into a nice lather.</li>
            <li>Very attractive, very impractical, like Paris Hilton in 2001....</li>
            <li>Now I have a nice expresso cup, not a shaving bowl.</li>
            <li>But made a nice candle out of it ha ha</li>
            <li>Very satisfied that I didn&#x27;t spend more on a shaving bowl.</li>
            <li>and this is perfect to pack away, heats up quickly for that perfect wet shave.</li>
            <li>It generally seems to be the perfect size for making a nice lather and getting it in the brush.</li>
            <li>Outer bowl was cool to touch yet brush wash warm and water and brush was still nice and warm.</li>
            <li>If you have a tube of Prososo shaving cream, you&#x27;ll be able to whip up a healthy batch of warm lather within seconds.</li>
            <li>Its great if you like a hot shave, which I do.  </li>
            <li>Makes a great hot lather for your face.</li>
            <li>ordered this, knowing that some reviewers expressed their dissatisfaction with the size of the bowl, because it was very cheap</li>
            <li>It fits easily into the hand and has a nice open mouth and the depth of the bowl is perfect for keeping your hands out of the bowl while lathering a shaving brush.</li>
            <li>Better as a drinking cup than a shaving mug.</li>
            <li>The opening at the top of the bowl is 2.5 inches.</li>
            <li>well...I wanted this for my travel kit, so I&#x27;m thinking that a bar of hotel soap should fit nicely and give me the functionality I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li>The most this can do for you is show you your reflection.</li>
            <li>Having said that, you might be able to use it with shaving cream from a tube but that&#x27;s not what is being advertised here.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend, who also wet-shaves, chose to go to Goodwill and pick up a 60cent mug to lather in, and that holds heat way better than this bowl.</li>
            <li>On top of it, the edge clangs on the handle</li>
            <li>I should have paid more attention to the size.</li>
            <li>Couldnt be better  </li>
            <li>It keeps the water warm and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It would be ideal for shaving if it were larger, but it is what it is.  </li>
            <li>There are no &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; shaving puck dimensions but from experience, I can tell you many won&#x27;t fit in this bowl (unless you want to break them apart).  </li>
            <li>it holds a good bit of heat and with a medium boar brush, it really lets me whip up lather ....</li>
            <li>Works great, shape fits nicely in the hand and foams soap to creamy fluff.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, it holds about 75 - 100 paper clips and this is fine with me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight and compact for travel.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if is going to fit the soap.</li>
            <li>But nicely made, nice clean design and at a low price.</li>
            <li>Works great and the size works well for limited counter space.</li>
            <li>With my smaller brush I can still make good lather.</li>
            <li>The mug/bowl is fine and keeps clean and is durable and all, but it doesn&#x27;t hold on to heat nearly as much as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>While it is very attractive, it does not have anywhere near enough room to build a lather or really perform as a shaving bowl.</li>
            <li>After reading a good portion of the previous reviews, I was pretty sure I knew what I was getting.</li>
            <li>So, now it is used as a tea cup for my morning tea, and yes, it&#x27;s exceptionally good at containing the heat of the tea without making the outside of the cup hot.</li>
            <li>when i get out I add a little more hot water and it makes a realy good lather.</li>
            <li>It is nice and shiny and wipes down easily after use to keep it clean.</li>
            <li>This is a great little shaving bowl.  </li>
            <li>Cleanup would be fast, and the bowl is extremely light and portable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this fit the bill and is also very lite, as it is plastic.</li>
            <li>Light stainless.</li>
            <li>It might be on the light side, but what do expect for a stainless product under $20?</li>
            <li>for $4 it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>Seller was cooperative, receptive and willing for us to return the Item for a full refund.  </li>
            <li>Its worth it</li>
            <li>The quality is good but it is pretty small, too small for most shaving soap pucks but it works great for pre heating and soaking my shaving brush.</li>
            <li>Though I believe it would make a fine thimble, I think the seller intentionally provided photos without any decent frame of reference as to size.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just about right.</li>
            <li>It fits right into the palm of my hand.</li>
            <li>Yes this bowl is smaller than normal ones but it is still a bargain and good quality.</li>
            <li>just* fit a normal puck of shaving soap into this bowl&#x27;s diameter</li>
            <li>This little gem is perfect because she can pour the soap into the bowl, bake and send it back to me.</li>
            <li>Looks great, just big enough to hold a puck of soap.</li>
            <li>This bowl - or other shaving bowls of it&#x27;s type - aren&#x27;t ideal for home use, where you&#x27;ll need a larger vessel, like a mug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it does require a bit of technique such as wiping the brush on the side to gather lather and then whip some more.</li>
            <li>I fill it with hot water before I get into the shower and place my brush in,</li>
            <li>Today put hot water in the bowl and placed the brush in the hot water while in the shower.</li>
            <li>Ok purchase, probably should have ordered larger cup size.</li>
            <li>Still it&#x27;s pretty and usable</li>
            <li>I should have read the reviews first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it fits the Colonel Conk shaving pucks pretty well.  </li>
            <li>The larger version is ok.  </li>
            <li>The dimensions shown are accurate (note that they are metric), and as a previous reviewer pointed out it is polished and shiny top to bottom.</li>
            <li>I will take my warm wet brush, swirl it on the soap, then move to my real soap dish and whip up my lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So small that I actually laughed when I opened the package.</li>
            <li>I got a small glass bowl from wallmart works good</li>
            <li>it is good quality just did not realize it is soooo small</li>
            <li>It is a very nice stainless bowl, but it is nowhere near big enough to be a shaving bowl.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many shavers who travel rely on an electric razor or cartridges - and these options are certainly portable, although you&#x27;re going to pay for the convenience.</li>
            <li>It is a great bowl at the right price; however, it is too small for daily use.</li>
            <li>Really nice little shave bowl</li>
            <li>Nice little shaving cup.</li>
            <li>I have to say that I really like the bowel.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t really a shaving bowl.</li>
            <li>It is really lightweight, no way it is &amp;#34;insulated&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>So much easier to use than the mug that I was using.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a new shave bowl to create some wicked lathers in when low-and-behold I saw my first ever stainless steel shaving bowl.</li>
            <li>As a result, the lather is cool by the time I get to my second pass.</li>
            <li>Go out and buy one of those giant coffee cups for the same price, they work a lot better.</li>
            <li>Keeping that in mind, I&#x27;d highly recommend this bowel for your lather-making needs.</li>
            <li>just chrome plated plastic, its OK looking, but get what you pay for on this one, don&#x27;t know how long it will last</li>
            <li>Overall, not entirely regrettable as a purchase, but I definitely will elect to purchase an old mug next time instead.</li>
            <li>The other reviews are accurate.  </li>
            <li>I shave in the shower and live in the South.</li>
            <li>Overall it sucks as a shave bowl but good for target practice.</li>
            <li>I can see so many other uses for them such as a tea or espresso cup,</li>
            <li>but it appears to be hollow, also its not as cool looking as I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>light stainless you pay for what you get, to small for lathering</li>
            <li>:) For the actual size i would say i have average sized hands</li>
            <li>Unless you have an extra large brush, this will not work well.</li>
            <li>B00B1TKY8C SimplyBeautiful Basic 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush]])</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even mind that it took nearly a month to arrive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m therefore not returning it for credit, but would advise anyone who wants to use this as your daily &amp;#34;in home&amp;#34; soap bowl move on to another option.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to receive the item</li>
            <li>This is so much smaller in real life than it looks in the picture.</li>
            <li>Before purchasing this, I&#x27;d been lathering arko shaving soap directly on my face with a shaving brush.</li>
            <li>Only useful if you have a matching tiny shaving brush.</li>
            <li>Good quality metal but much too small!!!!</li>
            <li>the top rim of the bowl is rough with some areas feeling sharp.</li>
            <li>if I didn&#x27;t have to trim down the soap I&#x27;d give it 5 stars but a mug bowl should fit standard soaps</li>
            <li>The actual bowl I received is evenly finished with a fairly high polish.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s Too small to fit anything.  </li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re someone who enjoys a quality wet shave on the road, this bowl is exactly what you&#x27;re going to need.</li>
            <li>This item was shipped from China and communication was very clear prior to and after purchase that it might take up to 5-6 weeks to arrive.  </li>
            <li>Its cheap and lets me lather up the small samples of shaving soaps and creams I tend to accumulate while letting me keep a larger bowl for something I use regularly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t need anything too big that wouldn&#x27;t fit on one of the small shelves in the shower.</li>
            <li>When I got it, the Brush barely fits.</li>
            <li>I have a studio apt and small bathroom, so I could use a few space savers where I can.  </li>
            <li>BUT NOT NEARLY AS LONG AS THE ESTIMATED DELIVERY SAID IT WOULD.</li>
            <li>I know they listed dimensions, but it&#x27;s way too small to be useful.</li>
            <li>This creates a little bit of a mess and wastes some of the nice lather.</li>

            <li> This is a great little shaving bowl.  </li>
            <li> Cleanup would be fast, and the bowl is extremely light and portable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this fit the bill and is also very lite, as it is plastic.</li>
            <li> Light stainless.</li>
            <li> It might be on the light side, but what do expect for a stainless product under $20?</li>
            <li> for $4 it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> Seller was cooperative, receptive and willing for us to return the Item for a full refund.  </li>
            <li> Its worth it</li>
            <li> The quality is good but it is pretty small, too small for most shaving soap pucks but it works great for pre heating and soaking my shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Though I believe it would make a fine thimble, I think the seller intentionally provided photos without any decent frame of reference as to size.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just about right.</li>
            <li> It fits right into the palm of my hand.</li>
            <li> Yes this bowl is smaller than normal ones but it is still a bargain and good quality.</li>
            <li> just* fit a normal puck of shaving soap into this bowl&#x27;s diameter</li>
            <li> This little gem is perfect because she can pour the soap into the bowl, bake and send it back to me.</li>
            <li> Looks great, just big enough to hold a puck of soap.</li>
            <li> This bowl - or other shaving bowls of it&#x27;s type - aren&#x27;t ideal for home use, where you&#x27;ll need a larger vessel, like a mug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it does require a bit of technique such as wiping the brush on the side to gather lather and then whip some more.</li>
            <li> I fill it with hot water before I get into the shower and place my brush in,</li>
            <li> Today put hot water in the bowl and placed the brush in the hot water while in the shower.</li>
            <li> Ok purchase, probably should have ordered larger cup size.</li>
            <li> Still it&#x27;s pretty and usable</li>
            <li> I should have read the reviews first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it fits the Colonel Conk shaving pucks pretty well.  </li>
            <li> The larger version is ok.  </li>
            <li> The dimensions shown are accurate (note that they are metric), and as a previous reviewer pointed out it is polished and shiny top to bottom.</li>
            <li> I will take my warm wet brush, swirl it on the soap, then move to my real soap dish and whip up my lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So small that I actually laughed when I opened the package.</li>
            <li> I got a small glass bowl from wallmart works good</li>
            <li> it is good quality just did not realize it is soooo small</li>
            <li> It is a very nice stainless bowl, but it is nowhere near big enough to be a shaving bowl.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many shavers who travel rely on an electric razor or cartridges - and these options are certainly portable, although you&#x27;re going to pay for the convenience.</li>
            <li> It is a great bowl at the right price; however, it is too small for daily use.</li>
            <li> Really nice little shave bowl</li>
            <li> Nice little shaving cup.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I really like the bowel.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t really a shaving bowl.</li>
            <li> It is really lightweight, no way it is &amp;#34;insulated&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> So much easier to use than the mug that I was using.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a new shave bowl to create some wicked lathers in when low-and-behold I saw my first ever stainless steel shaving bowl.</li>
            <li> As a result, the lather is cool by the time I get to my second pass.</li>
            <li> Go out and buy one of those giant coffee cups for the same price, they work a lot better.</li>
            <li> Keeping that in mind, I&#x27;d highly recommend this bowel for your lather-making needs.</li>
            <li> just chrome plated plastic, its OK looking, but get what you pay for on this one, don&#x27;t know how long it will last</li>
            <li> Overall, not entirely regrettable as a purchase, but I definitely will elect to purchase an old mug next time instead.</li>
            <li> The other reviews are accurate.  </li>
            <li> I shave in the shower and live in the South.</li>
            <li> Overall it sucks as a shave bowl but good for target practice.</li>
            <li> I can see so many other uses for them such as a tea or espresso cup,</li>
            <li> but it appears to be hollow, also its not as cool looking as I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> light stainless you pay for what you get, to small for lathering</li>
            <li> :) For the actual size i would say i have average sized hands</li>
            <li> Unless you have an extra large brush, this will not work well.</li>
            <li> B00B1TKY8C SimplyBeautiful Basic 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush]])</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even mind that it took nearly a month to arrive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m therefore not returning it for credit, but would advise anyone who wants to use this as your daily &amp;#34;in home&amp;#34; soap bowl move on to another option.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to receive the item</li>
            <li> This is so much smaller in real life than it looks in the picture.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this, I&#x27;d been lathering arko shaving soap directly on my face with a shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Only useful if you have a matching tiny shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Good quality metal but much too small!!!!</li>
            <li> the top rim of the bowl is rough with some areas feeling sharp.</li>
            <li> if I didn&#x27;t have to trim down the soap I&#x27;d give it 5 stars but a mug bowl should fit standard soaps</li>
            <li> The actual bowl I received is evenly finished with a fairly high polish.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s Too small to fit anything.  </li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re someone who enjoys a quality wet shave on the road, this bowl is exactly what you&#x27;re going to need.</li>
            <li> This item was shipped from China and communication was very clear prior to and after purchase that it might take up to 5-6 weeks to arrive.  </li>
            <li> Its cheap and lets me lather up the small samples of shaving soaps and creams I tend to accumulate while letting me keep a larger bowl for something I use regularly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t need anything too big that wouldn&#x27;t fit on one of the small shelves in the shower.</li>
            <li> When I got it, the Brush barely fits.</li>
            <li> I have a studio apt and small bathroom, so I could use a few space savers where I can.  </li>
            <li> BUT NOT NEARLY AS LONG AS THE ESTIMATED DELIVERY SAID IT WOULD.</li>
            <li> I know they listed dimensions, but it&#x27;s way too small to be useful.</li>
            <li> This creates a little bit of a mess and wastes some of the nice lather.</li>
            <li> None the less, it gets the job done and the price is very reasonable compared to other shave bowls out there.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a small, well-made, double wall, stainless steel bowl.</li>
            <li> Of course, it wouldn&#x27;t make much sense to use it with hard soap, because there wouldn&#x27;t be enough room for the lather.</li>
            <li> This is a very small bowl, almost too small to fit my Tweezerman shave brush in (my travel brush(, and certainly too small to use with my larger brushes.  </li>
            <li> Too small to get a brush in and make decent suds.</li>
            <li> Too small to get a decent lather in my opinion</li>
            <li> Too small for shaving, but high quality</li>
            <li> It is a bit smaller and lighter than I expected</li>
            <li> Was smaller than expected for a shaving cup</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t recommend the smaller version due to the &amp;#34;larger&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I needed an insulated shaving mug that was not real large.</li>
            <li> This bowl is far too small for it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> it is a small bowl and if you are used to using large bowls for shaving, then this will take a few shaves before you become accustomed to the size difference.</li>
            <li> However, after trying it myself, I&#x27;m not sure how anyone could get a decent lather in such a small dish.  </li>
            <li> but wish it was a little bigger.</li>
            <li> Its also a little pricey for a simple bowl.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done, but is a little smaller than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> but I thought that it would have been a little bit bigger.</li>
            <li> A little smaller than a tennis ball.</li>
            <li> The standard-size shaving soap (like Colonel Conk Glycerin) is roughly 3 inches.</li>
            <li> This is too small to be called a shaving bowl, its barely a teacup.</li>
            <li> The mouth is quite narrow and the bowl is deep.</li>
            <li> Too small, arrived with two dents (&amp;#34;Durable&amp;#34;?), and when shaken it sounds like a broken light-bulb.&lt;br /&gt;Not really worth it, IMO.</li>
            <li> Not to big and not to small.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough to be portable.</li>
            <li> This item is way smaller than I expected and has hardly any weight to it.  </li>
            <li> Demensions are not right for a brush bowl.</li>
            <li> Not too big and not too small!</li>
            <li> So long as you don&#x27;t press the brush too hard down inside the bowel, you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this to shave for a month, maybe a month and a half now.</li>
            <li> Expected it to be small so that was no surprise.</li>
            <li> The bowl is a little over 2 and 1/2 inches in diameter.</li>
            <li> Little bowl for my little shave brush.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even see this item functioning as a shaving bowl due to it being so small.  </li>
            <li> a little slippery though, holds heat well.</li>
            <li> I got the stainless one because I am afraid of breaking it in bathroom.  </li>
            <li> It was a waste of money for me considering the description of the product and photos used.</li>
            <li> It had a few dings around the rim but its metal</li>
            <li> The photos do not accurately demonstrate scale-</li>
            <li> Like others have mentioned this bowl is a little small.</li>
            <li> A little small perhaps, but I knew beforehand what I was buying.</li>
            <li> Upon receiving my order I was rather disappointed, it&#x27;s far too small to work up a proper lather in.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s super annoying to use.</li>
            <li> To small to work a lather up.  </li>
            <li> This is a small bowl that suits my lathering needs</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Wayyyyyy too small.  </li>
            <li> It is so small that I almost can not use.</li>
            <li> It is a bit small  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just way too small.</li>
            <li> but it is too small for my shaving soap</li>
            <li> I buy the Van der Hagen brand and its too small the opening</li>
            <li> Too small for the usual shaving soaps.  </li>
            <li> I ignored the reviews about this dish being too small figuring it would help me save some counter space.  </li>
            <li> The bowels are too small</li>
            <li> Not sure of the heat retaining properties.  </li>
            <li> It is entirely my fault that I purchased something so useless to the purpose I had intended it for.</li>
            <li> this is a small and lightweight bowl.</li>
            <li> ; version being so small.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for something on the small side that wouldn&#x27;t break if dropped or start growing mold.</li>
            <li> While well made, sadly, it is unable to hold a volume of lather necessary for shaving.  </li>
            <li> Item is very very small, i did not expect to be that small.</li>
            <li> The picture makes it look like the lower section has a dull or frosty finish.</li>
            <li> and I have a hard time to lather in it...</li>
            <li> This is very small bowl</li>
            <li> Very small.</li>
            <li> but the cup is so shallow that the lather has nowhere to go.</li>
            <li> Especially at less than $6.50.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut a thin slice of my arko bar off and place it in the bottom.</li>
            <li> He is not happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Got cold on the counter after a few min.</li>
            <li> The mug holds approximately 4 fl oz.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how the manufacturer could fix this without making the bowel inconvenient to use.</li>
            <li> got frustrated and grabbed a 4 inch steel bowl out of the kitchen instead</li>
            <li> I am sick of looking at stuff, I am just going to use a coffee mug for my shaving.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Expected it to be small so that was no surprise. I didn&#x27;t even mind that it took nearly a month to arrive. What WAS a surprise was that it arrived with a substanial dent!</li>
            <li> To small to work a lather up.  Better as a drinking cup than a shaving mug.</li>
            <li> The opening at the top of the bowl is 2.5 inches. The standard-size shaving soap (like Colonel Conk Glycerin) is roughly 3 inches. As with all purchases here on Amazon, I shoulda read the freaking reviews first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well...I wanted this for my travel kit, so I&#x27;m thinking that a bar of hotel soap should fit nicely and give me the functionality I&#x27;m looking for. I&#x27;m therefore not returning it for credit, but would advise anyone who wants to use this as your daily &amp;#34;in home&amp;#34; soap bowl move on to another option.</li>
            <li> The picture made me think it was bigger this led to me ordering a g12 shaving scuttle and this will be for travel.</li>
            <li> Looks great. Great quality. Worked great. Great price.  Very satisfied that I didn&#x27;t spend more on a shaving bowl.</li>
            <li> I have a friend that makes homemade soaps, balms, etc. This little gem is perfect because she can pour the soap into the bowl, bake and send it back to me.</li>
            <li> Probably could be a bit bigger. But nicely made, nice clean design and at a low price. The picture makes it look like the lower section has a dull or frosty finish. The actual bowl I received is evenly finished with a fairly high polish.</li>
            <li> This item was shipped from China and communication was very clear prior to and after purchase that it might take up to 5-6 weeks to arrive.  I was pleasantly surprised to receive the item a week after I ordered it.  The shaving mug is very nice and was well packed.  Excellent product and very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> This is a small bowl that suits my lathering needs nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut a thin slice of my arko bar off and place it in the bottom. I can lather with the bowl in the cup of my hand and brush in the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinses off nicely and looks attractive on the counter.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get this for building your lather.  It&#x27;s Wayyyyyy too small.  Get a big bowl or mug style  piece, or even a scuttle. The most this can do for you is show you your reflection.</li>
            <li> Good quality metal but much too small!!!! It is so small that I almost can not use. Pass this up for a bigger product. .....may be good for a travel size</li>
            <li> Works great, shape fits nicely in the hand and foams soap to creamy fluff.  I can see so many other uses for them such as a tea or espresso cup, let your imagination be your guide.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new shave bowl to create some wicked lathers in when low-and-behold I saw my first ever stainless steel shaving bowl. Upon receiving my order I was rather disappointed, it&#x27;s far too small to work up a proper lather in. So, now it is used as a tea cup for my morning tea, and yes, it&#x27;s exceptionally good at containing the heat of the tea without making the outside of the cup hot.</li>
            <li> Too small, arrived with two dents (&amp;#34;Durable&amp;#34;?), and when shaken it sounds like a broken light-bulb.&lt;br /&gt;Not really worth it, IMO. (Returned)</li>
            <li> It is a bit small  but hey it looks great and does not take any counter space up, that&#x27;s a plus!!</li>
            <li> This bowl - or other shaving bowls of it&#x27;s type - aren&#x27;t ideal for home use, where you&#x27;ll need a larger vessel, like a mug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as a portable shaving bowl, the size and shape is ideal. Of course, it wouldn&#x27;t make much sense to use it with hard soap, because there wouldn&#x27;t be enough room for the lather. If you have a tube of Prososo shaving cream, you&#x27;ll be able to whip up a healthy batch of warm lather within seconds. Cleanup would be fast, and the bowl is extremely light and portable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many shavers who travel rely on an electric razor or cartridges - and these options are certainly portable, although you&#x27;re going to pay for the convenience. But if you&#x27;re someone who enjoys a quality wet shave on the road, this bowl is exactly what you&#x27;re going to need.</li>
            <li> Piece of junk.  Do not buy.</li>
            <li> Like others have mentioned this bowl is a little small. I also thought it would be heavier but it appears to be hollow, also its not as cool looking as I was hoping for. None the less, it gets the job done and the price is very reasonable compared to other shave bowls out there.</li>
            <li> This is very small bowl and I have a hard time to lather in it...it seems kind of plastic too.  for $4 it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> ***Do not buy this if you use solid shaving soap***&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this, knowing that some reviewers expressed their dissatisfaction with the size of the bowl, because it was very cheap and I wanted something to travel with. Big mistake! This is so much smaller in real life than it looks in the picture. I can *just* fit a normal puck of shaving soap into this bowl&#x27;s diameter but the cup is so shallow that the lather has nowhere to go. Having said that, you might be able to use it with shaving cream from a tube but that&#x27;s not what is being advertised here. I have no issue with the quality of the cup and it looks as good in person as it does in the pictures. It&#x27;s just way too small.</li>
            <li> Very good shaving mug ... it holds a good bit of heat and with a medium boar brush, it really lets me whip up lather .... it does require a bit of technique such as wiping the brush on the side to gather lather and then whip some more. Size helps reduce the clutter of shaving implements on my counter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a shaving cup...It&#x27;s tea cup....really.....it&#x27;s designed for drinking tea.&lt;br /&gt;I got frustrated and grabbed a 4 inch steel bowl out of the kitchen instead and it worked great.</li>
            <li> I thought this bowl was a shanving bowl. When I got it, the Brush barely fits. Not usable for brush shaving. It was a waste of money for me considering the description of the product and photos used. If it was three times the size, I would buy it.</li>
            <li> I like the size. It&#x27;s just about right. Not to big and not to small. It&#x27;s light weight and compact for travel. I like it!</li>
            <li> I got the stainless one because I am afraid of breaking it in bathroom.  Really nice little shave bowl but wish it was a little bigger.</li>
            <li> The bowl is great but it is too small for my shaving soap I buy the Van der Hagen brand and its too small the opening is 2 7/16&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;  if I didn&#x27;t have to trim down the soap I&#x27;d give it 5 stars but a mug bowl should fit standard soaps</li>
            <li> just chrome plated plastic, its OK looking, but get what you pay for on this one, don&#x27;t know how long it will last but for now it will do.</li>
            <li> Too small for the usual shaving soaps.  However, I will keep it as it is an excellent paper clip holder.  It would be ideal for shaving if it were larger, but it is what it is.  Anyway, it holds about 75 - 100 paper clips and this is fine with me.  It should not be marketed as a shaving container, but as an office supply item.</li>
            <li> This is too small to be called a shaving bowl, its barely a teacup. Its also a little pricey for a simple bowl. Overall it sucks as a shave bowl but good for target practice. Go out and buy one of those giant coffee cups for the same price, they work a lot better.</li>
            <li> light stainless you pay for what you get, to small for lathering I would rather a larger mug or bowl next time</li>
            <li> It does the job I purchased it for. A little small perhaps, but I knew beforehand what I was buying.</li>
            <li> I use this mug to soak and to heat up my Arko shaving soap stick. It keeps the water warm and it is easy to clean. The bowl is a little over 2 and 1/2 inches in diameter.</li>
            <li> This wont work as a shaving mug, but as an insulated espresso demitasse or tea cup it works great. Too small for shaving, but high quality</li>
            <li> Demensions are not right for a brush bowl. Unless you have an extra large brush, this will not work well. The mouth is quite narrow and the bowl is deep. Also took forever to get here. I almost forgot I ordered it.</li>
            <li> I have a studio apt and small bathroom, so I could use a few space savers where I can.  I ignored the reviews about this dish being too small figuring it would help me save some counter space.  However, after trying it myself, I&#x27;m not sure how anyone could get a decent lather in such a small dish.  I&#x27;ll be returning it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this to shave for a month, maybe a month and a half now. I have to say that I really like the bowel. It generally seems to be the perfect size for making a nice lather and getting it in the brush. It&#x27;s small enough to be portable. I can keep my razor in it when it&#x27;s not being used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I do like the size of the bowel, the lather does sometimes spill out of it. This creates a little bit of a mess and wastes some of the nice lather. I&#x27;m not sure how the manufacturer could fix this without making the bowel inconvenient to use. So long as you don&#x27;t press the brush too hard down inside the bowel, you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem. Keeping that in mind, I&#x27;d highly recommend this bowel for your lather-making needs.</li>
            <li> Great travel mug. Convienient size, fit perfectly in my shaving kit. Easy to clean. Heat transfer to shaving cream excellent.</li>
            <li> Thought it was a soap mug.  But it&#x27;s Too small to fit anything.  I don&#x27;t even know what it&#x27;s for.  My cat uses it as a toy now</li>
            <li> The bowels are too small</li>
            <li> Little bowl for my little shave brush. It also fits wonderfully into a travel shave kit. It had a few dings around the rim but its metal so it survived what ever it was it encountered. I use it to soak my brush while I&#x27;m showering and it does in fact hold water, well. :) For the actual size i would say i have average sized hands and i can reach the rim with my finger tips while it sits in my palm.</li>
            <li> I bought this bowl because of the price. The quality is good but it is pretty small, too small for most shaving soap pucks but it works great for pre heating and soaking my shaving brush. I fill it with hot water before I get into the shower and place my brush in, when i get out I add a little more hot water and it makes a realy good lather.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this, I&#x27;d been lathering arko shaving soap directly on my face with a shaving brush. The mug/bowl is fine and keeps clean and is durable and all, but it doesn&#x27;t hold on to heat nearly as much as I&#x27;d like. As a result, the lather is cool by the time I get to my second pass. My girlfriend, who also wet-shaves, chose to go to Goodwill and pick up a 60cent mug to lather in, and that holds heat way better than this bowl. Overall, not entirely regrettable as a purchase, but I definitely will elect to purchase an old mug next time instead.</li>
            <li> Good bowl.  It is a bit smaller and lighter than I expected but otherwise it does as it&#x27;s advertised, plus it looks great on the counter!</li>
            <li> I purchased this cup for my husband so I could have the custard cup he was using to mix his shaving cream with returned to my kitchen. He is not happy with the product. No issues with the manufacturing. He says it does not grab the shaving cream like ceramic and the bubbles just don&#x27;t form into a nice lather.</li>
            <li> This bowl is far too small for it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> Good item. Gets the job done, but is a little smaller than I&#x27;d like. Still a great product for the price.</li>
            <li> I needed an insulated shaving mug that was not real large. this fit the bill and is also very lite, as it is plastic.</li>
            <li> Very small. Too small to get a brush in and make decent suds.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the tube shave creams.</li>
            <li> Awesome for the price</li>
            <li> The other reviews are accurate.  This is a very small bowl, almost too small to fit my Tweezerman shave brush in (my travel brush(, and certainly too small to use with my larger brushes.  It was delivered as described and in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> Only had this for two days. The quality is great! Seems like it might be a bit small and deep at first. Works great and the size works well for limited counter space. Today put hot water in the bowl and placed the brush in the hot water while in the shower. Outer bowl was cool to touch yet brush wash warm and water and brush was still nice and warm.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t really a shaving bowl. It is a very nice stainless bowl, but it is nowhere near big enough to be a shaving bowl. While it is very attractive, it does not have anywhere near enough room to build a lather or really perform as a shaving bowl. Very attractive, very impractical, like Paris Hilton in 2001....</li>
            <li> Item is very very small, i did not expect to be that small. I think it&#x27;s 2&amp;#34;x2&amp;#34;. I don&#x27;t know if is going to fit the soap. We&#x27;ll see!</li>
            <li> Great for traveling, and I can tuck my brush in it for space in the suitcase. It is nice and shiny and wipes down easily after use to keep it clean.</li>
            <li> Great cup. Light stainless. Not sure of the heat retaining properties.  Got cold on the counter after a few min.</li>
            <li> Nice little shaving cup. Probably meant for mixing shaving cream or soap and not for holding soap disk. Ok purchase, probably should have ordered larger cup size.</li>
            <li> I know they listed dimensions, but it&#x27;s way too small to be useful. I can&#x27;t even think of a way to repurpose it.</li>
            <li> I like it but I thought that it would have been a little bit bigger. Still it&#x27;s pretty and usable and I LIKE IT!</li>
            <li> So small that I actually laughed when I opened the package. Returned the item.</li>
            <li> I have no one to blame but myself. I should have read the reviews. Now I have a nice expresso cup, not a shaving bowl. Yes, they give you the size, in cm. I am sick of looking at stuff, I am just going to use a coffee mug for my shaving.</li>
            <li> Yes this bowl is smaller than normal ones but it is still a bargain and good quality. With my smaller brush I can still make good lather. If you have a bigger, thicker brush this wont work. definitely great for travel.</li>
            <li> I should have read the reviews first. It is entirely my fault that I purchased something so useless to the purpose I had intended it for. Though I believe it would make a fine thimble, I think the seller intentionally provided photos without any decent frame of reference as to size. Seller should be reprimanded and ashamed.</li>
            <li> I like the double-wall insulation on this shaving bowl.  It fits easily into the hand and has a nice open mouth and the depth of the bowl is perfect for keeping your hands out of the bowl while lathering a shaving brush.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a durable bowl and from the description, this bowl did not disappoint. I&#x27;ve dropped a couple of time and not a scratch!! Escali brush fits and can lather up a storm.</li>
            <li> Price is right and it&#x27;s the perfect size. Not too big and not too small! A little smaller than a tennis ball.</li>
            <li> This item is way smaller than I expected and has hardly any weight to it.  I should have read the reviews and examined the pictures.  I don&#x27;t even see this item functioning as a shaving bowl due to it being so small.  Please avoid.  Feels like an aluminum can.</li>
            <li> I BELIEVE IT CAME FROM CHINA... YES, SHIPPED FROM CHINA... SO IT TOOK A WHILE TO RECIEVE BUT NOT NEARLY AS LONG AS THE ESTIMATED DELIVERY SAID IT WOULD. BUT ITS GREAT, USE IT FOR MY SHAVING BRUSH AND ITS THE PERFECT DEPTH.</li>
            <li> Looks great, just big enough to hold a puck of soap. Will need a different bowl to whip up a lather. I got a small glass bowl from wallmart works good a little slippery though, holds heat well.</li>
            <li> Bowl is tiny, think tea-cup size. Only useful if you have a matching tiny shaving brush. On top of it, the edge clangs on the handle so it&#x27;s super annoying to use. I tossed mine out.</li>
            <li> This is for the &amp;#34;High: 52mm/2.05&amp;#34; Diameter: 75mm/2.88&amp;#34; version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this is a small and lightweight bowl. There are no &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; shaving puck dimensions but from experience, I can tell you many won&#x27;t fit in this bowl (unless you want to break them apart).  I&#x27;ve found it fits the Colonel Conk shaving pucks pretty well.  The Colonel Conk shaving pucks are the smallest I have - I can&#x27;t recall of any brand that&#x27;s smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend the smaller version due to the &amp;#34;larger&amp;#34; version being so small.  The larger version is ok.  Its cheap and lets me lather up the small samples of shaving soaps and creams I tend to accumulate while letting me keep a larger bowl for something I use regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last item - the top rim of the bowl is rough with some areas feeling sharp.</li>
            <li> After reading a good portion of the previous reviews, I was pretty sure I knew what I was getting. I was right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a small, well-made, double wall, stainless steel bowl. It might be on the light side, but what do expect for a stainless product under $20? The dimensions shown are accurate (note that they are metric), and as a previous reviewer pointed out it is polished and shiny top to bottom. It fits right into the palm of my hand. For those of you that crave visual input, I&#x27;m going to post a picture of the bowl with a puck of shaving soap (4.2 oz). ([[ASIN:B00CO68RJO Jock Soap&#x27;s Shave Puck]] )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for something on the small side that wouldn&#x27;t break if dropped or start growing mold. I shave in the shower and live in the South. I face lather and use a smallish brush ([[ASIN:B00B1TKY8C SimplyBeautiful Basic 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush]]) so I didn&#x27;t need anything too big that wouldn&#x27;t fit on one of the small shelves in the shower. This fits the bill. Especially at less than $6.50.</li>
            <li> On the positive side, this fits my Col. Conks 2.25 oz shave soap perfectly.  Since I am only using this to hold my soap, it will serve it&#x27;s purpose.  I will take my warm wet brush, swirl it on the soap, then move to my real soap dish and whip up my lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No way you can lather in this cup. It is really lightweight, no way it is &amp;#34;insulated&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Too small to get a decent lather in my opinion</li>
            <li> It is a great bowl at the right price; however, it is too small for daily use. Buy this size bowl if you are looking for a travel shaving bowl and are using a smaller size travel brush</li>
            <li> The mug holds approximately 4 fl oz.  While well made, sadly, it is unable to hold a volume of lather necessary for shaving.  Seller was cooperative, receptive and willing for us to return the Item for a full refund.  We decided to keep the Item and find another use for it, as returning the Item via International Post is a hassle we wish to avoid.  We&#x27;ve decided from this point forward to purchase only from Seller&#x27;s located within the Continental USA, the &amp;#34;lower 48&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is a great little shaving bowl.  So much easier to use than the mug that I was using.  Its great if you like a hot shave, which I do.  fill it with the hottest water you can and let it sit for about 15 min.  Makes a great hot lather for your face.</li>
            <li> I have seen thimbles bigger than this.  I should have paid more attention to the size.</li>
            <li> it is good quality just did not realize it is soooo small</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t receive what was Pictured. But made a nice candle out of it ha ha</li>
            <li> Couldnt be better  it took a llittle while to get but look at the price. Its worth it</li>
            <li> The photos do not accurately demonstrate scale- it is a small bowl and if you are used to using large bowls for shaving, then this will take a few shaves before you become accustomed to the size difference. For me, this is what I wanted-I travel and this is perfect to pack away, heats up quickly for that perfect wet shave. The bowl is sturdy, well made and great to use.</li>
            <li> Was smaller than expected for a shaving cup</li>
            <li> Good product at a good price.</li>
