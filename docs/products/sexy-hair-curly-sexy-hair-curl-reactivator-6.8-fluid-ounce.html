            <li>Love the product but it won&#x27;t spray.</li>
            <li>I love all of the products made for &amp;#34;Curly Sexy Hair &amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>This product revives the curl in your h as it, t as me a away the frizzy, and keeps your h as it looking shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>I purchased this and the curl cream to find out which one I like better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok in a pinch</li>
            <li>I makes my curls more defined.</li>
            <li>The product itself is great and does wonders for my natural curly hair.  </li>
            <li>It works great with my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>The product is really neat and smells good.  </li>
            <li>It creates that &#x27;beach wave&#x27; look, so I was so excited to find a sea salt product by curly sexy hair.  </li>
            <li>This is fine for a once in while use.</li>
            <li>use it daily to freshen up my curls - good stuff - does not make hair sticky</li>
            <li>The times it does, it is hit or miss at most how much streams out.</li>
            <li>Sea salt is a huge trend right now in curly hair products.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite Sexy Hair products, especially with permed and color treated hair.</li>
            <li>and I definitely feel like my hair looks better with it!</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it will</li>
            <li>I tried running the nozzle under hot water in case it had gotten clogged but that didn&#x27;t fix the problem.</li>
            <li>Does exactly as it says - reactivates your curl.</li>
            <li>I have used this product in the past and loved the results.  </li>
            <li>Really curls my hair giving me another curly hair day...</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t the seller return these to the manufacturer to be replaced with the new style packaging?</li>
            <li>I feel like Sexy Hair never lets me down!!</li>
            <li>It seems it was sent from another seller though, and now that it&#x27;s time to get a new bottle of course this seller is the cheapest one and the other seller has the item for several dollars more.</li>
            <li>However, that being said this would probably be my least favorite from the Curly line.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s pretty frustrating, but at least Amazon was good about replacing the first bottle with no hassles.</li>
            <li>I feel the blow dryer helps adds to the curl rather the dryer is on cold, warm or hot.</li>
            <li>Aside from the product arriving a week or more late , it&#x27;s better late than never !</li>
            <li>My hairdresser told me that they changed the packaging to resolve this problem, so this seller is obviously selling bottles with the old packaging.</li>
            <li>Left my hair sticky and when fully dried it make the other products in my hair (Sexy Curly Hair Curl Power Enhancer) crunchy.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair &amp; could not live without this product!  </li>

            <li> I have naturally curly hair &amp; could not live without this product!  </li>
            <li> product worked for a couple of weeks (using a few days a week) but it eventually stopped spraying although I could press the top down as usual, just nothing came out.  </li>
            <li> It just came out in a long stream.  </li>
            <li> my hair is not tightly curled so usually this type of product works to moisten it when it gets flat.  </li>
            <li> I only use it after I wash my hair; I comb my hair upside down after washing it, then spray this all over and blow dry with my hair upside down on low setting &amp; medium heat.</li>
            <li> Let it set for a few minutes before you add &amp;#34;Sexy Curly mouse&amp;#34;  after you add in both products blow dry it on low.</li>
            <li> the trick is put it in wet.</li>
            <li> I then apply hairspray with the hair still flipped over, let it dry for a few seconds</li>
            <li> But it makes your hair really stiff and makes it feel like straw.</li>
            <li> The new packaging is bad.</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews this is clearly a common problem with their stock.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my curls crunchy or tough to manage.</li>
            <li> I use it every time I wash my hair without fail.</li>

            <li> Though this bottle came not in working order, Amazon refunded my money without issue.  I was able to get another bottle and happy for it.  The product is really neat and smells good.  Really curls my hair giving me another curly hair day... just spray and scruntch... holds all day with hairspray of course.</li>
            <li> Left my hair sticky and when fully dried it make the other products in my hair (Sexy Curly Hair Curl Power Enhancer) crunchy.</li>
            <li> The product to great but the spray nozzle just doesn&#x27;t work.  I bought two bottles and neither of them work. If there is a trick to it, I can&#x27;t figure it out.  I have used this product in the past and loved the results.  The new packaging is bad.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!  It helps &amp;#34;make&amp;#34; curls that last all day.  Not stickly, nor smelly! Must be tried to see for oneself!</li>
            <li> Love this Curl Reactivator -&lt;br /&gt;I use it daily to freshen up my curls - good stuff - does not make hair sticky</li>
            <li> I feel like Sexy Hair never lets me down!! However, that being said this would probably be my least favorite from the Curly line.  Sea salt is a huge trend right now in curly hair products.  It creates that &#x27;beach wave&#x27; look, so I was so excited to find a sea salt product by curly sexy hair.  I felt like it definitely create texture and wave but it almost left my hair with a lot of tangles.  The sprayer is also not my favorite it seems to work best when sprayed in spurts.  Overall I still use it every day and I definitely feel like my hair looks better with it!</li>
            <li> I cannot use this. It does not spray out of the can.  Please contact A.S.A.P.  please. So I can get another can to actually be able to use it.</li>
            <li> The product itself is great and does wonders for my natural curly hair.  However, the majority of the time I cannot get the product to come out of the can.  The times it does, it is hit or miss at most how much streams out.</li>
            <li> Great product and great price will order again. It does exactly what it says it will and I couldnt be happier.</li>
            <li> This is fine for a once in while use. But it makes your hair really stiff and makes it feel like straw. It is ok but not what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> PRODUCT ITSELF: 5 Stars&lt;br /&gt;PRODUCT FROM THIS SELLER: 1 Star&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product worked for a couple of weeks (using a few days a week) but it eventually stopped spraying although I could press the top down as usual, just nothing came out.  I tried running the nozzle under hot water in case it had gotten clogged but that didn&#x27;t fix the problem. I contacted Amazon and they replaced the item. It seems it was sent from another seller though, and now that it&#x27;s time to get a new bottle of course this seller is the cheapest one and the other seller has the item for several dollars more. That&#x27;s pretty frustrating, but at least Amazon was good about replacing the first bottle with no hassles. Wonder why this seller is still able to offer this product though...? Based on the reviews this is clearly a common problem with their stock. My hairdresser told me that they changed the packaging to resolve this problem, so this seller is obviously selling bottles with the old packaging. Can&#x27;t the seller return these to the manufacturer to be replaced with the new style packaging? Seems fishy to me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from this problem, I really love this product. It works great with my naturally curly hair. I only use it after I wash my hair; I comb my hair upside down after washing it, then spray this all over and blow dry with my hair upside down on low setting &amp; medium heat. I then apply hairspray with the hair still flipped over, let it dry for a few seconds and then I am good to go. I used to fight with my curls, this stuff makes me love them :)</li>
            <li> Love the product but it won&#x27;t spray. This is my third bottle with the same problem.  Hope they improve the packaging. Ugh!</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 bottles and when I went to use them both bottles would not spray.  It just came out in a long stream.  I have used the product before and loved it.  But because of the performance of these last ones, is the reason for my low rating.</li>
            <li> This product works great the trick is put it in wet. Let it set for a few minutes before you add &amp;#34;Sexy Curly mouse&amp;#34;  after you add in both products blow dry it on low. I feel the blow dryer helps adds to the curl rather the dryer is on cold, warm or hot.</li>
            <li> this works great, refreshes my curls almost immediately! I use it every time I wash my hair without fail. will reorder it again.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite Sexy Hair products, especially with permed and color treated hair. Does exactly as it says - reactivates your curl. I do not wash my hair every day, so I use this product after spritzing my hair with water and then diffusing. It doesn&#x27;t make my curls crunchy or tough to manage.</li>
            <li> I love all of the products made for &amp;#34;Curly Sexy Hair &amp;#34;. Aside from the product arriving a week or more late , it&#x27;s better late than never ! This product revives the curl in your h as it, t as me a away the frizzy, and keeps your h as it looking shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> my hair is not tightly curled so usually this type of product works to moisten it when it gets flat.  I have been using Matrix curl.life reactivator but cannot find it anymore so I tried this one.  Didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair at all.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and the curl cream to find out which one I like better.  Of the two this one came in second.  I didn&#x27;t like the way it squirts out all over as a mousse, and it made my hair feel brittle.  It&#x27;s ok in a pinch and I&#x27;ll use it up but will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair &amp; could not live without this product!  I makes my curls more defined.</li>
