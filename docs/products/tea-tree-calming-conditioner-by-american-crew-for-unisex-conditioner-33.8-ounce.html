            <li>This is absolutely the best mens&#x27; conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>The absolute best nonorganic condition I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair feel amazing and look healthy.</li>
            <li>This product works much better if you use it while showering, and after shampooing, otherwise it just kind of makes your hair hurt.</li>
            <li>Very nice aroma and leaves your hair feeling clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>American crew is the best, smells nice too.</li>
            <li>Best American Crew Product I could find on amazon.</li>
            <li>The smell is outstanding and there is a tingle on your scalp when you use</li>
            <li>Cant rave about this product anymore than I do love it</li>
            <li>Had to buy this online because they don&#x27;t sell at stores any more.</li>
            <li>Pay a bit more for the security of knowing that you are using authentic product.</li>
            <li>Simply the best!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled with my psoriasis for years but this product has helped me significantly!  </li>
            <li>Wow, conditioner is light and creamy, leaves my hair clean and smelling great out of the shower, I now use it on my face to soften my stubble before my shave.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin, including my scalp, and this product helps greatly with that.</li>
            <li>My favorite body wash by far.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this over cheap store bought brands.</li>
            <li>No issues, just glad to have my shampoo and conditioner set back!</li>
            <li>Love the product and is definitely the real thing.</li>
            <li>Not only is the conditioner great for keeping down dandruff, and calming the scalp, but the scent I find compliments the Daily Shampoo better, and lasts longer.</li>
            <li>I also like the large quantities.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also pretty much a life time supply in the larger container, so well worth the money!</li>
            <li>I would recommened this product to anyone who wants to try a new product like American Crew, you will be very happy with this product and any other procuct&#x27;s you buy from American crew.</li>
            <li>Goes very well with the Crew tea trea balancing shampoo</li>
            <li>I really hope Crew doesn&#x27;t discontinue this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I really like the tea tree conditioner, it works well with my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to wear dark clothes again without fear of looking like</li>
            <li>Living with high humidity this conditioner helps keep frizz to a minimum.</li>
            <li>Other than the great smell this product has, a little dab on a loofa will have plenty of suds to clean with compared to other brands where you need twice as much to get the same amount on your body.</li>
            <li>I read other reviews before purchasing the product and I found that this was the only authentic conditioner.</li>
            <li>I would most definitely recommend this to other American Crew users.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Daily Stimulating conditioner for years now, but when looking to purchase a new batch of conditioner I decided to try this one instead.</li>
            <li>They often have ridiculous sales on product, and you&#x27;ll be able to catch American Crew items from 30% to 70% off.</li>
            <li>American Crew Conditioner is great,it leaves your hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t think any other conditioner comes close.</li>
            <li>Well, not long ago, I was coerced into purchasing shampoo and conditioner from Amazon.</li>

            <li> This is absolutely the best mens&#x27; conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. Smells great and leaves your hair looking amazing. Great price for the 33.8 oz bottle. Lasts months.</li>
            <li> Smells great, works well!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is excellent. The smell is outstanding and there is a tingle on your scalp when you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing product</li>

            <li> Had to buy this online because they don&#x27;t sell at stores any more. This product has been discontinued on American Crew&#x27;s Site and in stores. Everything showed up on time and was well packed. No issues, just glad to have my shampoo and conditioner set back!</li>
            <li> You should feel my hair! It&#x27;s luscious!!</li>
            <li> American Crew Conditioner is great,it leaves your hair feeling soft. I would recommened this product to anyone who wants to try a new product like American Crew, you will be very happy with this product and any other procuct&#x27;s you buy from American crew.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with my psoriasis for years but this product has helped me significantly!  I&#x27;m able to wear dark clothes again without fear of looking like I just walked through a snowstorm.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make any difference to my hair. I have dry hair and can the difference if a product is helpful.</li>
            <li> My husband &amp; I both have thick wavey hair &amp; we both like this conditioner. Living with high humidity this conditioner helps keep frizz to a minimum.</li>
            <li> My husband loves Crew products.  It&#x27;s hard to find these products at this price.  I also like the large quantities.</li>
            <li> Well, not long ago, I was coerced into purchasing shampoo and conditioner from Amazon. Rightly so, I thought that was an awful idea, especially since the internet if rife with companies that sell fake health and beauty items at bargain prices. That time, I did receive American Crew product. It was just that the shampoo was separated and I had to keep mixing it.&lt;br /&gt;This time, I didn&#x27;t fare too well, as the conditioner in the bottle isn&#x27;t even tea tree conditioner. It&#x27;s plain conditioner, and I&#x27;m not convinced that it is even American Crew. Perhaps the sticker over the bar code should be a clue. Perhaps the five-star reviews from reviewers who only give out five stars to an odd selection of health and beauty products should be a clue.&lt;br /&gt;In any case, I suggest you go to the mall and scout the salons. They often have ridiculous sales on product, and you&#x27;ll be able to catch American Crew items from 30% to 70% off. Pay a bit more for the security of knowing that you are using authentic product.</li>
            <li> The absolute best nonorganic condition I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Love the product and is definitely the real thing.</li>
            <li> I really like the tea tree conditioner, it works well with my hair. American crew is the best, smells nice too.</li>

            <li> Works great, smells great, love it!</li>
            <li> Wow, conditioner is light and creamy, leaves my hair clean and smelling great out of the shower, I now use it on my face to soften my stubble before my shave. Simply the best!</li>
