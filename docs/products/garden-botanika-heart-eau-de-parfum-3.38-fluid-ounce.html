            <li>This is my favorite perfume.  </li>

            <li>Love, love the scent  but after an hour it disappears.</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite scent for years.  </li>
            <li>I ordered three bottles of my favorite \\&quot;Heart\\&quot;</li>
            <li>So for Christmas, I thought I&#x27;d found something they would &#x27;love&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>I prefer a more exotic aroma.</li>
            <li>My Favorite scent of all time.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a new signature fragrance since Philosophy sold the company and somehow downgraded the beautiful &amp;#34;Grace &amp;#34;scents.</li>
            <li>My favorite summer scent...fresh and clean!</li>
            <li>I receive many compliments even from strangers because the scent is clean and refereshing!</li>
            <li>It is a wonderful scent which is not heavy but fresh.</li>
            <li>Does not have a perfume smell like most that are so strong you cannot stay close to the person.</li>
            <li>It certainly smelled good on my patient.</li>
            <li>I first discovered this delightful wonder on a waitress at a tearoom that I frequent.  </li>
            <li>I guess I thought it would have more to offer than primarily an alcohol smell</li>
            <li>Great floral soft scent.</li>
            <li>Smelled this on a flight attendant coworker and loved the scent.</li>
            <li>Believe it or not, I rediscovered the original &amp;#34;Heart&amp;#34; from Garden Botanika among all the many fragrances on one of my dressers.</li>
            <li>I love it and still frequently get compliments on how good I smell.</li>
            <li>Fresh clean, scent, not overwhelming...very nice.</li>
            <li>perfume has fresh clean citrus, rose scent</li>
            <li>I dislike this fragrance because it smells like fabric softener sheets which is fine for my clothes but not as a scent for me.</li>
            <li>Very light and fresh</li>
            <li>Very light, fresh sent.</li>
            <li>A perfect fragrance for any woman young or old.</li>
            <li>and I found it to be too light.  </li>
            <li>One day, I noticed she smelled fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I do not like heavy scents, so this is so perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>Light scent that makes me think of baby powder.</li>
            <li>Needed a scent that was gluten free for a gift.  </li>

            <li>Fresh and clean scent!</li>
            <li>I first smelled this lovely fragrance which was given as a sample in The Four Seasons Hotel in Philadelphia.</li>
            <li>Clean and fresh smell that everybody likes!</li>
            <li>Clean and fresh!</li>
            <li>This is such a fresh, light scent, I just love it!!  </li>
            <li>I was really influenced by the reviews, and had the impression that this scent was light and refreshing.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t rate that, but it was packaged well and it was cheaper here than it is on the parfume&#x27;s website, plus I got free super saver shipping too.</li>
            <li>This perfume comes out strong, very, very strong and then dries quickly, leaving a pleasant enough scent, not powdery, more vanilla than anything, but it just does not last.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know who copied the fragrance, but it is absolutely true to the original fragrance.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought it was not going to be one I would enjoy, but as the day wore on, I found myself really enjoying the light scent very much.</li>
            <li>my God you smell so good and clean, I can just stand next to you all</li>
            <li>Well, for my birthday, she surprised me with my own bottle.      </li>

            <li>really nice and soft smelling</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this stuff</li>
            <li>Light, fresh scent; always get a compliment when wearing Heart.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a fresh, light, citrusy scent and this is too overpowering</li>
            <li>Fresh and light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, &amp;#34;non-perfumey&amp;#34; smell is just the right mix of softness and citrus.  </li>
            <li>Even strangers comment on the fresh clean scent.</li>

            <li>The scent is mild and not offensive to others in a close environment</li>
            <li>It was not unpleasant, just not my cup of tea.</li>
            <li>I keep looking for a perfume that smells like powder, nice, fresh, simple and &amp;#34;just showered&amp;#34; clean.  </li>
            <li>I know you will llve it as much as I!!</li>
            <li>I will most certainly buy more &amp;#34;Heart&amp;#34; when my supply runs low.</li>
            <li>Fresh and mellow scents</li>
            <li>These compliments only come when in close proximity to a person, not the kind that hits you from across the room.    </li>
            <li>It smells so fresh.</li>
            <li>NOT heavy, fresh, fabulous!  </li>
            <li>Smells like fresh soap &amp; water.  </li>

            <li>This perfume smells so fresh.</li>
            <li>It is so fresh and everyone asks me what I am wearing...</li>
            <li>just a hint of aroma, fresh smell.  </li>

            <li>I get so many compliments and refer more people to Amazon to purchase this product than any other purchase I&#x27;ve made.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fan of soap and water clean, like Philosophy&#x27;s Pure</li>
            <li>Priced right for my budget.</li>
            <li>It has a very citrus and clean smell that is not over powering.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s feminine, pretty and fresh.</li>
            <li>little did I know that the product sent to me would not smell pleasant at all.</li>
            <li>love it!  &amp; came in as expected</li>
            <li>Its soft, fresh, sublte, clean and alluring.</li>
            <li>love it...wear it daily.</li>
            <li>everyone two rows over can smell it for the first five minutes.  </li>
            <li>but I keep forgetting not to buy one that I haven&#x27;t tested first.</li>
            <li>Will surely order a bot or two for my sis next time.</li>
            <li>l use the heart body lotion  first...</li>
            <li>So much compliments!</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced too!</li>
            <li>I first received it as a gift when I complimented someone who was wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;Ever</li>
            <li>Over the years I have had several favorite fragrances.</li>
            <li>My husband and several of my friends love it when I wear it.</li>
            <li>, it never fails, someone always says, \\&quot;What are you wearing??\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Sadly, my favorite Garden Botanika should only be purchased from the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li>As the other reviewer commented - this makes a nice \\&quot;signature scent\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>When you spray it, a lot comes out, it&#x27;s not like other perfumes where you can kind of control the amount that is applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Glad amazon is carrying it and at a marked down price... :)</li>
            <li>It smells clean and does not bother people that are sensitive to perfumes.</li>
            <li>Heart is the only scent I wear, and I CONSTANTLY get compliments on how good I smell, as well as asking where to buy it.  </li>
            <li>Similar to Irish Spring soap, but in a good way.</li>
            <li>A long time favorite, please never stop selling</li>
            <li>complimented daily as fresh and clean fragrance</li>
            <li>Soft smelling perfume that settles in nicely and lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>Normally I would never pay the extra $ for a membership, but it is worth it in this case for the additional discount off the price plus free</li>
            <li>It is fresh, clean and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>I have also introduced it by way of gifts to my girlfriends and they all like it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>but lasts you the whole day.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, I do not care for or use very smelly beauty products.  </li>
            <li>it smells to me like very concentrated detergent.  </li>
            <li>It is light enough that it does not offend others&lt;br</li>
            <li>Learned this from my friend and purchased a whole bunch on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Too light for me as it did not last.</li>
            <li>I got it very fast and WOW the smell!</li>
            <li>use this all the time  got more compliments on it i also use the other products like the body lotion and body spray&lt;br /&gt;love it</li>
            <li>Garden Botankia usually only offers free ship if you spend a certain amount</li>
            <li>First let me start my review by saying I have an EXTREMELY sensitive nose.  </li>
            <li>with just enough citrus &amp; woodsy to keep from being too sweet.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so fresh &amp; light but is long lasting.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Gave as a gift to a person who is highly allergic.  </li>
            <li>It is a little floral, but also clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>It does smell clean and fresh but does not seem to last long</li>
            <li>Love the HEART fragrance for everyday.</li>
            <li>last long, just love it.</li>
            <li>did not quite live up to my expectation.  </li>
            <li>this a new fragrance for me</li>
            <li>#34;what are you wearing&amp;#34;, but, &amp;#34; you smell so good!&amp;#34; I have found my new signature fragrance.....</li>
            <li>This is a new perfume that my wife is trying.....</li>
            <li>I used to work in a hospital and didn&#x27;t want to wear anything heavy since so many patients were sensitive to smells and/or nauseous from medications or &amp;#34;npo&amp;#34; for upcoming procedures.  </li>
            <li>Never stinky or overpowering like so many more expensive scents!</li>
            <li>I like a light scent that I can spray a little bit during the day and not choke my cubicle neighbors at work, and this, if sprayed, well,</li>
            <li>Keep a bottle of this size on the dresser for a quick spritz before work or any other occasion that arrives.</li>
            <li>I have since purchased at least four bottles of the perfume and wear it all the time, receiving many compliments every time.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li>Complete strangers stop me to ask!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally, I buy it directly from Garden Botanika.  </li>
            <li>I used to order this product directly from the company.  </li>
            <li>Nothing has come close to this so far in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t mind it getting on my clothes because of the soft scent.</li>
            <li>Plus my partner says I smell like an old lady.</li>
            <li>and I must say that I diagree with some of the other purchasers who say that this fragrance is NOT the same as the original.</li>
            <li>A little too sweet for me.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying this product at a regular store.</li>
            <li>A fragrance would take my fancy and I would wear it on a daily basis until a new fragrance captured my attention.</li>
            <li>I may try new fragrances, but Heart is the one I always come back to.</li>
            <li>Too bad because we need more phthalate free perfumes out there.</li>
            <li>I purchased a bottle directly from Garden Botanika and it has the same fragrance she is use to.</li>
            <li>I will reorder it in the near future.</li>
            <li>Sad because it is nice</li>
            <li>Heart has the notes I strived to get in my personal blends, only lighter and more subtle.</li>
            <li>This is fragrance is exactly as I remember ~ a little floral, but</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This has been my favorite scent for years.  </li>
            <li> I ordered three bottles of my favorite \\&quot;Heart\\&quot;</li>
            <li> So for Christmas, I thought I&#x27;d found something they would &#x27;love&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> I prefer a more exotic aroma.</li>
            <li> My Favorite scent of all time.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a new signature fragrance since Philosophy sold the company and somehow downgraded the beautiful &amp;#34;Grace &amp;#34;scents.</li>
            <li> My favorite summer scent...fresh and clean!</li>
            <li> I receive many compliments even from strangers because the scent is clean and refereshing!</li>

            <li> It certainly smelled good on my patient.</li>
            <li> I first discovered this delightful wonder on a waitress at a tearoom that I frequent.  </li>
            <li> I guess I thought it would have more to offer than primarily an alcohol smell</li>
            <li> Great floral soft scent.</li>
            <li> Smelled this on a flight attendant coworker and loved the scent.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, I rediscovered the original &amp;#34;Heart&amp;#34; from Garden Botanika among all the many fragrances on one of my dressers.</li>
            <li> I love it and still frequently get compliments on how good I smell.</li>
            <li> Fresh clean, scent, not overwhelming...very nice.</li>
            <li> perfume has fresh clean citrus, rose scent</li>
            <li> I dislike this fragrance because it smells like fabric softener sheets which is fine for my clothes but not as a scent for me.</li>
            <li> Very light and fresh</li>
            <li> Very light, fresh sent.</li>
            <li> A perfect fragrance for any woman young or old.</li>
            <li> and I found it to be too light.  </li>
            <li> One day, I noticed she smelled fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I do not like heavy scents, so this is so perfect for me.  </li>
            <li> Light scent that makes me think of baby powder.</li>
            <li> Needed a scent that was gluten free for a gift.  </li>

            <li> Clean and fresh smell that everybody likes!</li>
            <li> Clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> This is such a fresh, light scent, I just love it!!  </li>
            <li> I was really influenced by the reviews, and had the impression that this scent was light and refreshing.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t rate that, but it was packaged well and it was cheaper here than it is on the parfume&#x27;s website, plus I got free super saver shipping too.</li>
            <li> This perfume comes out strong, very, very strong and then dries quickly, leaving a pleasant enough scent, not powdery, more vanilla than anything, but it just does not last.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know who copied the fragrance, but it is absolutely true to the original fragrance.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought it was not going to be one I would enjoy, but as the day wore on, I found myself really enjoying the light scent very much.</li>
            <li> my God you smell so good and clean, I can just stand next to you all</li>

            <li> really nice and soft smelling</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this stuff</li>
            <li> Light, fresh scent; always get a compliment when wearing Heart.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a fresh, light, citrusy scent and this is too overpowering</li>
            <li> Fresh and light.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, &amp;#34;non-perfumey&amp;#34; smell is just the right mix of softness and citrus.  </li>
            <li> Even strangers comment on the fresh clean scent.</li>

            <li> The scent is mild and not offensive to others in a close environment</li>
            <li> It was not unpleasant, just not my cup of tea.</li>
            <li> I keep looking for a perfume that smells like powder, nice, fresh, simple and &amp;#34;just showered&amp;#34; clean.  </li>
            <li> I know you will llve it as much as I!!</li>
            <li> I will most certainly buy more &amp;#34;Heart&amp;#34; when my supply runs low.</li>
            <li> Fresh and mellow scents</li>
            <li> These compliments only come when in close proximity to a person, not the kind that hits you from across the room.    </li>
            <li> It smells so fresh.</li>
            <li> NOT heavy, fresh, fabulous!  </li>

            <li> It has a very citrus and clean smell that is not over powering.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s feminine, pretty and fresh.</li>
            <li> little did I know that the product sent to me would not smell pleasant at all.</li>
            <li> love it!  &amp; came in as expected</li>
            <li> Its soft, fresh, sublte, clean and alluring.</li>
            <li> love it...wear it daily.</li>
            <li> everyone two rows over can smell it for the first five minutes.  </li>
            <li> but I keep forgetting not to buy one that I haven&#x27;t tested first.</li>
            <li> Will surely order a bot or two for my sis next time.</li>

            <li> Reasonably priced too!</li>
            <li> I first received it as a gift when I complimented someone who was wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;Ever</li>
            <li> Over the years I have had several favorite fragrances.</li>
            <li> My husband and several of my friends love it when I wear it.</li>
            <li> , it never fails, someone always says, \\&quot;What are you wearing??\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Sadly, my favorite Garden Botanika should only be purchased from the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> As the other reviewer commented - this makes a nice \\&quot;signature scent\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> When you spray it, a lot comes out, it&#x27;s not like other perfumes where you can kind of control the amount that is applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Glad amazon is carrying it and at a marked down price... :)</li>
            <li> It smells clean and does not bother people that are sensitive to perfumes.</li>
            <li> Heart is the only scent I wear, and I CONSTANTLY get compliments on how good I smell, as well as asking where to buy it.  </li>
            <li> Similar to Irish Spring soap, but in a good way.</li>
            <li> A long time favorite, please never stop selling</li>
            <li> complimented daily as fresh and clean fragrance</li>
            <li> Soft smelling perfume that settles in nicely and lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> Normally I would never pay the extra $ for a membership, but it is worth it in this case for the additional discount off the price plus free</li>
            <li> It is fresh, clean and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have also introduced it by way of gifts to my girlfriends and they all like it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> but lasts you the whole day.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, I do not care for or use very smelly beauty products.  </li>
            <li> it smells to me like very concentrated detergent.  </li>
            <li> It is light enough that it does not offend others&lt;br</li>
            <li> Learned this from my friend and purchased a whole bunch on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Too light for me as it did not last.</li>
            <li> I got it very fast and WOW the smell!</li>
            <li> use this all the time  got more compliments on it i also use the other products like the body lotion and body spray&lt;br /&gt;love it</li>
            <li> Garden Botankia usually only offers free ship if you spend a certain amount</li>
            <li> First let me start my review by saying I have an EXTREMELY sensitive nose.  </li>
            <li> with just enough citrus &amp; woodsy to keep from being too sweet.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so fresh &amp; light but is long lasting.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Gave as a gift to a person who is highly allergic.  </li>
            <li> It is a little floral, but also clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> It does smell clean and fresh but does not seem to last long</li>
            <li> Love the HEART fragrance for everyday.</li>
            <li> last long, just love it.</li>
            <li> did not quite live up to my expectation.  </li>
            <li> this a new fragrance for me</li>
            <li> #34;what are you wearing&amp;#34;, but, &amp;#34; you smell so good!&amp;#34; I have found my new signature fragrance.....</li>
            <li> This is a new perfume that my wife is trying.....</li>
            <li> I used to work in a hospital and didn&#x27;t want to wear anything heavy since so many patients were sensitive to smells and/or nauseous from medications or &amp;#34;npo&amp;#34; for upcoming procedures.  </li>
            <li> Never stinky or overpowering like so many more expensive scents!</li>
            <li> I like a light scent that I can spray a little bit during the day and not choke my cubicle neighbors at work, and this, if sprayed, well,</li>
            <li> Keep a bottle of this size on the dresser for a quick spritz before work or any other occasion that arrives.</li>
            <li> I have since purchased at least four bottles of the perfume and wear it all the time, receiving many compliments every time.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li> Complete strangers stop me to ask!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally, I buy it directly from Garden Botanika.  </li>
            <li> I used to order this product directly from the company.  </li>
            <li> Nothing has come close to this so far in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t mind it getting on my clothes because of the soft scent.</li>
            <li> Plus my partner says I smell like an old lady.</li>
            <li> and I must say that I diagree with some of the other purchasers who say that this fragrance is NOT the same as the original.</li>
            <li> A little too sweet for me.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend buying this product at a regular store.</li>
            <li> A fragrance would take my fancy and I would wear it on a daily basis until a new fragrance captured my attention.</li>
            <li> I may try new fragrances, but Heart is the one I always come back to.</li>
            <li> Too bad because we need more phthalate free perfumes out there.</li>
            <li> I purchased a bottle directly from Garden Botanika and it has the same fragrance she is use to.</li>
            <li> I will reorder it in the near future.</li>
            <li> Sad because it is nice</li>
            <li> Heart has the notes I strived to get in my personal blends, only lighter and more subtle.</li>
            <li> This is fragrance is exactly as I remember ~ a little floral, but</li>
            <li> Delicate floral scent -- not overpowering, but just right to attract notice and compliments.</li>
            <li> At the same time, we both smelled it, looked at each other and said \\&quot;wow</li>
            <li> When you first spritz, it&#x27;s way strong (makes me feel a bit sick), and when it wanes some, it&#x27;s still too sweet-smelling.</li>
            <li> I dont like scents that linger way too long even after youve left the room 30 mintues ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to continue to buy as long as they continue to sell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a soft fragrance, not that heavy, cloying \\&quot;who was just in the elevator\\&quot; perfume.  </li>
            <li> I wear a single spritz daily, no more and no less, (and it lasts forever)</li>
            <li> This perfume smells like it has been sitting on a shelf for a very long time.</li>
            <li> This Heart Parfum along with the Heart Body wash is not a new thing for me.</li>
            <li> Not sure why I feel so sensitive with this scent....</li>
            <li> It smells nice, however, it doesn&#x27;t have the staying power I was hoping for.  :(  </li>
            <li> If your looking for an everyday scent thats not over powering and leaves people wanting you back, heart is the scent you want to wear.</li>
            <li> Found the quality to be what I expected, shipping prompt and packaging sufficient.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not strong like example ( Red Door)</li>
            <li> First, she absolutley was crazy about the perfume, and second ,  I was amazed that \\&quot;Amazon\\&quot; had it delivered to my door on Christmas Eve when I took a chance by placing the order on 12/20.</li>
            <li> I bought three bottles intending to give the other two to my sisters.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> never had problem before with other scents Other than not liking a scent...</li>
            <li> Looking forward to trying other products</li>
            <li> I will purchase this product again, and looking forward to try other products.</li>
            <li> Sh was not happy that I didn&#x27;t purchase directly from Garden Botanika.  </li>
            <li> this is just annoying, because for the first 5 minutes after spraying, the smell is completely overpowering.  </li>
            <li> I came down to help at the cash registers and said,</li>
            <li> and she has doctors who follow her down the hall just to get a wiff of her.  </li>
            <li> Not writing it down, I would ask her this each time I saw her and would remind myself that I needed to try to find it.  </li>
            <li> The after-smell once the scent has mellowed down (a few minutes and even hours after spraying) smells like you just stepped out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> I need to put another order in before it is done because it use it everyday</li>
            <li> This perfume can be worn all year round</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Instead these bottles were weak scented, unsweet and aged.  </li>
            <li> I wear this everyday!</li>
            <li> that product, Heart has staying power, and it&#x27;s less expensive.  </li>
            <li> The worse part is that I cant even return this substandard product because it is &amp;#34;hazardous material&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Sad that didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I ordered this fragrance as a gift for a dear friend, as it has always been one of our favorites, however it arrived a day later than promised and the gift wrapping was horrible.</li>
            <li> Purchased blindly without knowing what to expect.  </li>
            <li> Without fail, I get compliments every time I wear it.  </li>
            <li> I buy ot bulk because I&#x27;m afraid they&#x27;re going to run out.</li>
            <li> One of the worst things in life is having your oxygen supply tainted from a passing woman with overpowering perfume that makes you want to gag, but alas, I digress.    </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Every time I wear this I get commented about the wonderful smell!! It&#x27;s so fresh &amp; light but is long lasting. You gotta try it I know you will llve it as much as I!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. The cost is great I buy ot bulk because I&#x27;m afraid they&#x27;re going to run out. I&#x27;m going to continue to buy as long as they continue to sell.</li>
            <li> I whould recommend it  to anyone  because it smell so good  and the price for it is good . I need to put another order in before it is done because it use it everyday</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Heart for years and love it!</li>
            <li> use this all the time  got more compliments on it i also use the other products like the body lotion and body spray&lt;br /&gt;love it</li>
            <li> My SUPREME FAVORITE!</li>
            <li> Love Heart!!  very pleased - good price and quick delivery....</li>
            <li> One of my patients wore this scent.  It was clean and fresh, very pleasant.  I bought three bottles intending to give the other two to my sisters.&lt;br /&gt;It did not quite live up to my expectation.  It does smell clean and fresh but does not seem to last long and I found it to be too light.  It might be my body chemistry ?  It certainly smelled good on my patient.</li>
            <li> love this scent. Soft smelling perfume that settles in nicely and lasts for a long time. Not overpowering at all. Good value too.</li>
            <li> I have been using heart for over 10 years now. I dont like scents that linger way too long even after youve left the room 30 mintues ago. Its soft, fresh, sublte, clean and alluring. When I give hugs, I almost-always get asked what I&#x27;m wearing.  If your looking for an everyday scent thats not over powering and leaves people wanting you back, heart is the scent you want to wear.</li>
            <li> I honestly bought this perfume only because of the attractive price and the good reviews. I got it very fast and WOW the smell! It is what I have been looking for for years! Clean and fresh smell that everybody likes! I get tons of compliments as I never have! This will be my signature smell. RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li> This product has the packaging and looks of the Garden Botanika Heart perfume.  BUT the fragrance is not the same.  My wife has been using this product for nine years.  Sh was not happy that I didn&#x27;t purchase directly from Garden Botanika.  I purchased a bottle directly from Garden Botanika and it has the same fragrance she is use to.</li>
            <li> Been my favorite for years!  Very light and fresh</li>
            <li> This  was a Christmas gift to my wife which turned out to be a double PLUS +++++. First, she absolutley was crazy about the perfume, and second ,  I was amazed that \\&quot;Amazon\\&quot; had it delivered to my door on Christmas Eve when I took a chance by placing the order on 12/20. Somebody went the extra mile. THANK YOU!!</li>
            <li> I first smelled this lovely fragrance which was given as a sample in The Four Seasons Hotel in Philadelphia. At first, I thought it was not going to be one I would enjoy, but as the day wore on, I found myself really enjoying the light scent very much. I have since purchased at least four bottles of the perfume and wear it all the time, receiving many compliments every time. I have also introduced it by way of gifts to my girlfriends and they all like it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> This has to be the best scented parfume I&#x27;ve ever used. I spray it on in the morning and it lasts all day.  The scent is not overbearing and you feel so feminine smelling it periodically throughout the day. I get so many compliments and refer more people to Amazon to purchase this product than any other purchase I&#x27;ve made.</li>
            <li> Gift for my sister. She loved it</li>
            <li> While working the pharmacy I came down to help at the cash registers and said, \\&quot;Wow, somebody smells great!\\&quot;  A nurse from the hospital said it was her and she has doctors who follow her down the hall just to get a wiff of her.  We laughed, then I asked what it was.  I knew I had to get some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We went to an audience participation dinner theater of Scrooge before Christmas.  Well I ended up on stage.  After the show Scrooge came up to me and asked what perfume I was wearing, because \\&quot;you smell great\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where ever we go I&#x27;m always asked what scent I&#x27;m wearing.  My husband has heard this so often he smiles and shakes his head.  I have NEVER hand so many compliments on any scent I have worn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE GARDEN BOTINAKA HEART!!!</li>
            <li> I really really love the smell of this scent!!</li>
            <li> I often receive great comments when I walk by people.  It is a wonderful scent which is not heavy but fresh.</li>
            <li> Fresh and mellow scents</li>
            <li> Have been using this perfume for years and I always get complimented on how good I smell.  It&#x27;s not overpowering.. Very fresh and light but lasts you the whole day.  Glad amazon is carrying it and at a marked down price... :)</li>
            <li> First let me start my review by saying I have an EXTREMELY sensitive nose.  Therefore, I do not care for or use very smelly beauty products.  And I NEVER EVER wore perfume (until now).  One of the worst things in life is having your oxygen supply tainted from a passing woman with overpowering perfume that makes you want to gag, but alas, I digress.    I first discovered this delightful wonder on a waitress at a tearoom that I frequent.  Because the waitress knows me as a very good patron, she will sometimes greet me with a hug. One day, I noticed she smelled fantastic.  I thought, \\&quot;Wow, I wish I could smell like that.\\&quot;  I asked what she was wearing and you guessed it - Garden Botanika.  Not writing it down, I would ask her this each time I saw her and would remind myself that I needed to try to find it.  Well, for my birthday, she surprised me with my own bottle.      I LOVE IT!    This perfume is amazing.  It is light and flowery and a bit fruity - just the perfect mix.  I wear a single spritz daily, no more and no less, (and it lasts forever) and I get compliments nearly daily.  \\&quot;Wow, someone smells good, is that you?  That&#x27;s smells so good, what is it?  etc...\\&quot;  These compliments only come when in close proximity to a person, not the kind that hits you from across the room.    My sister, who is also an anti-perfume person and claims she hates it when anyone wears perfume, no matter how \\&quot;good\\&quot; it smells also likes it (on me).  Still haven&#x27;t persuaded her to try it, but she told me she&#x27;s tempted.    As the other reviewer commented - this makes a nice \\&quot;signature scent\\&quot;.  People will remember you for this (and in a good way too!)</li>
            <li> I found this perfume when I was visiting family in California 15 years ago and fell in love.  I purchased it from the Garden Botanika store and back then you couldn&#x27;t order anything online so I had family purchase the perfume and ship it to me.  I&#x27;m so happy that you can now purchase the perfume online from Amazon!  This is my signature scent and I always receive compliments.  It has a very citrus and clean smell that is not over powering. This perfume can be worn all year round and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very light, fresh sent. Have been using it for a while and will continue.</li>
            <li> Heart Parfum is a light, fresh fragrant that everyone compliments</li>
            <li> The perfect fragrance for those who love to smell clean and unique. I have used this fragrance for years and always receive compliments from strangers. So good I don&#x27;t want to share!</li>
            <li> The Perfume is amazing! I get so many complements on it!</li>
            <li> Very nice floral scent.</li>
            <li> Love it, fresh clean scent.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  This is the second time I have purchased it. Very light and not overbearing in smell. I wear it every day.</li>
            <li> I just love this product.</li>
            <li> I really hoped to love this, description sounded awesome.  It actually burns my eyes and it is only on my clothes.  Not sure why I feel so sensitive with this scent....never had problem before with other scents Other than not liking a scent...it smells to me like very concentrated detergent.  Sad that didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> This Heart Parfum along with the Heart Body wash is not a new thing for me. I would buy these two items along with the lotion when we had a Garden Botanika in my city (Albuquerque, NM) Garden Botanika disappeared sometime ago. Then I found it on Amazon, which made me very happy. I always got complimented on this fragrant.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery!! Great clean smell. Will order again!!</li>
            <li> I love this scent!!!  It&#x27;s so fresh and clean and light!  I wear it everyday.</li>
            <li> complimented daily as fresh and clean fragrance</li>
            <li> My Mom&#x27;s favorite ...</li>
            <li> My favorite summer scent...fresh and clean!</li>
            <li> EVERYWHERE I go, people always ask me what perfume I&#x27;m wearing.  It&#x27;s light, &amp;#34;non-perfumey&amp;#34; smell is just the right mix of softness and citrus.  I used to work in a hospital and didn&#x27;t want to wear anything heavy since so many patients were sensitive to smells and/or nauseous from medications or &amp;#34;npo&amp;#34; for upcoming procedures.  And Heart never bothered them!  Its smells more like a beautiful &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; smell vs. perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been my scent for over 7 years now and I&#x27;ll never use anything else!</li>
            <li> Love this body spray!  I used this years ago, and my husband loved it, when I ran out, I forgot who made it ~ never thought to look it up on Amazon. Thank you Amazon!  This is fragrance is exactly as I remember ~ a little floral, but with just enough citrus &amp; woodsy to keep from being too sweet.  It&#x27;s a soft fragrance, not that heavy, cloying \\&quot;who was just in the elevator\\&quot; perfume.  Clean, like the most incredible smelling shampoo you could create, that keeps smelling like you just washed your hair...</li>
            <li> love it...wear it daily. Fresh clean, scent, not overwhelming...very nice. Priced right for my budget. Get many compliments&lt;br /&gt;on the fragrance.</li>
            <li> The best scent there is! Even strangers comment on the fresh clean scent. Never stinky or overpowering like so many more expensive scents!</li>
            <li> I get compliments when I wear this fragrance. It&#x27;s a must have. It smells clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years. I love this product. It smells so fresh. Like I just got out of the shower. Does not have a perfume smell like most that are so strong you cannot stay close to the person. Will always use it nothing else!!!</li>
            <li> Smelled this on a flight attendant coworker and loved the scent. She told me how she was walking through an airport and a gentleman who had passed by her, continued walking almost out of sight and then returned to say how wonderful her perfume smelled. My wife loves it and gets many compliments when she has it on.</li>
            <li> This is my second time to purchase this Heart.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Keep a bottle of this size on the dresser for a quick spritz before work or any other occasion that arrives.</li>
            <li> I discovered Heart about 10 years ago when a woman wearing it was walking in front of me and a friend.  At the same time, we both smelled it, looked at each other and said \\&quot;wow she smells good!\\&quot;. I saw the woman later in the restroom, and asked what she was wearing.  I am VERY picky about perfumes, and this one is just wonderful.  NOT heavy, fresh, fabulous!  Heart is the only scent I wear, and I CONSTANTLY get compliments on how good I smell, as well as asking where to buy it.  Complete strangers stop me to ask!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I am also a smoker...yet I still get continual comments.  How&#x27;s that for a testament?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I buy it directly from Garden Botanika.  You get a discount if you pay for a membership.  Normally I would never pay the extra $ for a membership, but it is worth it in this case for the additional discount off the price plus free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it... you will LOVE it, as will everyone around you!</li>
            <li> The scent is really lovely but it is gone by the time I get to work.  Sad because it is nice but I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and have been wearing it for more than 10 years. Found the quality to be what I expected, shipping prompt and packaging sufficient.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 10 years now! I would recommend this!&lt;br /&gt;Great product and very reasonable and smells really fantastic!</li>
            <li> The Garden Botanika Heart De Parfum was so good &amp; smelled so good. I will reorder it in the near future.</li>
            <li> I love this parfum and have received so many compliments, It&#x27;s scent lasts all day. I will keep buying this</li>
            <li> Love it, I received so many compliments on it an for the price you cant beat it! #happy as a clam</li>
            <li> I keep looking for a perfume that smells like powder, nice, fresh, simple and &amp;#34;just showered&amp;#34; clean.  Admittedly, I ordered this on Amazon without ever having smelled it elsewhere.  I went based on the reviews.  This perfume comes out strong, very, very strong and then dries quickly, leaving a pleasant enough scent, not powdery, more vanilla than anything, but it just does not last.  When you spray it, a lot comes out, it&#x27;s not like other perfumes where you can kind of control the amount that is applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To keep re-spraying this is just annoying, because for the first 5 minutes after spraying, the smell is completely overpowering.  I like a light scent that I can spray a little bit during the day and not choke my cubicle neighbors at work, and this, if sprayed, well, everyone two rows over can smell it for the first five minutes.  But then, like I said, poof, it&#x27;s gone and you literally cannot smell it.  I had thrown away the box, otherwise, I would have sent it back.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells like it has been sitting on a shelf for a very long time. I have smelled the scent in brick and mortar stores and it is pleasant. I thought I would save some money by ordering through Amazon. little did I know that the product sent to me would not smell pleasant at all. I highly recommend buying this product at a regular store. The worse part is that I cant even return this substandard product because it is &amp;#34;hazardous material&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My relative loves this perfume and I am happy to always see it on amazon for a reasonable price. Looking forward to trying other products</li>
            <li> Gave as a gift to a person who is highly allergic.  She only uses this scent.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this fragrance based on the glowing reviews but I keep forgetting not to buy one that I haven&#x27;t tested first. I dislike this fragrance because it smells like fabric softener sheets which is fine for my clothes but not as a scent for me.</li>
            <li> I so love its gentle scent,.. and it lasts. Will surely order a bot or two for my sis next time.</li>
            <li> I ordered this fragrance as a gift for a dear friend, as it has always been one of our favorites, however it arrived a day later than promised and the gift wrapping was horrible. I am hoping for a refund from Amazon of the additional money I was charged for the expedited shipping and gift wrapping. I did not get what I paid for.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of complements esp from guys when I wear this cologne.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  I will definitely recommend it to others.  The scent is mild and not offensive to others in a close environment</li>
            <li> This perfume is lovely. The scent is like nothing I&#x27;ve experienced in a fragrance. It&#x27;s feminine, pretty and fresh. I love it!</li>
            <li> Love the clean and fresh smell....people always ask what I am wearing. ,....I tell them it comes from the heart...l use the heart body lotion  first...it keeps the fragrance lasting a lot longer....</li>
            <li> So much compliments! I work in customer service, women and men just compliment on how wonderful I smell.. A  women customer approach me and said, OH! my God you smell so good and clean, I can just stand next to you all day!&lt;br /&gt;This perfume has fresh clean citrus, rose scent it&#x27;s not strong like example ( Red Door) it&#x27;s a wonderful clean scent fresh out of the shower:)) will buy again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Customer!&lt;br /&gt;Tamara</li>
            <li> I received the item on time just as they said.&lt;br /&gt;My wife loves the Parfum and will buy it again..</li>
            <li> My favorite scent ever! Clean and fresh! I get soooooo many compliments!</li>
            <li> I wear this everyday! It is my signature scent! I receive many compliments even from strangers because the scent is clean and refereshing! Reasonably priced too!</li>
            <li> I have worn this fragrance for over 15 years.  I love it and still frequently get compliments on how good I smell.</li>
            <li> This is the only scent I wear and I was pleased to get it with no SH applied. Garden Botankia usually only offers free ship if you spend a certain amount and this allowed me to buy only what I wanted at this time.</li>
            <li> Great smell. My friend wears this all the time. So thought I  would get it. really nice and soft smelling</li>
            <li> Smells like fresh soap &amp; water.  A compliment every time.  Even in doctors office.  I purchased 170 this year from requests.  GREAT PRODUCT. I cannot wear fragrances</li>
            <li> I love this scent.  I don&#x27;t like overpowering, floral, musky or spicy notes.  I&#x27;m a fan of soap and water clean, like Philosophy&#x27;s Pure Grace.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike that product, Heart has staying power, and it&#x27;s less expensive.  It is a little floral, but also clean and fresh.  Many compliments.</li>
            <li> Beautiful scent....I&#x27;ve been wearing it for 3 years now and absolutely love it!  Compliments all the time.</li>
            <li> I have been using Garden Botanika Heart for years now.  I first received it as a gift when I complimented someone who was wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;Ever since then (probably 10 years), it is all I wear.  It has a fresh and clean smell.  It is light enough that it does not offend others&lt;br /&gt;who wear it.  I used to order this product directly from the company.  I was thrilled to see that I could get it from Amazon.com.  It is&lt;br /&gt;my most favorite place to shop so I could do one stop shopping and get my supply without any problem.  I order 4 - 5 bottles at one time.  I&lt;br /&gt;will give them as gifts and always am being asked \\&quot;what are you wearing\\&quot; and gladly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this stuff but I found it smelled like Irish spring soap.  I gave it away to charity as no one else wanted it!  Too bad because we need more phthalate free perfumes out there.</li>
            <li> Love this! I had a friend who was wearing this and she gave me the link. I have gotten lots of complements. Great price too!</li>
            <li> Light, fresh scent; always get a compliment when wearing Heart.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have had several favorite fragrances. A fragrance would take my fancy and I would wear it on a daily basis until a new fragrance captured my attention. I have even dabbled in blending my own personal ones. Heart has the notes I strived to get in my personal blends, only lighter and more subtle. I get many complements from coworkers. I can see myself continuing to wear Heart for many more years.</li>
            <li> Garden Botanika&#x27;s signature fragrance is wonderful and fresh, and it is never overpowering.  A perfect fragrance for any woman young or old.</li>
            <li> this a new fragrance for me and i really love the way this perfume smells</li>
            <li> Love the HEART fragrance for everyday. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Heart by Garden Botanika for over 15 years.  I continously get completments on the scent.  It is not over powering.</li>
            <li> Please never discontiue this fragrance. I&#x27;ve been wearing Heart for years. My husband and several of my friends love it when I wear it. It makes even the wind smell wonderful as I pass by.</li>
            <li> Learned this from my friend and purchased a whole bunch on Amazon.  The after-smell once the scent has mellowed down (a few minutes and even hours after spraying) smells like you just stepped out of the shower.  Great find!</li>
            <li> Love this light, fresh scent. 👍🏻👍🏻.</li>
            <li> Kids will like it.  A little too sweet for me.  The heroine was just too cute.  Nice weekend movie for pizza and the family.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent for all time!  If only I could find another perfume so that I could alternate.  I do not like heavy scents, so this is so perfect for me.  I always will use this for any time of day.  Wonderful fresh scent with a hint of musk.  Nothing has come close to this so far in my opinion.</li>
            <li> A very nice clean scent. I got it for my birthday many many years ago,and still my favorite go to scent. Love it!</li>
            <li> Was not for me, but the person I gave it told me that smell great</li>
            <li> This perfume smells so fresh. It&#x27;s a great spring and summer scent. It has a floral and honeysuckle scent. It&#x27;s sexy and seductive!!!</li>
            <li> I get complements on this perfume all the time.  It smells clean and does not bother people that are sensitive to perfumes.</li>
            <li> A long time favorite, please never stop selling</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of &amp;#34;Heart&amp;#34; for years and I get so many compliments on it!  Fresh and clean scent!</li>
            <li> I may try new fragrances, but Heart is the one I always come back to. Light scent that makes me think of baby powder. Who doesn&#x27;t love that? :)</li>
            <li> Smells so fresh and clean. I always get compliments when I wear it- asi n ALWAYS!!! I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I Love this product, it smells wonderful! I will purchase this product again, and looking forward to try other products.</li>
            <li> This is one of my all time favorite scents.  It is fresh, clean and lasts a long time.  I always get complimented when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Great scent.  Purchased blindly without knowing what to expect.  Needed a scent that was gluten free for a gift.  This is a great item for anyone.</li>
            <li> What can I say?  This is my wife&#x27;s favorite and has been for years.  I believe this will continue into the future.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for many years and over these year have gotten so many complements ... It&#x27;s a very clean ,fresh smell</li>
            <li> love it!  &amp; came in as expected</li>
            <li> I love this perfume...not too heavy...not too light!  It is so fresh and everyone asks me what I am wearing...I smell so good!</li>
            <li> daughter loves this also and they do smell nice</li>
            <li> I guess I thought it would have more to offer than primarily an alcohol smell - I&#x27;ll use it for air freshener.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, I rediscovered the original &amp;#34;Heart&amp;#34; from Garden Botanika among all the many fragrances on one of my dressers. I purchased this newer version from Amazon and I must say that I diagree with some of the other purchasers who say that this fragrance is NOT the same as the original. I don&#x27;t know who copied the fragrance, but it is absolutely true to the original fragrance. I will most certainly buy more &amp;#34;Heart&amp;#34; when my supply runs low. Delicate floral scent -- not overpowering, but just right to attract notice and compliments.</li>
            <li> Great floral soft scent. I get so many compliments. last long, just love it. This is my signature parfum and I will always wear it.</li>
            <li> This is such a fresh, light scent, I just love it!!  I get so many compliments!  Everytime I wear this, it never fails, someone always says, \\&quot;What are you wearing??\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Smells fresh, like just right out of the shower. Similar to Irish Spring soap, but in a good way. Get lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> This scent is amazing! I have been searching for a new signature fragrance since Philosophy sold the company and somehow downgraded the beautiful &amp;#34;Grace &amp;#34;scents. Gave this a try after reading the reviews and fell in love! I get compliments all the time. Not, &amp;#34;what are you wearing&amp;#34;, but, &amp;#34; you smell so good!&amp;#34; I have found my new signature fragrance.....move over &amp;#34;Amazing Grace.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Light fragrance....just a hint of aroma, fresh smell.  Love it in the summer as my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; fragrance.  Don&#x27;t mind it getting on my clothes because of the soft scent.</li>
            <li> Perfume is so subjective. This one didn&#x27;t work for me. I was looking for a fresh, light, citrusy scent and this is too overpowering</li>
            <li> It smells nice, however, it doesn&#x27;t have the staying power I was hoping for.  :(  my search continues for the perfect lingering scent.</li>
            <li> Wife loves this perfume</li>
            <li> Good product...my wife likes it.</li>
            <li> Fresh clean scent. I always get compliments and asked  what I&#x27;m wearing. :)</li>
            <li> Without fail, I get compliments every time I wear it.  I love this fragrance: it&#x27;s clean and fresh without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> I was really influenced by the reviews, and had the impression that this scent was light and refreshing. It&#x27;s not! When you first spritz, it&#x27;s way strong (makes me feel a bit sick), and when it wanes some, it&#x27;s still too sweet-smelling. Plus my partner says I smell like an old lady. If that&#x27;s not a resounding NO, I don&#x27;t know what is! It&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  The scent stays with you all day and its a light scent.  When I wear this scent, people stop and asked the name of it.  I Love it.</li>
            <li> Smells like you stepped out of the shower. Nice clean smell that stays with you all day! Spray all over after a shower and go.</li>
            <li> Favorite perfume, great price.  This is my favorite perfume.  I am always asked what I am wearing when I am wearing this perfume!  I wish we still had a local store here in town.</li>
            <li> It was light and refreshing a good summer fragrance!&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to wear it through the summer!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance but it has zero staying ability. I doubt I&#x27;ll reorder. Love, love the scent  but after an hour it disappears.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite scent for years.  Fresh and light.</li>
            <li> Nice perfume...This is a new perfume that my wife is trying.....very nice....I like it</li>
            <li> My favorite of all!!!!! Please don&#x27;t discontinue!!!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell as nice on me as it does on others</li>
            <li> Sadly, my favorite Garden Botanika should only be purchased from the manufacturer.  I ordered three bottles of my favorite \\&quot;Heart\\&quot; because of friends always remarking about how they loved it.  So for Christmas, I thought I&#x27;d found something they would &#x27;love&#x27;.  Instead these bottles were weak scented, unsweet and aged.  I do NOT recommend buying perfume on this network.</li>
            <li> My mother-in-law loves this scent, I have no idea what it smells like so I can&#x27;t rate that, but it was packaged well and it was cheaper here than it is on the parfume&#x27;s website, plus I got free super saver shipping too.</li>
            <li> Too light for me as it did not last. I prefer a more exotic aroma. Very nice for those who want something airy. It was not unpleasant, just not my cup of tea.</li>
            <li> My Favorite scent of all time.</li>
