            <li>I have never felt better using another brush?</li>
            <li>It is more for a child.</li>
            <li>I am ordering more of these.</li>
            <li>This POH 4 row 43 tuft bristle toothbrush is even better than I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li>I do some work at a free health care clinic.</li>
            <li>It&amp;#34;s light; and,it has bristles that seem to enable me to keep my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>I like that these are just straightforward toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel really clean after using it and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my gums at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing that I can not find an adult toothbrush in the stores.</li>
            <li>Nice soft brush,great for the gums.</li>
            <li>The handle is short, but it still feels good in the hand.</li>
            <li>They were received quickly.</li>
            <li>I am a medical provider and POH has kindly furnished free toothbrushes to me to give to my clients in need.</li>
            <li>But mostly I like it because it has a straight handle that feels comfy and zips right into the slot by my bathroom glass.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for a decent soft brush with a good old-fashioned easy-to-hold square handle since they first started making &amp;#34;ergonomic&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I would have liked to get RED since that&#x27;s what shown.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased with the fullness of the brush head, they&#x27;re soft without being &amp;#34;limp&amp;#34; and the handles are straight.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are soft, but clean the teeth really well.</li>
            <li>I guess I am too much of a critic.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very well made and just what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Simple and comfortable.</li>
            <li>I was looking for toothbrushes to hang in my retro toothbrush holder, which requires straight handles.  </li>
            <li>Well, when they started giving other brushes, cheaper ones perhaps, that look all fancy, I sure noticed my gums didn&#x27;t do as well.  </li>
            <li>Look up Bass method on you tube for more instruction.</li>
            <li>Better than any of the other toothbrushes with different lengths of bristles, extra bells and whistles, and better than my electric brush.</li>
            <li>These really are NOT firm brushes.  </li>
            <li>Funny, my wife feels the same way?</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have said, the handle is just a smidge short; but that&#x27;s my only complaint with this excellent brush.</li>
            <li>Instead I got a clear.</li>
            <li>Perhaps for a child, but not an adult.  </li>
            <li>And yes the one I ordered is &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34; marked.  </li>
            <li>It is rated SOFT.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure who those brushes are made for but they won&#x27;t fit in the toothbrush holder in my bathroom and they feel too big and are inclined to spin around if I get saliva and toothpaste on while I&#x27;m brushing.  </li>
            <li>This is not the same soft one the periodontist gave me for brushing my gums around my implants.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel much cleaner with less effort.</li>
            <li>Not long enough of a handle</li>

            <li> These brushes are well made and most importantly, really do a good job on teeth and gums.  I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else now.  I started using them when my dentist gave them in his goodie bag for checkups; I thought, what a dumb little plain jane brush!  Well, when they started giving other brushes, cheaper ones perhaps, that look all fancy, I sure noticed my gums didn&#x27;t do as well.  So . . now I buy them for myself on Amazon, and give the others away to Goodwill.</li>
            <li> Well I see the reviews for this brush are good..  So I bought some.  I guess I am too much of a critic.  These really are NOT firm brushes.  Medium at best.  Then it is the handle -- it is too short!  Like it was made for a child.  It measures 6 1/2&amp;#34; tip to tip.  Come on folks, I have a medium hand and can hardly grab it!  Perhaps for a child, but not an adult.  And yes the one I ordered is &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34; marked.  My Colgate and Oral-B measure 7&amp;#34; plus.  I really do not understand how these folks can rate this 5-stars.</li>
            <li> AFTER BEING GIVEN THESE BY TWO DIFFERENT DENTISTS, I WENT ON LINE AND ORDERED A HALF DOZEN.  I&#x27;VE HAD A LOT OF CROWN DONE LATELY AND THESE ARE GREAT.</li>
            <li> Nice soft brush,great for the gums.</li>
            <li> I sent for this toothbrush on spec because I couldn&#x27;t find a toothbrush in any store that didn&#x27;t have a clunky, gigantic, bat-like handle.  I&#x27;m not sure who those brushes are made for but they won&#x27;t fit in the toothbrush holder in my bathroom and they feel too big and are inclined to spin around if I get saliva and toothpaste on while I&#x27;m brushing.  I like the POH brush because it provides gentle but effective cleaning (good bristles).  But mostly I like it because it has a straight handle that feels comfy and zips right into the slot by my bathroom glass.  I will order more of these.</li>
            <li> I ordered several of these. They were received quickly. They&#x27;re very well made and just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Simply: I like brushing my teeth with the POH! I wish I could explain why I feel  using this brush on my teeth &amp;#34;works&amp;#34;:for me. It&amp;#34;s light; and,it has bristles that seem to enable me to keep my teeth clean. I have never felt better using another brush? Funny, my wife feels the same way?</li>
            <li> this basic design works</li>
            <li> I like that these are just straightforward toothbrushes.  No racing stripes, no ergo molding, no space age bristle patterns.  Does the job, lasts a long time before deforming.</li>
            <li> This is not the same soft one the periodontist gave me for brushing my gums around my implants.  I am disappointed.  Those were blue and I did not see them on Amazon at the time.</li>
            <li> Simple and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I was looking for toothbrushes to hang in my retro toothbrush holder, which requires straight handles.  I was pleased with the fullness of the brush head, they&#x27;re soft without being &amp;#34;limp&amp;#34; and the handles are straight.  I was disappointed with how small the brushes are, over all, but they do meet all my requirements.</li>
            <li> I had my heart set on a red toothbrush as was pictured; but received a purple one.  I wonder if it is possible to pick what color you get.  It works well as a toothbrush, and I like that it is shorter in length than others I have had.</li>
            <li> Not long enough of a handle otherwise brush is good</li>
            <li> ... I wouldn&#x27;t say they are correct touting it as a brush that gives the sensation of a hard one.  If they made a MEDIUM perhaps then I&#x27;d get that feeling.  It is rated SOFT.  Let&#x27;s tell the truth.  I also wish it had a longer handle.  6.25\\&quot; long plastic feels too small in an adult hand and rather inexpensive its so featherweight.  The brush quality indeed feels great though and we are buying for the brush.  No bristles coming out in my mouth.  Tongue touches teeth that feel just polished.  I would have liked to get RED since that&#x27;s what shown.  Instead I got a clear.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing that I can not find an adult toothbrush in the stores. This is all plain adult except for the handle. It is more for a child. I wish it was an inch longer. It&#x27;s hard to get a grip in it. But I prefer it to the fancy space-age brushes they are trying to sell.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said, the handle is just a smidge short; but that&#x27;s my only complaint with this excellent brush. I have been looking for a decent soft brush with a good old-fashioned easy-to-hold square handle since they first started making &amp;#34;ergonomic&amp;#34; monstrosities. I am ordering more of these.</li>
            <li> This POH 4 row 43 tuft bristle toothbrush is even better than I hoped it would be. My teeth feel really clean after using it and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my gums at all. The bristles are soft, but clean the teeth really well. The handle is short, but it still feels good in the hand. After using the Oral B Indicator toothbrush for years, I was curious to see how this toothbrush would compare. I was amazed at how much more I liked the POH toothbrush. My teeth feel much cleaner with less effort. From now on, I will only use the POH toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It feels great and delivers on promises.What are you waiting for ?Go buy it.</li>
            <li> POH is a great company located in Tulsa OK. These quality toothbrushes work  well with the Bass method of tooth cleaning. Look up Bass method on you tube for more instruction. I am a medical provider and POH has kindly furnished free toothbrushes to me to give to my clients in need. I do some work at a free health care clinic. I appreciate POH.</li>
            <li> Better than any of the other toothbrushes with different lengths of bristles, extra bells and whistles, and better than my electric brush.</li>
            <li> Excellent head and bristles, handle could be longer. The short handle may be well thought design to limit the pressure I apply to my teeth while brushing.</li>
