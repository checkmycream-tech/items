            <li> It does not hold for long and the lace closure keeps retracking from the hairline when this product is used.</li>
            <li> The other bonds are sticky and a little messy but last for two weeks straight without reapplying.</li>
            <li> first put ur protector...then apply a thin coat of the ghost bond</li>
            <li> I had to do it a few times to get the hang of it, but, the third time was the charm...</li>
            <li> I hope eveyone reads this and listen because it is a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> And a little goes a long way...</li>
            <li> then let dry, then apply a second coat repeat at least 5 times...</li>
            <li> I have used other products that claim 2-4 week hold and wouldn&#x27;t hold over night...</li>
            <li> Use the other bonds instead.</li>
            <li> they said the same thing you have to use at least 5 coats...</li>
            <li> was just a gueewy mess.</li>
            <li> Not too messy, slight smell but bearable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took a little getting used to</li>
            <li> U have to apply it a few times...</li>
            <li> I AM HEAVY SWEATER</li>
            <li> This Ghost Bond, you have to re-apply everyday.</li>
            <li> but once I got past getting it everywhere and then trying to get it off of everywhere</li>
            <li> Sucks ðŸ‘Ž</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money and its so expensive.</li>
            <li> Product was not good for the humidity in GA and oily skin.</li>
            <li> I am mad that I wasted $30 on this garbage.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical</li>
            <li> u can&#x27;t go wrong on the hold.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> Absolutely horrible.</li>

            <li> I like the hold and clean up was very easy.</li>
            <li> I love this product it gives a long lasting hold if applied according to the directions.</li>
            <li> Best thing ever... Once you apply it PROPERLY... It works great... The first time I used it... It held my full lace on for two full weeks without reapplying... The key is when you first use it... U have to apply it a few times...first put ur protector...then apply a thin coat of the ghost bond then let dry, then apply a second coat repeat at least 5 times... Trust me this will work... I was skeptical but when I saw a Youtube video of someone using it they said the same thing you have to use at least 5 coats... And it works... Two weeks without reapplying I was happy... I have used other products that claim 2-4 week hold and wouldn&#x27;t hold over night... This does... Again if you do it PROPERLY...if u say it didn&#x27;t work that is because you didn&#x27;t do it properly... Your skin has to be clean with 70%alcohol I use 90%to ensure ....proceed with the above steps... HAPPY APPLYING...</li>
            <li> Horrible. Absolutely horrible.</li>
            <li> Got this item today and I luv it, not stringy, not messy; nor smelly. This stuff works great and does not hurt my head, secures wig, not tight hold that usually make my head hurt.  This glue is not messy at all, great hold. I&#x27;d buy this stuff again.</li>
            <li> Best glue you can buy,well worth it. Holds up to just about anything,any type weather,activities ect. Extended bond,easy to clean up and remove. Is a bit pricey but IT WORKS better than anything i have ever tried.</li>
            <li> Sucks ðŸ‘Ž I waisted my money on this terreble product .</li>
            <li> Great Adhesive for Lacefronts.  No latex or harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> Absolute best bond for lace wigs! Delivery was also fast!</li>
            <li> OK IT HOLD VERY GRIP ON LACE FRONT WIG BUT WHEN GO BED N WRAP UP MY HAIR IT HAD MOVED N NOT SET IN PLACE N I AM HEAVY SWEATER TOO ITS OK BUT I HAVE REAPPLY DAILYLY</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work.  I followed the direction to the letter and it only stuck for one day.  The nape of the hairline kept loosing up.  I kept cleaning and re-applied over and over again and again.</li>
            <li> Not too messy, slight smell but bearable. lives up to the name and holds well. Would use it again anad again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I had to do it a few times to get the hang of it, but, the third time was the charm...</li>
            <li> This is hands down this is the best glue out there</li>
            <li> It works very well it stands up to what it says. My client went swimming and it stayed on nice and tight.</li>
            <li> I bought this product as well (well not from Amazon) but it doesnt matter because it really does not work. I bought it because of beautybyjj on youtube channel. This is a waste of money and its so expensive. It does not hold for long and the lace closure keeps retracking from the hairline when this product is used. I did follow the instructions to the letter and it doesnt work. PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT BUY. Use the other bonds instead. The other bonds are sticky and a little messy but last for two weeks straight without reapplying. This Ghost Bond, you have to re-apply everyday. I am mad that I wasted $30 on this garbage. Buy the lace bonds they sell in your local beauty store. They cost $7 to $10 and works so much better. This product doesn&#x27;s even deserve a star. They get no star from me. I hope eveyone reads this and listen because it is a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Works very well! i love it, I definitely will be ordering this glue again,  it&#x27;s the best lace glue out there</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great I love it!</li>
            <li> Really love it. Better clean up</li>
            <li> Product was not good for the humidity in GA and oily skin.</li>
            <li> this glue did not do what it was supposed to it was just a gueewy mess. it did not hold very well. i tried 4 different times to apply this glue. and everytime it came undone.  The shipping was fast thats the only good thing i have to say about it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stick to wig very well, not easy to remove from hair too.</li>
            <li> Super great hold, although i feel like three layers of glue is a little much, over all very happy, hoping to get a. Greater hold with an scalp protective and you for sure need a dissolavent for removal for this product..</li>
            <li> This glue is absolutely amazing! It holds your lace in place for hours, although I don&#x27;t sleep in it, but it stays in place for 18 hours, I Love It Dearly, and I will definitely recommend this to everyone who wears a hairpiece or Lace wigs! This made me very elated! I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this product again!</li>
            <li> at first it held up very well when the wig was down but when i tried to put it in a high ponytail&lt;br /&gt;not waist your money</li>
            <li> Product works, would recommend for people who aren&#x27;t too oily on the skin and follows the directions. It&#x27;ll last up to a week</li>
            <li> This stuff works very well, I bought a bottle a few months ago from hair direct and it is the best!!!! I have also tried the Lace-it Ez Lace Wig Bond &amp; Removal System ...now this works ok!! But it wil turn white if you hop in the shower right after you apply it....an I had wrapped my hair up first and it still turned white! But the Ghose Bond is the best!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seal as good as I thought</li>
            <li> Holds my lace closure done great, just don&#x27;t know if it will be as easy to remove. I like overall</li>
            <li> This stuff is STICKY!&lt;br /&gt;It took a little getting used to but once I got past getting it everywhere and then trying to get it off of everywhere it really does have great hold and is pretty user friendly. Any problems I&#x27;m having with it are completely my own fault!</li>
            <li> This stuff works amazing....but please follow the instructions. AMAZING!!! And a little goes a long way...this is my go to adhesive....you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> If u wear lace fronts or hair systems u can&#x27;t go wrong on the hold. Very strong and lasts long</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product!!!!</li>
