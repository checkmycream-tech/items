            <li>it&#x27;s nice clean smell, the tingle from the eucalyptus oil</li>
            <li>As long as you don&#x27;t expect the stated smell, this is a great soap!!!</li>

            <li>and it is always smooth sailing.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy lathering up with this soap each morning.</li>

            <li>While the soap is not as user friendly if you have a brush it works well</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s rich foam.</li>
            <li>Lather dries up quickly but does provide a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>If you are a wet shaver, do yourself a favor and give this great shave soap a try.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s nice and soft for it&#x27;s nuptials with the razor.  </li>
            <li>Is it really worth it?</li>
            <li>but it is a product that always performs very very well-</li>
            <li>Nothing beats a hot shave in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had any hassle traveling with it because it&#x27;s more solid.  </li>
            <li>I bought it mostly because the plastic cup will not shatter like ceramic or crack like wooden ones</li>
            <li>This on the other hand just has a soap aroma with no other scent, but it is a superior shaving soap.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast and arrived on time.</li>
            <li>I like this shaving soap but is very pricey in the USA.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>

            <li>I really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li>No problems at all, and much better than the typical shaving junk at pharmacy chains.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I have tried 2 other soaps in addition to this product and so far it is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I normally use and prefer the cream, but sometimes have run into issues traveling with it from the TSA.  </li>
            <li>I have tried the very similar Omega Shaving soap which is also Eucalyptus scented and has that gentle aroma.  </li>
            <li>I have recently changed over from using canned shaving cream and  a MAC III to a straight razor, brush and scuttle.</li>
            <li>When I first started shaving with a straight razor, I tried a ton of different soaps, but they all left my skin too dry.</li>
            <li>Not a big deal to me because I really like the overall composition of the product and</li>
            <li>I have recommended this soap to a few friends who wet shave and they love it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>no other shaving soap I&#x27;ve tried even comes close</li>
            <li>It smells like an old timey barbershop and leaves you with a shave that is second to none.</li>
            <li>Omega shaving soap is the exact same product in a black bowl</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Just a terrific product.  Not really the best- but it is a product that always performs very very well- just needs a tad extra water and it is always smooth sailing.  Omega shaving soap is the exact same product in a black bowl and- well it is also a great item!</li>
            <li> Nothing beats a hot shave in the morning.  Having tried several soaps, I believe that the Proraso is the best.  The eucalyptus sent is perfect to wake up to in the morning.  The soap lasts a long time and I feel that it is a bargain.  I saw a Bill Nye, The Science Guy episode where he went ninth everything that was in the aerosol cans and the cost to the environment.  This is a simple way to be green and save money.</li>
            <li> Provides an excellent lather. Requires a touch more water than some others though. Shipped fast and arrived on time. Only shaving soap I&#x27;ll use.</li>
            <li> When I first started shaving with a straight razor, I tried a ton of different soaps, but they all left my skin too dry. Then I found Proraso. It smells like an old timey barbershop and leaves you with a shave that is second to none. Apply this with a proper brush and even a razor in need of some honing works well enough.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy lathering up with this soap each morning. It produces a rich lather with almost no effort and helps me get a great shave every time. The eucalyptus/menthol in it is very refreshing too.</li>
            <li> I have tried the very similar Omega Shaving soap which is also Eucalyptus scented and has that gentle aroma.  This on the other hand just has a soap aroma with no other scent, but it is a superior shaving soap. Easy to get a rich lather and provides superior lubrication through several strokes with the blade without needing to re-lather.  As long as you don&#x27;t expect the stated smell, this is a great soap!!!</li>
            <li> I have recently changed over from using canned shaving cream and  a MAC III to a straight razor, brush and scuttle. I am just starting to try out different products so I can form an opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Proraso Eucalyptus I am able to whip up a good lather and it leaves my face cool and refreshed when the shave is done. I have tried 2 other soaps in addition to this product and so far it is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Works , like the smell and it works , use this everday , good product , you need to use a good brush.</li>
            <li> no other shaving soap I&#x27;ve tried even comes close</li>
            <li> Develops a good lather and wets beard so it&#x27;s nice and soft for it&#x27;s nuptials with the razor.  However after rinsing it does leave a film on your sink you&#x27;ll have to deal with.  Not a big deal to me because I really like the overall composition of the product and how good it feels on my face.</li>
            <li> this stuff is THE bomb. Highly recommended. Gives you that awesome fresh tingly feeling. Is great paired with the Proraso aftershave!</li>
            <li> I like this shaving soap but is very pricey in the USA. A tub of this in Italy is about $1.50. Her it is $8.00. Is it really worth it?</li>
            <li> I normally use and prefer the cream, but sometimes have run into issues traveling with it from the TSA.  While the soap is not as user friendly if you have a brush it works well and is the same basic ingredients as the cream.  I&#x27;ve never had any hassle traveling with it because it&#x27;s more solid.  Very easy on my skin and always sets up for a great comfortable shave.    Love this stuff</li>
            <li> Started using this last year. Works great. Lathers well. No problems at all, and much better than the typical shaving junk at pharmacy chains. A brush is necessary. These containers last forever- should get over a year per cup.</li>
            <li> Aroma is definitely eucalyptus which makes it almost medicinal. Lather dries up quickly but does provide a smooth shave. I bought it mostly because the plastic cup will not shatter like ceramic or crack like wooden ones</li>
            <li> Very easy to lather. Not your traditional soap. Works very well.</li>
            <li> If you are a wet shaver, do yourself a favor and give this great shave soap a try. I love it&#x27;s nice clean smell, the tingle from the eucalyptus oil and it&#x27;s rich foam. I have recommended this soap to a few friends who wet shave and they love it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;Nice Smell&lt;br /&gt;I like the tingle from the eucalyptus oil in the soap&lt;br /&gt;Creates a nice rich foam&lt;br /&gt;Lasts soooo much longer than creams&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;This is the best shave soap I have used and one of the more inexpensive. I really like this shave soap combined with Proraso&#x27;s Pre-Shave cream. http://www.amazon.com/Proraso-Pre-shave-Cream-Refresh-Ounce/dp/B0082BYLS6/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1405120705&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;proraso+pre-shave+cream</li>
            <li> Good price,do need a brush to use this product.Nice smell,will order again. One of the nicest soaps that I know of.</li>
            <li> It is what my husband wanted.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.  Nice scent, not overpowering.  I have sensitive skin, and this seems to keep it in good shape.</li>
