            <li>I dont have anything good to say it was broke</li>
            <li>Good product for the price.</li>
            <li>Otherwise these are ok but may be found elsewhere and being able to see them in person may be best.</li>
            <li>Love this headband!</li>
            <li>Teeth is a nice plus to keep in place.</li>
            <li>I also wore it for hours at a time at work and in the evening without getting any kind of headache.</li>
            <li>Came as promised pagacked nicely-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not anything spectacular or showy, but it works.</li>
            <li>It was okay.</li>
            <li>You better buy this one, [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>better quality.</li>
            <li>however I had hoped for better from these.</li>
            <li>They work okay for this because they do tend to move around under some weight.</li>
            <li>Looks more like it might fit a toddler.  </li>
            <li>Nice headband, fits good, not tight and is comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>and i liked it because it is actually pretty comfortable.</li>
            <li>This headband takes really well to hot glue, which worked out great for when I was making horns for a costume</li>
            <li>Made of flimsy cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>The way they should be made if they would just quit being cheap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made of cheap plastic that feels brittle but doesn&#x27;t seem to be.</li>
            <li>While my head is not perfectly round like the hoop, more teeth inside it would have been better.</li>
            <li>Luckily one of these was going to be used for a costume</li>
            <li>And they were very durable and strong.</li>
            <li>This headband is exactly what it is advertised as!</li>
            <li>and I feel like they were worth trying,</li>
            <li>They are made from extremely hard plastic that I&#x27;m pretty sure will crack if I try to adjust them to make them more comfortable.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re getting this just to put your hair back, then they stay perfectly well for everyday use.</li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>and I use these for a bigger more hefty size.</li>
            <li>More clips and not totally convenient.</li>
            <li>I have a large head, but it stayed in place.</li>
            <li>Very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am very satiesfied whit this product</li>
            <li>I bought several of these headbands with the hope that they would be comfortable.</li>
            <li>They were cheap enough that I&#x27;m not going to bother returning them</li>
            <li>and it is made from very flimsy, NOT sturdy plastic.</li>
            <li>Very brittle as well.</li>
            <li>Very flimsy and doesn&#x27;t hold on head when you put a fascinator on it.</li>
            <li>they are very sturdy too - cant wait to decorate</li>
            <li>Most headbands are too tight behind the ears or dont grip the hair - this headband is excellent value for money and is light and stays on my daughters thick frizzy hair keeping her hair out of her face.</li>
            <li>They are honestly some of the most uncomfortable headbands I have ever encountered, I can only wear them for about 10 minutes before I start getting a headache.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Our one came with grey bands in the plastic on the inside, center top, and inside left and right.</li>
            <li>The exterior is completely gloss black and easy to stick adhesive backed things on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and it like similar ones that I have purchased at Wal-mart in the past.</li>
            <li>The size was good, but it was to thin, last less than a year before end up broke.</li>

            <li> I bought this for a project and i liked it because it is actually pretty comfortable. good headband to wear</li>
            <li> Nice headband, fits good, not tight and is comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> I dont have anything good to say it was broke</li>
            <li> The quality is laughable. Made of flimsy cheap plastic. The teeth are too big so they won&#x27;t even go through your hair properly. Nor will they stay put like they should be. Very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased about a couple of these things in Southeast Asia a couple of years ago. And they were very durable and strong. The way they should be made if they would just quit being cheap. Just goes to show you that the crap we are offered in the states is of poorest quality in the world. Don&#x27;t bother...</li>
            <li> Real hard plastic headband. I am very satiesfied whit this product</li>
            <li> It was okay. I have a large head, but it stayed in place. Teeth is a nice plus to keep in place. Goof for price</li>
            <li> This headband takes really well to hot glue, which worked out great for when I was making horns for a costume</li>
            <li> The size was good, but it was to thin, last less than a year before end up broke. You better buy this one, [[ASIN:B00LXPMTHI niceeshop(TM) Women Lady Non Slip Plastic Hair Hoop Wide Basic Headband with Teeth,Black]] better quality.</li>
            <li> Basic head band but works well.</li>
            <li> Most headbands are too tight behind the ears or dont grip the hair - this headband is excellent value for money and is light and stays on my daughters thick frizzy hair keeping her hair out of her face.</li>
            <li> Turned out how I expected</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I bought several of these headbands with the hope that they would be comfortable. They are honestly some of the most uncomfortable headbands I have ever encountered, I can only wear them for about 10 minutes before I start getting a headache. They are made from extremely hard plastic that I&#x27;m pretty sure will crack if I try to adjust them to make them more comfortable. Obviously, you get what you pay for however I had hoped for better from these. They were cheap enough that I&#x27;m not going to bother returning them and I feel like they were worth trying, but definitely not the comfort promised.</li>
            <li> I ordered this twice and it is made from very flimsy, NOT sturdy plastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a plastic headband that works to hold your hair back. It&#x27;s nice and it like similar ones that I have purchased at Wal-mart in the past.</li>
            <li> I used this to make ears for my Halloween costume and it was sturdy enough to withstand that (I was a Pichu aka a baby Pikachu [...] ). I also wore it for hours at a time at work and in the evening without getting any kind of headache. This headband is exactly what it is advertised as!</li>
            <li> Very small. Not as described will not fit an adult!  Looks more like it might fit a toddler.  Very brittle as well. I can see this snapping after a few uses.</li>
            <li> We actually got this headband to attach a head tracking device and for that purpose it works well. It&#x27;s made of cheap plastic that feels brittle but doesn&#x27;t seem to be. It has shallow grip dimples on the inside to catch on your hair and hold it in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our one came with grey bands in the plastic on the inside, center top, and inside left and right. The exterior is completely gloss black and easy to stick adhesive backed things on. Which is why we chose it for attaching the head tracking device to our heads.</li>
            <li> These headbands arrived on time but unfortunately were chipped in many areas even when these were in bags. Luckily one of these was going to be used for a costume and I was able to cover the issues with the accessories, but I was disappointed to see them chipped and it was more expensive for me to send back. Otherwise these are ok but may be found elsewhere and being able to see them in person may be best.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but these are not made very well. Very flimsy and doesn&#x27;t hold on head when you put a fascinator on it. Guessing they are made in China? Too bad.</li>
            <li> Grandma likes them so I like them!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using these for some antlers/horns I create for my online shop and I use these for a bigger more hefty size. They work okay for this because they do tend to move around under some weight. If you&#x27;re getting this just to put your hair back, then they stay perfectly well for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Came as promised pagacked nicely- they are very sturdy too - cant wait to decorate</li>
            <li> Love this headband! Growing my hair out and this keeps my bangs from falling in my face!</li>
            <li> While my head is not perfectly round like the hoop, more teeth inside it would have been better. I use it to keep my hair back when washing up my face, and it usually slips down. More clips and not totally convenient.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price. I use it every day and I haven&#x27;t yet had any problems with it. It&#x27;s not anything spectacular or showy, but it works.</li>
            <li> Too small even for my seven year old.</li>
            <li> I wear this to work, for those days where the front of my hair just isnt cooperating like it should. Definatly serves the purpose and is sturdy and not flimsy. Also the little spokes on the underside do not tug or pull the hair whilst its on.</li>
