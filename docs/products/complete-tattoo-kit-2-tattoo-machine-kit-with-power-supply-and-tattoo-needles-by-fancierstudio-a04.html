            <li>and the 89.00 kit come with stainless steal guns the the best because they don&#x27;t rust.</li>

            <li>Nice kit though.</li>

            <li>The kit was a nice starter but could&#x27;ve included better quality ink, and a reusable practice skin.</li>

            <li>overall i was very happy with this kit</li>
            <li>now i orered this kit for more extras for my tattooing collection.</li>
            <li>i suggest buying more coils for the gun</li>
            <li>The liner works better than the shader.  </li>
            <li>Grate for starters an to learn an even more</li>
            <li>We are pleased with it.</li>
            <li>:}</li>
            <li>i bought better ink</li>
            <li>My clients love it.</li>

            <li>so im not sayin their top</li>
            <li>many times friends started calling me note book</li>
            <li>.I was fairly pleased with this purchase...</li>
            <li>Also purchase more carbon paper which you will need.</li>
            <li>If you can afford better, do it.</li>
            <li>Dvd blows, better off watching Youtube videos.</li>
            <li>every thing was great, the dvd sucked,dvd needs to go into more detail, i bought as a gift for my brother, he watched dvd and was lost,  but would buy from them again, great prices    but other than that everything good, fast shipper,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done 14 tattoos so far and the gun is still in great shape, stencil paper is crappy though so buy more.</li>
            <li>Inks are good for fading out, better off getting real inks.</li>
            <li>love it very much the tattoo machine works great and did not have to tune it up very much</li>
            <li>so far it works great</li>

            <li>good product the ink however isn&#x27;t really good, but other than that everything worked out fine.</li>
            <li>is cheap but just order better stuff not a bad price for what you get.</li>
            <li>, everything was fine besides my liner not working and the dvd not working</li>
            <li>Great machines excellent power box helps me make great line work and get that perfect soft gray shading I look for or that hard deep black</li>
            <li>well considering it is in a cheap kit.  </li>
            <li>Still a great deal for a basic setup.</li>
            <li>but thats what u get for cheap kit</li>
            <li>I had to buy my own ink since I was using this on real skin</li>
            <li>so far so good</li>
            <li>Purchased this kit came in 2 days free shipping , came with everything in description , so far so good</li>
            <li>Holy smokes, this is a fun kit!</li>
            <li>Son in law excited when he received this for his birthday.  </li>
            <li>it freaking sucked i got so excited</li>
            <li>The product is good, the entire transaction was fine.</li>
            <li>Hey some great name brand ink, disposable tube and needle combo, more stencil paper and green soap and you will be set.</li>
            <li>I love this kit and have already done a few tattoos with it that came out looking great.</li>
            <li>Good price, fast shipping, and decent product.</li>
            <li>So far both guns have worked amazing.</li>
            <li>the line but its a cool buy</li>
            <li>i have done several tats and everything is still working good</li>
            <li>Cool tattoo kit</li>
            <li>good starting kit for beginners .</li>
            <li>i burnt it out on my fourteenth tattoo not a bad kit to start out ink</li>
            <li>Other than that, its great.</li>
            <li>Great kit, can&#x27;t bet what you get, if looking to buy any kit on here go with this, guns are really sold for chinese machines</li>
            <li>hot!&lt;br /&gt;Excellent for late night fun &amp; great for the price!</li>
            <li>His new favorite hobby.</li>
            <li>:) Buy other ink if you want to tattoo, but other than that it is great!</li>
            <li>Have obviously had to buy more ink, but the machines themselves still work no problem!</li>
            <li>this is by far a better deal .</li>
            <li>ITS WELL WORTH THE PRICE</li>
            <li>fast delivery!, was super exited to open the package everything seems to work fine for now but will not be really sure until my boyfriend opens it and starts using it after christmas.</li>
            <li>It also came with an instructional dvd, which I thought was pretty cool.</li>
            <li>, well worth it.</li>
            <li>Machines are decent for the price, fine tune them a bit and play around with the power supply as well.</li>
            <li>i am excited because i fouNd this deal.i just got a kit  with thee stainless steel guns</li>
            <li>but amazon made it right</li>
            <li>the power supply and power cord are pretty cheap, and the ink is garbage, I figured that going in, the machines are pretty ok if you&#x27;re just starting out an apprenticeship and want to learn about machines.</li>
            <li>More or less seemed okay for the price.</li>
            <li>but they sound like trying to run a cheap lawn mower next to your ear.</li>
            <li>so in the end everything is fairly decent...needs a little tuning</li>
            <li>Seller gives you EXACTLY what they describe.</li>
            <li>It does only come with one sheet of transfer paper though, so make sure to order some.</li>
            <li>, it was the first gift he opened and played with.</li>
            <li>exactly what was described.</li>
            <li>Could use a better set of instructions on basic setup.</li>
            <li>The lingering gun worked at first</li>
            <li>Satisfied overall.</li>
            <li>Fun product for a decent price</li>
            <li>the ink/one sheet of transfer paper is pretty much garbage, but the tools work.  </li>
            <li>He said at first it would jam an heat up fast.</li>
            <li>The machine although not expensive work very well.</li>
            <li>please don&#x27;t use these for &amp;#34;scratching&amp;#34; pay your dues and learn the trade, there&#x27;s no such thing as easy money</li>
            <li>the guns are strong quality they have a little weight and dont feel cheap</li>
            <li>Overall for the price it really can&#x27;t get any better, this is a great deal for starters, really need to buy a better brand of ink if you want it to last, the ink given fades after a couple months pretty bad, other than that the guns work great, shipped early, and everything was there,</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and everything was packed and wrapped nice and tight.</li>
            <li>some stuff that you cant really tell is in the picture.</li>
            <li>AND THEY ARE STAINLESS STEEL  </li>
            <li>Everything that was advertised with the kit was there and all has worked very well.</li>
            <li>Nothing to complain about really.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, everything works as it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>it was ok the one machine worked and the other didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I know I could have spent more on another kit with case, but none of the others had a high rating like this one.</li>
            <li>Overall, not a bad set up.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t watched the dvd but a decent starter/travel kit.</li>
            <li>and I guess the parts wore in  it running decent for him.</li>
            <li>Decent kit for the price</li>
            <li>But, if you&#x27;re looking at these kits, most likely you are starting out.</li>
            <li>k i recomend to buy stencil pro or stencil magic to apply the stencil and green soap .</li>
            <li>I have done a few tattoos with these machines, on myself, get better inks.</li>
            <li>The liner required some tuning to get it just right, but all of the tools are included and it only took a minute to get it up to speed.</li>
            <li>I LIKE THIS NEW KIT</li>
            <li>now I have to get new machines to go with my power supply.</li>
            <li>but I was immediately shipped a new liner that worked at no cost to me..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to the tattoo stuff</li>
            <li>tax n shipping)i got 2 1o wrap decent guns ,1 decent power supply /peddle, cables , extra gromments , o rings ,allen renches ink from taiwan, ink caps , cap holder , and a whole bunch of assorted needles ,foot pedel ,  and on the bottom of the gun thers a s for shading and a l for liner_</li>
            <li>I WAS VERY SURPRISED WITH THIS KIT</li>
            <li>LOL CRAZY RICK</li>
            <li>I have used it to rehit some of my old tattoos.</li>
            <li>the guns seemed really heavy and the ink is cheap</li>
            <li>but after the third tattoo had to do the same the power box is very touchy but functional, the ink is complete garbage</li>
            <li>Both of my machines work pretty well for how much I spent on them.</li>
            <li>then you see plenty of needles just wish it came with more black ink but other than that BUY THIS KIT</li>
            <li>luckily it was just the ink caps missing.</li>
            <li>I had to completely take it apart and put it back together for it to function.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I was somewhat skeptical of the kit, but decided to take a chance.</li>
            <li>the only thing i dont like is the dvd didnt really help you out on anything, the guy just sits their and gives someone a tattoo not very helpful</li>
            <li>it works well if you dont want to mess up your good guns on play toys for the drunk friends.</li>

            <li> now i orered this kit for more extras for my tattooing collection.</li>
            <li> i suggest buying more coils for the gun</li>
            <li> The liner works better than the shader.  </li>
            <li> Grate for starters an to learn an even more</li>
            <li> We are pleased with it.</li>
            <li> :}</li>
            <li> i bought better ink</li>
            <li> My clients love it.</li>
            <li> I was able to take apart and modify it to work more to my liking.</li>
            <li> so im not sayin their top</li>
            <li> many times friends started calling me note book</li>
            <li> .I was fairly pleased with this purchase...</li>
            <li> Also purchase more carbon paper which you will need.</li>
            <li> If you can afford better, do it.</li>
            <li> Dvd blows, better off watching Youtube videos.</li>
            <li> every thing was great, the dvd sucked,dvd needs to go into more detail, i bought as a gift for my brother, he watched dvd and was lost,  but would buy from them again, great prices    but other than that everything good, fast shipper,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done 14 tattoos so far and the gun is still in great shape, stencil paper is crappy though so buy more.</li>
            <li> Inks are good for fading out, better off getting real inks.</li>
            <li> love it very much the tattoo machine works great and did not have to tune it up very much</li>
            <li> so far it works great</li>
            <li> it came with in a real body, but good for practicing.  </li>
            <li> I love this whole set its just amazing</li>
            <li> My item came very quick</li>
            <li> It was easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good set for a decent price.</li>
            <li> good product the ink however isn&#x27;t really good, but other than that everything worked out fine.</li>
            <li> is cheap but just order better stuff not a bad price for what you get.</li>
            <li> , everything was fine besides my liner not working and the dvd not working</li>
            <li> Great machines excellent power box helps me make great line work and get that perfect soft gray shading I look for or that hard deep black</li>
            <li> well considering it is in a cheap kit.  </li>
            <li> Still a great deal for a basic setup.</li>
            <li> but thats what u get for cheap kit</li>
            <li> I had to buy my own ink since I was using this on real skin</li>
            <li> so far so good</li>
            <li> Purchased this kit came in 2 days free shipping , came with everything in description , so far so good</li>
            <li> Holy smokes, this is a fun kit!</li>
            <li> Son in law excited when he received this for his birthday.  </li>
            <li> it freaking sucked i got so excited</li>
            <li> The product is good, the entire transaction was fine.</li>
            <li> Hey some great name brand ink, disposable tube and needle combo, more stencil paper and green soap and you will be set.</li>
            <li> I love this kit and have already done a few tattoos with it that came out looking great.</li>
            <li> Good price, fast shipping, and decent product.</li>
            <li> So far both guns have worked amazing.</li>
            <li> the line but its a cool buy</li>
            <li> i have done several tats and everything is still working good</li>
            <li> Cool tattoo kit</li>
            <li> good starting kit for beginners .</li>
            <li> i burnt it out on my fourteenth tattoo not a bad kit to start out ink</li>
            <li> Other than that, its great.</li>
            <li> Great kit, can&#x27;t bet what you get, if looking to buy any kit on here go with this, guns are really sold for chinese machines</li>
            <li> hot!&lt;br /&gt;Excellent for late night fun &amp; great for the price!</li>
            <li> His new favorite hobby.</li>
            <li> :) Buy other ink if you want to tattoo, but other than that it is great!</li>
            <li> Have obviously had to buy more ink, but the machines themselves still work no problem!</li>
            <li> this is by far a better deal .</li>
            <li> ITS WELL WORTH THE PRICE</li>
            <li> fast delivery!, was super exited to open the package everything seems to work fine for now but will not be really sure until my boyfriend opens it and starts using it after christmas.</li>
            <li> It also came with an instructional dvd, which I thought was pretty cool.</li>
            <li> , well worth it.</li>
            <li> Machines are decent for the price, fine tune them a bit and play around with the power supply as well.</li>
            <li> i am excited because i fouNd this deal.i just got a kit  with thee stainless steel guns</li>
            <li> but amazon made it right</li>
            <li> the power supply and power cord are pretty cheap, and the ink is garbage, I figured that going in, the machines are pretty ok if you&#x27;re just starting out an apprenticeship and want to learn about machines.</li>
            <li> More or less seemed okay for the price.</li>
            <li> but they sound like trying to run a cheap lawn mower next to your ear.</li>
            <li> so in the end everything is fairly decent...needs a little tuning</li>
            <li> Seller gives you EXACTLY what they describe.</li>
            <li> It does only come with one sheet of transfer paper though, so make sure to order some.</li>
            <li> , it was the first gift he opened and played with.</li>
            <li> exactly what was described.</li>
            <li> Could use a better set of instructions on basic setup.</li>
            <li> The lingering gun worked at first</li>
            <li> Satisfied overall.</li>
            <li> Fun product for a decent price</li>
            <li> the ink/one sheet of transfer paper is pretty much garbage, but the tools work.  </li>
            <li> He said at first it would jam an heat up fast.</li>
            <li> The machine although not expensive work very well.</li>
            <li> please don&#x27;t use these for &amp;#34;scratching&amp;#34; pay your dues and learn the trade, there&#x27;s no such thing as easy money</li>
            <li> the guns are strong quality they have a little weight and dont feel cheap</li>
            <li> Overall for the price it really can&#x27;t get any better, this is a great deal for starters, really need to buy a better brand of ink if you want it to last, the ink given fades after a couple months pretty bad, other than that the guns work great, shipped early, and everything was there,</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and everything was packed and wrapped nice and tight.</li>
            <li> some stuff that you cant really tell is in the picture.</li>
            <li> AND THEY ARE STAINLESS STEEL  </li>
            <li> Everything that was advertised with the kit was there and all has worked very well.</li>
            <li> Nothing to complain about really.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, everything works as it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> it was ok the one machine worked and the other didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I know I could have spent more on another kit with case, but none of the others had a high rating like this one.</li>
            <li> Overall, not a bad set up.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t watched the dvd but a decent starter/travel kit.</li>
            <li> and I guess the parts wore in  it running decent for him.</li>
            <li> Decent kit for the price</li>
            <li> But, if you&#x27;re looking at these kits, most likely you are starting out.</li>
            <li> k i recomend to buy stencil pro or stencil magic to apply the stencil and green soap .</li>
            <li> I have done a few tattoos with these machines, on myself, get better inks.</li>
            <li> The liner required some tuning to get it just right, but all of the tools are included and it only took a minute to get it up to speed.</li>
            <li> I LIKE THIS NEW KIT</li>
            <li> now I have to get new machines to go with my power supply.</li>
            <li> but I was immediately shipped a new liner that worked at no cost to me..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the tattoo stuff</li>
            <li> tax n shipping)i got 2 1o wrap decent guns ,1 decent power supply /peddle, cables , extra gromments , o rings ,allen renches ink from taiwan, ink caps , cap holder , and a whole bunch of assorted needles ,foot pedel ,  and on the bottom of the gun thers a s for shading and a l for liner_</li>
            <li> I WAS VERY SURPRISED WITH THIS KIT</li>
            <li> LOL CRAZY RICK</li>
            <li> I have used it to rehit some of my old tattoos.</li>
            <li> the guns seemed really heavy and the ink is cheap</li>
            <li> but after the third tattoo had to do the same the power box is very touchy but functional, the ink is complete garbage</li>
            <li> Both of my machines work pretty well for how much I spent on them.</li>
            <li> then you see plenty of needles just wish it came with more black ink but other than that BUY THIS KIT</li>
            <li> luckily it was just the ink caps missing.</li>
            <li> I had to completely take it apart and put it back together for it to function.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I was somewhat skeptical of the kit, but decided to take a chance.</li>
            <li> the only thing i dont like is the dvd didnt really help you out on anything, the guy just sits their and gives someone a tattoo not very helpful</li>
            <li> it works well if you dont want to mess up your good guns on play toys for the drunk friends.</li>
            <li> Comes with limited tubes so I already have to restock those but overall</li>
            <li> The only thing I would say negative would be about the ink ( very cheap and thin )</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s extremely difficult to fit the needle on it.</li>
            <li> but my boyfriend said he wouldn&#x27;t have used it just by looking at it and a grip for the long tattoos.</li>
            <li> so they returned my money and it didn&#x27;t take long</li>
            <li> the input/output are not labeled, I wish the foot switch was not the click once to activate click once to deactivate but that is very minor.</li>
            <li> everything is GOOD in this kit except it doesn&#x27;t come in a case and the sheet of stencil paper was bad and dried out.</li>
            <li> It fired up and with minimal tuning I was using it.  </li>
            <li> aobut what I expected tattoo CD was not so helpful,and inks</li>
            <li> , only issue stuff was missing was it came to my house</li>
            <li> i spent the money</li>
            <li> but if you know what you are doing it will only take a few seconds.</li>
            <li> The red that was included was dried and couldn&#x27;t be salvaged.</li>
            <li> the white came all dried up.</li>
            <li> The dvd is garbage, but expected that from other reviews.  </li>
            <li> A \\&quot;Y\\&quot; IS SET UP FOR SHADING , AND THE OTHER ONE IS SETUP FOR LINING .</li>
            <li> so I just read the other reviews and made my choice that way.</li>
            <li> but i got other inks.</li>
            <li> but I ordered other ink so that&#x27;s not an issue.</li>
            <li> everything came everything works as expected the ink will fade a little bit</li>
            <li> but when it comes to the guns they where not worth anything.</li>
            <li> My only complaint about this kit is that I wish it had a case with it.</li>
            <li> my only complaint is that the &amp;#34;DVD&amp;#34; that come with it never worked for me</li>
            <li> The only issue I encountered was the rubber nipples are a bit thick</li>
            <li> not very happy, did a total of 6 tattoos (no wasting time on practice skin as I have tattooed before)</li>
            <li> For this little money to get you up and running, who can complain.</li>
            <li> Hubby has done a few on us already and works perfect!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My power supply was dead on arrival, but Amazon let me return the kit</li>
            <li> the only real complaint I have is</li>
            <li> Fake skin is kinda thin compared to real skin.</li>
            <li> The only issue that I have is that the ink is complete crap, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied but working with what I got</li>
            <li> I know tattoo artists will tell you that this is a bad idea because it causes bad habits and shouldn&#x27;t be used by people who aren&#x27;t properly trained, although that is true</li>
            <li> Just the fake skins to buy don&#x27;t work very well, the gun stops working when pressure from it is applied to the fake skin.</li>
            <li> I love the kit, everything works, came on time, only thing is practice skin bull crap and stencil paper crap.</li>
            <li> THE DVD SUCKS  MINES HAD NO AUDIO.</li>
            <li> The only disappointment was the foot switch.</li>
            <li> this should do well as a starter kit (but as stated by others, the video sucks).</li>
            <li> And as everyone else said the ink sucks.</li>
            <li> this is a serious deal.  </li>
            <li> The one it came with is NOT good for practice.</li>
            <li> DVD sucks, ink sucks, and fake skin sucks, but everything else is on point.</li>
            <li> one machine was broken and did not work,and i did not get needles with this.dont buy it</li>
            <li> i use mine for my friends who like to drink and give tattooing a shot on some fake skin...</li>
            <li> Inks are garbage &amp; the DVD is useless.</li>
            <li> The transfer paper that was included was terribly wrinkled and not worth using.</li>
            <li> Shipping wasn&#x27;t so bad.</li>
            <li> Came with a lot of crap, hopefully I can figure out where they go, apart from that</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Great kit, can&#x27;t bet what you get, if looking to buy any kit on here go with this, guns are really sold for chinese machines just need to be tuned but wow it&#x27;s the best bang for your buck on Amazon! Hey some great name brand ink, disposable tube and needle combo, more stencil paper and green soap and you will be set. Greasy buy!!</li>
            <li> the ink/one sheet of transfer paper is pretty much garbage, but the tools work.  the only real complaint I have is the input/output are not labeled, I wish the foot switch was not the click once to activate click once to deactivate but that is very minor. It fired up and with minimal tuning I was using it.  haven&#x27;t watched the dvd but a decent starter/travel kit.</li>
            <li> good power supply , alot of good extras but when it comes to the guns they where not worth anything. they have power and they might get the job done but they sound like trying to run a cheap lawn mower next to your ear. i use mine for my friends who like to drink and give tattooing a shot on some fake skin... it works well if you dont want to mess up your good guns on play toys for the drunk friends.</li>
            <li> This machine is great and  easy to figure out. Seller gives you EXACTLY what they describe. This is an excellent machine to start with and both machines are labeled for easy identification.</li>
            <li> every thing was great, the dvd sucked,dvd needs to go into more detail, i bought as a gift for my brother, he watched dvd and was lost,  but would buy from them again, great prices    but other than that everything good, fast shipper,</li>
            <li> If you just want to practice and not spend a lot of money this is the way to go. I know tattoo artists will tell you that this is a bad idea because it causes bad habits and shouldn&#x27;t be used by people who aren&#x27;t properly trained, although that is true, I have given my father two tattoos with it and they turned out great. The only issue that I have is that the ink is complete crap, but you get what you pay for. Both of my machines work pretty well for how much I spent on them. :) Buy other ink if you want to tattoo, but other than that it is great!</li>
            <li> I love this whole set its just amazing it comes with everything you see and some stuff that you cant really tell is in the picture. It does only come with one sheet of transfer paper though, so make sure to order some. The guns are great! I am very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> the power supply and power cord are pretty cheap, and the ink is garbage, I figured that going in, the machines are pretty ok if you&#x27;re just starting out an apprenticeship and want to learn about machines. please don&#x27;t use these for &amp;#34;scratching&amp;#34; pay your dues and learn the trade, there&#x27;s no such thing as easy money</li>
            <li> THIS  IS A GREAT KIT , THE SHIPPING IS VERY FAST GOT IN TWO DAYS . I WAS VERY SURPRISED WITH THIS KIT , IT HAS EVERYTHING TO START WITH  . THE DVD SUCKS  MINES HAD NO AUDIO. THE GUNS ARE GREAT ,THE ONE THAT LOOKS LIKE A \\&quot;Y\\&quot; IS SET UP FOR SHADING , AND THE OTHER ONE IS SETUP FOR LINING . THE BRAND OF INK IS OK BUT I RECOMMEND \\&quot;MOM&#x27;S\\&quot; INK ....... THIS KIT IS GREAT FOR A BEGINNER OR PRO .. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ANY ONE WHO LOOKING TO BE A TATTOO ARTIST  .</li>
            <li> amatur or beginner this is a serious deal.  today i got my kit , man i was supprised , cant believe i was payin hundreds for kits and i coulda got this . ok for sixty bucks(with tax n shipping)i got 2 1o wrap decent guns ,1 decent power supply /peddle, cables , extra gromments , o rings ,allen renches ink from taiwan, ink caps , cap holder , and a whole bunch of assorted needles ,foot pedel ,  and on the bottom of the gun thers a s for shading and a l for liner_ i seen a review where they said one looks like a y ? well this aint no bull, i been tattin for years and honestly compared to inkcraft or superior this is by far a better deal . only prob i had was the foam from the package was all over sticking to my hands .  k i recomend to buy stencil pro or stencil magic to apply the stencil and green soap . but thats the big deal . buy this and you will realize how supprised i was . ups is shipped mine got it in 2 days , and i wasent expecting it...overall i was very happy with this kit and i feel i know what im talking about as i went thru about 5 diffrent kits from diffrent supplyers..</li>
            <li> i am excited because i fouNd this deal.i just got a kit  with thee stainless steel guns and they are nice, i got the kit with everything you need, ichanged the springs out of one and made it shader.i got a good deal on this kit  it was 89.oo it came with a nice box and all the works.so now i orered this kit for more extras for my tattooing collection. and the 89.00 kit come with stainless steal guns the the best because they don&#x27;t rust. i learned to read the comments before i buy.I LIKE THIS NEW KIT BECAUSE ITS ALREADY SET UP WITH A SHADER AND LINNER ISTEAD OF  THOSE LINNER AND SHADER GUNS FOR BOTH AND THEY ARE STAINLESS STEEL  LOL CRAZY RICK</li>
            <li> Received my kit and loving it!</li>
            <li> I bought this kit cheap hoping for the best and everything is awesome works great did alot of tattoos already with it i suggest buying more coils for the gun i burnt it out on my fourteenth tattoo not a bad kit to start out ink is cheap but just order better stuff not a bad price for what you get.</li>
            <li> My item came very quick I think like 2 or 3 days, packaged good. The kit was a nice starter but could&#x27;ve included better quality ink, and a reusable practice skin. The one it came with is NOT good for practice.</li>
            <li> Everything in this kit worked great and was awesome right off the bat but an hour into using it to practice the foot pedal stopped working. Happy with everything else besides that</li>
            <li> Great machines excellent power box helps me make great line work and get that perfect soft gray shading I look for or that hard deep black</li>
            <li> everything is GOOD in this kit except it doesn&#x27;t come in a case and the sheet of stencil paper was bad and dried out.</li>
            <li> What colors does it come with and does it come with ink cases ?</li>
            <li> couldnt ask for a better kit having a blast already did two tat and very pleased how good the guns work and dont let the picture fool you there is more to the kit then you see plenty of needles just wish it came with more black ink but other than that BUY THIS KIT ITS WELL WORTH THE PRICE ......... YOURS TRULY INK MASTER WEST VIRGINIA</li>
            <li> This product is just as discribed in discription the needles are good the machine is good its all good but the inks are really cheap still a great deal!</li>
            <li> Yeah buddy, this is a good one</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves it. I would recommend buying different ink I read the reviews and ordered the ink when I ordered the kit so I haven&#x27;t tried the ink but my boyfriend said he wouldn&#x27;t have used it just by looking at it and a grip for the long tattoos. But it comes with everything you would need. He tattooed me last week and everything worked. Great price for a great kit.</li>
            <li> Two simple guns, a bunch of different tips and stuff you probably won&#x27;t use, and one practice skin.  Power source works well considering it is in a cheap kit.  Inks are great for practice, but i&#x27;d never consider putting them in a clients skin.  When you get good at the art of tattooing, then get yourself some good inks.  Eternal, Starbrite, Mothers, etc..... But as I said, this is a solid setup for someone just wanting to learn or dabble with tattooing.</li>
            <li> For this little money to get you up and running, who can complain. Trash the ink, upgrade your coils, get some backup machines and you are going...</li>
            <li> fast delivery!, was super exited to open the package everything seems to work fine for now but will not be really sure until my boyfriend opens it and starts using it after christmas. But will re edit this review later on and see how it hold up</li>
            <li> The liner works better than the shader.  Shader is out of whack, and I had to tune it.  Not that big of a deal, but would suck for newbies.  The dvd is garbage, but expected that from other reviews.  I wouldn&#x27;t trust putting the ink it came with in a real body, but good for practicing.  Fake skin is kinda thin compared to real skin.</li>
            <li> he guns is great ink could be better and more of it and more needles would be great to ty</li>
            <li> Great for beginners. Got this for my husband and he loves it. His new favorite hobby. Good purchase.</li>
            <li> Grate for starters an to learn an even more I think this is even grate for people that r pros an just need the tools</li>
            <li> This comes with everything a beginning tattooist would need. My boyfriend was thrilled when we opened the box. I have used it to rehit some of my old tattoos. It also came with an instructional dvd, which I thought was pretty cool. Good price, fast shipping, and decent product.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son. I didn&#x27;t know anything about buying anything like this so I just read the other reviews and made my choice that way. He said at first it would jam an heat up fast. Now he has the hang of it and I guess the parts wore in  it running decent for him. We are pleased with it.</li>
            <li> The machine although not expensive work very well. Everything that was advertised with the kit was there and all has worked very well. Packaging was great. The only thing I would say negative would be about the ink ( very cheap and thin )</li>
            <li> aobut what I expected tattoo CD was not so helpful,and inks I have only tried the blue and red so far so good</li>
            <li> A gift for my hubby, it was the first gift he opened and played with. He is very pleased with how well it is for him to use, I am now on my way to getting my 3 tattoo. :}</li>
            <li> not very happy, did a total of 6 tattoos (no wasting time on practice skin as I have tattooed before) I got a total of 6 tattoos and both the liner and shading machines dies. now I have to get new machines to go with my power supply.</li>
            <li> This came with alot for just 40 bucks! I didnt like the tutorial disk but you can find good ones on youtube! I didnt try the ink on myself though i wouldnt trust this but i got other inks.</li>
            <li> came quick and it was very good quality equipment i love them and have used them quite frequent since i have had them also an awesome price</li>
            <li> one machine was broken and did not work,and i did not get needles with this.dont buy it</li>
            <li> I got 2 of this tattoo kits for myself and my son. love it very much the tattoo machine works great and did not have to tune it up very much I have done lots of tats already so far it works great</li>
            <li> Holy smokes, this is a fun kit! 33 dollars is a great price to learn about how tattoo machines are built and tuned.  I purchased this because I was watching some shows like Best Ink and Tattoo Master and wanted to know more about how the machines worked. I would purchase it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, don&#x27;t even think about tattooing someone with this crappy ink. You can tattoo someone with a toothbrush and a pin, but the ink is what lasts forever.</li>
            <li> Overall for the price it really can&#x27;t get any better, this is a great deal for starters, really need to buy a better brand of ink if you want it to last, the ink given fades after a couple months pretty bad, other than that the guns work great, shipped early, and everything was there,</li>
            <li> Great gun for the price, only issue stuff was missing was it came to my house luckily it was just the ink caps missing. I&#x27;ve done 14 tattoos so far and the gun is still in great shape, stencil paper is crappy though so buy more.</li>
            <li> great machines everything works perfectly, i have no complaints very good starter kit or for someone who is doing an apprenticeship. the only thing i dont like is the dvd didnt really help you out on anything, the guy just sits their and gives someone a tattoo not very helpful</li>
            <li> This was one of the best and cheapest kits that there was...figured we would try it...Sooooooo glad we did! Works awesome! Hubby has done a few on us already and works perfect!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**EDIT***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is now 2015 and it STILL works great! Have obviously had to buy more ink, but the machines themselves still work no problem!</li>
            <li> great buy. i dont know about the ink though. i bought better ink</li>
            <li> great starter kit.the practice skin is alright.power supply works well.this is just a practice kit for me.well priced for what u get.</li>
            <li> The equipment was and is great for the price. I wish it can with transfer paper. My clients love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to follow. I didn&#x27;t need to watch the DVD to figure out how to put the guns together. I just looked it up online. Very easy. I received the package on time and with everything in it. Looks like the pictures. Nothing to complain about really. Just the fake skins to buy don&#x27;t work very well, the gun stops working when pressure from it is applied to the fake skin. And the guns shouldn&#x27;t do that. Other than that, its great.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It was very cheap and everything was in good working condition it it exactly what was described.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I was somewhat skeptical of the kit, but decided to take a chance. It arrived sooner than expected and complete. Everything works great! The only disappointment was the foot switch. When pressed, it locks in either on or off positions, making it somewhat tricky when using. I was able to take apart and modify it to work more to my liking.</li>
            <li> i suggest you get this one and not the one with the carrying case this one comes with so many accesories its riddiculous...already gave myself an awesome stick figure tatoo ...the guns are strong quality they have a little weight and dont feel cheap im not a pro so im not sayin their top o the line but its a cool buy and im not dissapointed i spent the money</li>
            <li> I love the kit, everything works, came on time, only thing is practice skin bull crap and stencil paper crap. DVD never should have never been made . 4 stars over all</li>
            <li> Good deal for the money. The machines were very good quality as well as the power supply. The supplied needles weren&#x27;t so great though. Still a great deal for a basic setup. Recommended!</li>
            <li> Great tattoo kit ive tattooed my self many times friends started calling me note book lmao but awsome starter kit great needles and the gun was great aslo the power suply was awsome to</li>
            <li> I luv this set up i have done several tats and everything is still working good dont have any complaints</li>
            <li> for the price, this is a great set. everything is just as in the description. this should do well as a starter kit (but as stated by others, the video sucks).</li>
            <li> I love this kit and have already done a few tattoos with it that came out looking great. My only complaint about this kit is that I wish it had a case with it. I know I could have spent more on another kit with case, but none of the others had a high rating like this one. All in all, the quality of the materials in this kit are great.</li>
            <li> Fun product for a decent price , everything was fine besides my liner not working and the dvd not working but I was immediately shipped a new liner that worked at no cost to me..so in the end everything is fairly decent...needs a little tuning but if you know what you are doing it will only take a few seconds. .I was fairly pleased with this purchase...even if the machines aren&#x27;t American made</li>
            <li> The only thing keeping this from 5 stars is the instructional video.Could use a better set of instructions on basic setup. Nice kit though.</li>
            <li> So far both guns have worked amazing. Shipping was fast and everything was packed and wrapped nice and tight. I haven&#x27;t used the ink so no comment on that. 5/5 👌🏾👌🏾</li>
            <li> the guns seemed really heavy and the ink is cheap i wouldnt use the ink but thats what u get for cheap kit</li>
            <li> More or less seemed okay for the price. Inks are garbage &amp; the DVD is useless. My power supply was dead on arrival, but Amazon let me return the kit so I can&#x27;t be too upset. I did not get to actually use any of the equipment.</li>
            <li> Cool tattoo kit everything came everything works as expected the ink will fade a little bit</li>
            <li> Great beginner kit for the price</li>
            <li> Son in law excited when he received this for his birthday.  He enjoys tatoos and cant wait to get good at creating them</li>
            <li> I tried it. It was easy to use. Nice. I ink my buddy skin. Awesome! And my brother in law tried to use it too. He&#x27;s a good tattoo artist. And he&#x27;s a filipino. That&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> The product is good, the entire transaction was fine. Came on time, all that is pictured comes with it....my only complaint is that the &amp;#34;DVD&amp;#34; that come with it never worked for me so I had NO idea how to put the equipment together. I&#x27;m new to the tattoo stuff and I have NO idea how to put any of it together. Besides the DVD that never worked there is NO instructions. ZERO!!&lt;br /&gt;So you get all this stuff, all these bags, and you have NO idea how to put it together.&lt;br /&gt;Thank the heavens for youtube.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done great work wit it. I never had a problem with this kit, except that it doesnt come with a case</li>
            <li> it freaking sucked i got so excited wen i got this and tried doin a tattoo and it jus came out like s***. i want my money back</li>
            <li> I have done some practice tattooing as well as received 2 tattoos with this machine. I had to buy my own ink since I was using this on real skin but you could use the ones that come with it as practice. Comes with limited tubes so I already have to restock those but overall, well worth it.</li>
            <li> Purchased this kit came in 2 days free shipping , came with everything in description , so far so good +</li>
            <li> Shipping wasn&#x27;t so bad. Didn&#x27;t even get 2 tattoo guns. Got a completely different tattoo gun from the picture. Not satisfied but working with what I got</li>
            <li> Everything you need to get started, except the ink. The ink included is for practice skins and grapefruits. Do not use the provided ink on a person. The red that was included was dried and couldn&#x27;t be salvaged. The liner required some tuning to get it just right, but all of the tools are included and it only took a minute to get it up to speed. The transfer paper that was included was terribly wrinkled and not worth using. It&#x27;s a good set for a decent price.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, everything works as it&#x27;s supposed to. The only issue I encountered was the rubber nipples are a bit thick and it&#x27;s extremely difficult to fit the needle on it. I&#x27;ve checked to see if there were smaller sizes but there were not. And as everyone else said the ink sucks. My white ink was clumped n curdled but I ordered other ink so that&#x27;s not an issue.</li>
            <li> Bought and did 5 medium tatts and some stars on myself, machines wrkd good but after a while they do get hot!&lt;br /&gt;Excellent for late night fun &amp; great for the price!</li>
            <li> GREAT product for the money!! Great start up kit everything you need to get started in your profession and Dvd was helpful too</li>
            <li> it was ok the one machine worked and the other didn&#x27;t but amazon made it right and they could not do anything about the ink so they returned my money and it didn&#x27;t take long</li>
            <li> If you are guessing if this is a good buy, well I would say yes! For beginners perfect! I recommend buying your own ink however. Also purchase more carbon paper which you will need.</li>
            <li> Came with a lot of crap, hopefully I can figure out where they go, apart from that it works</li>
            <li> The package came on time with everything it was suppose to have. The DVD did not work was trash but you can use YouTube for good tutorials. The shadowing gun did not work I had to completely take it apart and put it back together for it to function. The lingering gun worked at first but after the third tattoo had to do the same the power box is very touchy but functional, the ink is complete garbage the white came all dried up. Decent kit for the price</li>
            <li> Overall, not a bad set up. Machines are decent for the price, fine tune them a bit and play around with the power supply as well. Inks are good for fading out, better off getting real inks. If you can afford better, do it. But, if you&#x27;re looking at these kits, most likely you are starting out. I have done a few tattoos with these machines, on myself, get better inks. Dvd blows, better off watching Youtube videos. Delivery time, spot on, packaged well and came with everything stated. Satisfied overall.</li>
            <li> good starting kit for beginners . good product the ink however isn&#x27;t really good, but other than that everything worked out fine.</li>
            <li> this price was so nice I had to do it twice. everything you need is right here to get you on your way to a great tatttoing experience</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase. DVD sucks, ink sucks, and fake skin sucks, but everything else is on point.</li>
