            <li>There are lots of great products out there that can help your hair at a much better price.</li>
            <li>Since I liked the smell, I looked at the ingredients and figured it might be good as a body cream.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>And I LOVE the fragrance of this product!</li>
            <li>Kept my kids here hair moist but not oily and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>yet it&#x27;s equally effective.</li>
            <li>Baby Buttercreme is an effective moisturizer for all of us.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re okay with those products then this might be a good purchase for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really really liked the effect it had</li>
            <li>product has a pleasant scent but its a bit strong for me; the Smell lingers for days.</li>
            <li>Perfect for people that are transitioning will keep your hair from breaking off plus it leaves your hair feeling very soft  </li>
            <li>nice curly and shining, cost a more on line</li>
            <li>Love your natural hair and give it the best!</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>Your kinks will still be kinks, although possibly more moisturized and manageable.</li>
            <li>This is what petroletum and mineral oil does and these two things are in mostly ALL of miss jessie&#x27;s products.  </li>
            <li>I love how my curls stick out my 4a, 4b hair when I use this creame.</li>
            <li>It makes the process much easier and it smells great.</li>
            <li>Love the smell &amp; the way my hair look &amp; feel after using it.</li>
            <li>works excellent on my 4c hair, i recently added some grapeseed oil to it</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s best to buy the sample size of this product before investing in a larger size.</li>
            <li>I love this product for it&#x27;s shine, and smell and softness of my curls.</li>
            <li>Love this hair cream.</li>
            <li>Once again I so love it.</li>
            <li>you like the smell of cocoa butter, you&#x27;d love this product&#x27;s aroma.</li>
            <li>This product works great on my 6 month old daughters hair.</li>
            <li>They smell good, however they are really over priced.</li>
            <li>Best if put on while wet for twist or braid outs!</li>
            <li>This has a strong scent considering it&#x27;s for kids.</li>
            <li>; if you are natural or transitioning this is the prefect product for very healthy hair with great shine and soft to the touch .</li>
            <li>This product is great for defineing your curls, but it can easily cause build up on your hair if you keep on applying it daily .</li>
            <li>Noticed a huge difference in my daughters hair with just a couple uses.</li>
            <li>Baby Buttercreme is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Example, my daughter has fantastic curly hair and washes a lot because of chlorine.</li>
            <li>I will keep an eye on the progress of my hair but so far so good.</li>
            <li>Now her curls stay curled and no more fly always!!!!!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any significant curl definition with this product.</li>
            <li>I started using this product on my 1 year old, and it is amazing.</li>
            <li>Their products are probably really inexpensive to make, and they charge all that money for their creative marketing.</li>
            <li>I find the scent a bit too pronounced but it fades fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>I love this product for making my dry hair look a bit better.</li>
            <li>Well worth the splurge.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>The product does moisturize my hair, but I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s bit pricy, but worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the perfume.  </li>
            <li>I use it rarely just to give me a smell.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>The product itself I love and would recommend for natural hair.</li>
            <li>Good for soft finger curls on  natural  hair</li>
            <li>Not only does this product smells good, but it also keeps my sons hair luxuriously soft and full.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve been through &amp; tried &amp; experimented with MANY MANY \\&quot;black\\&quot; hair care products &amp; now most recently \\&quot;NATURAL BLACK HAIR\\&quot; care products in my day...&amp; \\&quot;MY\\</li>
            <li>We are in a recession and it&#x27;s best to not waste money on an expensive  product that you may not like :)&lt;</li>
            <li>If you find yourself scratching your head after using certain products like this, reconsider what products you&#x27;re using on your hair!</li>
            <li>Do the math and be economically smart, ladies!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been \\&quot;NATURAL\\&quot; my WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE without ever of ANY KIND for ANY REASON</li>
            <li>The only thing it was good for was for my edges, and don&#x27;t apply it directly to your scalp, it will itch.</li>
            <li>Like I said its not a bad scent just a bit strong for me personally.</li>
            <li>I tried most of Miss Jessie&#x27;s products because of the big hype about them.  </li>
            <li>A real disaster!</li>
            <li>I ended up with many knots in my hair and lost big lumps of hair trying to untangled it!</li>
            <li>first saw this product being used in my niece&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>And thats exactly what this product did to my hair.</li>
            <li>Even though it is a great product, it is way too pricey, and the only time I buy their products is during their buy one get one free (of equal or lesser value) deal during the month of December.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the smell because it doesn&#x27;t smell too strong like other products we tried.</li>
            <li>Smells great, a little goes a long way and great for natural dry hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only thing is it smells kinda strong.</li>
            <li>I do not have to use a high amount of this product, even if I&#x27;m twisting my hair for the first time from after washing/deep conditioning my hair.  </li>
            <li>They also made my hair very greasy.  </li>
            <li>If you use too much you will get residue..</li>
            <li>If I use too much, it will flake.</li>
            <li>This product was so beefed up after I heard so much about it</li>
            <li>I really wish I looked twice at the ingredients in this product before buying it...</li>
            <li>So, I don&#x27;t understand how this product can claim to be \\&quot;moisturizing\\&quot; &amp; \\&quot;hydrating\\&quot; when it does the very opposite with its cheap ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re looking for REAL hydration and GOOD/Natural Ingredients.</li>
            <li>This price was much reasonable than the store prices.</li>
            <li>I bought this just for the sake of saying I&#x27;ve tried it but then ended up really liking the smell and the moisture it adds to my hair.</li>
            <li>I must have used too much.  </li>
            <li>Purchase small to try out first, but there are a gazillion products out there, you may just want to try a make your own mix knowing what works for you.  </li>
            <li>but the other top note made me feel some type of way.  </li>
            <li>I only buy at the once yearly BOGO sale, as paying full price hurts my heart.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t do as much research as I normally would b/c</li>
            <li>&quot; particular hair texture is a 4a some days a 4c others.</li>
            <li>This product really does leave my hair soft and prevents dryness.  </li>
            <li>Not smooth and healthy, like the Kinky Curly line.  </li>
            <li>placed ANY type of chemicals in my hair to permanently or \\&quot;temporary\\&quot; change my NATURAL \\&quot;black\\&quot; hair color and/or texture for the full and entire 28 years</li>
            <li>(Yes, black women with their TRUE VIRGIN hair do exist out there in the real world!...</li>
            <li>If you truly care about your natural hair and want it to be its healthiest, DO NOT use any products contaning petroletum or mineral oil!  </li>
            <li>It keeps my one year old hair shiny almost all day!</li>
            <li>It may be user error because I am new to going natural.</li>
            <li>I would say use essential oils like pure Castor, Coconut, Jojoba, sweet Almond, Olive or any other of your choosing to ensure your hair has all the moisture</li>
            <li>I have been trying to find something cheaper and all natural with no luck.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product since 2009 to do twist outs on my 4b/4c natural hair.</li>
            <li>how soft it made  my hair feel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been alive on this Earth...</li>
            <li>I have been natural for over a year and am a recovering \\&quot;product junkie\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>You can go through an 8 oz jar in 10 days if used frequently.</li>
            <li>Makes hair become soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I saw the product in action for myself.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Mineral oil and petroletum dry your hair, hinder growth, and do not allow moisture, which is what all black hair needs most.  </li>
            <li>Ok product but a ridiculous price.  </li>
            <li>Even though my hair is long, I just now (after one whole year) emptied my 8oz jar of this product.</li>
            <li>The products are very good but a little too expensive.  </li>
            <li>As mentioned in the title, this product goes a long way, and works better if you do not glob a handful in your hair (unless your hair is down your back).</li>
            <li>When I use the butter creme in my natural \\&quot;black/afro\\&quot; hair to assist with defining \\&quot;MY\\&quot; particular natural black hair texture/curl pattern when I&#x27;m putting my hair in 2 strand twists before going to sleep.  </li>
            <li>and I use a different moisturizer to keep it soft throughout the week.</li>
            <li>Completely ruined my flat twist out.</li>
            <li>After reading the ingredients, this product contains the TOP unhealthy beauty ingredients to stay away from such as petrolatum and mineral oil.  </li>
            <li>I generally use it for twist- or braid-outs and sometimes simply as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For being priced at nearly $40 for only 8 ounces...with really CRAPPY results, only a fool would waste their money on it.</li>

            <li> We are in a recession and it&#x27;s best to not waste money on an expensive  product that you may not like :)&lt;</li>
            <li> If you find yourself scratching your head after using certain products like this, reconsider what products you&#x27;re using on your hair!</li>
            <li> Do the math and be economically smart, ladies!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been \\&quot;NATURAL\\&quot; my WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE without ever of ANY KIND for ANY REASON</li>
            <li> The only thing it was good for was for my edges, and don&#x27;t apply it directly to your scalp, it will itch.</li>
            <li> Like I said its not a bad scent just a bit strong for me personally.</li>
            <li> I tried most of Miss Jessie&#x27;s products because of the big hype about them.  </li>
            <li> A real disaster!</li>
            <li> I ended up with many knots in my hair and lost big lumps of hair trying to untangled it!</li>
            <li> first saw this product being used in my niece&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> And thats exactly what this product did to my hair.</li>
            <li> Even though it is a great product, it is way too pricey, and the only time I buy their products is during their buy one get one free (of equal or lesser value) deal during the month of December.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the smell because it doesn&#x27;t smell too strong like other products we tried.</li>
            <li> Smells great, a little goes a long way and great for natural dry hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only thing is it smells kinda strong.</li>
            <li> I do not have to use a high amount of this product, even if I&#x27;m twisting my hair for the first time from after washing/deep conditioning my hair.  </li>
            <li> They also made my hair very greasy.  </li>
            <li> If you use too much you will get residue..</li>
            <li> If I use too much, it will flake.</li>
            <li> This product was so beefed up after I heard so much about it</li>
            <li> I really wish I looked twice at the ingredients in this product before buying it...</li>
            <li> So, I don&#x27;t understand how this product can claim to be \\&quot;moisturizing\\&quot; &amp; \\&quot;hydrating\\&quot; when it does the very opposite with its cheap ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re looking for REAL hydration and GOOD/Natural Ingredients.</li>
            <li> This price was much reasonable than the store prices.</li>
            <li> I bought this just for the sake of saying I&#x27;ve tried it but then ended up really liking the smell and the moisture it adds to my hair.</li>
            <li> I must have used too much.  </li>
            <li> Purchase small to try out first, but there are a gazillion products out there, you may just want to try a make your own mix knowing what works for you.  </li>
            <li> but the other top note made me feel some type of way.  </li>
            <li> I only buy at the once yearly BOGO sale, as paying full price hurts my heart.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t do as much research as I normally would b/c</li>
            <li> &quot; particular hair texture is a 4a some days a 4c others.</li>
            <li> This product really does leave my hair soft and prevents dryness.  </li>
            <li> Not smooth and healthy, like the Kinky Curly line.  </li>
            <li> placed ANY type of chemicals in my hair to permanently or \\&quot;temporary\\&quot; change my NATURAL \\&quot;black\\&quot; hair color and/or texture for the full and entire 28 years</li>
            <li> (Yes, black women with their TRUE VIRGIN hair do exist out there in the real world!...</li>
            <li> If you truly care about your natural hair and want it to be its healthiest, DO NOT use any products contaning petroletum or mineral oil!  </li>
            <li> It keeps my one year old hair shiny almost all day!</li>
            <li> It may be user error because I am new to going natural.</li>
            <li> I would say use essential oils like pure Castor, Coconut, Jojoba, sweet Almond, Olive or any other of your choosing to ensure your hair has all the moisture</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find something cheaper and all natural with no luck.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product since 2009 to do twist outs on my 4b/4c natural hair.</li>
            <li> how soft it made  my hair feel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been alive on this Earth...</li>
            <li> I have been natural for over a year and am a recovering \\&quot;product junkie\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> You can go through an 8 oz jar in 10 days if used frequently.</li>
            <li> Makes hair become soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I saw the product in action for myself.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Mineral oil and petroletum dry your hair, hinder growth, and do not allow moisture, which is what all black hair needs most.  </li>
            <li> Ok product but a ridiculous price.  </li>
            <li> Even though my hair is long, I just now (after one whole year) emptied my 8oz jar of this product.</li>
            <li> The products are very good but a little too expensive.  </li>
            <li> As mentioned in the title, this product goes a long way, and works better if you do not glob a handful in your hair (unless your hair is down your back).</li>
            <li> When I use the butter creme in my natural \\&quot;black/afro\\&quot; hair to assist with defining \\&quot;MY\\&quot; particular natural black hair texture/curl pattern when I&#x27;m putting my hair in 2 strand twists before going to sleep.  </li>
            <li> and I use a different moisturizer to keep it soft throughout the week.</li>
            <li> Completely ruined my flat twist out.</li>
            <li> After reading the ingredients, this product contains the TOP unhealthy beauty ingredients to stay away from such as petrolatum and mineral oil.  </li>
            <li> I generally use it for twist- or braid-outs and sometimes simply as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For being priced at nearly $40 for only 8 ounces...with really CRAPPY results, only a fool would waste their money on it.</li>
            <li> I have used this particular product for a little close to a year now as a 2 to possibly 3 time per week moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> MJ recommends using this for dry twistouts, but for my type 4 hair, that was a BIG NO.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for styling my (dry) hair in double strand twists.</li>
            <li> My husband has slightly coarse, wavy hair, my eldest son has loose soft curls, I have soft and tightly coily hair, and my baby has very tightly coiled and coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better luck with less expensive hair products with similar ingredients.</li>
            <li> I put a little on one of my leg, well a few hours later my leg was blue because this product took the stain out of my very old blue socks !!!  </li>
            <li> I feel like MJ uses their founders&#x27; big, curly hair to sell a dream to naturals who want their hair to be something it&#x27;s really not.</li>
            <li> The ingredients within the product are not natural.</li>
            <li> My baby girls hair is so curly that it would tangle and look dry.</li>
            <li> My hair looks like a grease ball, and it has always been dry.  </li>
            <li> I went to the store looking for a moisturizer for my dry hair.</li>
            <li> I dont know what the makers of miss jessies product were thinking about putting the absolute WORSE possible ingriediants in their products.  </li>
            <li> This product did not live up to it&#x27;s description at all.  </li>
            <li> Everyone knows these three are NOT GOOD for your hair since they are VERY DRYING &amp; leave your hair feeling GREASY.</li>
            <li> My curls looked good, but I get shrinkage when I style damp hair, so I was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> Also left her hair a little crunchy.</li>
            <li> I would agree with the members who stated that they do not or would not use this as a DAILY moisturizer, because it is a bit heavy &amp; thick for THAT particular type of \\&quot;regular\\&quot; usage, UNLESS your specific type of hair texture gets DUMB DRY on a consistently daily basis.  </li>
            <li> but I have to wet my hair every day and reapply.  </li>
            <li> What kept it from being a 5 star product is that it does not really make detangling MY hair easier.</li>
            <li> This is greasy, thick, and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair soft.  </li>
            <li> With Ms. Jessie&#x27;s products a little will go a long way.</li>
            <li> And a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I bought this and other products from the Miss Jessies&#x27; site.  </li>
            <li> just like with any other product.</li>
            <li> A little on the expensive side but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had the worse for long enough.  </li>
            <li> Some of the ingredients are common allergens and they are potentially toxic.</li>
            <li> It did nothing to \\&quot;spring up\\&quot; the curls, all it did was make them look greasy, yet dry at the same time, and curls were actually decreased.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this to do a two strand twist out, but once I took my hair down there was no curl.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed, but glad that I had only bought sample sizes.  </li>
            <li> I however literally use 3 half dollar (</li>
            <li> the coin) sized amounts on either half of my hair.</li>
            <li> Before using the buttercream my daughters hair would end up dry &amp; hard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man and bought this product because I have natural DRY hair that was in desperate need of moisture.  </li>
            <li> I wish I didn&#x27;t because it&#x27;s expensive and not all natural.  </li>
            <li> This is not a product you should use everyday, please understand that.</li>
            <li> Baby buttercreme also made my scalp itch like no one&#x27;s business after a few days.</li>
            <li> I used just a very little on my hair and they got all tangle, messy, heavy, dull, and dried out!</li>
            <li> This product is not for every texture of hair, so unfortunately you can only make that determination after you buy it and use.  </li>
            <li> Bc later, I hated the other scent present.  </li>
            <li> I tried it again on a wet twistout because it&#x27;s so dang expensive</li>
            <li> I thought it would work on my thick, curly hair</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t go two days as it will get thick and unmanageable like an SOS pad.  </li>
            <li> Uh you mean to tell me I just paid $30.00 for some Vaseline</li>
            <li> Believe me, I have tried a ton of less expensive alternatives and none come close.</li>
            <li> From my experience living here in NYC you will have a hard time beating Amazon price !</li>
            <li> I also smelled like ointment, not pleasant.  </li>
            <li> This statement applies to all Buttercremes, I learned the hard way by buying these expensive products.  </li>
            <li> YOU&#x27;LL BE SORRY.</li>
            <li> Because Miss Jessie&#x27;s is expensive, I will limit myself to buying this and the Sweetback conditioner.</li>
            <li> I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive</li>
            <li> I noticed that the other rewiew mentioned that her hair was itchy after some days and had terrible build up.  </li>
            <li> The Curly Meringue does, but both make my scalp ITCH like crazy.  </li>
            <li> The scent began to get annoying after a while, as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s overpriced and contains alcohol, which is horrible for curly hair because it is prone to breakage to begin with.  </li>
            <li> I am disgusted, lesson learned...always read the ingredients before you leave the store.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Been waiting to get this and I love it</li>
            <li> MJ recommends using this for dry twistouts, but for my type 4 hair, that was a BIG NO. It smelled good, but it was so greasy and it made my ends crunchy. I tried it again on a wet twistout because it&#x27;s so dang expensive and I wanted to like it. It did moisturize my hair. My curls looked good, but I get shrinkage when I style damp hair, so I was a little disappointed. My recommendation is to try SheaMoisture products instead. I feel like MJ uses their founders&#x27; big, curly hair to sell a dream to naturals who want their hair to be something it&#x27;s really not. If you have type 4 hair, you&#x27;re not going to look like Tracee Ellis Ross after you use this stuff, or anything from their line. Your kinks will still be kinks, although possibly more moisturized and manageable. Their products are probably really inexpensive to make, and they charge all that money for their creative marketing. Save your dough and do research on cheaper, ORGANIC products that do what they claim.</li>
            <li> I bought this and other products from the Miss Jessies&#x27; site.  I thought it would work on my thick, curly hair but it turned out to be a dissapointment.  It&#x27;s overpriced and contains alcohol, which is horrible for curly hair because it is prone to breakage to begin with.  It greasy and drying at the same time.  I&#x27;ve had better luck with less expensive hair products with similar ingredients. I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased their hair products if the site had posted the ingredients to begin with.  Never again.</li>
            <li> I tried most of Miss Jessie&#x27;s products because of the big hype about them.  You all need to know:  If you truly care about your natural hair and want it to be its healthiest, DO NOT use any products contaning petroletum or mineral oil!  I noticed that the other rewiew mentioned that her hair was itchy after some days and had terrible build up.  This is what petroletum and mineral oil does and these two things are in mostly ALL of miss jessie&#x27;s products.  They also made my hair very greasy.  I was very disappointed, but glad that I had only bought sample sizes.  Mineral oil and petroletum dry your hair, hinder growth, and do not allow moisture, which is what all black hair needs most.  I dont know what the makers of miss jessies product were thinking about putting the absolute WORSE possible ingriediants in their products.  Love your natural hair and give it the best! We&#x27;ve had the worse for long enough.  Trust me I have done the research and if you dont believe me, please look up petroletum and mineral oil for yourself and see the damaging things that they do to hair.  DONT BUY IT...YOU&#x27;LL BE SORRY.</li>
            <li> This product is not for every texture of hair, so unfortunately you can only make that determination after you buy it and use.  Youtube cant help you with that. This statement applies to all Buttercremes, I learned the hard way by buying these expensive products.  Some are flaky, some leave residue, some are sticky, some must be used with water daily.  Just wanted to let you know don&#x27;t believe the hype. Purchase small to try out first, but there are a gazillion products out there, you may just want to try a make your own mix knowing what works for you.  Blessings.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 1 year now, and just ordered the 16oz jar during Ms. Jessie&#x27;s bogo sale. As mentioned in the title, this product goes a long way, and works better if you do not glob a handful in your hair (unless your hair is down your back). Even though my hair is long, I just now (after one whole year) emptied my 8oz jar of this product. It smells great (vanilla bean and cookies)and I have not gotten any complaints on the scent. I generally use it for twist- or braid-outs and sometimes simply as a moisturizer. If you use too much you will get residue..just like with any other product. With Ms. Jessie&#x27;s products a little will go a long way. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the price. Even though it is a great product, it is way too pricey, and the only time I buy their products is during their buy one get one free (of equal or lesser value) deal during the month of December.</li>
            <li> It may be user error because I am new to going natural. I purchased this to do a two strand twist out, but once I took my hair down there was no curl. I did use in conjunction with Curly Pudding</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use this product! It&#x27;s a mix between glue and grease! I used just a very little on my hair and they got all tangle, messy, heavy, dull, and dried out! A real disaster! I ended up with many knots in my hair and lost big lumps of hair trying to untangled it! Took 3 shampoos to get it out.  Since I liked the smell, I looked at the ingredients and figured it might be good as a body cream. I put a little on one of my leg, well a few hours later my leg was blue because this product took the stain out of my very old blue socks !!!  Beware!</li>
            <li> I love this product for making my dry hair look a bit better. However, when you use products like this do it sparingly. The ingredients within the product are not natural. Some of the ingredients are common allergens and they are potentially toxic. It is best to research and read some of the clinical studies. If you find yourself scratching your head after using certain products like this, reconsider what products you&#x27;re using on your hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man and bought this product because I have natural DRY hair that was in desperate need of moisture.  Anywho, this product works but I have to wet my hair every day and reapply.  I can&#x27;t go two days as it will get thick and unmanageable like an SOS pad.  even wearing a cap at night).  So I bought this and the Curly Meringue.  The buttercreme by itself doesn&#x27;t give the shine I like.  The Curly Meringue does, but both make my scalp ITCH like crazy.  Plus my hair feels sticky.  No one can touch my hear with this stuff without washing it after.  Not smooth and healthy, like the Kinky Curly line.  I&#x27;ve been using both Miss Jessie&#x27;s for two weeks now.  And once I exhaust I will not restock.</li>
            <li> I prefer it to curly buttercreme because it&#x27;s not as greasy yet it&#x27;s equally effective. And a little goes a long way. I find the scent a bit too pronounced but it fades fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> Baby Buttercreme is fantastic. In our house, we have four different hair textures. My husband has slightly coarse, wavy hair, my eldest son has loose soft curls, I have soft and tightly coily hair, and my baby has very tightly coiled and coarse hair. Baby Buttercreme is an effective moisturizer for all of us. Believe me, I have tried a ton of less expensive alternatives and none come close.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find something cheaper and all natural with no luck.  Nothing gives me definition, shine and MOISTURE like this product.  I&#x27;ve used cheaper products that have provided great definition, but lack in providing moisture.  After I use this product, I can feel the moisture in it for 3-4 days without applying anything else. Nothing else required when I retwist at night.  I love this product!!!  I wish I didn&#x27;t because it&#x27;s expensive and not all natural.  I only buy at the once yearly BOGO sale, as paying full price hurts my heart.</li>
            <li> This smells really good, but has a waxy build feel and build up to it. I will not use it again.</li>
            <li> This product is great for defineing your curls, but it can easily cause build up on your hair if you keep on applying it daily . I only use this once to twist out my hair and I use a different moisturizer to keep it soft throughout the week. This is not a product you should use everyday, please understand that. I love how my curls stick out my 4a, 4b hair when I use this creame.</li>
            <li> Smells great, a little goes a long way and great for natural dry hair. Best if put on while wet for twist or braid outs!</li>
            <li> My hair loves Ms Jessie&#x27;s Butter Cream.</li>
            <li> I started using this product on my 1 year old, and it is amazing. It makes the process much easier and it smells great. I love it!</li>
            <li> This has a strong scent considering it&#x27;s for kids. Also left her hair a little crunchy. Not as great as I hoped for. I&#x27;ll keep experimenting.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since 2009 to do twist outs on my 4b/4c natural hair. I will not trade it for anything. Love the smell &amp; the way my hair look &amp; feel after using it.</li>
            <li> works excellent on my 4c hair, i recently added some grapeseed oil to it mixed it up well &amp; i love it even more!!! will keep this as a staple!!!👍👍👍</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for styling my (dry) hair in double strand twists. Baby butercream has a very good scent. IIRC, the scent was something like vanilla and cotton candy. The thing I didn&#x27;t like about this product was the level of build up it created. I had to use a shampoo with SLS to remove all of the product. Baby buttercreme also made my scalp itch like no one&#x27;s business after a few days. The things I liked about it was the incredible shine this product gave my  hair as well as how soft it made  my hair feel. I think it&#x27;s best to buy the sample size of this product before investing in a larger size. We are in a recession and it&#x27;s best to not waste money on an expensive  product that you may not like :)&lt;br /&gt;FYI- I have 4A hair texture.</li>
            <li> I have used this particular product for a little close to a year now as a 2 to possibly 3 time per week moisturizer.  I would agree with the members who stated that they do not or would not use this as a DAILY moisturizer, because it is a bit heavy &amp; thick for THAT particular type of \\&quot;regular\\&quot; usage, UNLESS your specific type of hair texture gets DUMB DRY on a consistently daily basis.  When I use the butter creme in my natural \\&quot;black/afro\\&quot; hair to assist with defining \\&quot;MY\\&quot; particular natural black hair texture/curl pattern when I&#x27;m putting my hair in 2 strand twists before going to sleep.  I do not have to use a high amount of this product, even if I&#x27;m twisting my hair for the first time from after washing/deep conditioning my hair.  I&#x27;ve been \\&quot;NATURAL\\&quot; my WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE without ever of ANY KIND for ANY REASON placed ANY type of chemicals in my hair to permanently or \\&quot;temporary\\&quot; change my NATURAL \\&quot;black\\&quot; hair color and/or texture for the full and entire 28 years I&#x27;ve been alive on this Earth...(Yes, black women with their TRUE VIRGIN hair do exist out there in the real world!...us or well, \\&quot;ME\\&quot;, being the last of the Mohicans! LOL!) So I&#x27;ve been through &amp; tried &amp; experimented with MANY MANY \\&quot;black\\&quot; hair care products &amp; now most recently \\&quot;NATURAL BLACK HAIR\\&quot; care products in my day...&amp; \\&quot;MY\\&quot; particular hair texture is a 4a some days a 4c others. So what i would tell anyone considering purchasing this just go for it! Good Luck!</li>
            <li> I have been natural for over a year and am a recovering \\&quot;product junkie\\&quot;.  You have to try a lot of different things to see what works.  Baby Buttercreme is the BEST!  Well worth the splurge. Because Miss Jessie&#x27;s is expensive, I will limit myself to buying this and the Sweetback conditioner. Now for styling, I find that it is wiser to use cheaper products.  My hair likes this product because it is moisturizing. I have found that this works as my sealant.  I use a lighter conditioner for moisture.  And I LOVE the fragrance of this product! And my hair likes petroleum and mineral oil.  Plus this jar lasts me three to four months. If you use it according to the directions, you only need to use about a tablespoon.  Since my hair is short, I use a teaspoon sized amount.  If I use too much, it will flake. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Miss Jessie&#x27;s products.  The products are very good but a little too expensive.  A good product.if you don&#x27;t mind paying the price..</li>
            <li> Completely ruined my flat twist out. Will not be buying again and I shouldn&#x27;t have listened to all the hype and bought this. Never again in fact I&#x27;m going to give away this that I have left.</li>
            <li> I love this product for it&#x27;s shine, and smell and softness of my curls. But it does leave a greasy spot on your pillow if you hair is not covered well.</li>
            <li> The product does moisturize my hair, but I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li> This product really does leave my hair soft and prevents dryness.  I use it daily so it&#x27;s bit pricy, but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Best product for kinky hair. My baby girls hair is so curly that it would tangle and look dry. Now her curls stay curled and no more fly always!!!!! Worth every dime and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I like miss Jessie&#x27;s products for my daughters hair as well as mine. They smell good, however they are really over priced. You can go through an 8 oz jar in 10 days if used frequently. Example, my daughter has fantastic curly hair and washes a lot because of chlorine. She needs to moisturize a lot.</li>
            <li> Love this hair cream. I use it on my daughter and it keeps her hair curly and moisturized</li>
            <li> This is greasy, thick, and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair soft.  It just defines curls.  It smells GREEAT! I can&#x27;t lie about that, and that&#x27;s the only reason why I would buy it again.  It&#x27;s worth the perfume.  I use it rarely just to give me a smell.  This product was so beefed up after I heard so much about it but it&#x27;s not a moisturizer.  certainly not a daily moisturizers.  Wanna do twists to get curls in the morning? buy this. wanna get a jell-like obedience to your hair? buy this.  wanna smell GREAT? buy this!</li>
            <li> Noticed a huge difference in my daughters hair with just a couple uses. Works great as a detangler also. Great product</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any significant curl definition with this product. I applied it after I washed and conditioned, but it sat on top of my hair as if it was an uncut oil (my hair hates oils). The scent began to get annoying after a while, as well. I still had to apply gel and everything else to get my hair to \\&quot;behave\\&quot;. Was not impressed with this product, and I am glad I only got a sample size.</li>
            <li> Makes hair become soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> nice curly and shining, cost a more on line</li>
            <li> A little on the expensive side but worth every penny. Kept my kids here hair moist but not oily and smells amazing. Everyone noticed the change in their hair and went out and got it also.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful product for almost any hair type</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!! Great Moisture for the hair Perfect for people that are transitioning will keep your hair from breaking off plus it leaves your hair feeling very soft  so the name speaks for itself &amp;#34;Baby Buttercreme&amp;#34; if you are natural or transitioning this is the prefect product for very healthy hair with great shine and soft to the touch . From my experience living here in NYC you will have a hard time beating Amazon price !</li>
            <li> This product ruined the wood on my dressing table.  Imagine what it is doing to your hair.....  I decided to use this product on my hair when I made the big chop. Big mistake. Some of the buttercream remained on the side of the jar when I placed the jar on my table.  When I moved the jar in the morning, imagine my surprise when I saw the ring on my table.  The coating on my table was gone.  Would never endorse a product that does this type of damage.</li>
            <li> This product did not live up to it&#x27;s description at all.  My hair looks like a grease ball, and it has always been dry.  It did nothing to \\&quot;spring up\\&quot; the curls, all it did was make them look greasy, yet dry at the same time, and curls were actually decreased.  I also smelled like ointment, not pleasant.  After reading the ingredients, this product contains the TOP unhealthy beauty ingredients to stay away from such as petrolatum and mineral oil.  At the price of $32 plus tax, I&#x27;m returning it pronto.</li>
            <li> PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE read the ingredients before purchasing. If you&#x27;re okay with those products then this might be a good purchase for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first saw this product being used in my niece&#x27;s hair. I really really liked the effect it had so I bought the product. I didn&#x27;t do as much research as I normally would b/c I saw the product in action for myself.&lt;br /&gt;I personally like the product even though now I know some of the ingredients can be harmful to hair. I however literally use 3 half dollar (the coin) sized amounts on either half of my hair. I will keep an eye on the progress of my hair but so far so good. I would say use essential oils like pure Castor, Coconut, Jojoba, sweet Almond, Olive or any other of your choosing to ensure your hair has all the moisture it needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has a pleasant scent but its a bit strong for me; the Smell lingers for days. Like I said its not a bad scent just a bit strong for me personally.</li>
            <li> Best buttercreme on the market.  Great price!</li>
            <li> I love it its the best looking forward to buy more when its done. Once again I so love it.</li>
            <li> Not only does this product smells good, but it also keeps my sons hair luxuriously soft and full.</li>
            <li> Great product it detangles my baby hair and keeps it manageable.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is it smells kinda strong. I&#x27;ll be recommending this to all my friends.</li>
            <li> Very nice there was no problem at all.</li>
            <li> Agh, it&#x27;s not all that as I thought , won&#x27;t be buying this again. Bought it cause I saw allot of ppl on YouTube with my hair texture (4c hair) using it for twistouts. It didn&#x27;t work for my hair. I didn&#x27;t get no curl definition. The only thing it was good for was for my edges, and don&#x27;t apply it directly to your scalp, it will itch. So, if I was to buy it again. It will only be to lay my edges that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> I really wish I looked twice at the ingredients in this product before buying it...&lt;br /&gt;It has \\&quot;Petrolatum, Mineral Oil, and Acetylated Lanolin. Everyone knows these three are NOT GOOD for your hair since they are VERY DRYING &amp; leave your hair feeling GREASY. And thats exactly what this product did to my hair. So, I don&#x27;t understand how this product can claim to be \\&quot;moisturizing\\&quot; &amp; \\&quot;hydrating\\&quot; when it does the very opposite with its cheap ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like the smell of cocoa butter, you&#x27;d love this product&#x27;s aroma. I personally like the smell of cocoa butter, just not on my hair. meh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For being priced at nearly $40 for only 8 ounces...with really CRAPPY results, only a fool would waste their money on it. They are making a whopping profit out of these products bc people continue to buy into Miss Jessie&#x27;s ploys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend Shea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie if you&#x27;re looking for REAL hydration and GOOD/Natural Ingredients. Guess what? It&#x27;s only $12-13 at your local beauty supply store for 12 ounces. Do the math and be economically smart, ladies!</li>
            <li> Great product. Use it on my daughters mixed curls. Best product I have found to keep hair moist and shareable.</li>
            <li> This product works great on my 6 month old daughters hair. Before using the buttercream my daughters hair would end up dry &amp; hard. The buttercream keeps it moisturized &amp; curly. I enjoy the smell because it doesn&#x27;t smell too strong like other products we tried. I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive or I could find it on sale! But it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Ok product but a ridiculous price.  There are lots of great products out there that can help your hair at a much better price.</li>
            <li> My item arrived in the time frame provided. The product itself I love and would recommend for natural hair. I use curly creme and the buttercreme together. This price was much reasonable than the store prices. Will purchase only this way.</li>
            <li> I bought this just for the sake of saying I&#x27;ve tried it but then ended up really liking the smell and the moisture it adds to my hair. What kept it from being a 5 star product is that it does not really make detangling MY hair easier. I have to put another leave-in with slip before using it. But I would probably purchase this again</li>
            <li> I went to the store looking for a moisturizer for my dry hair. I thought that the baby buttercreme smelled great and with all the talk about that line of products it must be great...NOT!!! I put it on my hair and it immediately felt greasy and sticky so I looked at the ingredients and the second one is petroleum...Uh you mean to tell me I just paid $30.00 for some Vaseline I can get at the dollar store. I am disgusted, lesson learned...always read the ingredients before you leave the store. Please try something else this product is a rip off!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product my hair stayed moist for days and it smells heavenly. Two thums up for miss Jessie&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!!! I only gave it a 4 because it has petroleum in it. It smells great. It keeps my one year old hair shiny almost all day! &amp; the price is amazing! This was $32 bucks in walmart!</li>
            <li> Adds softness and managability without&lt;br /&gt;Stickiness or greasiness.  Good for soft finger curls on  natural  hair</li>
            <li> I thought I loved the scent.  I tried a sample before.  I got it and I don&#x27;t think I actually like the smell.  I must have used too much.  Bc later, I hated the other scent present.  I like the baby powder smell but the other top note made me feel some type of way.  Not quite a headache or nauseous.</li>
