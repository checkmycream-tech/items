            <li>works great and priced good too.</li>
            <li>They work remarkable well</li>
            <li>The tip pressure is perfect, so you will never have to grab a hair more than once.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great at digging hairs out from underneath skin, but not so good at grasping hairs once they have emerged.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for the perfect tweezers for many years, and now I have found it.</li>
            <li>Normally I love the tweezer man brand, all my best tweezers are from hem.</li>
            <li>I have used many tweezers in m time and these are the best I have encountered.  </li>
            <li>The tweezers are perfect for getting splinters out, which was our primary goal!  </li>
            <li>Great price for a really good pair of tweezers.</li>
            <li>this product is very true to it claim been the best.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with my Tweezerman tweezers, and I hope they make every splinter encounter as easy as this one was.  </li>
            <li>This is a great concept and works most of the times!</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are specifically wonderful if you need to coax out ingrown hairs or remove fine splinters.</li>
            <li>I bought a pair of these in store &amp; loved them - then dropped them and blunted the tip.</li>
            <li>All in all these are a good buy</li>
            <li>Good for extracting the hair under the skin, but the needle tips end up snapping the hair when you try to tweeze it out    </li>
            <li>When I tried to use this pair, the hair either broke, or I could not get a good grip.  </li>
            <li>These are over priced, they don&#x27;t work good.</li>
            <li>Good quality.  </li>
            <li>Good quality</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t know these would be so good.</li>
            <li>At a lower price point these would be something good to stock up on and throw away when the tips got bent.  </li>
            <li>This one is not as good.</li>
            <li>In addition, their customer service is uniquely good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for detail work, I guess.  </li>
            <li>I have one word for people who think Tweezerman is a good product.</li>
            <li>good product.</li>
            <li>this product is good.  </li>
            <li>but they are good for ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>The materials used seem to be of good quality.</li>
            <li>After that experience I realized the importance of having good tweezers on hand.</li>
            <li>Good quality</li>
            <li>Good quality product that does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and at a good price.</li>
            <li>Tweezerman makes a good product that stand up over time.</li>
            <li>works fairly well.</li>
            <li>It does the job so perfectly and you will not need another tool to clean up your in grown hairs.</li>
            <li>These tweezers are great - very precise.  </li>
            <li>so they aren&#x27;t really great splinter type tweezers any more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is another great product from tweezerman, and I love the quality/feel of the tweezers, however we just don&#x27;t seem to find them applicable in our case.  </li>
            <li>Tweezerman is a great company that I totally love and trust!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love them and am happy I purchased them.</li>
            <li>Well, great product, love it.</li>
            <li>, he is very pleased.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been VERY pleased with these tweezers.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for eyebrows and it is able to get almost every hair.</li>
            <li>For splinters they are the best out there and well worth the money.</li>
            <li>A bit pricey - but - beautifully made, easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good thing they are brightly colored, otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t be able to see one of my co-workers sneaking off with them.</li>
            <li>Love these tweezers!  </li>
            <li>When paired with my 15x magnification mirror there is not a stray eyebrow that is safe from being plucked!</li>
            <li>oh man, i love these things!</li>
            <li>I LOVE these tweezers!  </li>
            <li>I was immediately impressed on my first try.</li>

            <li>I get so many stubborn hairs for my husband!</li>
            <li>I had to order another one which I&#x27;ll try to take better care of!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I made this purchase!</li>
            <li>I love this!  </li>

            <li>They work great for splinters or really fine work on removing ingrown hairs, etc.  </li>
            <li>This tweezer works amazing for ingrown hairs</li>
            <li>Also, the price is amazing.</li>
            <li>Great,  accurate tweezing of those stubborn ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>Its amazing the difference</li>
            <li>And 9 bucks is a great price for something so indispensable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing at the hairs it removes that have not pierced the skin as of yet.  </li>
            <li>This Tweezers are amazing, hey just go ahead and buy it.</li>
            <li>and it is available for a great price here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>have been so impressed with how sturdy these tweezers are after using them for over a year, and how accurate and precise they were designed to be.  </li>
            <li>These are amazing.  </li>
            <li>but they ruin them with their own package.</li>
            <li>The idea was nice but the execution did not come through for me.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice if they&#x27;d integrate a place to store that tip guard into the design of the tweezers.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice to know that the option is there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and is handy to have</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s kind of a catch 22 of sorts.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are absolutely the best tweezers ever fashioned by man.</li>
            <li>Really nice firs-aid tool.</li>
            <li>Tweezerman makes nice products.  </li>
            <li>If these were twice the price I would still own them.  </li>
            <li>The Tweezerman stainless steel ingrown hair splintertweeze is an excellent product for dealing with ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>well i have a nice set of beginner chop sticks ...</li>

            <li>As far as I&#x27;m concerned, these are the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used for ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>To be totally honest, I decided on a more preventative approach than cure.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best tweezer I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li>I am sure that somebody who is used to drugstore tweezers would probably find these a nice upgrade, but if you&#x27;re used to Tweezerman quality, beware.  </li>
            <li>These are by far the best tweezers I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>These are absolutely great tweezers, well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>These are quality tweezers suitable for both cosmetic endeavors and miniature hobby projects.</li>
            <li>Why aren&#x27;t tweezers like these more popular???</li>
            <li>Would have liked another color, but its ok</li>
            <li>This is really great if you need to \\&quot;dig\\&quot; those troublesome ingrown hairs that are stuck right under the surface.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In terms of performance, they&#x27;re great tweezers right out of the box.</li>
            <li>This is really great if you need to &amp;#34;dig&amp;#34; those troublesome ingrown hairs that are stuck right under the surface.</li>
            <li>It was so easy!</li>
            <li>I need a tweezer that pulls very fine hairs.</li>
            <li>I bought these in 2010 and they&#x27;re still going strong!</li>
            <li>It really doesnt get the hair all that good!</li>
            <li>This is by far the most impressive ingrown hair tweezer that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;What makes these tweezers so great is that they have a sharp tip that is very good at holding on to whatever it grabs.  </li>
            <li>I use these for general tweezer needs and find them to be excellent.</li>
            <li>Very precise for getting those stubborn hairs,</li>
            <li>They have a very precise tip and it grabs anything.  </li>
            <li>They are very precise.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for anybody who needs a good pair of tweezers!</li>
            <li>I thought for sure it was a fluke and ordered another pair through Amazon -</li>
            <li>Going to order me some more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure, just not for us.</li>
            <li>They are also more compact and come in a protective case that will keep the tips from getting bent.</li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>If you have amazon prime you can get free shipping and save yourself the gas it would have taken to drive to the store, win-win!</li>
            <li>Secondly, I dropped the tweezers, and after that the precision tips did not meet perfectly, so I had to jimmy</li>
            <li>You just need to make sure you sterilize them before</li>
            <li>These are definitely the best ones out there.  </li>
            <li>The points of these STILL match perfectly even after several accidental drops into the sink.</li>
            <li>meaning I have to use these to get the hair, and then another, duller pair to remove it :)</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I am going to be getting more of this product...</li>
            <li>A great item at a fair price - definitely recommended.</li>
            <li>Use them on ingrowns on my beard and so much more.</li>
            <li>for product that satisfied me.</li>
            <li>the more I seem to be getting them.</li>
            <li>/I am so glad I bought 3 pair, for home, for travel, and I gave one to my mother as a suprise (she likes hers too)</li>
            <li>But they sure do the trick of extracting all kinds of thorns and splinters out of my hands.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not always able to pop them with my fingers or it would hurt to do it with my fingers.  </li>
            <li>I was able to grasp and pull with precision.</li>
            <li>Use them all the time, one my favorite hygiene tools.</li>
            <li>I agree with others that these may not be the best for actually plucking hairs from the root</li>
            <li>Now I can continue waxing without too many bumps after.  </li>
            <li>* brand which is more money.  </li>
            <li>and I thought these would be even better.  </li>
            <li>Had a cyst on the bottom of my top eyelid for coupla years.  </li>
            <li>Was able to grasp and penetrate the cyst resulting in puss removal.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the third pair and they pull wonderfully.</li>
            <li>(I give them four more weeks), I will send the three off as a set.  </li>
            <li>This is a quality product, better than any \\&quot;Wal-Mart\\&quot; tool ever thought of being.</li>
            <li>I use this all the time, more than I thought I would.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with it personally.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to dig hairs out, grab them, and pull them out without causing a lot of damage.</li>
            <li>The vast majority of the time it works flawlessly.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend is able to remove splinters with no effort.</li>
            <li>i love this tweezer.</li>
            <li>I love this tweezer.  </li>
            <li>These are the pointiest tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used and as such the best.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love these tweezers</li>
            <li>, i surely would not let my kids get ahold of these.</li>
            <li>(For comparison, I have better luck</li>
            <li>/&gt;We are so pleased that we have these in the house now.</li>
            <li>Its not like I throw them around or step on them:-)</li>
            <li>One of the points is going to become slightly more bent than the other.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are my favorite tweezers.</li>
            <li>i love this brand but don&#x27;t like this version at all.</li>
            <li>I love these tweezers.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much I love these.  </li>
            <li>so I have tried many things over the years.</li>
            <li>Why would I want to do that if I love it???</li>
            <li>It has become more of a craft pair of tweezers for me.  </li>
            <li>WAY better than fishing around in a kids finger with a needle.  </li>
            <li>Tips connect and hold a splinter way better than you&#x27;d think.</li>
            <li>Need I say more?</li>
            <li>Love these tweezers.</li>
            <li>For a woman appearance is everything, you will love this like I do.</li>
            <li>I have bought many pairs of tweezers in my life for my husband.</li>
            <li>I have gotten so many ingrown hairs with these.</li>
            <li>So make sure you don&#x27;t stab yourself, because you will.</li>
            <li>so so much more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a splinter in my hand for quite some time and haven&#x27;t been able to remove it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>But as bleary-eyed and sleep-fogged as he was, he was able to isolate the splinter and remove it without any struggle or pain on my part.  </li>
            <li>So glad I bought this thing I should have bought 2 just in case</li>
            <li>These tweezers are wonderful, I might never use a regular tweezer again.</li>
            <li>Tweezerman used to have a much better quality product.</li>
            <li>I count on brand names to be better, won&#x27;t buy this brand again.</li>
            <li>Tweezerman makes outstanding products.</li>
            <li>I have been using these tweezers for a number of years now, and continue to be pleased.</li>
            <li>Cut the mails of my two toddlers better than anything.</li>
            <li>Purchased 4 items, satisfied with every one.</li>
            <li>I thought these tweezers would work better</li>
            <li>:  be sure to retain the rubbery plastic end cap to slide overtop the tweezers when they are not in use.  </li>
            <li>These are my favorite needle nose tweezers ever.  </li>
            <li>So make sure you don&#x27;t stab yourself, because you will.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s was convenient to shop for a good pair of tweezers that would come right to my home with out running all over town looking.</li>
            <li>Best item I have bought in a long time.</li>
            <li>Also would make a good addition to any first aid kit.</li>
            <li>these work pretty good</li>
            <li>When I first got these they seemed to work fairly well</li>
            <li>Great finished product, as i find with most tweezerman, all their products so far are built well, and do what is required</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had super pointy tweezers before, but these are amazing.  </li>
            <li>It is the perfect tool, every single time.</li>
            <li>As with many fine tools, there is a trade-off.  </li>
            <li>These do an OK job, but not recommended for baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re better than all other brands, but not the best over all.    </li>
            <li>Like some of the other reviews, I , too have bought every tweezer in the drugstores trying to find the most perfect one that WORKS.</li>
            <li>It comes with good directions about safety and cleaniness and certainly does the job in getting under the skin.  </li>
            <li>Thats really the main reason i use them and let me stress how awesome these</li>
            <li>It was like having two sewing needles in perfect alignment and was able to easily extract the foreign invader of my finger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In the end, I think this is probably a great tool for an \\&quot;emergency\\&quot; in-grown hair or in the hands of a professional.  </li>
            <li>It took a learning curve to figure out that it&#x27;s best to try to grab the hair at an angle and not straight on.</li>
            <li>Incredible accuracy and can penetrate spots where deep ingrown hairs lie.</li>
            <li>The packaging material promises Tweezerman will gladly grind (re-sharpen) the tips for free --</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no longer available and this one is just OK.</li>
            <li>my cousin loved it so much, I had to get her one as well.</li>
            <li>Tweezers are good quality and work very well for intended use.</li>
            <li>had another set of ingrown hair/splinter tweezers from them that were practically razor sharp -- perfect for digging out recalcitrant hairs or splinters.</li>
            <li>these a perfect and sharp to get the in grown out.  </li>
            <li>The tips of these things are like SHARP needles, and they are perfect for \\&quot;isolating ingrown</li>
            <li>Color makes it easy to find in a drawer, sharp points make it perfect for digging out splinters.  </li>
            <li>Loved it - high quality, sharp, works excellently.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is not at all a problem, because the tips still easily get under the skin to get ingrown hairs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And they bend easily.</li>
            <li>The tips bend easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Ingrown hairs are easily plucked away.  </li>
            <li>It works so well for tweeting eyebrows but is also awesome for removing splinters, it&#x27;s so narrow and precise!</li>
            <li>Easy to remove ingrown hair.  </li>
            <li>The thing about the tips though is that since they are so slim they are easy to</li>
            <li>Easy to use and works well.</li>
            <li>Easily digs out ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>They do come with a plastic cover for the tip, however, this comes off easily and gets lost</li>
            <li>and then they&#x27;re easy to damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After repeat shavings, I get ingrown hairs on my face and these tweezers easily remove them.</li>
            <li>I like the precision of it even better than the straight or the slanted tweezer which I also own.</li>
            <li>I have had these tweezers for a couple of years and are still going strong.  </li>
            <li>strong stable pointed tweezers.  </li>
            <li>The tip is perfectly pointed and equally sharp, which is required for precise removal.</li>
            <li>These things are nice and sharp and work great.  </li>
            <li>Nice and sharp for digging and grabbing  ingrown hairs out with great precision...</li>
            <li>I skewered the tube the first time I tried to use it to cover the tips, so I need to find some kind of alternative sheath for travel.</li>
            <li>These Tweezerman tweezers are hands down the best tweezers I have ever used.</li>
            <li>They are hands down the best tweezers I have ever used or seen!</li>
            <li>These are very sharp tweezers and are great!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very sharp and the points meet perfectly.</li>
            <li>1 - the point of this tweezers are fine and slender...</li>
            <li>in fact at times they are TOO fine...</li>
            <li>So, I learned to adjust my grip and grab the hair using the wider part of the tweezer and it works out fine.</li>
            <li>Having the finest of fine hairs is to your disadvantage, but that would apply to any tweezer.   </li>
            <li>The tips of this product are so fine that I no longer need to jab at my neck with a pin.</li>
            <li>These are extremely fine pointed.  </li>
            <li>Again, for fine hairs, these tweezers cannot be beat.  </li>
            <li>Fine tip is laughfable.</li>
            <li>Anytime I need to grab something fine like a bead or brad</li>
            <li>I like to have both a fine tip and a slant tweezer, and between these two, I have everything I need.</li>
            <li>I wear contacs and I will get these extremely fine eyelashes that grow under my eyelash line and poke/irritate my eyes.  </li>
            <li>It requires precision but it will pull out ingrown hair, the grip is strong and feels comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>The tips on the Tweezerman were not as fine and precise as desired.</li>
            <li>With a little practice, you will find that these work excellent.  </li>
            <li>They&#x3D; tweezers are immensely accurate.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the brand and product, especially after doing the math which drew to my attention</li>
            <li>Fortunately, unlike the 1 and 2 star reviewers, I&#x27;m not cursed with scab-covered ingrown hairs all over my body.</li>
            <li>remember, tweezerman sharpens your tools for free (all you have to pay for is shipping).</li>
            <li>these tweezers are great to lift ingrown facial hair buried in the skin, because of their \\&quot;needle-like\\&quot; tips.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great for probing under the skin for hairs that have turned back into the follicle and started growing under the skin.</li>
            <li>The free, lifetime sharpening is a plus, too.</li>
            <li>These things are as precise as surgical instrument.  </li>
            <li>The tips are so precise...</li>
            <li>Fortunately, TWEEZERMAN&#x27;s warranty will replace or fix them &amp;#34;free&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ll sharpen your tweezers for free and even pay for return postage; you just have to pay the postage to Texas.</li>
            <li>Come to think of it, anyone who has to tweeze stuff in a lab -- to look at it under a microscope or with a loupe -- or anything else requiring the ability to pick up a precise object at a precise point, these would probably outperform the overpriced lab junk for sale so often from scientific supply stores.</li>
            <li>Since they are so precise, you have to be as well.</li>
            <li>If these don&#x27;t work great for you, it will very likely be the operator, not the product.</li>
            <li>It has a comfortable grip to it, which is also important do to my authritis in my hands</li>
            <li>They are easy to clean</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>must say the quality out of the box was fantastic.</li>
            <li>The second pair was great.  </li>
            <li>Also, great at picking up tiny iPhone screws or anything at all</li>
            <li>Upon pressure it might leave a tiny dot mark on the skin, I am happy with this purchase</li>
            <li>Also tweezerman will sharpen these tweezers for free if they should ever need it</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s great for individual hairs and edging</li>
            <li>Look well made, precise tweezer tips.</li>
            <li>works really well in pulling ingrown hairs, just again be careful you dont want to poke yourself, it takes time getting used to how to be able to use it, but then again practice makes perfect.</li>
            <li>/&gt;they say you can send it in for free to be resharpened but</li>
            <li>and they work great for such a project.</li>
            <li>Indispensable.</li>
            <li>This is a nicely made product and works really well.</li>
            <li>but I did just find that this brand will repair and resharpen them for free</li>
            <li>So far so good,</li>
            <li>They work best to work out the hair you&#x27;re after, although sometimes I need to bust out my heavy-duty TM tweezers to actually get the whole hair out.</li>
            <li>Good spring action and holding up well.</li>
            <li>Perfect for splinters, of course, but also useful for removing stitches and wowing fellow construction workers when I pull them out of my center console.  </li>
            <li>Grabbing a hair with these is an exercise in futility which succeeds only after many attempts to snare what it is that for which you&#x27;re looking to grab.  </li>
            <li>the sharp pointed tip make them very good for the job</li>
            <li>I love how pointed and sharp these tweezers and it makes them great for ingrown hair.  </li>
            <li>No other tool in the house was effective, but once I got these, I was able to fix the necklace</li>
            <li>Amazing quality for the price,very useful in my practice,delivered on time and looks exactly as the picture</li>
            <li>These remove ingrown hairs quickly and easily with no discomfort.</li>
            <li>It really does a good job when it&#x27;s time to get really thorough in your grooming and need to pick at really fine hairs...</li>
            <li>They no longer \\&quot;tweeze\\&quot; like they did originally, but still work for loosening ingrown hairs</li>
            <li>the are able to get exactly what I want.</li>
            <li>Best tweezers for small problems.  </li>
            <li>I ordered these tweezers to help me remove splinters and small metal shavings and they work perfectly</li>
            <li>Was excited to get these, seem to work well.  </li>
            <li>Precision implement, superbly does things have wished for in the past..  in grown hair, splinters.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I plucked and plucked and everything came out cleanly until the day they didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>First, I am so impressed by these tweezers and their ability to pull hair close to the skin - hair so short that I have to be using a 15x magnification mirror to really know they are there.  </li>
            <li>I really was hoping for something very precise.  </li>
            <li>The sharp stainless steel tips are perfect for ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>these are the right tool for the job !</li>
            <li>wife liked these tweezers so much, we ended up buying a second set for our medicine cabinet (as nothing works better for removing splinters than these Tweezerman tweezers!).  </li>
            <li>Who can&#x27;t find a pair of bright yellow tweezers in a cluttered cabinet or drawer!  </li>
            <li>They might be really good at removing larger things like splinters, but I haven&#x27;t had to try that yet.</li>
            <li>They come with a protective cover for the end, which is good to prevent accidental impalement, especially if you put them in a pocket.  </li>
            <li>the concept is extremely cool</li>
            <li>Were good for the short time they lasted.</li>
            <li>Overall, I find that if you are patient, it does almost as good a job as waxing.</li>
            <li>These are true to description.  </li>
            <li>took off one star for the fact that it is ONLY good for ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>Its really only good for getting out splinters</li>
            <li>always a good thing to keep in the cabinet as inevitably you&#x27;ll need it</li>
            <li>Have never owned such a good pair of tweezers before and have bought plenty in cosmetic departments over the years.</li>
            <li>Thank you for such a good product.</li>
            <li>Really good for removing ingrown facial hairs.</li>
            <li>very good at getting those stubborn ingrown hairs...very sharp and pointedly gets right to the cord of the hairs...would highly recommend this product.!!!</li>
            <li>And I really mean the best.  </li>
            <li>The first is that the ends are easily damaged and warped.  </li>
            <li>The tips are so fine they draw down to nearly needles, but they have superb traction &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; even at that level.</li>
            <li>They are very comfortable to hold and use since they are nice and wide where you hold them.</li>
            <li>They really do a great job pulling hairs and even digging out foreign matter under the skin.</li>
            <li>Really sharp tips and great edge on the end.</li>
            <li>These are insanely sharp and great for removing ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product, but as soon as you get used to how sharp they are, you WILL stab yourself in the hand.</li>
            <li>See, they are great at getting just under the skin and working items out from under the skin so they are poking out of the skin far enough so they can then be grabbed using a tweezer made for easy grabbing and pulling.</li>
            <li>my experience with these tweezers, they are not designed for anyone with fine hair that is too fine, for removing splinters from plants that are so unusual as to be rare (lantana, cactus, etc.)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice to read about real people using products and giving real feedback.</li>
            <li>I loved my old stainless steel Tweezerman splinter remover.  </li>
            <li>These make quick painless work if it.</li>
            <li>I have larger hands than most females and I am able to hold and maneuver the tweezer to remove ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>The tips are super sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it was shipped quickly</li>
            <li>They are sharp and tend to grab well most of the time !!</li>
            <li>There are other Tweezerman products that are more effective</li>
            <li>they were pretty cheaply priced so i figured id try them out because i like the tweezerman brand</li>
            <li>Normally I have been satisfied with the others I have purchased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a professional but appreciate a good quality tool.  </li>
            <li>I was very excited about this product, and Tweezerman products came highly recommended to me.  </li>
            <li>fast delivery, good product, does the job, very helpful for those with sensitive skin, sturdy product, I do wish it had a light</li>
            <li>They work great, they are very very sharp and come with a rubber tip cover.</li>
            <li>could live without it for eyebrow purposes, its probably better for splinters etc...</li>
            <li>The steel tip is very brittle and will crack easily.</li>
            <li>It works very well for removing splinters and easily plucking fewer strands of hair from eyebrows.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve got an OCD streak about ingrown hairs, like me, this little guy will be your new best friend!</li>
            <li>The metal is very soft so the &#x27;Perfectly aligned tips&#x27;, a most critical feature, do not stay aligned for long.</li>
            <li>These tweezers indeed are very nice and sharp!</li>
            <li>The interior portion does not have any ridges but has been machined in such a way that it provides excellent grip when the hair is dry.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and super precise.</li>
            <li>These are actually less effective and cause more damage.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t use too much pressure then it will work perfectly fine on the tips.</li>
            <li>The tips are extremely fine, yet strong enough to lift out a splinter easily the first time.  </li>
            <li>Great for getting a little deeper for those ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>They take a little getting used to, but once you do, they&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>So I bought these yellow ones on Amazon, and they work fantastic, even better than the originals.  </li>
            <li>When first bought, this tool is so exact and precise.  </li>
            <li>I ended up using my old tweezers since they gripped much better.</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t grip worth spit.</li>
            <li>These tweezers cost 2-3x any store type, were worth every penny.</li>
            <li>but they are fully worth it</li>
            <li>so I was thrilled to find a tweezer made especially for this.  </li>
            <li>recently purchased a vinyl plotter so I can make my own vinyl decals.</li>
            <li>My 4 year old calls them the magic tweezers.</li>
            <li>Pricey for tweezers but worth it.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>The handle is coated, and appears to be non-slip- worth the price&#x27;</li>
            <li>These Tweezerman tweezers are worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love their other tweezers which I own, but these don&#x27;t really do what they&#x27;re supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>I had the original Tweezerman&#x27;s (which I paid TRIPLE the price for at a big box store), and they served me well for many years</li>
            <li>my  brothers really love this tweezer cannot stop talking about them to other guys I will be  ordering more.</li>
            <li>and I am sure I will love this product for a very long time...especially with the lifetime guarantee!!!</li>
            <li>You need a steady hand and good hand/eye coordination and for obvious reasons, don&#x27;t use these anywhere around your eyes.</li>
            <li>These are 100x better, very very sharp, and can be very very precise.  </li>
            <li>Pulls the splinter right out.</li>
            <li>It did not grab the hair but slid right off each time.</li>
            <li>If you need and want tweezers that get right to the point these are the ones.</li>
            <li>It looks like since the hair is right under the surface of your skin</li>
            <li>Yes, they are just right for grabbing or teasing out an in-grown hair from tender skin.  </li>
            <li>, right?  </li>
            <li>It looks like since the hair is right under the surface of your skin</li>
            <li>these tweezers are good for just about tweezing anything.........very precise and not much more</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re pretty much working with a precise surgical item here.</li>
            <li>Our experience with tweezers are that most hairs are too fine to be removed by most of the tweezers, and after time the tweezers become dull and useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: I&#x27;ve used these for several years and they are the absolute best for ingrown chin hairs (menopausal women know very well what I&#x27;m talking about) and essential for splinters.</li>
            <li>Was able to get out splinters that I wasn&#x27;t able to previously.</li>
            <li>I plan never to be without a pair within easy reach for the rest of my days, and I really don&#x27;t say that about much.</li>
            <li>Great product for getting ingrown hairs or small thorns out.</li>
            <li>This is great for small hairs, or ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>Not even having to apply huge pressure like I did with normal tweezers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure about the ingrown hair thing, but they are just great at anything you&#x27;d like stabbed or tweezed out of you..</li>
            <li>Great for small slivers or metal slivers.</li>
            <li>I accidentally dropped my pair on the tile floor in the bathroom, the points bent out of true straight and no longer worked.</li>
            <li>I own Revlon tweezers which I purchased long time ago from Target.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also yellow and easy to find!</li>
            <li>have no clue what to recommend to anyone with very fine hair on their face, especially excess eyebrow hair, looking for tweezers.</li>
            <li>This tool makes for very precise grooming; It gets right under each individual hair.</li>
            <li>The tweezers are wide and secure in my hand which allow more control in the process.</li>
            <li>It has a small mouth for this exact reason, not meant for plucking lots of hairs, use a thicker opener.&lt;br /&gt;tweezerman is a great brand and never dissapoints.  </li>
            <li>Worth every cent for these, and the price on here is much better than what I can find in local stores.</li>
            <li>When you&#x27;re looking under a microscope, it&#x27;s clear to see that most tweezers have a gap; they don&#x27;t really close all the way.  </li>
            <li>I have a few pair of these splinter tweezers for my occupation and they are simply the best out there.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy, and super pointy.  </li>
            <li>Great for ingrown hair and for any other epilation really, better than any other.</li>
            <li>That said the product manufacturer seems to offer a pretty good gaurentee: \\&quot;We replace Damaged/dropped tools for one half the purchase price, we repair bent tips for $5.00 per tool.  </li>
            <li>Super sharp and super accurate!</li>
            <li>The ends of the tweezers are very much NEEDLES, so you can&#x27;t grab anything with it.  </li>
            <li>Some people may find great use of these, but prefer the flat tipped/tapered tweezers after using these briefly</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t like these tweezers because the tips get bent easily and you can&#x27;t really bend them back to the original position.</li>
            <li>The week after these arrived I found my favorite tweezers, these work for what they say but the needle tip regular tweezermans work better overall for hairs, ingrown or not.</li>
            <li>Bought these for my first aid kit for splinters, etc...</li>
            <li>Some reviewers say they have difficulty pulling/grabbing hair with these tweezers, but I never have a problem - I think the trick is to hold the tweezers more parallel to your face and pull in the direction of hair growth.   </li>
            <li>but I would definitely advise buying more than one at a time</li>
            <li>These are reasonably price, and worth every penny of it.</li>
            <li>Very pointy!  </li>
            <li>the ONLY thing that could make them better is if they had a \\&quot;grippy\\&quot; section where you hold it........</li>
            <li>but I just need to be able to learn hold it and properly use it.</li>
            <li>Plus the company took more than a week in an off-season time to ship the tiny item.</li>
            <li>Just be warned that tweezing can become addictive because these make it somewhat enjoyable.</li>
            <li>I am a fervent gardener, and consequently have more than my share of tiny splinters lodged in my fingers.</li>
            <li>Overall, I simply love them and just need not to be so aggressive.</li>
            <li>What a wonderful set of tweezers You won&#x27;t go wrong with them.  </li>
            <li>Now I wouldn&#x27;t expect a glass to get dropped from counter height to the floor and survive, but considering the size/weight of these tweezers I kind of expected that they would have made it out unscathed.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ll have to use restraint next time :)</li>
            <li>I bought the listed product as a replacement for that first tweezer; you can read about my experience with that first tweezer below.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t check Amazon&#x27;s price first.</li>
            <li>the first pair I owned.</li>
            <li>I just used these for the first time and am amazed at how well they got out the ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>This is a simple but elegant tool.</li>
            <li>Exactly what you pay for.</li>
            <li>I admit I&#x27;m an avid picker.  </li>
            <li>Just have a look at the product shot, it&#x27;s exactly what you&#x27;d expect it to be.</li>
            <li>Way better than regular tweezers for removing wood splinters!  </li>
            <li>You can get exactly the spot that you want, to pull the tick out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried to use them and the first thing I muttered to myself</li>
            <li>would have given this a 5 out of 5 stars if this was build with a higher quality metal</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t come up with any cons, really..!</li>
            <li>These are super sharp with a very fine point.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Surgical forceps such as Dumont or Hamilton Bell #5 with Super Fine tips is the way to go to extracting ingrown hairs with needle precision.  </li>
            <li>I bought these for a first aid kit in case I ever need to removed splinters or stingers, should work well.</li>
            <li>The tip is certainly much larger than the Revlon Platinum Tweezer Slant Tip, which I have included in an image next to the Tweezerman - Ingrown Hair Splintertweeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am currently using these for crafting, which they are actually perfect for.  </li>
            <li>They are also great for small stickers or stamped images or pretty much anything else.  </li>
            <li>If there were a way to protect the tip better, I think they would last longer.</li>
            <li>These tweezers do exactly what they should.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned several slanted tip tweezerman tweezers, and I love every one of them.  </li>
            <li>Never thought I would truly understand how a pair of tweezers could be worth this much money</li>
            <li>Thanks Tweezerman!</li>
            <li>They are now kept in our First Aid kit and travel with us to the beach and park.  </li>
            <li>To prevent the problem in the first place, use an electric razor and accept a not-so-close shave.</li>
            <li>It should last for many years.  </li>
            <li>I have had for one year; I use them almost every day and they work like the first day</li>
            <li>Because of their thickness, it rips the skin around the hair which can cause scarring more so than a needle and regular tweezers.</li>
            <li>Somehow the tweezers work better, faster, and do not leave deep scars.</li>
            <li>I sure hope they last</li>
            <li>I guess if you know up front to be super careful with them you might do better than I did??</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s sooo much easier to isolate the right hair</li>
            <li>These fill a specific role very well, but are not as good at other tasks like easy grabbing and plucking.</li>
            <li>You need to grip hairs JUST right to prevent breakage, but it&#x27;s easy enough to learn.</li>
            <li>Nice sharp matching points.</li>
            <li>They are ridiculously precise and sharp to a point where you can easily hurt yourself.</li>
            <li>Using these is so much more delicate than any other way I&#x27;ve tried, and faster and more effective.  </li>
            <li>Also I bought myself a new lighted magnifying mirror which helped tremendously.</li>
            <li>The price on amazon is really good too - I have seen it at big box stores for between $17 to $22, and currently on amazon</li>
            <li>It really works to make them back to \\&quot;super\\&quot; grabbing! :)</li>
            <li>I was very pleased that these tweezers helped me deal with the issue even though I had little to go on.  </li>
            <li>Two features that are very beneficial for both backpacking and camping first aid kits.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty much unusable after that...</li>
            <li>pretty much leaves no hair unreachable.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean and sharp too.</li>
            <li>They are pretty much useless.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it can really dig in under the skin as needed, springy but not difficult to pinch shut.</li>
            <li>Good for small splinters or ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>I bought them to replace an old pair of Tweezerman splinter tweezers that had a true needle point.  </li>
            <li>My first concern prior to ordering was that these tweezers would not be strong enough to grasp the hairs because they are so fine.</li>
            <li>It seems like the pointy tips are just too sharp for me to use and is more like picking with a pin, rather than actually being able to hold the hair.  </li>
            <li>Nothing much to say other than great product if you have any type of facial hair needing to be removed (that&#x27;s all i use it for).</li>
            <li>bought this originally for eyebrows but a regular tweezer is be able to do the same job.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very sharp precise fine tipped tool.</li>
            <li>I use a slanted tip tweezerman tweezer to easily grab stuff once it&#x27;s poking out enough after using these; the process works well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also if I catch a hair that has just begun to grow back under my skin, these will easily lift those out before it becomes a problem.</li>
            <li>There doesn&#x27;t end up being enough surface area sometimes to easily grab what your trying to take out.</li>
            <li>This is great for getting at those dark hairs before its obvious to the world that &amp;#34; yes I am a girl</li>
            <li>A good tweezer but the sharpness didn&#x27;t last long so need to buy too often, will not buy this one again</li>
            <li>The set is a little more pricey, but well worth it if these are going in your first aid kit.</li>
            <li>Also way better than using a single needle.  </li>
            <li>You have to hold it at a certain angle to pull them out.</li>
            <li>I got this thinking it would help with plucking large, clump hair follicles that develop in my beard.  </li>
            <li>Certainly, they are for adults only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>certain you keep the clear-plastic tube that covers the tips in the packaging.  </li>
            <li>I have another pair of slant tip tweezers (also tweezerman) that I use for certain things (like I said, these are my favorites</li>
            <li>The tip is super sharp and skinny, will grab on to the splinter for easy removal.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve been durable and, except for all the splinter tweezers I&#x27;ve had, extremely well-aligned -- suitable not just for stray hairs but lab work too.</li>
            <li>Work brilliantly, you do have to be careful with them as they are very sharp though.</li>
            <li>I think this tool is perfect to dig down to your ingrown hair and try to bring it above your skin surface and then use another pair of tweezers to actually pull it.</li>
            <li>Handle has wide area that makes it very easy to hold steady.</li>
            <li>Tweezer has very fine pointed tip and is sharp, not to be used by children.  </li>
            <li>Incredibly fine point makes removing the smallest hair possible.</li>
            <li>However, there are problems with having tweezers with such fine tips.  </li>
            <li>This is my first tweezerman tweezer, and it is a lot better than any other tweezer I have owned.</li>
            <li>I can only see these eyelashes with a flashlight, they&#x27;re so fine.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend these to anyone who wants a high quality tweezer at a very reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>Just like my title says above, this is awesome for getting out those tough to reach hairs.</li>
            <li>Tweezers for very well, great for the tiny little hairs that you don&#x27;t want and/or getting a splinter.  </li>
            <li>It was tough to initially take the plunge, but now I know why they cost so much, they&#x27;re made perfectly for the job they do.  </li>
            <li>Overall they&#x27;re not a bad purchase, just don&#x27;t expect anything special as far as tricky ingrown hairs are concerned.</li>
            <li>The fine tip makes it easy to remove small splinters.  </li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t really an Amazon flaw that I can see - this is a packaging problem straight from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>They work well, but they are very shap/pointy.</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>It is capable of drawing blood if you use it incorrectly.</li>
            <li>Thanks to all of the Amazon.com reviewers out there that help everyone make informed buying decisions.</li>
            <li>These tweezers really get the job done.  </li>
            <li>Works very well</li>
            <li>maybe even the whole collection.</li>
            <li>They are supposed to be made of Stainless Steel yet the tips bent like Aluminum?</li>
            <li>I might be trying to tweeze, between those really well-honed edges.  </li>
            <li>found that if I could work them just so on a hair of sufficient girth, without applying too much pressure, that I could still yank it.</li>
            <li>I sent the tweezers back to Tweezerman for a free sharpening and $5 realignment to see if it would make any difference.</li>
            <li>They can puncture the skin, I suppose, but that is really about it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done laser hair removal, but they are light enough that it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>; RUBIS &amp;#34; If you want a real tweezer spend the money for</li>
            <li>:B000EMYHA8 Tweezerman  Stainless Steel Ingrown Hair Splintertweeze]]</li>
            <li>She really likes them because she can pull the tiniest of hairs.</li>
            <li>That is where the product really shined.</li>
            <li>About 5-6mm would really make a difference for the purposes i am using them for.</li>
            <li>very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I was trying to remove ingrown hairs with cheap tweezers from the local drug store!</li>
            <li>it works really well.</li>
            <li>I am very relieved to have the hairs gone.</li>
            <li>which absolutely effects accuracy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find myself using these as much as I thought I would.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t really beat this product when it comes to price and performance.</li>
            <li>really wish i hadnt bought these.</li>
            <li>I really like these tweezers.</li>
            <li>These Tweezers work very well for ingrown hair.</li>
            <li>they really do the trick.  </li>
            <li>I really like these tweezers.</li>
            <li>THEY ARE VERY POINTY.</li>
            <li>When I tried harder, they would cut the skin, cause bleeding and make more harm.</li>
            <li>If you suffer from light to coarse ingrown hair on your face like side burns or on the chin</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this tweezer!</li>
            <li>but since these tweezers have pointy ends it is much faster and easier.</li>
            <li>Shipment is really fast.</li>
            <li>They sharpened for free and sent them back as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned a pair for a year, and for the price, I expected this to hold up better.</li>
            <li>I expected Tweezerman to produce a better quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them for much hair tweezing because the tips don&#x27;t have any grip.</li>
            <li>but since these tweezers have pointy ends it is much faster and easier.</li>
            <li>However there are a few issues that keep me from loving it...    </li>
            <li>And the metal of the tips is just rough enough to get a good grip without serrations.</li>
            <li>Tweezers aren&#x27;t the most expensive products you can buy, so for $14.99 I kind of expect a quality product that gets the job done.    </li>
            <li>The needle tips line up right on with one another very well, and it comes with a little protective cap to make sure no one drops it on their foot when it&#x27;s not being used.</li>
            <li>The points come to a sharp and very precise end.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been considering them but really didn&#x27;t think they would be that much better than other methods of getting out ingrown hairs -</li>
            <li>so* sharp, which should be a good thing, but the tips bent the second time I used them!  </li>
            <li>The sharp tip means more precision when plucking any hairs, I&#x27;ve stopped using regular blunt tweezers as they are not as quick and easy to use, would definitely reccomend</li>
            <li>These are great because they are so narrow at the tip, they can go directly to the hair just barely popping out of the skin and remove it without a mark.</li>
            <li>I have had my original pair for 15 (!)</li>
            <li>They are too brittle to bend back without torching them first, just be sure to protect the yellow rubber coating, or re-dip them if you&#x27;re inclined.</li>
            <li>Other tweezers cost more and don&#x27;t even work as well...</li>
            <li>Compared to other tweezers I have from a drug store, this gives a better precision.  </li>
            <li>I have updated this review (from two stars) as I can do much better &#x27;work&#x27; with virtually any other quality tweezers.</li>
            <li>I was very careful making sure I put the cap on when I was done</li>
            <li>did it take us so long to find these tweezers--they are simply extraordinary!</li>
            <li>But once you get the precision down these are  another great item as expected from Tweezerman.  </li>
            <li>The tweezerman only meets for a short length at the tiny tips, so I often can&#x27;t get get the gripping area precisely applied on a longer hair.</li>
            <li>They have a very fine point and require little effort to compress.</li>
            <li>Finally found the perfect tweezers for those coarse, hard to pull ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>These have a nice point but they are not as small at the tip as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li>If you need regular tweezers, look into the other Tweezerman products, such as the slant end type, which have the same high quality and excellent warranty.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you keep the plastic cap for the tip to keep them sharp and avoid accidental puncture wounds!</li>
            <li>These tweezers are VERY sharp and seem like they&#x27;d be great at removing ingrown hairs, however they perform about as well at removing tough-to-get hairs as my other Tweezerman tweezers.</li>
            <li>They work great and have sharp ends that help pull out ingrown hairs vs the typical tweezers with blunt ends.</li>
            <li>I love these they are very sharp</li>
            <li>Since my acquisition of these I&#x27;ve gone to a whole new level.  </li>
            <li>However be careful with them because they are so pointy you can prick yourself quite easy</li>
            <li>I have purchased over a half dozen Tweezerman&#x27;s because I love them</li>
            <li>That being said, for whatever reason, I could not get the hang of using this particular pair of tweezers to remove ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>*the super pointy tips actually poked me quite a bit</li>
            <li>These are the ultimate tweezers - but you sure have to pay for ultimate!</li>
            <li>However, I was only able to use this product for a short time.  </li>
            <li>For $14.99 they had better last a while, dispite the occasional drop.</li>
            <li>The older</li>
            <li>This happened to us, but luckily I had already prepared for this and had an extra pair!  </li>
            <li>They are able to get those tiny hairs around the chin that are such a nuisance.</li>
            <li>(He&#x27;s happy, too, since I&#x27;m the idiot who always walks around barefoot, so this is a tool more for his use than mine.)</li>
            <li>The tweezers come to a very fine point, and are capable of pulling anything from small eyebrow hairs to splinters, and anything in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They work pretty well for most ingrown hair and grab the hair very firm.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>These are high quality tweezers.</li>
            <li>If you grab too high, the hair will break.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>this product is so high quality</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>We have a high quality glass magnifying glass we use, and then we hone in on the critter with these.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them and I trust Tweezerman</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Tweezerman is a high quality tool.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have a bunch of those 99 cent twezers and they definately are not as high quality as these.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Because the point is so sharp, you have to be careful not to jab yourself or you will be a good bit of bleeding</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if these would be fine enough for very delicate things, like removing splinters, but these tweezermans have such a fine point that you can literally penetrate your skin with the tip without feeling it.  </li>
            <li>I love that it came with a little cover to help protect the tips (I tend to be a bit butter-fingered, and</li>
            <li>I sometimes think that it should work a little bit better than it does</li>
            <li>My son was amazed the other day how easily the got out a splinter in his finger.  </li>
            <li>Just makes it an extremely easy, drama-free task unlike other -cheaper- tweezers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great pair of tweezers for for tiny little hairs that only you can see or feel.  </li>
            <li>and I think tweezerman has done a decent effort to live up to its job</li>
            <li>I am used to using a stainless steel surgical grade forcep and these are nowhere near that level.  </li>
            <li>After this they would not conform to their normal shape despite my efforts and would not tweeze anything.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is fairly difficult to get a good grip on hair with these, but that&#x27;s not what these are really for!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the extra $!</li>
            <li>I purchased them pretty much for such purpose.  </li>
            <li>Within a few minutes after receiving these tweezers I was able to get them pulled out.</li>
            <li>I was able to get a metal splinter out that I have had for a few months now...</li>
            <li>It does not work as well for fine hairs or fuzz, but there are other products for those.</li>
            <li>They never dull just require cleaning.</li>
            <li>Reading all the reveiws on this I was expecting needle sharp fine tip tweezers.</li>
            <li>They are fine to hold, sharp-tip, but I think I&#x27;m going to use them for projects and other stuff besides plucking my eyebrows; my hair and skin is just to oily for these things to grasp.</li>
            <li>product&#x27;s graphic yellow design makes it more eye-catching than your traditional stainless steel model.  </li>
            <li>They feel like quality from the moment you hold them, They have served their purpose in fishing cotton wick through very small coils with amazing</li>
            <li>Sharp and precise</li>
            <li>The two sharp tips to align precisely.  </li>
            <li>The sharp tips allows you to pierce the bump and force the hair free.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying a new one because I let mine fall</li>
            <li>I was looking for a pair of new fine-tipped tweezers and came across these.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind every 3 months buying a new pair then by all means make this purchase.</li>
            <li>These tweezers are very sharp and easy to use for removing ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>i haven&#x27;t contacted tweezerman yet about a possible replacement since it&#x27;s only a lifetime sharpening for free.</li>
            <li>I love these little tweezers!</li>
            <li>The tweezers is very sharp, precise and high quality.</li>
            <li>Inspected thoroughly and I was surprised by the high quality for the price.</li>
            <li>, they work great for the little strays when you do your eyebrows, also for me at least if you end up with an ingrown hair when you shave your legs, these make it very easy to remove, the tips are sharp enough to penetrate a couple layers of skin if they need to.</li>
            <li>they arrived EXACTLY THE SAME WAY!</li>
            <li>I bought these tweezers because I had my first experience with what I believed to be in-grown hairs (looked like blackheads), following a series of bikini waxes and laser hair removal.  </li>
            <li>I have used these tweezers for years, and only repurchased them after I lost my first pair.</li>
            <li>It is tiny and was lost within the first two days.  </li>
            <li>These tweezers, combined with a jeweler&#x27;s loupe (because I&#x27;m old and can&#x27;t see as well as I used to!), allow me to pull out the tiniest splinters.</li>
            <li>With my first pair (the yellow), one of the tips was damaged and the tips could not grip correctly.  </li>
            <li>but I had to purchase the second one because I lost the first pair.</li>
            <li>Then the fine tip gets bent and becomes pretty useless rather quickly.</li>
            <li>There were more expensive models, greater precision not necessary for what i was doing.</li>
            <li>I would like to purchase a second pair for placing in first aid kit in our automobiles.</li>
            <li>Kind of sharp so be careful not to stab yourself.</li>
            <li>Even with a little bleeding these have done the job very quickly and without causing anymore damage to the surrounding skin.     </li>
            <li>These tweezers get used all over people and things, and are easily sanitized with a little rubbing alcohol or hand sanitizer.  </li>
            <li>This item is well constructed, cleans up easily and should last a very long time.  </li>
            <li>are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to pull out hairs that were barely visible with little to no work.</li>
            <li>This thing is very sharp and accurate when trying to remove ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>Very sharp and precise.</li>
            <li>The tips are very sharp and allow for precise grabbing.</li>
            <li>Had my old ones 50 years and needed new ones.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re nice and sharp, but not so sharp that you&#x27;ll accidentally hurt yourself.</li>
            <li>That might not matter so much if you&#x27;re plucking a hair, but if you are trying to pick up just one tiny grain of dolomite among a tray of other tiny particles, most tweezers just can&#x27;t do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My only difficulty is trying to grabbing the end of a longer hair out of a group on my bushy eyebrows (not normal edge plucking, which is fine.)</li>
            <li>Yes, we definitely have \\&quot;standard\\&quot; tweezers as well, for more typical tweezer types of activities.</li>
            <li>only downside is, you gotta be careful they kinda bend easily</li>
            <li>When I asked for clarification, they apologized, waived the fee entirely, and sent my tweezers back all nice and sharp!</li>
            <li>They are great for tight spaces like a blocked pore or scum in your trackball mouse.  </li>
            <li>This works for getting tiny, fine splinters out your fingers after working outside, or tiny hairs under eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>Just a word of warning, though, they are super sharp, so keep the plastic tip that comes with them.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Sometimes gripping hairs with it is hard because of the point.</li>
            <li>Super pointy and sharp.  </li>
            <li>The tip of my finest-tipped tweezers had gotten dull and my vision wasn&#x27;t getting any better, so</li>
            <li>Unlike standard tweezers these tweezers are pretty long and have a man sized large grip which may or may not be to your liking.  </li>
            <li>I know Tweezerman offers a free sharpening service (I have included the web address under \\&quot;comments\\&quot;), but sometimes you don&#x27;t need complete sharpening...just a little adjustment.</li>
            <li>in addition to all the run-of-the-mill less expensive tweezers that can be found at drugstores, I now own three types of too sharp Tweezerman tweezers (recommended by various beauty experts as being the best) that will rip up my skin without removing facial hair -- especially stray eyebrow hairs -- or splinters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you keep them clean and off the floor they should last a very long time.</li>
            <li>I bought these tweezers to replace my old Tweezerman Splintertweeze tweezers.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s problematic, because you are supposed to remove ingrown completely --</li>
            <li>I tried using it to yank arm hairs, leg hairs, chest hairs, face hairs, even back hairs and the \\&quot;bikini line\\&quot; (too much information?</li>
            <li>Before buying these I would sometimes have to use a straight pin along with regular tweezers to access the ingrown hair.</li>
            <li>I just replaced mine that was over 20 years old.</li>
            <li>So when I had to replace some old tweezers I bought these.</li>
            <li>Its easier than ever to get the most minute hair/pimple/flaw with these suckers.</li>
            <li>It must of been an old style.</li>
            <li>They are like harpoons and really help get deep when you need to</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>that first I have to slightly free the hair from the surrounding skin using a needle or other sharp</li>
            <li>And this is usually NOT a simple procedure, despite the fact that we have a whole arsenal of tweezers around the house.  </li>
            <li>There is a protective cap, but I think you&#x27;re most likely to drop them while your hands are wet, possibly just out of the shower.</li>
            <li>I ordered a replacement set from Amazon and so far those are working well,</li>
            <li>This is because only the very TIP of the tweezers come together--from there, they bow out--making it difficult to get a good grip.  </li>
            <li>I going to have use a sharping stone or something to sharpen them back up other than they work good to pull the little hairs out.</li>
            <li>They come in there own little plastic \\&quot;case\\&quot; with rubber tip cover to keep them sharp.</li>
            <li>Make sure to be careful with these tweezers because they are sharp, but will uncover the hair and allow you to retrieve the hair.</li>
            <li>These are full size tweezers, a bit longer than what I typically see sold in the drug store.  </li>
            <li>These are super sharp, so keep the tip protector on there!  </li>
            <li>the few times that i thought it would come in handy (small hair that was pushed into skin), it didnt really help.</li>
            <li>The tips are not nearly as pointed (too wide to use precisely) or as flush (won&#x27;t grasp well).</li>
            <li>but it has some work left (for sure in the amateur) --</li>
            <li>There were some posts indicating that it was not pointy enough compared to an older model.  </li>
            <li>Every other pair of tweezers will go right in the trash after you use these.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone especially if you get ingrowns from waxing or sugaring.</li>
            <li>I have tried everything for facial hair removal and nothing no matter how high tech or costly</li>
            <li>However, if you are bleeding, make sure you stop that first because I have found these tend to lose grip when the hair and or tweezers are a little slick from blood.</li>
            <li>The tweezers worked great while they lasted, however after a few months use the tips aren&#x27;t nearly as sharp and the ends bent slightly</li>
            <li>only complaint about the product is i wish they naturally were more expanded in the &amp;#34;open&amp;#34; position.</li>
            <li>Tweezer forceps don&#x27;t line up so not good for most jobs.</li>
            <li>Although these are more expensive than your regular run of the mill tweezers, they are definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>A very useful and oddly under-used piece of a medical kit.</li>
            <li>Not hard, just enough to rub and straighten those points.</li>
            <li>be very careful, be very precise and be very narrow in the width to pick (in fact a high price with mm.</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have mentioned, the tips are very sharp (they come with a cap for safety), so they can hone right in on a single lash (or ingrown hair) quite easily.  </li>
            <li>and they last a long time and they are pretty good too specially to get those little tiny difficult hairs from your face.</li>
            <li>one drop on a hard surface and you have misaligned the tips and most likely ruined it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had the travel sized Tweezerman set and didn&#x27;t know how much the larger set actual worked.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my third set of these tweezers in five months (one yellow, two stainless steel).  </li>
            <li>If you have trouble with such a precise tool than maybe it isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li>I have had the Ingrown Tweezers from Tweezerman before and they were very pointed, thin and precise.  </li>
            <li>After a few tries with the tweezerman, I was able to get the hair out.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a lot of trouble when the sharpness gets used up so quickly.</li>
            <li>This new pair of Tweezerman splinter tweezers do not have a needle point; the tweezer&#x27;s point is squared off so they are not sharp enough to pierce the skin and grab ingrown hairs.     </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, especially around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>No other store carries one so pointed at the end,</li>
            <li>The Greek half is why I am super hairy.</li>
            <li>I purchased these from Amazon - at less than half of the local price for the same product from the same maker - and am very pleased with them.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I suffered along all my life with the clumsy tweezers available in drug stores: which are like using salad tongs for tweezer needs, compared to these.</li>
            <li>But the tips barely touch</li>
            <li>I had an ingrown that was several months old and</li>
            <li>after having developed the might-work light-touch-and-magic-incantation technique described above.</li>
            <li>I bought a second set for my frequent out of town trips...</li>
            <li>I paid nearly twice this price locally to get these, and I now have 3 pairs: 1 for the bathroom, 1 for my purse</li>
            <li>but I do understand that manufacturers can only go so far.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve only used these twice.</li>
            <li>Wow never knew there was such a thing out there</li>
            <li>I actually like these ones better than all the other tweezerman styles (which are all more expensive!).</li>
            <li>Its been about 4 months of a lot of use, and they are not as sharp as they originally were, but that is expected with any tweezers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not cheap for tweezers, but this purchase was worth it.</li>
            <li>However, it is not suitable as a primary pair of tweezers or for people who are, like me, a little clumbsy or ham handed (you know who you are ;)).</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was on a quest to find the perfect tweezer for my job (petroleum geology), as it&#x27;s all but impossible to find a tweezer that can stand up to rough daily use, especially with the precision that these have to offer.  </li>
            <li>I needed a good set of tweezers to weed out the unwanted vinyl from cut designs, and the sharp point on these tweezers work perfectly, especially with very complex designs.</li>
            <li>We live in a fairly rural area and our back yard seems to be a haven for ticks.</li>
            <li>Since the tips are so fine it can sometimes be hard to grasp those properly</li>
            <li>They are sharp, and they will dig into your skin, but unless you get a hair exactly in their very,very tiny grip, you will just have a hole in your face and the hair will still be there.  </li>
            <li>The fine tweezers in the petite set are sharper than these yellow suckers.</li>
            <li>I also follow up with a flat tweezer to remove the hair completely.  </li>
            <li>But for cases where you need precise control, or you need to go into a very small area, these are just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are sharp, and can dig in and grip hairs hiding under the skin without inflicting too much collateral damage.</li>
            <li>They are extremely precise, not quite needle sharp but certainly sharp enough, and they work wonders.</li>
            <li>In addition, if or when they become dull, you can send the tweezers back to the company and they&#x27;ll resharpen them for free of charge.  </li>
            <li>Tweezerman supposedly provides free sharpening and once my third pair becomes dull</li>
            <li>the tip is not sharp enough!!!</li>
            <li>and none seemed to last very long or allow me to get ahold of my fine facial hairs that grow wild where I least expect them to be.</li>
            <li>I would got with the traditional slant style tweezer in general.</li>
            <li>The ends are very close to each other in the resting open position.</li>
            <li>like this product so much that I will buy other Tweezerman products in the future.</li>
            <li>My first go with these made me nervous--but after a few hairs, I got the hang of them.</li>
            <li>The tips will slowly bend if you use them a lot, to the point where you have to find a sweet spot to grip the hairs.</li>
            <li>The super sharp tips of the tweezers, bend easily, and break off, making it somewhat unusable, and unable to grab more difficult hairs.</li>
            <li>I idiotically purchased these Tweezerman tweezers because two I already have are useless at removing my very fine eyebrow hairs along with splinters from the plants in my front yard that are native to the Southwest</li>
            <li>This particular model has precision ground sharp points, which are designed to penetrate the skin&#x27;s surface and pull out ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>well built, very sturdy, very sharp.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that the points are VERY sharp, so they can cut the skin pretty deeply, causing scabbing and possibly scars.</li>
            <li>Heavy duty and very sharp tweezers manage to grab quite accurately</li>
            <li>the sharp tips actually seemed really ineffective when I used them compared to a flat tipped pair.</li>
            <li>As a lady interested in keeping her eyebrows tame, I had always had regular Tweezerman slanted tweezers.  </li>
            <li>These tweezers are not any better than regular tweezers, it is very difficult to get them to grab the hair, the only thing i accomplished with them is some unwanted cuts and bleeding from trying to grab ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>Very well made and you wont regret spending a little on these.</li>
            <li>They are precisely cut, and if dropped on the point it will break or at the very least bend.</li>
            <li>Rarely it may break the hair, or you may have a hair that&#x27;s hard to grasp(usually because it&#x27;s very short).    </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s great at digging hairs out from underneath skin, but not so good at grasping hairs once they have emerged.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for the perfect tweezers for many years, and now I have found it.</li>
            <li> Normally I love the tweezer man brand, all my best tweezers are from hem.</li>

            <li> Great price for a really good pair of tweezers.</li>
            <li> this product is very true to it claim been the best.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my Tweezerman tweezers, and I hope they make every splinter encounter as easy as this one was.  </li>
            <li> This is a great concept and works most of the times!</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are specifically wonderful if you need to coax out ingrown hairs or remove fine splinters.</li>
            <li> I bought a pair of these in store &amp; loved them - then dropped them and blunted the tip.</li>
            <li> All in all these are a good buy</li>
            <li> Good for extracting the hair under the skin, but the needle tips end up snapping the hair when you try to tweeze it out    </li>
            <li> When I tried to use this pair, the hair either broke, or I could not get a good grip.  </li>
            <li> These are over priced, they don&#x27;t work good.</li>
            <li> Good quality.  </li>
            <li> Good quality</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know these would be so good.</li>
            <li> At a lower price point these would be something good to stock up on and throw away when the tips got bent.  </li>
            <li> This one is not as good.</li>
            <li> In addition, their customer service is uniquely good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for detail work, I guess.  </li>
            <li> I have one word for people who think Tweezerman is a good product.</li>
            <li> good product.</li>
            <li> this product is good.  </li>
            <li> but they are good for ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> The materials used seem to be of good quality.</li>
            <li> After that experience I realized the importance of having good tweezers on hand.</li>
            <li> Good quality</li>
            <li> Good quality product that does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and at a good price.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman makes a good product that stand up over time.</li>
            <li> works fairly well.</li>
            <li> It does the job so perfectly and you will not need another tool to clean up your in grown hairs.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are great - very precise.  </li>
            <li> so they aren&#x27;t really great splinter type tweezers any more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is another great product from tweezerman, and I love the quality/feel of the tweezers, however we just don&#x27;t seem to find them applicable in our case.  </li>
            <li> Tweezerman is a great company that I totally love and trust!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love them and am happy I purchased them.</li>
            <li> Well, great product, love it.</li>
            <li> , he is very pleased.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been VERY pleased with these tweezers.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for eyebrows and it is able to get almost every hair.</li>
            <li> For splinters they are the best out there and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey - but - beautifully made, easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good thing they are brightly colored, otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t be able to see one of my co-workers sneaking off with them.</li>
            <li> Love these tweezers!  </li>
            <li> When paired with my 15x magnification mirror there is not a stray eyebrow that is safe from being plucked!</li>
            <li> oh man, i love these things!</li>
            <li> I LOVE these tweezers!  </li>
            <li> I was immediately impressed on my first try.</li>

            <li> I love these tweezers!</li>
            <li> I get so many stubborn hairs for my husband!</li>
            <li> I had to order another one which I&#x27;ll try to take better care of!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I made this purchase!</li>
            <li> I love this!  </li>

            <li> These will do the job, excellent quality, readily available, easy to locate item on the web.</li>
            <li> They work great for splinters or really fine work on removing ingrown hairs, etc.  </li>
            <li> This tweezer works amazing for ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> Also, the price is amazing.</li>
            <li> Great,  accurate tweezing of those stubborn ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Its amazing the difference</li>
            <li> And 9 bucks is a great price for something so indispensable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing at the hairs it removes that have not pierced the skin as of yet.  </li>
            <li> This Tweezers are amazing, hey just go ahead and buy it.</li>
            <li> and it is available for a great price here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> have been so impressed with how sturdy these tweezers are after using them for over a year, and how accurate and precise they were designed to be.  </li>
            <li> These are amazing.  </li>
            <li> but they ruin them with their own package.</li>
            <li> The idea was nice but the execution did not come through for me.  </li>
            <li> It would be nice if they&#x27;d integrate a place to store that tip guard into the design of the tweezers.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nice to know that the option is there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and is handy to have</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s kind of a catch 22 of sorts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are absolutely the best tweezers ever fashioned by man.</li>
            <li> Really nice firs-aid tool.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman makes nice products.  </li>
            <li> If these were twice the price I would still own them.  </li>
            <li> The Tweezerman stainless steel ingrown hair splintertweeze is an excellent product for dealing with ingrown hairs.  </li>

            <li> These are really nice to have around.  </li>
            <li> I also found that mine aren&#x27;t perfectly aligned so even when I&#x27;m right on top of a hair</li>
            <li> These are very nice, precise tweezers that will get to anything you have that&#x27;s under the skin.  </li>

            <li> These tweezers are the best possible way to remove them, with the help of a good magnifying glass, of course.  </li>
            <li> I think these tweezers are really great because of the surface area it provides for your fingers to grip and the super pointy tips.</li>

            <li> Tweezerman are my favorite, love the point!</li>
            <li> I searched and searched and could not find any tweezers that were as good at plucking fine hairs.  </li>
            <li> As far as I&#x27;m concerned, these are the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used for ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> To be totally honest, I decided on a more preventative approach than cure.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best tweezer I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> I am sure that somebody who is used to drugstore tweezers would probably find these a nice upgrade, but if you&#x27;re used to Tweezerman quality, beware.  </li>
            <li> These are by far the best tweezers I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> These are absolutely great tweezers, well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> These are quality tweezers suitable for both cosmetic endeavors and miniature hobby projects.</li>
            <li> Why aren&#x27;t tweezers like these more popular???</li>
            <li> Would have liked another color, but its ok</li>
            <li> This is really great if you need to \\&quot;dig\\&quot; those troublesome ingrown hairs that are stuck right under the surface.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In terms of performance, they&#x27;re great tweezers right out of the box.</li>
            <li> This is really great if you need to &amp;#34;dig&amp;#34; those troublesome ingrown hairs that are stuck right under the surface.</li>
            <li> It was so easy!</li>
            <li> I need a tweezer that pulls very fine hairs.</li>
            <li> I bought these in 2010 and they&#x27;re still going strong!</li>
            <li> It really doesnt get the hair all that good!</li>
            <li> This is by far the most impressive ingrown hair tweezer that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;What makes these tweezers so great is that they have a sharp tip that is very good at holding on to whatever it grabs.  </li>
            <li> I use these for general tweezer needs and find them to be excellent.</li>
            <li> Very precise for getting those stubborn hairs,</li>
            <li> They have a very precise tip and it grabs anything.  </li>
            <li> They are very precise.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for anybody who needs a good pair of tweezers!</li>
            <li> I thought for sure it was a fluke and ordered another pair through Amazon -</li>
            <li> Going to order me some more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure, just not for us.</li>
            <li> They are also more compact and come in a protective case that will keep the tips from getting bent.</li>
            <li> Glad</li>
            <li> If you have amazon prime you can get free shipping and save yourself the gas it would have taken to drive to the store, win-win!</li>
            <li> Secondly, I dropped the tweezers, and after that the precision tips did not meet perfectly, so I had to jimmy</li>
            <li> You just need to make sure you sterilize them before</li>
            <li> These are definitely the best ones out there.  </li>
            <li> The points of these STILL match perfectly even after several accidental drops into the sink.</li>
            <li> meaning I have to use these to get the hair, and then another, duller pair to remove it :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I am going to be getting more of this product...</li>
            <li> A great item at a fair price - definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> Use them on ingrowns on my beard and so much more.</li>
            <li> for product that satisfied me.</li>
            <li> the more I seem to be getting them.</li>
            <li> /I am so glad I bought 3 pair, for home, for travel, and I gave one to my mother as a suprise (she likes hers too)</li>
            <li> But they sure do the trick of extracting all kinds of thorns and splinters out of my hands.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not always able to pop them with my fingers or it would hurt to do it with my fingers.  </li>
            <li> I was able to grasp and pull with precision.</li>
            <li> Use them all the time, one my favorite hygiene tools.</li>
            <li> I agree with others that these may not be the best for actually plucking hairs from the root</li>
            <li> Now I can continue waxing without too many bumps after.  </li>
            <li> * brand which is more money.  </li>
            <li> and I thought these would be even better.  </li>
            <li> Had a cyst on the bottom of my top eyelid for coupla years.  </li>
            <li> Was able to grasp and penetrate the cyst resulting in puss removal.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the third pair and they pull wonderfully.</li>
            <li> (I give them four more weeks), I will send the three off as a set.  </li>
            <li> This is a quality product, better than any \\&quot;Wal-Mart\\&quot; tool ever thought of being.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time, more than I thought I would.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with it personally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to dig hairs out, grab them, and pull them out without causing a lot of damage.</li>
            <li> The vast majority of the time it works flawlessly.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend is able to remove splinters with no effort.</li>
            <li> i love this tweezer.</li>
            <li> I love this tweezer.  </li>
            <li> These are the pointiest tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used and as such the best.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love these tweezers</li>
            <li> , i surely would not let my kids get ahold of these.</li>
            <li> (For comparison, I have better luck</li>
            <li> /&gt;We are so pleased that we have these in the house now.</li>
            <li> Its not like I throw them around or step on them:-)</li>
            <li> One of the points is going to become slightly more bent than the other.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are my favorite tweezers.</li>
            <li> i love this brand but don&#x27;t like this version at all.</li>
            <li> I love these tweezers.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much I love these.  </li>
            <li> so I have tried many things over the years.</li>
            <li> Why would I want to do that if I love it???</li>
            <li> It has become more of a craft pair of tweezers for me.  </li>
            <li> WAY better than fishing around in a kids finger with a needle.  </li>
            <li> Tips connect and hold a splinter way better than you&#x27;d think.</li>
            <li> Need I say more?</li>
            <li> Love these tweezers.</li>
            <li> For a woman appearance is everything, you will love this like I do.</li>
            <li> I have bought many pairs of tweezers in my life for my husband.</li>
            <li> I have gotten so many ingrown hairs with these.</li>
            <li> So make sure you don&#x27;t stab yourself, because you will.</li>
            <li> so so much more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a splinter in my hand for quite some time and haven&#x27;t been able to remove it.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> But as bleary-eyed and sleep-fogged as he was, he was able to isolate the splinter and remove it without any struggle or pain on my part.  </li>
            <li> So glad I bought this thing I should have bought 2 just in case</li>
            <li> These tweezers are wonderful, I might never use a regular tweezer again.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman used to have a much better quality product.</li>
            <li> I count on brand names to be better, won&#x27;t buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman makes outstanding products.</li>
            <li> I have been using these tweezers for a number of years now, and continue to be pleased.</li>
            <li> Cut the mails of my two toddlers better than anything.</li>
            <li> Purchased 4 items, satisfied with every one.</li>
            <li> I thought these tweezers would work better</li>
            <li> :  be sure to retain the rubbery plastic end cap to slide overtop the tweezers when they are not in use.  </li>
            <li> These are my favorite needle nose tweezers ever.  </li>
            <li> So make sure you don&#x27;t stab yourself, because you will.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s was convenient to shop for a good pair of tweezers that would come right to my home with out running all over town looking.</li>
            <li> Best item I have bought in a long time.</li>
            <li> Also would make a good addition to any first aid kit.</li>
            <li> these work pretty good</li>
            <li> When I first got these they seemed to work fairly well</li>
            <li> Great finished product, as i find with most tweezerman, all their products so far are built well, and do what is required</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had super pointy tweezers before, but these are amazing.  </li>
            <li> It is the perfect tool, every single time.</li>
            <li> As with many fine tools, there is a trade-off.  </li>
            <li> These do an OK job, but not recommended for baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re better than all other brands, but not the best over all.    </li>
            <li> Like some of the other reviews, I , too have bought every tweezer in the drugstores trying to find the most perfect one that WORKS.</li>
            <li> It comes with good directions about safety and cleaniness and certainly does the job in getting under the skin.  </li>
            <li> Thats really the main reason i use them and let me stress how awesome these</li>
            <li> It was like having two sewing needles in perfect alignment and was able to easily extract the foreign invader of my finger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the end, I think this is probably a great tool for an \\&quot;emergency\\&quot; in-grown hair or in the hands of a professional.  </li>
            <li> It took a learning curve to figure out that it&#x27;s best to try to grab the hair at an angle and not straight on.</li>
            <li> Incredible accuracy and can penetrate spots where deep ingrown hairs lie.</li>
            <li> The packaging material promises Tweezerman will gladly grind (re-sharpen) the tips for free --</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no longer available and this one is just OK.</li>
            <li> my cousin loved it so much, I had to get her one as well.</li>
            <li> Tweezers are good quality and work very well for intended use.</li>
            <li> had another set of ingrown hair/splinter tweezers from them that were practically razor sharp -- perfect for digging out recalcitrant hairs or splinters.</li>
            <li> these a perfect and sharp to get the in grown out.  </li>
            <li> The tips of these things are like SHARP needles, and they are perfect for \\&quot;isolating ingrown</li>
            <li> Color makes it easy to find in a drawer, sharp points make it perfect for digging out splinters.  </li>
            <li> Loved it - high quality, sharp, works excellently.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is not at all a problem, because the tips still easily get under the skin to get ingrown hairs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And they bend easily.</li>
            <li> The tips bend easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Ingrown hairs are easily plucked away.  </li>
            <li> It works so well for tweeting eyebrows but is also awesome for removing splinters, it&#x27;s so narrow and precise!</li>
            <li> Easy to remove ingrown hair.  </li>
            <li> The thing about the tips though is that since they are so slim they are easy to</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works well.</li>
            <li> Easily digs out ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> They do come with a plastic cover for the tip, however, this comes off easily and gets lost</li>
            <li> and then they&#x27;re easy to damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After repeat shavings, I get ingrown hairs on my face and these tweezers easily remove them.</li>
            <li> I like the precision of it even better than the straight or the slanted tweezer which I also own.</li>
            <li> I have had these tweezers for a couple of years and are still going strong.  </li>
            <li> strong stable pointed tweezers.  </li>
            <li> The tip is perfectly pointed and equally sharp, which is required for precise removal.</li>
            <li> These things are nice and sharp and work great.  </li>
            <li> Nice and sharp for digging and grabbing  ingrown hairs out with great precision...</li>
            <li> I skewered the tube the first time I tried to use it to cover the tips, so I need to find some kind of alternative sheath for travel.</li>
            <li> These Tweezerman tweezers are hands down the best tweezers I have ever used.</li>
            <li> They are hands down the best tweezers I have ever used or seen!</li>
            <li> These are very sharp tweezers and are great!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very sharp and the points meet perfectly.</li>
            <li> 1 - the point of this tweezers are fine and slender...</li>
            <li> in fact at times they are TOO fine...</li>
            <li> So, I learned to adjust my grip and grab the hair using the wider part of the tweezer and it works out fine.</li>
            <li> Having the finest of fine hairs is to your disadvantage, but that would apply to any tweezer.   </li>
            <li> The tips of this product are so fine that I no longer need to jab at my neck with a pin.</li>
            <li> These are extremely fine pointed.  </li>
            <li> Again, for fine hairs, these tweezers cannot be beat.  </li>
            <li> Fine tip is laughfable.</li>
            <li> Anytime I need to grab something fine like a bead or brad</li>
            <li> I like to have both a fine tip and a slant tweezer, and between these two, I have everything I need.</li>
            <li> I wear contacs and I will get these extremely fine eyelashes that grow under my eyelash line and poke/irritate my eyes.  </li>
            <li> It requires precision but it will pull out ingrown hair, the grip is strong and feels comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> The tips on the Tweezerman were not as fine and precise as desired.</li>
            <li> With a little practice, you will find that these work excellent.  </li>
            <li> They&#x3D; tweezers are immensely accurate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the brand and product, especially after doing the math which drew to my attention</li>
            <li> Fortunately, unlike the 1 and 2 star reviewers, I&#x27;m not cursed with scab-covered ingrown hairs all over my body.</li>
            <li> remember, tweezerman sharpens your tools for free (all you have to pay for is shipping).</li>
            <li> these tweezers are great to lift ingrown facial hair buried in the skin, because of their \\&quot;needle-like\\&quot; tips.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great for probing under the skin for hairs that have turned back into the follicle and started growing under the skin.</li>
            <li> The free, lifetime sharpening is a plus, too.</li>
            <li> These things are as precise as surgical instrument.  </li>
            <li> The tips are so precise...</li>
            <li> Fortunately, TWEEZERMAN&#x27;s warranty will replace or fix them &amp;#34;free&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ll sharpen your tweezers for free and even pay for return postage; you just have to pay the postage to Texas.</li>
            <li> Come to think of it, anyone who has to tweeze stuff in a lab -- to look at it under a microscope or with a loupe -- or anything else requiring the ability to pick up a precise object at a precise point, these would probably outperform the overpriced lab junk for sale so often from scientific supply stores.</li>
            <li> Since they are so precise, you have to be as well.</li>
            <li> If these don&#x27;t work great for you, it will very likely be the operator, not the product.</li>
            <li> It has a comfortable grip to it, which is also important do to my authritis in my hands</li>
            <li> They are easy to clean</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> must say the quality out of the box was fantastic.</li>
            <li> The second pair was great.  </li>
            <li> Also, great at picking up tiny iPhone screws or anything at all</li>
            <li> Upon pressure it might leave a tiny dot mark on the skin, I am happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> Also tweezerman will sharpen these tweezers for free if they should ever need it</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s great for individual hairs and edging</li>
            <li> Look well made, precise tweezer tips.</li>
            <li> works really well in pulling ingrown hairs, just again be careful you dont want to poke yourself, it takes time getting used to how to be able to use it, but then again practice makes perfect.</li>
            <li> /&gt;they say you can send it in for free to be resharpened but</li>
            <li> and they work great for such a project.</li>
            <li> Indispensable.</li>
            <li> This is a nicely made product and works really well.</li>
            <li> but I did just find that this brand will repair and resharpen them for free</li>
            <li> So far so good,</li>
            <li> They work best to work out the hair you&#x27;re after, although sometimes I need to bust out my heavy-duty TM tweezers to actually get the whole hair out.</li>
            <li> Good spring action and holding up well.</li>
            <li> Perfect for splinters, of course, but also useful for removing stitches and wowing fellow construction workers when I pull them out of my center console.  </li>
            <li> Grabbing a hair with these is an exercise in futility which succeeds only after many attempts to snare what it is that for which you&#x27;re looking to grab.  </li>
            <li> the sharp pointed tip make them very good for the job</li>
            <li> I love how pointed and sharp these tweezers and it makes them great for ingrown hair.  </li>
            <li> No other tool in the house was effective, but once I got these, I was able to fix the necklace</li>
            <li> Amazing quality for the price,very useful in my practice,delivered on time and looks exactly as the picture</li>
            <li> These remove ingrown hairs quickly and easily with no discomfort.</li>
            <li> It really does a good job when it&#x27;s time to get really thorough in your grooming and need to pick at really fine hairs...</li>
            <li> They no longer \\&quot;tweeze\\&quot; like they did originally, but still work for loosening ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> the are able to get exactly what I want.</li>
            <li> Best tweezers for small problems.  </li>
            <li> I ordered these tweezers to help me remove splinters and small metal shavings and they work perfectly</li>
            <li> Was excited to get these, seem to work well.  </li>
            <li> Precision implement, superbly does things have wished for in the past..  in grown hair, splinters.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I plucked and plucked and everything came out cleanly until the day they didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> First, I am so impressed by these tweezers and their ability to pull hair close to the skin - hair so short that I have to be using a 15x magnification mirror to really know they are there.  </li>
            <li> I really was hoping for something very precise.  </li>
            <li> The sharp stainless steel tips are perfect for ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> these are the right tool for the job !</li>
            <li> wife liked these tweezers so much, we ended up buying a second set for our medicine cabinet (as nothing works better for removing splinters than these Tweezerman tweezers!).  </li>
            <li> Who can&#x27;t find a pair of bright yellow tweezers in a cluttered cabinet or drawer!  </li>
            <li> They might be really good at removing larger things like splinters, but I haven&#x27;t had to try that yet.</li>
            <li> They come with a protective cover for the end, which is good to prevent accidental impalement, especially if you put them in a pocket.  </li>
            <li> the concept is extremely cool</li>
            <li> Were good for the short time they lasted.</li>
            <li> Overall, I find that if you are patient, it does almost as good a job as waxing.</li>
            <li> These are true to description.  </li>
            <li> took off one star for the fact that it is ONLY good for ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> Its really only good for getting out splinters</li>
            <li> always a good thing to keep in the cabinet as inevitably you&#x27;ll need it</li>
            <li> Have never owned such a good pair of tweezers before and have bought plenty in cosmetic departments over the years.</li>
            <li> Thank you for such a good product.</li>
            <li> Really good for removing ingrown facial hairs.</li>
            <li> very good at getting those stubborn ingrown hairs...very sharp and pointedly gets right to the cord of the hairs...would highly recommend this product.!!!</li>
            <li> And I really mean the best.  </li>
            <li> The first is that the ends are easily damaged and warped.  </li>
            <li> The tips are so fine they draw down to nearly needles, but they have superb traction &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; even at that level.</li>
            <li> They are very comfortable to hold and use since they are nice and wide where you hold them.</li>
            <li> They really do a great job pulling hairs and even digging out foreign matter under the skin.</li>
            <li> Really sharp tips and great edge on the end.</li>
            <li> These are insanely sharp and great for removing ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product, but as soon as you get used to how sharp they are, you WILL stab yourself in the hand.</li>
            <li> See, they are great at getting just under the skin and working items out from under the skin so they are poking out of the skin far enough so they can then be grabbed using a tweezer made for easy grabbing and pulling.</li>
            <li> my experience with these tweezers, they are not designed for anyone with fine hair that is too fine, for removing splinters from plants that are so unusual as to be rare (lantana, cactus, etc.)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nice to read about real people using products and giving real feedback.</li>
            <li> I loved my old stainless steel Tweezerman splinter remover.  </li>
            <li> These make quick painless work if it.</li>
            <li> I have larger hands than most females and I am able to hold and maneuver the tweezer to remove ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> The tips are super sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it was shipped quickly</li>
            <li> They are sharp and tend to grab well most of the time !!</li>
            <li> There are other Tweezerman products that are more effective</li>
            <li> they were pretty cheaply priced so i figured id try them out because i like the tweezerman brand</li>
            <li> Normally I have been satisfied with the others I have purchased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional but appreciate a good quality tool.  </li>
            <li> I was very excited about this product, and Tweezerman products came highly recommended to me.  </li>
            <li> fast delivery, good product, does the job, very helpful for those with sensitive skin, sturdy product, I do wish it had a light</li>
            <li> They work great, they are very very sharp and come with a rubber tip cover.</li>
            <li> could live without it for eyebrow purposes, its probably better for splinters etc...</li>
            <li> The steel tip is very brittle and will crack easily.</li>
            <li> It works very well for removing splinters and easily plucking fewer strands of hair from eyebrows.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got an OCD streak about ingrown hairs, like me, this little guy will be your new best friend!</li>
            <li> The metal is very soft so the &#x27;Perfectly aligned tips&#x27;, a most critical feature, do not stay aligned for long.</li>
            <li> These tweezers indeed are very nice and sharp!</li>
            <li> The interior portion does not have any ridges but has been machined in such a way that it provides excellent grip when the hair is dry.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and super precise.</li>
            <li> These are actually less effective and cause more damage.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t use too much pressure then it will work perfectly fine on the tips.</li>
            <li> The tips are extremely fine, yet strong enough to lift out a splinter easily the first time.  </li>
            <li> Great for getting a little deeper for those ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> They take a little getting used to, but once you do, they&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li> Well worth it.</li>
            <li> So I bought these yellow ones on Amazon, and they work fantastic, even better than the originals.  </li>
            <li> When first bought, this tool is so exact and precise.  </li>
            <li> I ended up using my old tweezers since they gripped much better.</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t grip worth spit.</li>
            <li> These tweezers cost 2-3x any store type, were worth every penny.</li>
            <li> but they are fully worth it</li>
            <li> so I was thrilled to find a tweezer made especially for this.  </li>
            <li> recently purchased a vinyl plotter so I can make my own vinyl decals.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old calls them the magic tweezers.</li>
            <li> Pricey for tweezers but worth it.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> The handle is coated, and appears to be non-slip- worth the price&#x27;</li>
            <li> These Tweezerman tweezers are worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love their other tweezers which I own, but these don&#x27;t really do what they&#x27;re supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> I had the original Tweezerman&#x27;s (which I paid TRIPLE the price for at a big box store), and they served me well for many years</li>
            <li> my  brothers really love this tweezer cannot stop talking about them to other guys I will be  ordering more.</li>
            <li> and I am sure I will love this product for a very long time...especially with the lifetime guarantee!!!</li>
            <li> You need a steady hand and good hand/eye coordination and for obvious reasons, don&#x27;t use these anywhere around your eyes.</li>
            <li> These are 100x better, very very sharp, and can be very very precise.  </li>
            <li> Pulls the splinter right out.</li>
            <li> It did not grab the hair but slid right off each time.</li>
            <li> If you need and want tweezers that get right to the point these are the ones.</li>
            <li> It looks like since the hair is right under the surface of your skin</li>
            <li> Yes, they are just right for grabbing or teasing out an in-grown hair from tender skin.  </li>
            <li> , right?  </li>
            <li> It looks like since the hair is right under the surface of your skin</li>
            <li> these tweezers are good for just about tweezing anything.........very precise and not much more</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re pretty much working with a precise surgical item here.</li>
            <li> Our experience with tweezers are that most hairs are too fine to be removed by most of the tweezers, and after time the tweezers become dull and useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: I&#x27;ve used these for several years and they are the absolute best for ingrown chin hairs (menopausal women know very well what I&#x27;m talking about) and essential for splinters.</li>
            <li> Was able to get out splinters that I wasn&#x27;t able to previously.</li>
            <li> I plan never to be without a pair within easy reach for the rest of my days, and I really don&#x27;t say that about much.</li>
            <li> Great product for getting ingrown hairs or small thorns out.</li>
            <li> This is great for small hairs, or ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> Not even having to apply huge pressure like I did with normal tweezers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the ingrown hair thing, but they are just great at anything you&#x27;d like stabbed or tweezed out of you..</li>
            <li> Great for small slivers or metal slivers.</li>
            <li> I accidentally dropped my pair on the tile floor in the bathroom, the points bent out of true straight and no longer worked.</li>
            <li> I own Revlon tweezers which I purchased long time ago from Target.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also yellow and easy to find!</li>
            <li> have no clue what to recommend to anyone with very fine hair on their face, especially excess eyebrow hair, looking for tweezers.</li>
            <li> This tool makes for very precise grooming; It gets right under each individual hair.</li>
            <li> The tweezers are wide and secure in my hand which allow more control in the process.</li>
            <li> It has a small mouth for this exact reason, not meant for plucking lots of hairs, use a thicker opener.&lt;br /&gt;tweezerman is a great brand and never dissapoints.  </li>
            <li> Worth every cent for these, and the price on here is much better than what I can find in local stores.</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re looking under a microscope, it&#x27;s clear to see that most tweezers have a gap; they don&#x27;t really close all the way.  </li>
            <li> I have a few pair of these splinter tweezers for my occupation and they are simply the best out there.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy, and super pointy.  </li>
            <li> Great for ingrown hair and for any other epilation really, better than any other.</li>
            <li> That said the product manufacturer seems to offer a pretty good gaurentee: \\&quot;We replace Damaged/dropped tools for one half the purchase price, we repair bent tips for $5.00 per tool.  </li>
            <li> Super sharp and super accurate!</li>
            <li> The ends of the tweezers are very much NEEDLES, so you can&#x27;t grab anything with it.  </li>
            <li> Some people may find great use of these, but prefer the flat tipped/tapered tweezers after using these briefly</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like these tweezers because the tips get bent easily and you can&#x27;t really bend them back to the original position.</li>
            <li> The week after these arrived I found my favorite tweezers, these work for what they say but the needle tip regular tweezermans work better overall for hairs, ingrown or not.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my first aid kit for splinters, etc...</li>
            <li> Some reviewers say they have difficulty pulling/grabbing hair with these tweezers, but I never have a problem - I think the trick is to hold the tweezers more parallel to your face and pull in the direction of hair growth.   </li>
            <li> but I would definitely advise buying more than one at a time</li>
            <li> These are reasonably price, and worth every penny of it.</li>
            <li> Very pointy!  </li>
            <li> the ONLY thing that could make them better is if they had a \\&quot;grippy\\&quot; section where you hold it........</li>
            <li> but I just need to be able to learn hold it and properly use it.</li>
            <li> Plus the company took more than a week in an off-season time to ship the tiny item.</li>
            <li> Just be warned that tweezing can become addictive because these make it somewhat enjoyable.</li>
            <li> I am a fervent gardener, and consequently have more than my share of tiny splinters lodged in my fingers.</li>
            <li> Overall, I simply love them and just need not to be so aggressive.</li>
            <li> What a wonderful set of tweezers You won&#x27;t go wrong with them.  </li>
            <li> Now I wouldn&#x27;t expect a glass to get dropped from counter height to the floor and survive, but considering the size/weight of these tweezers I kind of expected that they would have made it out unscathed.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ll have to use restraint next time :)</li>
            <li> I bought the listed product as a replacement for that first tweezer; you can read about my experience with that first tweezer below.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t check Amazon&#x27;s price first.</li>
            <li> the first pair I owned.</li>
            <li> I just used these for the first time and am amazed at how well they got out the ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> This is a simple but elegant tool.</li>
            <li> Exactly what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I admit I&#x27;m an avid picker.  </li>
            <li> Just have a look at the product shot, it&#x27;s exactly what you&#x27;d expect it to be.</li>
            <li> Way better than regular tweezers for removing wood splinters!  </li>
            <li> You can get exactly the spot that you want, to pull the tick out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried to use them and the first thing I muttered to myself</li>
            <li> would have given this a 5 out of 5 stars if this was build with a higher quality metal</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t come up with any cons, really..!</li>
            <li> These are super sharp with a very fine point.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Surgical forceps such as Dumont or Hamilton Bell #5 with Super Fine tips is the way to go to extracting ingrown hairs with needle precision.  </li>
            <li> I bought these for a first aid kit in case I ever need to removed splinters or stingers, should work well.</li>
            <li> The tip is certainly much larger than the Revlon Platinum Tweezer Slant Tip, which I have included in an image next to the Tweezerman - Ingrown Hair Splintertweeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am currently using these for crafting, which they are actually perfect for.  </li>
            <li> They are also great for small stickers or stamped images or pretty much anything else.  </li>
            <li> If there were a way to protect the tip better, I think they would last longer.</li>
            <li> These tweezers do exactly what they should.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several slanted tip tweezerman tweezers, and I love every one of them.  </li>
            <li> Never thought I would truly understand how a pair of tweezers could be worth this much money</li>
            <li> Thanks Tweezerman!</li>
            <li> They are now kept in our First Aid kit and travel with us to the beach and park.  </li>
            <li> To prevent the problem in the first place, use an electric razor and accept a not-so-close shave.</li>
            <li> It should last for many years.  </li>
            <li> I have had for one year; I use them almost every day and they work like the first day</li>
            <li> Because of their thickness, it rips the skin around the hair which can cause scarring more so than a needle and regular tweezers.</li>
            <li> Somehow the tweezers work better, faster, and do not leave deep scars.</li>
            <li> I sure hope they last</li>
            <li> I guess if you know up front to be super careful with them you might do better than I did??</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s sooo much easier to isolate the right hair</li>
            <li> These fill a specific role very well, but are not as good at other tasks like easy grabbing and plucking.</li>
            <li> You need to grip hairs JUST right to prevent breakage, but it&#x27;s easy enough to learn.</li>
            <li> Nice sharp matching points.</li>
            <li> They are ridiculously precise and sharp to a point where you can easily hurt yourself.</li>
            <li> Using these is so much more delicate than any other way I&#x27;ve tried, and faster and more effective.  </li>
            <li> Also I bought myself a new lighted magnifying mirror which helped tremendously.</li>
            <li> The price on amazon is really good too - I have seen it at big box stores for between $17 to $22, and currently on amazon</li>
            <li> It really works to make them back to \\&quot;super\\&quot; grabbing! :)</li>
            <li> I was very pleased that these tweezers helped me deal with the issue even though I had little to go on.  </li>
            <li> Two features that are very beneficial for both backpacking and camping first aid kits.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty much unusable after that...</li>
            <li> pretty much leaves no hair unreachable.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean and sharp too.</li>
            <li> They are pretty much useless.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it can really dig in under the skin as needed, springy but not difficult to pinch shut.</li>
            <li> Good for small splinters or ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I bought them to replace an old pair of Tweezerman splinter tweezers that had a true needle point.  </li>
            <li> My first concern prior to ordering was that these tweezers would not be strong enough to grasp the hairs because they are so fine.</li>
            <li> It seems like the pointy tips are just too sharp for me to use and is more like picking with a pin, rather than actually being able to hold the hair.  </li>
            <li> Nothing much to say other than great product if you have any type of facial hair needing to be removed (that&#x27;s all i use it for).</li>
            <li> bought this originally for eyebrows but a regular tweezer is be able to do the same job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very sharp precise fine tipped tool.</li>
            <li> I use a slanted tip tweezerman tweezer to easily grab stuff once it&#x27;s poking out enough after using these; the process works well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also if I catch a hair that has just begun to grow back under my skin, these will easily lift those out before it becomes a problem.</li>
            <li> There doesn&#x27;t end up being enough surface area sometimes to easily grab what your trying to take out.</li>
            <li> This is great for getting at those dark hairs before its obvious to the world that &amp;#34; yes I am a girl</li>
            <li> A good tweezer but the sharpness didn&#x27;t last long so need to buy too often, will not buy this one again</li>
            <li> The set is a little more pricey, but well worth it if these are going in your first aid kit.</li>
            <li> Also way better than using a single needle.  </li>
            <li> You have to hold it at a certain angle to pull them out.</li>
            <li> I got this thinking it would help with plucking large, clump hair follicles that develop in my beard.  </li>
            <li> Certainly, they are for adults only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> certain you keep the clear-plastic tube that covers the tips in the packaging.  </li>
            <li> I have another pair of slant tip tweezers (also tweezerman) that I use for certain things (like I said, these are my favorites</li>
            <li> The tip is super sharp and skinny, will grab on to the splinter for easy removal.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve been durable and, except for all the splinter tweezers I&#x27;ve had, extremely well-aligned -- suitable not just for stray hairs but lab work too.</li>
            <li> Work brilliantly, you do have to be careful with them as they are very sharp though.</li>
            <li> I think this tool is perfect to dig down to your ingrown hair and try to bring it above your skin surface and then use another pair of tweezers to actually pull it.</li>
            <li> Handle has wide area that makes it very easy to hold steady.</li>
            <li> Tweezer has very fine pointed tip and is sharp, not to be used by children.  </li>
            <li> Incredibly fine point makes removing the smallest hair possible.</li>
            <li> However, there are problems with having tweezers with such fine tips.  </li>
            <li> This is my first tweezerman tweezer, and it is a lot better than any other tweezer I have owned.</li>
            <li> I can only see these eyelashes with a flashlight, they&#x27;re so fine.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend these to anyone who wants a high quality tweezer at a very reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> Just like my title says above, this is awesome for getting out those tough to reach hairs.</li>
            <li> Tweezers for very well, great for the tiny little hairs that you don&#x27;t want and/or getting a splinter.  </li>
            <li> It was tough to initially take the plunge, but now I know why they cost so much, they&#x27;re made perfectly for the job they do.  </li>
            <li> Overall they&#x27;re not a bad purchase, just don&#x27;t expect anything special as far as tricky ingrown hairs are concerned.</li>
            <li> The fine tip makes it easy to remove small splinters.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t really an Amazon flaw that I can see - this is a packaging problem straight from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> They work well, but they are very shap/pointy.</li>
            <li> It works really well</li>
            <li> It is capable of drawing blood if you use it incorrectly.</li>
            <li> Thanks to all of the Amazon.com reviewers out there that help everyone make informed buying decisions.</li>
            <li> These tweezers really get the job done.  </li>
            <li> Works very well</li>
            <li> maybe even the whole collection.</li>
            <li> They are supposed to be made of Stainless Steel yet the tips bent like Aluminum?</li>
            <li> I might be trying to tweeze, between those really well-honed edges.  </li>
            <li> found that if I could work them just so on a hair of sufficient girth, without applying too much pressure, that I could still yank it.</li>
            <li> I sent the tweezers back to Tweezerman for a free sharpening and $5 realignment to see if it would make any difference.</li>
            <li> They can puncture the skin, I suppose, but that is really about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done laser hair removal, but they are light enough that it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> ; RUBIS &amp;#34; If you want a real tweezer spend the money for</li>
            <li> :B000EMYHA8 Tweezerman  Stainless Steel Ingrown Hair Splintertweeze]]</li>
            <li> She really likes them because she can pull the tiniest of hairs.</li>
            <li> That is where the product really shined.</li>
            <li> About 5-6mm would really make a difference for the purposes i am using them for.</li>
            <li> very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I was trying to remove ingrown hairs with cheap tweezers from the local drug store!</li>
            <li> it works really well.</li>
            <li> I am very relieved to have the hairs gone.</li>
            <li> which absolutely effects accuracy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find myself using these as much as I thought I would.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really beat this product when it comes to price and performance.</li>
            <li> really wish i hadnt bought these.</li>
            <li> I really like these tweezers.</li>
            <li> These Tweezers work very well for ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> they really do the trick.  </li>
            <li> I really like these tweezers.</li>
            <li> THEY ARE VERY POINTY.</li>
            <li> When I tried harder, they would cut the skin, cause bleeding and make more harm.</li>
            <li> If you suffer from light to coarse ingrown hair on your face like side burns or on the chin</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this tweezer!</li>
            <li> but since these tweezers have pointy ends it is much faster and easier.</li>
            <li> Shipment is really fast.</li>
            <li> They sharpened for free and sent them back as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a pair for a year, and for the price, I expected this to hold up better.</li>
            <li> I expected Tweezerman to produce a better quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them for much hair tweezing because the tips don&#x27;t have any grip.</li>
            <li> but since these tweezers have pointy ends it is much faster and easier.</li>
            <li> However there are a few issues that keep me from loving it...    </li>
            <li> And the metal of the tips is just rough enough to get a good grip without serrations.</li>
            <li> Tweezers aren&#x27;t the most expensive products you can buy, so for $14.99 I kind of expect a quality product that gets the job done.    </li>
            <li> The needle tips line up right on with one another very well, and it comes with a little protective cap to make sure no one drops it on their foot when it&#x27;s not being used.</li>
            <li> The points come to a sharp and very precise end.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been considering them but really didn&#x27;t think they would be that much better than other methods of getting out ingrown hairs -</li>
            <li> so* sharp, which should be a good thing, but the tips bent the second time I used them!  </li>
            <li> The sharp tip means more precision when plucking any hairs, I&#x27;ve stopped using regular blunt tweezers as they are not as quick and easy to use, would definitely reccomend</li>
            <li> These are great because they are so narrow at the tip, they can go directly to the hair just barely popping out of the skin and remove it without a mark.</li>
            <li> I have had my original pair for 15 (!)</li>
            <li> They are too brittle to bend back without torching them first, just be sure to protect the yellow rubber coating, or re-dip them if you&#x27;re inclined.</li>
            <li> Other tweezers cost more and don&#x27;t even work as well...</li>
            <li> Compared to other tweezers I have from a drug store, this gives a better precision.  </li>
            <li> I have updated this review (from two stars) as I can do much better &#x27;work&#x27; with virtually any other quality tweezers.</li>
            <li> I was very careful making sure I put the cap on when I was done</li>
            <li> did it take us so long to find these tweezers--they are simply extraordinary!</li>
            <li> But once you get the precision down these are  another great item as expected from Tweezerman.  </li>
            <li> The tweezerman only meets for a short length at the tiny tips, so I often can&#x27;t get get the gripping area precisely applied on a longer hair.</li>
            <li> They have a very fine point and require little effort to compress.</li>
            <li> Finally found the perfect tweezers for those coarse, hard to pull ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> These have a nice point but they are not as small at the tip as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li> If you need regular tweezers, look into the other Tweezerman products, such as the slant end type, which have the same high quality and excellent warranty.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you keep the plastic cap for the tip to keep them sharp and avoid accidental puncture wounds!</li>
            <li> These tweezers are VERY sharp and seem like they&#x27;d be great at removing ingrown hairs, however they perform about as well at removing tough-to-get hairs as my other Tweezerman tweezers.</li>
            <li> They work great and have sharp ends that help pull out ingrown hairs vs the typical tweezers with blunt ends.</li>
            <li> I love these they are very sharp</li>
            <li> Since my acquisition of these I&#x27;ve gone to a whole new level.  </li>
            <li> However be careful with them because they are so pointy you can prick yourself quite easy</li>
            <li> I have purchased over a half dozen Tweezerman&#x27;s because I love them</li>
            <li> That being said, for whatever reason, I could not get the hang of using this particular pair of tweezers to remove ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> *the super pointy tips actually poked me quite a bit</li>
            <li> These are the ultimate tweezers - but you sure have to pay for ultimate!</li>
            <li> However, I was only able to use this product for a short time.  </li>
            <li> For $14.99 they had better last a while, dispite the occasional drop.</li>
            <li> The older</li>
            <li> This happened to us, but luckily I had already prepared for this and had an extra pair!  </li>
            <li> They are able to get those tiny hairs around the chin that are such a nuisance.</li>
            <li> (He&#x27;s happy, too, since I&#x27;m the idiot who always walks around barefoot, so this is a tool more for his use than mine.)</li>
            <li> The tweezers come to a very fine point, and are capable of pulling anything from small eyebrow hairs to splinters, and anything in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They work pretty well for most ingrown hair and grab the hair very firm.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> These are high quality tweezers.</li>
            <li> If you grab too high, the hair will break.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> this product is so high quality</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> We have a high quality glass magnifying glass we use, and then we hone in on the critter with these.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them and I trust Tweezerman</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman is a high quality tool.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have a bunch of those 99 cent twezers and they definately are not as high quality as these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Because the point is so sharp, you have to be careful not to jab yourself or you will be a good bit of bleeding</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if these would be fine enough for very delicate things, like removing splinters, but these tweezermans have such a fine point that you can literally penetrate your skin with the tip without feeling it.  </li>
            <li> I love that it came with a little cover to help protect the tips (I tend to be a bit butter-fingered, and</li>
            <li> I sometimes think that it should work a little bit better than it does</li>
            <li> My son was amazed the other day how easily the got out a splinter in his finger.  </li>
            <li> Just makes it an extremely easy, drama-free task unlike other -cheaper- tweezers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great pair of tweezers for for tiny little hairs that only you can see or feel.  </li>
            <li> and I think tweezerman has done a decent effort to live up to its job</li>
            <li> I am used to using a stainless steel surgical grade forcep and these are nowhere near that level.  </li>
            <li> After this they would not conform to their normal shape despite my efforts and would not tweeze anything.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is fairly difficult to get a good grip on hair with these, but that&#x27;s not what these are really for!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the extra $!</li>
            <li> I purchased them pretty much for such purpose.  </li>
            <li> Within a few minutes after receiving these tweezers I was able to get them pulled out.</li>
            <li> I was able to get a metal splinter out that I have had for a few months now...</li>
            <li> It does not work as well for fine hairs or fuzz, but there are other products for those.</li>
            <li> They never dull just require cleaning.</li>
            <li> Reading all the reveiws on this I was expecting needle sharp fine tip tweezers.</li>
            <li> They are fine to hold, sharp-tip, but I think I&#x27;m going to use them for projects and other stuff besides plucking my eyebrows; my hair and skin is just to oily for these things to grasp.</li>
            <li> product&#x27;s graphic yellow design makes it more eye-catching than your traditional stainless steel model.  </li>
            <li> They feel like quality from the moment you hold them, They have served their purpose in fishing cotton wick through very small coils with amazing</li>
            <li> Sharp and precise</li>
            <li> The two sharp tips to align precisely.  </li>
            <li> The sharp tips allows you to pierce the bump and force the hair free.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying a new one because I let mine fall</li>
            <li> I was looking for a pair of new fine-tipped tweezers and came across these.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind every 3 months buying a new pair then by all means make this purchase.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are very sharp and easy to use for removing ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t contacted tweezerman yet about a possible replacement since it&#x27;s only a lifetime sharpening for free.</li>
            <li> I love these little tweezers!</li>
            <li> The tweezers is very sharp, precise and high quality.</li>
            <li> Inspected thoroughly and I was surprised by the high quality for the price.</li>
            <li> , they work great for the little strays when you do your eyebrows, also for me at least if you end up with an ingrown hair when you shave your legs, these make it very easy to remove, the tips are sharp enough to penetrate a couple layers of skin if they need to.</li>
            <li> they arrived EXACTLY THE SAME WAY!</li>
            <li> I bought these tweezers because I had my first experience with what I believed to be in-grown hairs (looked like blackheads), following a series of bikini waxes and laser hair removal.  </li>
            <li> I have used these tweezers for years, and only repurchased them after I lost my first pair.</li>
            <li> It is tiny and was lost within the first two days.  </li>
            <li> These tweezers, combined with a jeweler&#x27;s loupe (because I&#x27;m old and can&#x27;t see as well as I used to!), allow me to pull out the tiniest splinters.</li>
            <li> With my first pair (the yellow), one of the tips was damaged and the tips could not grip correctly.  </li>
            <li> but I had to purchase the second one because I lost the first pair.</li>
            <li> Then the fine tip gets bent and becomes pretty useless rather quickly.</li>
            <li> There were more expensive models, greater precision not necessary for what i was doing.</li>
            <li> I would like to purchase a second pair for placing in first aid kit in our automobiles.</li>
            <li> Kind of sharp so be careful not to stab yourself.</li>
            <li> Even with a little bleeding these have done the job very quickly and without causing anymore damage to the surrounding skin.     </li>
            <li> These tweezers get used all over people and things, and are easily sanitized with a little rubbing alcohol or hand sanitizer.  </li>
            <li> This item is well constructed, cleans up easily and should last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to pull out hairs that were barely visible with little to no work.</li>
            <li> This thing is very sharp and accurate when trying to remove ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and precise.</li>
            <li> The tips are very sharp and allow for precise grabbing.</li>
            <li> Had my old ones 50 years and needed new ones.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re nice and sharp, but not so sharp that you&#x27;ll accidentally hurt yourself.</li>
            <li> That might not matter so much if you&#x27;re plucking a hair, but if you are trying to pick up just one tiny grain of dolomite among a tray of other tiny particles, most tweezers just can&#x27;t do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only difficulty is trying to grabbing the end of a longer hair out of a group on my bushy eyebrows (not normal edge plucking, which is fine.)</li>
            <li> Yes, we definitely have \\&quot;standard\\&quot; tweezers as well, for more typical tweezer types of activities.</li>
            <li> only downside is, you gotta be careful they kinda bend easily</li>
            <li> When I asked for clarification, they apologized, waived the fee entirely, and sent my tweezers back all nice and sharp!</li>
            <li> They are great for tight spaces like a blocked pore or scum in your trackball mouse.  </li>
            <li> This works for getting tiny, fine splinters out your fingers after working outside, or tiny hairs under eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> Just a word of warning, though, they are super sharp, so keep the plastic tip that comes with them.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Sometimes gripping hairs with it is hard because of the point.</li>
            <li> Super pointy and sharp.  </li>
            <li> The tip of my finest-tipped tweezers had gotten dull and my vision wasn&#x27;t getting any better, so</li>
            <li> Unlike standard tweezers these tweezers are pretty long and have a man sized large grip which may or may not be to your liking.  </li>
            <li> I know Tweezerman offers a free sharpening service (I have included the web address under \\&quot;comments\\&quot;), but sometimes you don&#x27;t need complete sharpening...just a little adjustment.</li>
            <li> in addition to all the run-of-the-mill less expensive tweezers that can be found at drugstores, I now own three types of too sharp Tweezerman tweezers (recommended by various beauty experts as being the best) that will rip up my skin without removing facial hair -- especially stray eyebrow hairs -- or splinters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you keep them clean and off the floor they should last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I bought these tweezers to replace my old Tweezerman Splintertweeze tweezers.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s problematic, because you are supposed to remove ingrown completely --</li>
            <li> I tried using it to yank arm hairs, leg hairs, chest hairs, face hairs, even back hairs and the \\&quot;bikini line\\&quot; (too much information?</li>
            <li> Before buying these I would sometimes have to use a straight pin along with regular tweezers to access the ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> I just replaced mine that was over 20 years old.</li>
            <li> So when I had to replace some old tweezers I bought these.</li>
            <li> Its easier than ever to get the most minute hair/pimple/flaw with these suckers.</li>
            <li> It must of been an old style.</li>
            <li> They are like harpoons and really help get deep when you need to</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> that first I have to slightly free the hair from the surrounding skin using a needle or other sharp</li>
            <li> And this is usually NOT a simple procedure, despite the fact that we have a whole arsenal of tweezers around the house.  </li>
            <li> There is a protective cap, but I think you&#x27;re most likely to drop them while your hands are wet, possibly just out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I ordered a replacement set from Amazon and so far those are working well,</li>
            <li> This is because only the very TIP of the tweezers come together--from there, they bow out--making it difficult to get a good grip.  </li>
            <li> I going to have use a sharping stone or something to sharpen them back up other than they work good to pull the little hairs out.</li>
            <li> They come in there own little plastic \\&quot;case\\&quot; with rubber tip cover to keep them sharp.</li>
            <li> Make sure to be careful with these tweezers because they are sharp, but will uncover the hair and allow you to retrieve the hair.</li>
            <li> These are full size tweezers, a bit longer than what I typically see sold in the drug store.  </li>
            <li> These are super sharp, so keep the tip protector on there!  </li>
            <li> the few times that i thought it would come in handy (small hair that was pushed into skin), it didnt really help.</li>
            <li> The tips are not nearly as pointed (too wide to use precisely) or as flush (won&#x27;t grasp well).</li>
            <li> but it has some work left (for sure in the amateur) --</li>
            <li> There were some posts indicating that it was not pointy enough compared to an older model.  </li>
            <li> Every other pair of tweezers will go right in the trash after you use these.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone especially if you get ingrowns from waxing or sugaring.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything for facial hair removal and nothing no matter how high tech or costly</li>
            <li> However, if you are bleeding, make sure you stop that first because I have found these tend to lose grip when the hair and or tweezers are a little slick from blood.</li>
            <li> The tweezers worked great while they lasted, however after a few months use the tips aren&#x27;t nearly as sharp and the ends bent slightly</li>
            <li> only complaint about the product is i wish they naturally were more expanded in the &amp;#34;open&amp;#34; position.</li>
            <li> Tweezer forceps don&#x27;t line up so not good for most jobs.</li>
            <li> Although these are more expensive than your regular run of the mill tweezers, they are definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> A very useful and oddly under-used piece of a medical kit.</li>
            <li> Not hard, just enough to rub and straighten those points.</li>
            <li> be very careful, be very precise and be very narrow in the width to pick (in fact a high price with mm.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have mentioned, the tips are very sharp (they come with a cap for safety), so they can hone right in on a single lash (or ingrown hair) quite easily.  </li>
            <li> and they last a long time and they are pretty good too specially to get those little tiny difficult hairs from your face.</li>
            <li> one drop on a hard surface and you have misaligned the tips and most likely ruined it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had the travel sized Tweezerman set and didn&#x27;t know how much the larger set actual worked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my third set of these tweezers in five months (one yellow, two stainless steel).  </li>
            <li> If you have trouble with such a precise tool than maybe it isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> I have had the Ingrown Tweezers from Tweezerman before and they were very pointed, thin and precise.  </li>
            <li> After a few tries with the tweezerman, I was able to get the hair out.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a lot of trouble when the sharpness gets used up so quickly.</li>
            <li> This new pair of Tweezerman splinter tweezers do not have a needle point; the tweezer&#x27;s point is squared off so they are not sharp enough to pierce the skin and grab ingrown hairs.     </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, especially around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> No other store carries one so pointed at the end,</li>
            <li> The Greek half is why I am super hairy.</li>
            <li> I purchased these from Amazon - at less than half of the local price for the same product from the same maker - and am very pleased with them.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I suffered along all my life with the clumsy tweezers available in drug stores: which are like using salad tongs for tweezer needs, compared to these.</li>
            <li> But the tips barely touch</li>
            <li> I had an ingrown that was several months old and</li>
            <li> after having developed the might-work light-touch-and-magic-incantation technique described above.</li>
            <li> I bought a second set for my frequent out of town trips...</li>
            <li> I paid nearly twice this price locally to get these, and I now have 3 pairs: 1 for the bathroom, 1 for my purse</li>
            <li> but I do understand that manufacturers can only go so far.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only used these twice.</li>
            <li> Wow never knew there was such a thing out there</li>
            <li> I actually like these ones better than all the other tweezerman styles (which are all more expensive!).</li>
            <li> Its been about 4 months of a lot of use, and they are not as sharp as they originally were, but that is expected with any tweezers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap for tweezers, but this purchase was worth it.</li>
            <li> However, it is not suitable as a primary pair of tweezers or for people who are, like me, a little clumbsy or ham handed (you know who you are ;)).</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was on a quest to find the perfect tweezer for my job (petroleum geology), as it&#x27;s all but impossible to find a tweezer that can stand up to rough daily use, especially with the precision that these have to offer.  </li>
            <li> I needed a good set of tweezers to weed out the unwanted vinyl from cut designs, and the sharp point on these tweezers work perfectly, especially with very complex designs.</li>
            <li> We live in a fairly rural area and our back yard seems to be a haven for ticks.</li>
            <li> Since the tips are so fine it can sometimes be hard to grasp those properly</li>
            <li> They are sharp, and they will dig into your skin, but unless you get a hair exactly in their very,very tiny grip, you will just have a hole in your face and the hair will still be there.  </li>
            <li> The fine tweezers in the petite set are sharper than these yellow suckers.</li>
            <li> I also follow up with a flat tweezer to remove the hair completely.  </li>
            <li> But for cases where you need precise control, or you need to go into a very small area, these are just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are sharp, and can dig in and grip hairs hiding under the skin without inflicting too much collateral damage.</li>
            <li> They are extremely precise, not quite needle sharp but certainly sharp enough, and they work wonders.</li>
            <li> In addition, if or when they become dull, you can send the tweezers back to the company and they&#x27;ll resharpen them for free of charge.  </li>
            <li> Tweezerman supposedly provides free sharpening and once my third pair becomes dull</li>
            <li> the tip is not sharp enough!!!</li>
            <li> and none seemed to last very long or allow me to get ahold of my fine facial hairs that grow wild where I least expect them to be.</li>
            <li> I would got with the traditional slant style tweezer in general.</li>
            <li> The ends are very close to each other in the resting open position.</li>
            <li> like this product so much that I will buy other Tweezerman products in the future.</li>
            <li> My first go with these made me nervous--but after a few hairs, I got the hang of them.</li>
            <li> The tips will slowly bend if you use them a lot, to the point where you have to find a sweet spot to grip the hairs.</li>
            <li> The super sharp tips of the tweezers, bend easily, and break off, making it somewhat unusable, and unable to grab more difficult hairs.</li>
            <li> I idiotically purchased these Tweezerman tweezers because two I already have are useless at removing my very fine eyebrow hairs along with splinters from the plants in my front yard that are native to the Southwest</li>
            <li> This particular model has precision ground sharp points, which are designed to penetrate the skin&#x27;s surface and pull out ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> well built, very sturdy, very sharp.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that the points are VERY sharp, so they can cut the skin pretty deeply, causing scabbing and possibly scars.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty and very sharp tweezers manage to grab quite accurately</li>
            <li> the sharp tips actually seemed really ineffective when I used them compared to a flat tipped pair.</li>
            <li> As a lady interested in keeping her eyebrows tame, I had always had regular Tweezerman slanted tweezers.  </li>
            <li> These tweezers are not any better than regular tweezers, it is very difficult to get them to grab the hair, the only thing i accomplished with them is some unwanted cuts and bleeding from trying to grab ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Very well made and you wont regret spending a little on these.</li>
            <li> They are precisely cut, and if dropped on the point it will break or at the very least bend.</li>
            <li> Rarely it may break the hair, or you may have a hair that&#x27;s hard to grasp(usually because it&#x27;s very short).    </li>
            <li> Some things take high precision tweezers that are very sharp.</li>
            <li> For those who are new to in-grown hairs like me, my technique was essentially to scrape at the black head of infected hair, and actually stick these tweezers in the hair follicle and grab until I got a hold of something and then pull.  </li>
            <li> They are very fine-pointed and sharp, so be careful, but it definately does the job.</li>
            <li> My regular flat tweezers were not pointed enough to grab them.   </li>
            <li> I searched for something that was very thin to put under the stitch to be able to take out.</li>
            <li> But the last few years, this particular tweezer does not work for me.  </li>
            <li> purchased the Tweezerman tweezers based on mostly positive reviews, but I was not able to use them for ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> which seems to be a frequent problem with other brands I have tried.  </li>
            <li> They seem to work pretty well but over time they do become dull.</li>
            <li> Just be careful you don&#x27;t drop them like I did as the tips are so thin they get easily bent, but they work</li>
            <li> *was not able to use long enough to really find positives  Cons  *</li>
            <li> You do not have to press excessively to get results, just gentle pressure.</li>
            <li> - just can&#x27;t grab the occasional overly long hair muutant hair out of a cluster.</li>
            <li> trick is to use the flat area of the tweezer, located just \\&quot;before\\&quot; the tips are tapered into points;  </li>
            <li> It deflected the tips a little when I need to get repaired or buy a new one</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more than a little frustrating.</li>
            <li> I ordered the \\&quot;Splintertweeze\\&quot; and within 5 minutes of opening the package, I was able to remove that irritating little splinter that I thought was going to be a permanent attachment.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve accidentally poked myself with the sharp point, but would highly recommend these to any one determined to get that hair the other tweezers won&#x27;t pull</li>
            <li> the tips bend really easily making the tweezers totally useless.</li>
            <li> The tips are so tiny and precise that it can be difficult to get a grip sometimes</li>
            <li> The only negative really is the cost, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> , they worked on my boyfriend and he has some really course and thick facial hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased these tweezers to get to those tiny little eyebrow hairs (I am not blessed with thick eyebrows) and my little hairs defy most tweezers.  </li>
            <li> Instead of the ends tapering to a point, though, they were squared off blunt far enough up the prongs, that it made it impossible to do any sort of fine work under the skin.</li>
            <li> These have really sharp tips, so don&#x27;t have general purpose use (don&#x27;t use them around your eyes).</li>
            <li> Either my hair was too deep to pluck or the tweezer isn&#x27;t sharp enough to get it.  </li>
            <li> Let me open this review by stating that my experience with these tweezers and a similar model (also described) is not typical of the tweezerman products I&#x27;ve bought and used in the past.</li>
            <li> Point is too thick and not able to grasp a fine hair.</li>
            <li> but then again who wants dull tweezers?</li>
            <li> but you hardly ever really need it.</li>
            <li> These are so sharp and thin at the point that you can easily get under the skin and extract a hair with minimal puncture damage to the surface of the skin.  </li>
            <li> I have always sworn by Tweezerman, but it seems like the quality of their products has really been declining lately.  </li>
            <li> and it loses its sharpness fast</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if you can send them back to Tweezerman to be fixed?    </li>
            <li> Just be careful, I left it sitting out one day and accidentally punctured my finger with it, ouch!</li>
            <li> The have a long needle like tip that allow you to get into the skin without digging like a needle has you do.</li>
            <li> I also can&#x27;t imagine how a product like this would stand up long term.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Color is loud but you won&#x27;t misplaced them.</li>
            <li> make it improve a long way - I would pay the inc. in price too)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why it took me so long to find these.  </li>
            <li> I wound up having to take a needle to my hand, and now my shredded fingers are all bandaged up with about 6 minor splinters still in there.</li>
            <li> Wish I had found these a long time ago.</li>
            <li> only caveat is that you need to be careful with the tip.</li>
            <li> These were a complete waste of time and money for me and added nothing to the process of digging out an ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> My first problem was that after every in-grown hair was removed, there was a tell-tale scab left behind.  </li>
            <li> These work great for getting the hairs out without making a bloody mess.</li>
            <li> Sometimes normal tweezers are just not precise enough to grab their pinhead-sized little bodies.</li>
            <li> A little about me, 30 year old male half Greek and half American.</li>
            <li> I purchased these tweezers to remove slivers and other tiny things embedded in my extremities.  </li>
            <li> Unless the tweezers come to a sharp point, forget about getting the object out without digging a big hole around it.</li>
            <li> For an item that ended up being the same as your department or drugstore offering, it was expensive and nothing more than ordinary.</li>
            <li> a hair too short for other tweezers to get and or too ingrown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> relied on reviews from various sites, including Amazon, when deciding whether to buy these, as I did with the other Tweezerman products.</li>
            <li> Due to the sharpness, I have poked myself several times.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunate for me, I landed about 30 splinters the other day, and as I was removing the second one, I dropped the tweezers!  </li>
            <li> After constantly pinching myself with other tweezers these seem like a god send.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m probably a life long fan now!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use them for other projects as the tip bend easy and then they are useless for what they are designed for.</li>
            <li> Never have these usually painful processes been so easy, simple and actually painless.</li>
            <li> It seems sharp enough to do whatever I need to do so far - taking out a small piece of wood from my kid&#x27;s palm and shaping my eyebrow.  </li>
            <li> The design and construction of the tips is not fine, nor rigid enough to provide a solid pinch on a hair, so it doesn&#x27;t serve the purpose that I purchased it for.  </li>
            <li> The tips are intentionally not needle sharp - you can tell the needle tips were ground flat after the alignment process.</li>
            <li> These are one hell of a sharp bastards, so you&#x27;ll need to be extra careful when your body parts are on the business end of those tweezers.</li>
            <li> I then tried to use a pin and found the old fingers did not like to hold the small pin.</li>
            <li> Academic research and common sense indicate that ingrown hairs should be left alone or treated medically.</li>
            <li> Kind of dangerous...!</li>
            <li> They can tease down under the skin and get those curled hairs back out again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Always put the little plastic protective cap back on after use to keep them as sharp as possible.</li>
            <li> They are excellent at removing ingrown and small hairs which would otherwise be impossible to get without leaving a gaping hole behind.</li>
            <li> I found this out in the process of digging out a particularly deep ingrown hair -- I was just about to pop it out when I squeezed it with the tweezers to yank it -- but instead of yanking it up over the skin, it cut it in half, even deeper than it was before.</li>
            <li> Dug a deep sliver out with a lot less blood and gore than using a pin.</li>
            <li> Who knows, but they were expensive to break and not function so quickly.</li>
            <li> The ends appose reasonably well but are bowed slightly so in order to grasp a hair you need to squeeze fairly hard</li>
            <li> This is common for men who shave with straight razors and this very sharp tweezer does the job as well as any tweezer I have used.</li>
            <li> The only thing you have to be careful of when you use them is that they are very sharp.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned tweezers that worked so well and were machined with such tight tolerances.</li>
            <li> the tweezers would act like scissors and cut it leaving little hair left for me to grab.</li>
            <li> Occasionally, the tip will slip and cut whatever you are trying to pinch, but if you put just a little cross-pressure as you pinch, it will work without a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has trouble grasping very fine hair, and if you are not careful, you can poke yourself which is painful because these tweezers are very sharp.</li>
            <li> Hold it flat against your skin to obtain results, but be careful not to point the end, very sharp.</li>
            <li> They make all my old tweezers seem as dull as a butterknife.</li>
            <li> After a few months though, the tips started getting dull and now they aren&#x27;t really grippy anymore.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the paint is starting to chip/scrape away.</li>
            <li> I finally had to stop using it altogether after I misused the tweezers to retrieve something at the bottom of a narrow bottle and the tips bent.     </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re liable to get stabbed if you do</li>
            <li> Dissappointed that I spent this money.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to drop these though...</li>
            <li> As a result they sometimes will clip part of the hair, making it shorter and harder to pull out.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done but the pointy edge is not durable which is to be expected.</li>
            <li> Be careful though-</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t dare use it for its stated purpose because it&#x27;s liable to cut the ingrown hair or splinter in just the way that makes them burrow for bone like a tree root towards water.</li>
            <li> Just be careful re:</li>
            <li> I get the harder it is to see and grab them and</li>
            <li> It is what I had expected.</li>
            <li> Once they are out you can then use regular tweezers to pull the hair out if you are having trouble using these - and this helps save the tips of these</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of money on products that were junk.  </li>
            <li> If you have round and slant tip tweezers but some short hair get missed then this is the tweezer for the job.</li>
            <li> so be careful</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s enough of a hassle that I ordered a pair of Tweezerman&#x27;s slanted-cut tweezers to do the \\&quot;heavy lifting\\&quot; plucking, and will use these for the precision work (that is, isolating the hair or splinter or bullet fragment.)</li>
            <li> The only downside is the tips tend to get bent after a few months rolling around in my cosmetic bag.</li>
            <li> so be careful or you will cut yourself.  </li>
            <li> The design allows you to carefully pluck just that one hair that&#x27;s messing up the line of your brow.</li>
            <li> tweezerman&#x27;s for a few years and finally decided to try the ingrown hair ones.</li>
            <li> there a little expensive, but worth the price!</li>
            <li> I pinch the yellow pointy ones together, then grab the shaft and slide the other pair up and off the tip a few times.</li>
            <li> Along with proper exfoliating before shaving, I&#x27;ve had to use these tweezers less and less</li>
            <li> The only problem is, because its so thin at the tip, it doesn&#x27;t last that long.  </li>
            <li> Be careful they are sharp.  </li>
            <li> The sharp pointy bit removes ingrown hair with ease, just be careful not to prick or bruise your self.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do be careful as they are sharp.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman tweezers out of the box is as sharp as a needle, so be careful.  </li>
            <li> Not really much that I can say about this product other then the fact that it does its job.</li>
            <li> Have to be careful you don&#x27;t poke an eye out, they are really sharp.</li>
            <li> Just be careful of the sharp points when you use them.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re decent, but not great.</li>
            <li> The tip is almost needle thin, I do not recommend these tweezers  unless you have a fairly steady hand.</li>
            <li> I sent it in to tweezerman with a note describing the problem in detail the problem and $5 for them to bend the thing back into shape if they could tell that&#x27;s what was causing the trouble -- but it came back with my $5 check intact, a little sharper for the trouble.</li>
            <li> The toe is too thick and not sharp.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a problem with the tweezers&#x27; sharpness or their ability to grab things, but I&#x27;d recommend keeping close track of the plastic cap that covers the sharp ends.</li>
            <li> They are extremely sharp and have an almost surgical precision to them.  </li>
            <li> These are not as sharp and pointed as my other tweezerman tweezers were.</li>
            <li> The makers claim that the ends are sharp but they are squared off.  </li>
            <li> Sharp points get under the skin too if u have to &amp;#34;dig.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> The tip on the one I recieved had one square sided tip and the other was pointed.      </li>
            <li> The tweezers themselves did the job as advertised, unfortunately after using them for the first time I placed them on the counter, washed my face and in the process of grabbing my towel</li>
            <li> Every other style of tweezer -- point end, slant end, body tweezer</li>
            <li> the sharp points on these.</li>
            <li> No more second guessing if you \\&quot;got\\&quot; that ingrown hair or that splinter.    </li>
            <li> so they stay the necessarily sharp.</li>
            <li> Comes with a cap to keep the points sharp.</li>
            <li> They also hold their shape (i.e. they don&#x27;t bend) like other tweezers do.  </li>
            <li> I thought that these tweezers were ultra sharp...</li>
            <li> I used regular tweezers to try to get a small piece of glass out of my daughters foot</li>
            <li> they are sharp</li>
            <li> They are so pointed and sharp at the ends that they will get out any ingrown hair you have with ease, and the ends DO NOT bend</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is another one of those times when you search Amazon first for a &#x27;difficult to find&#x27; product.</li>
            <li> (the other tweezer man set I got</li>
            <li> The tip is quite sharp which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> THEY ARE SHARP.</li>
            <li> Extracted ingrowns easier than any other way I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> They are so sharp they will even pull blackheads out.  </li>
            <li> They are vey sharp so use caution when poking around your skin.</li>
            <li> This little piece of tool works wonders on little tiny splinters to get.</li>
            <li> Because they are so pointy and sharp, keep them where a child can&#x27;t reach.</li>
            <li> I will use THOSE other tweezers and slide them up the points (while pinched together) to help reshape and align them.</li>
            <li> Their other tweezers got 5-stars from me.  </li>
            <li> In the past, I&#x27;ve used a needle for ingrown hairs or regular tweezers.</li>
            <li> These things are SHARP and will stab through any fabric or plastic sleeve you try to put them in (you wouldn&#x27;t want to just toss these into a purse without the end cap).</li>
            <li> Using them may require some practice only because the tips are sharp and small pitch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are tough tweezers I use to open open wounds and get out whatever is buried under my skin.</li>
            <li> The tweezers feel very heavy duty, and I tested by pulling several ingrown hairs, they did well.</li>
            <li> I will warn you to be careful since the ends of the tweezerman are very sharp.</li>
            <li> I will warn you to be careful since the ends of the tweezit  are very sharp.</li>
            <li> My only complaint (and the only reason I gave the tweezers 4 stars vs. 5) is the same one that others have made--it can be difficult to grasp the hair or lash and get enough hold on it to pull it out.  </li>
            <li> Even though the points are very sharp and slender, they do not bend like other tweezers that I have had.  </li>
            <li> Very sharp, be careful with these!</li>
            <li> I would probably have less scarring from digging out ingrown hairs with other needles/tweezers.    </li>
            <li> and I do way less damage to my neck with these vs other techniques I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I found that the precision description of these tweezers was hard for me personally to use in reality  </li>
            <li> Years ago only sold by select dealers and hard to get.</li>
            <li> Have to press extra hard to grab hair.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is the plastic tip guard thing that comes with them to protect the points.  </li>
            <li> It is what it is, but its not worth the price.</li>
            <li> You can literally get every single little hair with this thing!</li>
            <li> I was let down by this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These are SHARP!</li>
            <li> Tweezers like these should be kept away from little ones, as the points are needle sharp.  </li>
            <li> so sharp!</li>
            <li> But other times, it breaks the hair and even causes bleeding if you have sensative skin!  </li>
            <li> perhaps a little too sharp.</li>
            <li> Extremely percise!</li>
            <li> Very sharp and sometimes cut the hair you&#x27;re attempting to pull</li>
            <li> These tweezers are very sharp.</li>
            <li> Very sharp points.</li>
            <li> This is a *very* sharp and pointed tweezer.</li>
            <li> The tips are very sharp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i have no had trouble plucking with them (they aren&#x27;t just sharp and pokey)</li>
            <li> Very sharp...</li>
            <li> People need to use caution when using these tweezers, they are very sharp.</li>
            <li> Provide a sharp access to ingrown hairs and extracts with a firm grip.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are definitely very sharp so use with care.</li>
            <li> They are very very sharp</li>
            <li> Very sharp and serves well for both splinters and ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> These get the job done and are very sharp for getting out splinters.</li>
            <li> Very sharp needle-like tip</li>
            <li> tip arrived pushed through the package, slightly bending/blunting them</li>
            <li> I agree with the previous reviewer...</li>
            <li> That they were too blunt to break the skin without serious clawing didn&#x27;t especially matter, because they were also misaligned</li>
            <li> Less than a week</li>
            <li> Stop buying your typical store tweezers</li>
            <li> Splinters that are slightly under the skin are also not a problem.  </li>
            <li> However, now that I&#x27;ve been using the tweezers for a month or so, this is much less of a problem.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first about spending $10 on a pair of tweezers, coming from spending less than a couple of dollars for past tweezers</li>
            <li> I went crazy with them the first time i used them and had a bit of blood in a couple spots, i looked picked</li>
            <li> It was magic even on prickly pear needles that are as thin as a fiber of fiberglass (and just as uncomfortable to get under your skin!)</li>
            <li> Either I don&#x27;t know how to use these bad boys or my hair is just SUPER stubborn.</li>
            <li> If a small floor collision can bend the tips that much, common use of the tweezers for ingrown hairs or splinters would cause similar damage over an extended period of time.    </li>
            <li> I hope I got mine as sharp as they&#x27;re supposed to be though because the shield was pierced and the tweezers were poking out past them.</li>
            <li> As tweezers they fall a little</li>
            <li> I realize the tips have to come to a point to pull splinters or small hairs, but these ended up being a little too sharp.  </li>
            <li> 2 - These are REALLY sharp; the little plastic cap this comes with is not good enough to protect you if somehow you push it on too hard...    </li>
            <li> /&gt;Do keep the little end cap and replace it on the tip when not in use as these tweezers are veryyy sharp!!</li>
            <li> These are precision tweezers with long thin sharp points.</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly facial hairs</li>
            <li> The too is not as expected, and hard to use.</li>
            <li> THe needle tweezers are pointy and a tad hard to get closed 100%.</li>
            <li> Rather it sort of pokes a hole and causes unnecessary bleeding and likely pain</li>
            <li> I used these tweezers for a few days before the tip bent and was unusable (tips would not connect and tweeze anything).  </li>
            <li> I often ruin my tweezers by dropping them, and it seems like each replacement pair I buy is worse than the last.  </li>
            <li> the end isnt round</li>
            <li> I am a bit clumsly and have dropped these a few times onto my slate floor.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> This is not the tweezers you use everyday - this one is meant to break the skin, like for an ingrown hair or for a splinter.  </li>
            <li> Buy this item for those ingrown hair problems you may have trouble with.</li>
            <li> The extremely narrow tips are prone to damage if used aggressively.</li>
            <li> If they don&#x27;t feel like they are grabbing, I use the tweezers to \\&quot;pinch\\&quot; a nail file a few times (I like the glass ones) and slide it off.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> The tips are precision ground and grip firmly.</li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> Buy this item for those ingrown hair problems you may have trouble with.</li>
            <li> VERY SHARP!</li>
            <li> Keep the plastic cover for the tips - they are very sharp!</li>
            <li> All the other tweezers broke the hair and/or left me with ugly red marks.  </li>
            <li> but this bad boy gets right in there and gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> it was way less money, too!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re replace a broken or \\&quot;soiled\\&quot; tool for a flat $5</li>
            <li> I use to use the little scissors attachment from a small swiss army knife.</li>
            <li> I use to use the little scissors attachment from a small swiss army knife.</li>
            <li> Hard to put these tweezers down.  </li>
            <li> After the bad experience, I swore off of Tweezerman because I had only had the yellow tweezers that warped for six weeks.  </li>
            <li> After several rounds of painfully mashing away at my face with Drug store tweezers and a sewing needle trying to get out tiny ingrown beard hairs, I got a pair of these.</li>
            <li> Sorry if this review is gross!</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted for picking up and holding small electronic componets for soldering.</li>
            <li> , that is when the ends slip past one another.  </li>
            <li> -- I&#x27;ve purchased from them in the past</li>
            <li> Also, the contact area when you have the tips pressed together is so small</li>
            <li> The tweezers come with a small rubber tip to use during storage</li>
            <li> but I was really disappointed in the quality of the first pair.  </li>
            <li> I bought my first Splintertweeze because I was sorely disappointed by a very dull pair of Point tweezers that I bought to replace my old ones, and now this new Splintertweeze is almost as bad as those Point tweezers were!  </li>
            <li> The tips of the tweezers are very sharp and thin, but still grab even the smallest hairs firmly.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these to anyone that needs to get an annoying foreign object causing pain or infection out from under your skin.</li>
            <li> In other words, unnecessary bleeding.</li>
            <li> The tip is sharp and thin.</li>
            <li> With the needle-like tips, it&#x27;s not great for any other tweezing unless you&#x27;re patient.</li>
            <li> The tips can be bent easily, so no prying with these!</li>
            <li> Not suitable for ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> Even though the tips are very small, the grip at the tips is very tight.</li>
            <li> What a waste, the tips are very thin and sharp</li>
            <li> &quot; tips made it hard to get hairs.</li>
            <li> but I found them hard to use even when working 100% as they should.  </li>
            <li> so I found out the hard way.</li>
            <li> It picks at really hard to get hairs.  </li>
            <li> These tweezers seem to have a hard to holding onto ingrown hairs on my neck.</li>
            <li> I have had a hard time trying to re-align the tips to my satisfaction.</li>
            <li> These tweezers can hardly pull out a hair that isn&#x27;t under the skin.</li>
            <li> Remember to keep the cover that comes with them to protect the tip, since one drop on the hard floor with ruin these.  </li>
            <li> After two months, the tips were dull and each and every hair that I pulled broke at the skin.  </li>
            <li> but mine seem to have gone dull after awhile.</li>
            <li> I have used these tweezers to get out splinters and hard to reach stubborn hairs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to pull the hair out</li>
            <li> I use them often and never have an issue with them getting dull.</li>
            <li> Being fairly clumsy</li>
            <li> It did -- now that the tweezers have been sharpened (at least the ends come to a point instead of being squared off), all it takes is the slightest contact between the two prongs to cause any hair on my body to go flying off.</li>
            <li> I have tons of ingrown hairs on my face, these have helped me take care of them with the least damage.</li>
            <li> (at least that was the case for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will never own another pair of tweezers owned by anybody.</li>
            <li> INconveniently enough--it was the middle of the night.  </li>
            <li> at least that&#x27;s what it felt like using them.</li>
            <li> THAT was a SHOCK and a gratifying appreciation for someone with my thick course</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think my skin is that thick</li>
            <li> have found no better tweezers anywhere!</li>
            <li> After cleaning thoroughly I also use it for removing those small splinters!</li>
            <li> Like the other reviewer, I found it difficult at times to pluck hairs using the needle-like tip of the tool.   </li>
            <li> In fact, I use their other tweezers to snag an ingrown hair after these FAIL to do so.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure which was worse, the hair bump, or the scab.  </li>
            <li> (chin hair emergencies can happen anytime, anywhere) and a spare pair in case the tips get bent (Tweezerman will sharpen and straighten tips for a very small fee).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is just incredibly annoying to have to keep purchasing new pairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> By the way, I bent it slightly and it is now useless.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> It is not good for that.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m going to have to find a dermatologist to get the thing out before it gets infected or painful without leaving a big scar.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve purchased numerous tweezers and have become frustrated at finding ones that did the job.  </li>
            <li> Not good or usable for splinters.  </li>
            <li> These tweezers are virtually worthless, other than to pierce the skin with their sharp points.  </li>
            <li> They can be dangerous though, so please be careful!</li>
            <li> but the sharp points made them dangerous to use on softer skin (ie, don&#x27;t pluck eyebrows with these).  </li>
            <li> The only downfall is that they are so delicate that if you drop them on their point they are worthless.  </li>
            <li> After a year, the tips get weak.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure what was wrong.</li>
            <li> Though, when I do get the hair it does pull it ALL the way out, for me its just tough getting there.</li>
            <li> The tips are very delicate, I did not use them often but they are warped.</li>
            <li> I purchased a pair of these tweezers to help me fix a very delicate gold chain necklace that had gotten tangled.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could find what they made in the past!!  </li>
            <li> I mean pierce-your-skin-if-you-want-to pointy!</li>
            <li> frustrating...    </li>
            <li> And it gets worse the closer to the point of the tweezers the hair is grabbed with.</li>
            <li> Not happy for the price or function.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m talking about five attempts before I give up and break out my blunt store brand with the poor grip.</li>
            <li> There are times that the larger base is helpful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these for over a year now, they haven&#x27;t broken, or dulled in their ability to grab hair.  </li>
            <li> I have to take breathers, though, because I get addicted to pulling out ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> And I hate even a tiny hair under my eyebrows (fussy, I know!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically like using a thin nail to dig the hair out or</li>
            <li> This tweezer has made the process of removing my boyfriend&#x27;s ingrown hairs less painful.</li>
            <li> But I do get occasional random slivers of random crap under my fingernails, in my finger tips, etc...</li>
            <li> Wow, they aren&#x27;t kidding--these are a splinter&#x27;s worst nightmare!  </li>
            <li> These will extract the tiniest little splinters or those nasty little cactus hairs with ease.  </li>
            <li> I hate that with other tweezers I&#x27;d sometimes pluck at skin and then look like I had a pimple...which I never do.</li>
            <li> When I just started however, this tweezer worked wonders in lifting those difficult hairs.</li>
            <li> and the product is practically useless.</li>
            <li> They are expensive but you probably will not need another pair... unless you want to have to tote them around.</li>
            <li> But I was unable to use them for my ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> The tweezers either cut or fail to grab the hair.</li>
            <li> I was almost finished when I noticed that it was the wrong size.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> The ends are so small that it seems impossible to grasp a hair (especially a thick beard hair on my husbands neck).  </li>
            <li> They are so pointy and delicate that any bump can disfigure them to be unusable :(  </li>
            <li> it is dangerous in the wrong</li>
            <li> DULL!!!</li>
            <li> I mean, they are just tweezers!!!</li>
            <li> You will not be sorry!</li>
            <li> You will not go wrong with this brand!</li>
            <li> not sure why the price has changed since I bought mine over a year ago (reviewed after using a while), but this price change seems insane.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s very difficult to grasp the hair to pluck it.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s difficult to grab any hair with these making them quite worthless.    </li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s gone from awkward to worthless and possibly dangerous.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I have bad chest acne</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well made also, I don&#x27;t foresee it going bad anytime soon.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Regardless of the quality of the material, the suggestion that these tweezers be used to extract ingrown hairs is bad medicine.</li>
            <li> If anyone has ever had a whisker or an eyebrow that has become stuck under your skin and becomes painful, or a splinter in your hand or finger, these will do the trick.  </li>
            <li> These are design for (painfully) &amp;#34;digging out&amp;#34; ingrown hair.  </li>
            <li> I was suffering with painful ingrown chin hairs that I could never seem to remove.</li>
            <li> buy these expecting them to fill all your tweezing needs, and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I get around 3 hairs on my lip &amp; chin that drive me crazy!  </li>
            <li> I was really disappointed.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It makes me mad and frustrated when its tweezing time!</li>
            <li> but...if you are like me and hate it when things don&#x27;t work like they should, you will appreciate these!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So annoying.  </li>
            <li> too bad!)</li>
            <li> I hated it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very frustrated</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed!  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I never have seen my boyfriend become possesive with any grooming tools before, but he hated for anyone else to use them!  </li>
            <li> Disgusting.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought a pair of these in store &amp; loved them - then dropped them and blunted the tip. Store no longer carries them so I ordered these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tip arrived pushed through the package, slightly bending/blunting them so they aren&#x27;t really great splinter type tweezers any more. I thought for sure it was a fluke and ordered another pair through Amazon - they arrived EXACTLY THE SAME WAY! This isn&#x27;t really an Amazon flaw that I can see - this is a packaging problem straight from the manufacturer. Awesome product but they ruin them with their own package.</li>
            <li> Love these tweezers!  Going to order me some more.  These have been the best ones I have ever owned and used!</li>
            <li> These tweezers are the prefect fineness I have been looking for. No other store carries one so pointed at the end, works great and priced good too.</li>
            <li> The week after these arrived I found my favorite tweezers, these work for what they say but the needle tip regular tweezermans work better overall for hairs, ingrown or not. I&#x27;m happy with the brand and product, especially after doing the math which drew to my attention I have had my original pair for 15 (!) years. They are a great value.</li>
            <li> I can tell based on the quality of this pair of tweezers that they are perfect for some people/situations.  That being said, for whatever reason, I could not get the hang of using this particular pair of tweezers to remove ingrown hairs.  It seems like the pointy tips are just too sharp for me to use and is more like picking with a pin, rather than actually being able to hold the hair.  The ends are so small that it seems impossible to grasp a hair (especially a thick beard hair on my husbands neck).  Rather it sort of pokes a hole and causes unnecessary bleeding and likely pain (though I did not attempt on myself).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is another great product from tweezerman, and I love the quality/feel of the tweezers, however we just don&#x27;t seem to find them applicable in our case.  Great for someone I&#x27;m sure, just not for us.</li>
            <li> Great tweezers for ingrown hairs. Very sharp and precise. Easy to use. Definitely recommend for anyone who needs tweezers for ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> As far as I&#x27;m concerned, these are the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used for ingrown hairs. It does not work as well for fine hairs or fuzz, but there are other products for those.</li>
            <li> To be totally honest, I decided on a more preventative approach than cure. I used a facial scrubber to (one of those facial washes with the grains) to lift the hairs after shaving. I did this twice a day. In order to prevent dryness, I had to use a moisturizer. Once I started to get rid of the in grown hairs, I started using the scrubber just once a day and continued to moisturize. When I just started however, this tweezer worked wonders in lifting those difficult hairs.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my first aid kit for splinters, etc... They&#x27;re better than all other brands, but not the best over all.    Fortunately, unlike the 1 and 2 star reviewers, I&#x27;m not cursed with scab-covered ingrown hairs all over my body. But I do get occasional random slivers of random crap under my fingernails, in my finger tips, etc... And when I do, I like to use the Tweezerman Petite Tweezer Set instead:    http://www.amazon.com/Tweezerman-Petite-Tweezer-Leather-Case/dp/B000WI1WAM/ref&#x3D;sr_1_6?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;s&#x3D;beauty&amp;qid&#x3D;1272973122&amp;sr&#x3D;8-6    The fine tweezers in the petite set are sharper than these yellow suckers. They are also more compact and come in a protective case that will keep the tips from getting bent. Two features that are very beneficial for both backpacking and camping first aid kits. The set is a little more pricey, but well worth it if these are going in your first aid kit.</li>
            <li> Nothing much to say other than great product if you have any type of facial hair needing to be removed (that&#x27;s all i use it for).</li>
            <li> These tweezers are just great!! Finally found the perfect tweezers for those coarse, hard to pull ingrown hairs. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought a 2 pack of \\&quot;Tweezerman\\&quot; it said you can send them back for life to get sharpened. I sent them 4-28. It&#x27;s now 7-4. Guess I&#x27;ll never get them.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman is a great company that I totally love and trust!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are SHARP! VERY SHARP! They definitely do the trick, I promise you! Along with proper exfoliating before shaving, I&#x27;ve had to use these tweezers less and less but they work well for those ingrown hairs you just can&#x27;t get rid of!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And remember, tweezerman sharpens your tools for free (all you have to pay for is shipping).</li>
            <li> I bought these tweezers because I had my first experience with what I believed to be in-grown hairs (looked like blackheads), following a series of bikini waxes and laser hair removal.  My only info on how to deal with them came from the internet.  I was very pleased that these tweezers helped me deal with the issue even though I had little to go on.  I didn&#x27;t have a problem with the tweezers&#x27; sharpness or their ability to grab things, but I&#x27;d recommend keeping close track of the plastic cap that covers the sharp ends. For those who are new to in-grown hairs like me, my technique was essentially to scrape at the black head of infected hair, and actually stick these tweezers in the hair follicle and grab until I got a hold of something and then pull.  Sorry if this review is gross!</li>
            <li> I used these tweezers for a few days before the tip bent and was unusable (tips would not connect and tweeze anything).  Pros  *was not able to use long enough to really find positives  Cons  *the sharp tips actually seemed really ineffective when I used them compared to a flat tipped pair. The \\&quot;needle thin\\&quot; tips made it hard to get hairs. I found that the precision description of these tweezers was hard for me personally to use in reality  *the super pointy tips actually poked me quite a bit and I gained a sort of Pavlovian aversion to using them  *while using them they fell about 2 feet from the bathroom mirror cabinet to the bathroom counter, bending the tips instantly. After this they would not conform to their normal shape despite my efforts and would not tweeze anything. I may take them up on the replacement but I found them hard to use even when working 100% as they should.  Some people may find great use of these, but prefer the flat tipped/tapered tweezers after using these briefly</li>
            <li> Like some of the other reviews, I , too have bought every tweezer in the drugstores trying to find the most perfect one that WORKS. These are the BEST tweezers ever: they hold the finest hair in their grip and pulls em out! Glad I spend the extra bucks.Well worth it.</li>
            <li> These tweezers take out the shortest, tiniest of hairs. When paired with my 15x magnification mirror there is not a stray eyebrow that is safe from being plucked! Just be careful, I left it sitting out one day and accidentally punctured my finger with it, ouch! Some reviewers say they have difficulty pulling/grabbing hair with these tweezers, but I never have a problem - I think the trick is to hold the tweezers more parallel to your face and pull in the direction of hair growth.   The price on amazon is really good too - I have seen it at big box stores for between $17 to $22, and currently on amazon it&#x27;s only $11! If you have amazon prime you can get free shipping and save yourself the gas it would have taken to drive to the store, win-win!</li>
            <li> The points allow you to work on exposing in-grown hair.  But the tips barely touch so it&#x27;s very difficult to grasp the hair to pluck it.  There are other Tweezerman products that are more effective but I didn&#x27;t see them for sale on Amazon.  Found one that works at Walgreens (purple coated).</li>
            <li> I purchased these tweezers to remove slivers and other tiny things embedded in my extremities.  Unless the tweezers come to a sharp point, forget about getting the object out without digging a big hole around it.</li>
            <li> This tweezer has the finest point of any tweezer I&#x27;ve ever used... It really does a good job when it&#x27;s time to get really thorough in your grooming and need to pick at really fine hairs... However there are a few issues that keep me from loving it...    1 - the point of this tweezers are fine and slender... in fact at times they are TOO fine... sometimes I end up cutting/breaking a hair instead of pulling it out which defeats its purpose and its frustrating...    2 - These are REALLY sharp; the little plastic cap this comes with is not good enough to protect you if somehow you push it on too hard...    And 3 - the tips are very easily bent, if you drop it and it happens to hit something it&#x27;s pretty much unusable after that... I&#x27;m not sure if you can send them back to Tweezerman to be fixed?    All in all these are a good buy but I would definitely advise buying more than one at a time so you always have a back-up...    Happy plucking</li>
            <li> I ordered these tweezers from Amazon. They arrived bent. Without any hassle, Amazon shipped a replacement.</li>
            <li> These are high quality tweezers. Thats about all I can say. They work well, but they are very shap/pointy.</li>
            <li> These are the ultimate tweezers - but you sure have to pay for ultimate! Yikes!</li>
            <li> bought this originally for eyebrows but a regular tweezer is be able to do the same job. could live without it for eyebrow purposes, its probably better for splinters etc...</li>
            <li> Good for extracting the hair under the skin, but the needle tips end up snapping the hair when you try to tweeze it out    So I use a combination, this to unlodge the hair, and another product to actually pull the hair out.</li>
            <li> I was very excited about this product, and Tweezerman products came highly recommended to me.  However, I was only able to use this product for a short time.  My first problem was that after every in-grown hair was removed, there was a tell-tale scab left behind.  I&#x27;m not sure which was worse, the hair bump, or the scab.  Secondly, I dropped the tweezers, and after that the precision tips did not meet perfectly, so I had to jimmy the ends a bit every time I used it.  I finally had to stop using it altogether after I misused the tweezers to retrieve something at the bottom of a narrow bottle and the tips bent.     In the end, I think this is probably a great tool for an \\&quot;emergency\\&quot; in-grown hair or in the hands of a professional.  However, it is not suitable as a primary pair of tweezers or for people who are, like me, a little clumbsy or ham handed (you know who you are ;)).</li>
            <li> If you too battle with those stubborn ingrown hairs then here is the answer! Make sure to be careful with these tweezers because they are sharp, but will uncover the hair and allow you to retrieve the hair. You will not be sorry!</li>
            <li> I agree with the previous reviewer... these tweezers are great to lift ingrown facial hair buried in the skin, because of their \\&quot;needle-like\\&quot; tips.  I also follow up with a flat tweezer to remove the hair completely.  When I tried to use this pair, the hair either broke, or I could not get a good grip.  That&#x27;s not a problem, and does not affect my rating for them... because they do their job.    My only regret is that I did not buy them years ago.  I would probably have less scarring from digging out ingrown hairs with other needles/tweezers.    Great buy</li>
            <li> These tweezers are the greatest idea! If anyone has ever had a whisker or an eyebrow that has become stuck under your skin and becomes painful, or a splinter in your hand or finger, these will do the trick.  The have a long needle like tip that allow you to get into the skin without digging like a needle has you do. You just need to make sure you sterilize them before and after you use them. My son was amazed the other day how easily the got out a splinter in his finger.  I would highly recommend these to anyone that needs to get an annoying foreign object causing pain or infection out from under your skin. These are reasonably price, and worth every penny of it.</li>
            <li> I Love this tweezer!!! It works really well and I am sure I will love this product for a very long time...especially with the lifetime guarantee!!!</li>
            <li> Very sharp and sometimes cut the hair you&#x27;re attempting to pull</li>
            <li> They work remarkable well and I do way less damage to my neck with these vs other techniques I&#x27;ve tried. They grip well, and hold onto wayward hairs with a penchant for vengeance. I&#x27;ve gone through a couple of these over the years, but they do hold up well. The tips will slowly bend if you use them a lot, to the point where you have to find a sweet spot to grip the hairs. They are too brittle to bend back without torching them first, just be sure to protect the yellow rubber coating, or re-dip them if you&#x27;re inclined.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are very sharp. Good for small splinters or ingrown hairs. Take care not to abuse them. The tips can be bent easily, so no prying with these!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best tweezer I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I&#x27;m an Esthetician and do a lot of waxing this product pretty much leaves no hair unreachable.  I purchased this years ago and it looks the same now as back then.</li>
            <li> These are over priced, they don&#x27;t work good. They tend to cut the hair rather than grasp and pull it out.</li>
            <li> Very pointy!  Great for getting a little deeper for those ingrown hairs.  Good quality.  I hope I got mine as sharp as they&#x27;re supposed to be though because the shield was pierced and the tweezers were poking out past them.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for removing ingrown hairs. It is the perfect tool, every single time. I have used these tweezers for years, and only repurchased them after I lost my first pair. Excellent product, also great price compared to retailers.</li>
            <li> This is by far the most impressive ingrown hair tweezer that I have ever used. The tip is perfectly pointed and equally sharp, which is required for precise removal. Perfect!!</li>
            <li> Great product for getting ingrown hairs or small thorns out. Very sharp points. Comes with rubber cover that is best to hang on to and replace onto tips to protect them from bending. Great product!</li>
            <li> Excellent for removing ingrown hairs. You have to be mindful of where you grab the hair though. If you grab too high, the hair will break. So, I learned to adjust my grip and grab the hair using the wider part of the tweezer and it works out fine. Because the point is so sharp, you have to be careful not to jab yourself or you will be a good bit of bleeding so I found out the hard way. I definately recommend them to anyone who has problems with ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> The best for removing ticks from a dog. Good for splinters too, but the design and quality makes it ideal for de-ticking. Not to mention the fab color.</li>
            <li> these tweezers are good for just about tweezing anything.........very precise and not much more i can say......they do what they&#x27;re supposed to do........the ONLY thing that could make them better is if they had a \\&quot;grippy\\&quot; section where you hold it........have found no better tweezers anywhere!</li>
            <li> The tweezers are perfectly aligned. The tips are intentionally not needle sharp - you can tell the needle tips were ground flat after the alignment process. This is not at all a problem, because the tips still easily get under the skin to get ingrown hairs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is fairly difficult to get a good grip on hair with these, but that&#x27;s not what these are really for! These are best used to get stuff that is under the skin to a point where a wider tipped tweezer can grab the thing and get it out. See, they are great at getting just under the skin and working items out from under the skin so they are poking out of the skin far enough so they can then be grabbed using a tweezer made for easy grabbing and pulling. I use a slanted tip tweezerman tweezer to easily grab stuff once it&#x27;s poking out enough after using these; the process works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy these expecting them to fill all your tweezing needs, and you won&#x27;t be disappointed. These fill a specific role very well, but are not as good at other tasks like easy grabbing and plucking.</li>
            <li> I bought these tweezers to replace my old Tweezerman Splintertweeze tweezers.  They are not the same at all.  The tips are not nearly as pointed (too wide to use precisely) or as flush (won&#x27;t grasp well). I have always sworn by Tweezerman, but it seems like the quality of their products has really been declining lately.  Being fairly clumsy I often ruin my tweezers by dropping them, and it seems like each replacement pair I buy is worse than the last.  I bought my first Splintertweeze because I was sorely disappointed by a very dull pair of Point tweezers that I bought to replace my old ones, and now this new Splintertweeze is almost as bad as those Point tweezers were!  I am sure that somebody who is used to drugstore tweezers would probably find these a nice upgrade, but if you&#x27;re used to Tweezerman quality, beware.  It ain&#x27;t what it used to be.</li>
            <li> These are definitely the best ones out there.  I had the original Tweezerman&#x27;s (which I paid TRIPLE the price for at a big box store), and they served me well for many years but the tips broke.  So I bought these yellow ones on Amazon, and they work fantastic, even better than the originals.  They get even the shortest, tiniest hair out.  Just a word of warning, though, they are super sharp, so keep the plastic tip that comes with them.  You&#x27;re liable to get stabbed if you don&#x27;t (I speak from experience).</li>
            <li> This is a *very* sharp and pointed tweezer. It is capable of drawing blood if you use it incorrectly. When not in use I keep the plastic tip cap on the tweezers. I recommend keeping it away from your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes gripping hairs with it is hard because of the point. You have to hold it at a certain angle to pull them out.</li>
            <li> They are great for stubborn ingrown hairs.  I never have seen my boyfriend become possesive with any grooming tools before, but he hated for anyone else to use them!  Definelty 2 thumbs up, great tweezers I must say, they worked on my boyfriend and he has some really course and thick facial hair.</li>
            <li> These are very sharp tweezers and are great! I love them and am happy I purchased them. They grab hairs and splinters very easily.</li>
            <li> When first bought, this tool is so exact and precise.  It picks at really hard to get hairs.  The only problem is, because its so thin at the tip, it doesn&#x27;t last that long.  After a year, the tips get weak.</li>
            <li> In all reality, I am simply wanting to add another 5-star rating to these tweezers. There is not much left to be said that hasn&#x27;t been said already. They work great, they are very very sharp and come with a rubber tip cover. They are very comfortable to hold and use since they are nice and wide where you hold them. The yellow color is not unattractive at all. They really do a great job pulling hairs and even digging out foreign matter under the skin. Don&#x27;t forget to sterilize them before going digging!     Thanks to all of the Amazon.com reviewers out there that help everyone make informed buying decisions. It&#x27;s so nice to read about real people using products and giving real feedback.</li>
            <li> the tip is not sharp enough!!!</li>
            <li> I have a prob with ingrown hairs in my beard, no longer an issue, this baby does the trick just about every time.</li>
            <li> I use these tweezers for ingrown hairs all over my body, and they work wonderfully. They&#x27;re great for probing under the skin for hairs that have turned back into the follicle and started growing under the skin. The only drawback is that the points are VERY sharp, so they can cut the skin pretty deeply, causing scabbing and possibly scars.</li>
            <li> I have had laser treatment on my legs and my hairs haven&#x27;t fallen off yet. I&#x27;m very frustrated so I decided to get this tweezer in hopes of plucking out the un-fallen hairs. So far so good, but I just need to be able to learn hold it and properly use it. The tips are very sharp. It can go through your skin and pull out the hair. I tried it on an ingrown hair but I&#x27;m not sure what was wrong. Either my hair was too deep to pluck or the tweezer isn&#x27;t sharp enough to get it.  At any rate, I recommend this Tweezer. You can use it to untangle things too ;P</li>
            <li> These tweezers really get the job done.  They are extremely sharp and have an almost surgical precision to them.  The tip pressure is perfect, so you will never have to grab a hair more than once.  The free, lifetime sharpening is a plus, too.</li>
            <li> I bought these after suffering through scads of lame-o drugstore tweezers. The points of these STILL match perfectly even after several accidental drops into the sink. They&#x27;re nice and sharp, but not so sharp that you&#x27;ll accidentally hurt yourself. And the metal of the tips is just rough enough to get a good grip without serrations. Excellent all around.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are the ones you need if you have a splinter. Well made, pointy to get at what you want. Tips touch well.</li>
            <li> These are great for removing ingrown hairs and splinters.  I had an ingrown that was several months old and nothing short of going to the doctor to get it removed was going to work.  My waxer recommended these tweezers as a last resort.  After a few tries with the tweezerman, I was able to get the hair out.  I highly recommend this product to anyone especially if you get ingrowns from waxing or sugaring.</li>
            <li> For an item that ended up being the same as your department or drugstore offering, it was expensive and nothing more than ordinary. Plus the company took more than a week in an off-season time to ship the tiny item. It is February...not like Christmas where I would understand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great at digging hairs out from underneath skin, but not so good at grasping hairs once they have emerged. It tends to break them off instead of pulling them out by the root. That&#x27;s problematic, because you are supposed to remove ingrown completely -- meaning I have to use these to get the hair, and then another, duller pair to remove it :)</li>
            <li> These are not as sharp and pointed as my other tweezerman tweezers were. Very disappointed. I ended up using my old tweezers since they gripped much better.</li>
            <li> These things are as precise as surgical instrument.  In fact, it puts surgeon capabilities in the hands of the user.  These are so sharp and thin at the point that you can easily get under the skin and extract a hair with minimal puncture damage to the surface of the skin.  Just be warned that tweezing can become addictive because these make it somewhat enjoyable.</li>
            <li> I am a fervent gardener, and consequently have more than my share of tiny splinters lodged in my fingers. These tweezers are the best possible way to remove them, with the help of a good magnifying glass, of course.  I can&#x27;t think of one way they might be improved.</li>
            <li> These are by far the best tweezers I&#x27;ve owned. Would definitely buy another pair if I lost them! The needle point works well and they save tons of time</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted for picking up and holding small electronic componets for soldering. After cleaning thoroughly I also use it for removing those small splinters!</li>
            <li> Great tweezers. Now, if I could only manage to not be so determined! Obviously there is no rational for a \\&quot;user&#x27;s manual\\&quot;, but conceptually, that might help me quite a bit so that I stop causing wounds. Having the finest of fine hairs is to your disadvantage, but that would apply to any tweezer.   Overall, I simply love them and just need not to be so aggressive. These tweezers indeed are very nice and sharp!</li>
            <li> I was let down by this product.  The idea was nice but the execution did not come through for me.  The makers claim that the ends are sharp but they are squared off.  The ends appose reasonably well but are bowed slightly so in order to grasp a hair you need to squeeze fairly hard, that is when the ends slip past one another.  I am used to using a stainless steel surgical grade forcep and these are nowhere near that level.  Dissappointed that I spent this money.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are great for splinters and ingrown hairs. They come in there own little plastic \\&quot;case\\&quot; with rubber tip cover to keep them sharp. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> The tips are very delicate, I did not use them often but they are warped. I did dropped it once and one of the tips bent. They are still usable but I would have preferred a stronger product</li>
            <li> very good at getting those stubborn ingrown hairs...very sharp and pointedly gets right to the cord of the hairs...would highly recommend this product.!!!</li>
            <li> This tweezer works amazing for ingrown hairs, I get plenty in my bikini area and this gets them out with ease</li>
            <li> These tweezers are so great.  I ordered two this time because I keep dropping them and bending the tips. Can&#x27;t do without these guys.</li>
            <li> It is very good product!! Great for ingrown hair and for any other epilation really, better than any other. I&#x27;m buying a new one because I let mine fall and now it doesn&#x27;t work anymore (of course) Well, great product, love it.</li>
            <li> Tweezers for very well, great for the tiny little hairs that you don&#x27;t want and/or getting a splinter.  Good quality</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for my husband.  Works very well, he is very pleased.  The sharp stainless steel tips are perfect for ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I got this thinking it would help with plucking large, clump hair follicles that develop in my beard.  It is not good for that.  The ends of the tweezers are very much NEEDLES, so you can&#x27;t grab anything with it.  These are design for (painfully) &amp;#34;digging out&amp;#34; ingrown hair.  Not plucking hairs.</li>
            <li> What a wonderful set of tweezers You won&#x27;t go wrong with them.  Be careful they are sharp.  Had my old ones 50 years and needed new ones.  Didn&#x27;t know these would be so good.</li>
            <li> These are the best tweezers you can buy on the consumer market. No questions asked. They are ridiculously precise and sharp to a point where you can easily hurt yourself. Every other pair of tweezers will go right in the trash after you use these. The Tweezerman company seems to believe in their product as they offer lifetime sharpening and repair. Be careful not to drop these though...The steel tip is very brittle and will crack easily. The warranty does not cover dropping, but they do come with a rubber cover for the tip. If you keep them clean and off the floor they should last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product. I have been looking for the perfect tweezers for many years, and now I have found it. I am going to be getting more of this product...maybe even the whole collection. The tips are so precise...just last night I got a sliver out of my daughters hand. It was so easy! I also use this to extract pimples/blackheads with ease. Also, the price is amazing. Other tweezers cost more and don&#x27;t even work as well...And they bend easily. Not this product...no bending. Plus, it&#x27;s guaranteed.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful. Nice sharp matching points. Handle has wide area that makes it very easy to hold steady. Pulls the splinter right out. Will order another set to have one in the garage and one in the house.</li>
            <li> These tweezers seem to have a hard to holding onto ingrown hairs on my neck. As a result they sometimes will clip part of the hair, making it shorter and harder to pull out.</li>
            <li> Super pointy and sharp.  Works great for getting ingrown hairs out! I love that it came with a little cover to help protect the tips (I tend to be a bit butter-fingered, and it&#x27;s helped save the tips from a couple falls).</li>
            <li> Gets the job done but the pointy edge is not durable which is to be expected.</li>
            <li> Great,  accurate tweezing of those stubborn ingrown hairs. Sharp points get under the skin too if u have to &amp;#34;dig.&amp;#34; Ingrown hair sufferers know what I am talking about. Be careful though- one drop on a hard surface and you have misaligned the tips and most likely ruined it. I have had a hard time trying to re-align the tips to my satisfaction. Fortunately, TWEEZERMAN&#x27;s warranty will replace or fix them &amp;#34;free&amp;#34;. Costs you about $5 a pair. I have several pairs and wait til I am on the last one and then send them in for fixing.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are VERY sharp and seem like they&#x27;d be great at removing ingrown hairs, however they perform about as well at removing tough-to-get hairs as my other Tweezerman tweezers. They&#x27;re decent, but not great. They might be really good at removing larger things like splinters, but I haven&#x27;t had to try that yet. Overall they&#x27;re not a bad purchase, just don&#x27;t expect anything special as far as tricky ingrown hairs are concerned.</li>
            <li> These are simply the highest quality tweezers I have ever seen or used.  This particular model has precision ground sharp points, which are designed to penetrate the skin&#x27;s surface and pull out ingrown hairs.  With a little practice, you will find that these work excellent.  This item is well constructed, cleans up easily and should last a very long time.  Tweezerman includes a lifetime sharpening deal in the package. Tweezers like these should be kept away from little ones, as the points are needle sharp.  They come with a protective cover for the end, which is good to prevent accidental impalement, especially if you put them in a pocket.  If you need regular tweezers, look into the other Tweezerman products, such as the slant end type, which have the same high quality and excellent warranty.  A great item at a fair price - definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> Tweezers aren&#x27;t the most expensive products you can buy, so for $14.99 I kind of expect a quality product that gets the job done.    Unlike standard tweezers these tweezers are pretty long and have a man sized large grip which may or may not be to your liking.  The tip on the one I recieved had one square sided tip and the other was pointed.      The tweezers themselves did the job as advertised, unfortunately after using them for the first time I placed them on the counter, washed my face and in the process of grabbing my towel knocked them to the floor.  When I went to pick them up the tips were bent 90 degrees.      Now I wouldn&#x27;t expect a glass to get dropped from counter height to the floor and survive, but considering the size/weight of these tweezers I kind of expected that they would have made it out unscathed.  They are supposed to be made of Stainless Steel yet the tips bent like Aluminum? I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m very impressed with the products quality.    I also can&#x27;t imagine how a product like this would stand up long term.  If a small floor collision can bend the tips that much, common use of the tweezers for ingrown hairs or splinters would cause similar damage over an extended period of time.    That said the product manufacturer seems to offer a pretty good gaurentee: \\&quot;We replace Damaged/dropped tools for one half the purchase price, we repair bent tips for $5.00 per tool.  No shipping/handling charges.\\&quot; But you have to wait 4 weeks for the product to get returned.    I can&#x27;t help but feel as though the gaurentee is simply the company offering to fix a defect they know about at a premium, after the product has sold if anyone \\&quot;happens to encounter it\\&quot;.      At a lower price point these would be something good to stock up on and throw away when the tips got bent.  For $14.99 they had better last a while, dispite the occasional drop.</li>
            <li> oh man, i love these things! so sharp! i agree the tip is needle-like. these things can pluck anything that exists. a hair too short for other tweezers to get and or too ingrown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have no had trouble plucking with them (they aren&#x27;t just sharp and pokey) they are functional tweezers with an additional feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a word of caution, don&#x27;t pull them out just before you need to go somewhere.... you might start digging at something and then have a red mark just as you need to go. I went crazy with them the first time i used them and had a bit of blood in a couple spots, i looked picked on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;maybe i&#x27;ll have to use restraint next time :)</li>
            <li> I loved my old stainless steel Tweezerman splinter remover.  It was not yellow like this one.  This one is not as good.</li>
            <li> Two pairs of these tweezers were ruined when I dropped them...  They are so pointy and delicate that any bump can disfigure them to be unusable :(  So don&#x27;t get them if you are a klutz like me..</li>
            <li> Let me open this review by stating that my experience with these tweezers and a similar model (also described) is not typical of the tweezerman products I&#x27;ve bought and used in the past. Every other style of tweezer -- point end, slant end, body tweezer -- I&#x27;ve purchased from them in the past has worked perfectly well. In addition, their customer service is uniquely good. They&#x27;ll sharpen your tweezers for free and even pay for return postage; you just have to pay the postage to Texas. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The listed splinter tweezer is a different model from one I used to have. I bought the listed product as a replacement for that first tweezer; you can read about my experience with that first tweezer below. It&#x27;s remarkably similar to the second. The tweezers I got were well-honed along the edges of the prongs. Instead of the ends tapering to a point, though, they were squared off blunt far enough up the prongs, that it made it impossible to do any sort of fine work under the skin. That they were too blunt to break the skin without serious clawing didn&#x27;t especially matter, because they were also misaligned (I think that&#x27;s the cause of the problem), and just cut off whatever hair I might be trying to tweeze, between those really well-honed edges.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t dare use it for its stated purpose because it&#x27;s liable to cut the ingrown hair or splinter in just the way that makes them burrow for bone like a tree root towards water. I tried using it to yank arm hairs, leg hairs, chest hairs, face hairs, even back hairs and the \\&quot;bikini line\\&quot; (too much information? too bad!) region to see if maybe a coarser strand might stand up to the so-called \\&quot;tweezers\\&quot;.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I found that if I could work them just so on a hair of sufficient girth, without applying too much pressure, that I could still yank it. Easier said than done. Maybe a handful actually popped out, out of a half-gross or so of hairs I tried to pop out (in the name of science, natch) after having developed the might-work light-touch-and-magic-incantation technique described above. I sent the tweezers back to Tweezerman for a free sharpening and $5 realignment to see if it would make any difference. It did -- now that the tweezers have been sharpened (at least the ends come to a point instead of being squared off), all it takes is the slightest contact between the two prongs to cause any hair on my body to go flying off. And it gets worse the closer to the point of the tweezers the hair is grabbed with. So it&#x27;s gone from awkward to worthless and possibly dangerous. I finally threw them out. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I had another set of ingrown hair/splinter tweezers from them that were practically razor sharp -- perfect for digging out recalcitrant hairs or splinters. It was magic even on prickly pear needles that are as thin as a fiber of fiberglass (and just as uncomfortable to get under your skin!). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then, after a couple of months of faithful use, they -- referring to another, almost identical tweezerman model -- started to get misaligned. I found this out in the process of digging out a particularly deep ingrown hair -- I was just about to pop it out when I squeezed it with the tweezers to yank it -- but instead of yanking it up over the skin, it cut it in half, even deeper than it was before. Now I&#x27;m going to have to find a dermatologist to get the thing out before it gets infected or painful without leaving a big scar. After that incident, the tweezers kept on snipping instead of grabbing whenever I used them (not for ingrown hairs unless the entire hair was visible, and then only to pop it out with that dig-under-with-one-fork-of-the-tweezer-and-pry-up trick). I sent it in to tweezerman with a note describing the problem in detail the problem and $5 for them to bend the thing back into shape if they could tell that&#x27;s what was causing the trouble -- but it came back with my $5 check intact, a little sharper for the trouble. Now I&#x27;m the owner of a glorified hair trimmer. It&#x27;s good for detail work, I guess.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Since I started using Tweezerman tweezers I&#x27;ve never bought another brand of tweezer for any purpose. They&#x27;ve been durable and, except for all the splinter tweezers I&#x27;ve had, extremely well-aligned -- suitable not just for stray hairs but lab work too. Come to think of it, anyone who has to tweeze stuff in a lab -- to look at it under a microscope or with a loupe -- or anything else requiring the ability to pick up a precise object at a precise point, these would probably outperform the overpriced lab junk for sale so often from scientific supply stores.</li>
            <li> Best tweezers on the market.</li>
            <li> This is a great concept and works most of the times! But other times, it breaks the hair and even causes bleeding if you have sensative skin!  Would not recommend it for sensative skin...</li>
            <li> Use them on ingrowns on my beard and so much more. They work so great! Highly recommended for anybody who needs a good pair of tweezers!</li>
            <li> For guys that have curly facial hair, this is a must because of the ingrown hairs that eventually occur. I will often get these on my neck and this product has been perfect for quickly and easily removing those. The tweezers are wide and secure in my hand which allow more control in the process. Before buying these I would sometimes have to use a straight pin along with regular tweezers to access the ingrown hair. The tips of this product are so fine that I no longer need to jab at my neck with a pin. Also if I catch a hair that has just begun to grow back under my skin, these will easily lift those out before it becomes a problem. However, if you are bleeding, make sure you stop that first because I have found these tend to lose grip when the hair and or tweezers are a little slick from blood. Don&#x27;t they all?      The interior portion does not have any ridges but has been machined in such a way that it provides excellent grip when the hair is dry. Since the tips are so fine it can sometimes be hard to grasp those properly but when you do, one pull is all that&#x27;s needed. For splinters, these are a must! Even with a little bleeding these have done the job very quickly and without causing anymore damage to the surrounding skin.     I would warn you that if your hands shake these are probably not the best tweezers to purchase. Since they are so precise, you have to be as well. The tips on these things are needle-like. You need a steady hand and good hand/eye coordination and for obvious reasons, don&#x27;t use these anywhere around your eyes. For me, they have proven invaluable but I realize these tweezers might not be the best choice for everyone. If these don&#x27;t work great for you, it will very likely be the operator, not the product. I don&#x27;t even attempt to tweeze hairs if I have the coffee jitters.</li>
            <li> I use these for general tweezer needs and find them to be excellent. I haven&#x27;t yet needed them for a splinter or ingrown hair, but have no doubt that these will work just as well for their actual intended use. I can&#x27;t believe I suffered along all my life with the clumsy tweezers available in drug stores: which are like using salad tongs for tweezer needs, compared to these. Just be careful re: the sharp points on these.</li>
            <li> Sort of a joke, but seriously awesome tweezers. I do a lot of metal and wood working, and I regularly seem to have something I need to extract. These make quick painless work if it. Was able to get out splinters that I wasn&#x27;t able to previously.</li>
            <li> I bought a second set for my frequent out of town trips... They work great and have sharp ends that help pull out ingrown hairs vs the typical tweezers with blunt ends. No issues or complaints...</li>
            <li> These tweezers can hardly pull out a hair that isn&#x27;t under the skin. They can puncture the skin, I suppose, but that is really about it.</li>
            <li> These must be one of the best, if not the best Ingrown Hair Tweezers i have ever bought i would recommend these they are great , once again I thank Amazon .</li>
            <li> Great price and quality</li>
            <li> Works as advertized. Dug a deep sliver out with a lot less blood and gore than using a pin.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are great - very precise.  My only complaint is the plastic tip guard thing that comes with them to protect the points.  It is tiny and was lost within the first two days.  It would be nice if they&#x27;d integrate a place to store that tip guard into the design of the tweezers.  But functionally, the tweezers themselves are great.</li>
            <li> Very sharp... but this bad boy gets right in there and gets the job done.  No more second guessing if you \\&quot;got\\&quot; that ingrown hair or that splinter.    Makes a perfect gift.</li>
            <li> this product is so high quality it is dangerous in the wrong hands!&lt;br /&gt;very well built, very sturdy, very sharp. definitely keep out of reach of children.</li>
            <li> These are very nice, great for getting out ticks! Really sharp tips and great edge on the end. the end isnt round like I thought it was.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these tweezers!  I get around 3 hairs on my lip &amp; chin that drive me crazy!  I&#x27;ve done laser hair removal, but they are light enough that it didn&#x27;t work. These are great because they are so narrow at the tip, they can go directly to the hair just barely popping out of the skin and remove it without a mark. I hate that with other tweezers I&#x27;d sometimes pluck at skin and then look like I had a pimple...which I never do. I&#x27;m going to buy one for both of my sisters. Definitely worth the extra $!</li>
            <li> I have one word for people who think Tweezerman is a good product. &amp;#34; RUBIS &amp;#34; If you want a real tweezer spend the money for&lt;br /&gt;a good product. I just replaced mine that was over 20 years old.They never dull just require cleaning.</li>
            <li> this product is good.  I sometimes think that it should work a little bit better than it does but it gets the job done.  id probably buy it again.</li>
            <li> These tweezers work great, I have been searching for 15 yrs. for product that satisfied me. I have tried probably a dozen pairs and none seemed to last very long or allow me to get ahold of my fine facial hairs that grow wild where I least expect them to be. The older I get the harder it is to see and grab them and the more I seem to be getting them. It has a comfortable grip to it, which is also important do to my authritis in my hands /I am so glad I bought 3 pair, for home, for travel, and I gave one to my mother as a suprise (she likes hers too) yes I would buy this item again.[[ASIN:B000EMYHA8 Tweezerman  Stainless Steel Ingrown Hair Splintertweeze]]</li>
            <li> these are overpriced garbage. they don&#x27;t grip worth spit. the tips bend really easily making the tweezers totally useless. avoid at all costs.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman makes great tweezers. Once you use them you will never go back. Its amazing the difference and you&#x27;ll wonder how you ever did it before.</li>
            <li> These are one hell of a sharp bastards, so you&#x27;ll need to be extra careful when your body parts are on the business end of those tweezers. But they sure do the trick of extracting all kinds of thorns and splinters out of my hands.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t check Amazon&#x27;s price first. I paid nearly twice this price locally to get these, and I now have 3 pairs: 1 for the bathroom, 1 for my purse (chin hair emergencies can happen anytime, anywhere) and a spare pair in case the tips get bent (Tweezerman will sharpen and straighten tips for a very small fee).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I&#x27;ve used these for several years and they are the absolute best for ingrown chin hairs (menopausal women know very well what I&#x27;m talking about) and essential for splinters. And 9 bucks is a great price for something so indispensable. I plan never to be without a pair within easy reach for the rest of my days, and I really don&#x27;t say that about much.</li>
            <li> this product is very true to it claim been the best.  my  brothers really love this tweezer cannot stop talking about them to other guys I will be  ordering more.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I have bad chest acne and I&#x27;m not always able to pop them with my fingers or it would hurt to do it with my fingers.  These things are nice and sharp and work great.  I haven&#x27;t had any problem and they don&#x27;t hurt to use.  They have a nice cap that keeps the tip from getting dirty or poking you.  They are easy to clean and I have had them since summer 2013 and have had no issue.</li>
            <li> This is great for small hairs, or ingrown hairs.  It has a small mouth for this exact reason, not meant for plucking lots of hairs, use a thicker opener.&lt;br /&gt;tweezerman is a great brand and never dissapoints.  there a little expensive, but worth the price!</li>
            <li> Normally I love the tweezer man brand, all my best tweezers are from hem. So when I had to replace some old tweezers I bought these. What a waste, the tips are very thin and sharp which is what I wanted,but after only using them twice the tips have become bent and don&#x27;t grip. I was very careful making sure I put the cap on when I was done so I don&#x27;t know why they became so bent.</li>
            <li> maybe its me, but i can&#x27;t get all my eyebrow hairs with these tweezers. but they are good for ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both use an epilator so ingrown hairs are an issue. I bought these tweezers for me a couple years ago. They keep disappearing to my daughter&#x27;s bathroom so I recently bought her a pair. I am a bit clumsly and have dropped these a few times onto my slate floor. The tips bend easily. They no longer \\&quot;tweeze\\&quot; like they did originally, but still work for loosening ingrown hairs then I remove with the regular tweezers.</li>
            <li> The sharp pointy bit removes ingrown hair with ease, just be careful not to prick or bruise your self. Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The metal is very soft so the &#x27;Perfectly aligned tips&#x27;, a most critical feature, do not stay aligned for long. Less than a week and the product is practically useless.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are a must-have! I do a lot of work in a workshop and am always sticking things into my hands and fingers. These tweezers, combined with a jeweler&#x27;s loupe (because I&#x27;m old and can&#x27;t see as well as I used to!), allow me to pull out the tiniest splinters. They&#x27;re very sharp and the points meet perfectly. Highly recommended. They&#x27;re also yellow and easy to find!</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly facial hairs and I often try to pick out ingrown hairs. My first concern prior to ordering was that these tweezers would not be strong enough to grasp the hairs because they are so fine. I was immediately impressed on my first try. All the way to the tip I was able to grasp and pull with precision. Not even having to apply huge pressure like I did with normal tweezers. THAT was a SHOCK and a gratifying appreciation for someone with my thick course hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do be careful as they are sharp. Also fragile since I recently dropped my pair in the plastic sheath. It deflected the tips a little when I need to get repaired or buy a new one but that&#x27;s my fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: My sister came buy and saw these (she&#x27;s a stylist) and took them from my bathroom leaving cash in its place. Now need to reorder.</li>
            <li> I have been buying Tweezerman for years.  But the last few years, this particular tweezer does not work for me.  It&#x27;s not&lt;br /&gt;like the first pair I owned.</li>
            <li> Just like my title says above, this is awesome for getting out those tough to reach hairs. Just don&#x27;t drop it because once you bend the tip of it, it never works the same again.</li>
            <li> I like the product. The materials used seem to be of good quality. It is what I had expected.</li>
            <li> Use them all the time, one my favorite hygiene tools. Sharp and precise the are able to get exactly what I want.</li>
            <li> I just used these for the first time and am amazed at how well they got out the ingrown hairs. I&#x27;d been considering them but really didn&#x27;t think they would be that much better than other methods of getting out ingrown hairs - but I was wrong - these are so much better.    Yes, they do pierce the skin a bit, but that&#x27;s how you get out hairs that are ingrown.  Using these is so much more delicate than any other way I&#x27;ve tried, and faster and more effective.  I agree with others that these may not be the best for actually plucking hairs from the root (though you can do it with a bit of maneuvering) - but that isn&#x27;t a drawback for me because that isn&#x27;t the point of these tweezers.  The point of these is to extract ingrown hairs from under the skin.  Once they are out you can then use regular tweezers to pull the hair out if you are having trouble using these - and this helps save the tips of these so they stay the necessarily sharp.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my wife. She really likes them because she can pull the tiniest of hairs. They are well built.</li>
            <li> These are the best tweezers I have ever owned.  Best for getting out splinters &amp; the like.  Great quality product.</li>
            <li> The best tweezer I have ever used. Works like a charm, even on the tiniest of hairs. Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had super pointy tweezers before, but these are amazing.  Perfect for ingrown hairs - you can grab that pesky hair (even when it&#x27;s already formed a bump!), yank him out, sanitize, and go about life.  Those plus the lifetime sharpening, makes me happy.  Now I can continue waxing without too many bumps after.  Great tweezers!</li>
            <li> I purchased these from Amazon - at less than half of the local price for the same product from the same maker - and am very pleased with them.  The tips are extremely fine, yet strong enough to lift out a splinter easily the first time.  I purchased them pretty much for such purpose.  I&#x27;m not a professional but appreciate a good quality tool.  (My earlier tweezers were \\&quot;stolen\\&quot; by a security guard in Ecuador who decided I was a danger to an airplane if I kept my tweezers.)  My order came promptly as scheduled.    I would recommend these to anyone who wants a high quality tweezer at a very reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> These are extremely fine pointed.  They work great for splinters or really fine work on removing ingrown hairs, etc.  We&#x27;ve been using these for over a year now, and are extremely happy with them.  Remember to keep the cover that comes with them to protect the tip, since one drop on the hard floor with ruin these.  This happened to us, but luckily I had already prepared for this and had an extra pair!  Worth every cent for these, and the price on here is much better than what I can find in local stores.</li>
            <li> Wow, they aren&#x27;t kidding--these are a splinter&#x27;s worst nightmare!  They are very fine-pointed and sharp, so be careful, but it definately does the job.</li>
            <li> Just the thing to have at all times.  I&#x27;ve used them to remove splinters, ingrown hairs, re-keying lock cores, picking up tiny parts from bags &amp; boxes.</li>
            <li> I received this product to augment my Vape tool kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say the quality out of the box was fantastic. They feel like quality from the moment you hold them, They have served their purpose in fishing cotton wick through very small coils with amazing precision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a matter of fact, they were sterilized (with alcohol) and used remove a thorn that was stuck in my finger from yard work. That is where the product really shined. It was like having two sewing needles in perfect alignment and was able to easily extract the foreign invader of my finger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about the product is i wish they naturally were more expanded in the &amp;#34;open&amp;#34; position. The ends are very close to each other in the resting open position. About 5-6mm would really make a difference for the purposes i am using them for.</li>
            <li> This is a Perfect Precision Grooming Tool. Incredibly fine point makes removing the smallest hair possible. Easy to use. Great Price. Quality Item.</li>
            <li> This is a simple but elegant tool. The points come to a sharp and very precise end. It works beautifully for splinters. Comes with a cap to keep the points sharp.</li>
            <li> I have alway bought Tweezerman brand but I thought I would buy a S*** brand which is more money.  I was really disappointed. It did not grab the hair but slid right off each time. So I had found this yellow Tweezerman at amazon~so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  It works every time. I like the precision of it even better than the straight or the slanted tweezer which I also own. Nothing to get in the way of seeing what you are extracting. You do not have to press excessively to get results, just gentle pressure. It is not just for ingrown hair it is an all purpose tweezer tool for wife and me. Will always buy this one and happy it was way less money, too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had the travel sized Tweezerman set and didn&#x27;t know how much the larger set actual worked. I have larger hands than most females and I am able to hold and maneuver the tweezer to remove ingrown hairs. The tips are very sharp and allow for precise grabbing.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman products are the best!</li>
            <li> Exactly what you pay for. Stop buying your typical store tweezers it&#x27;s waste of money and time. These are perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Color is loud but you won&#x27;t misplaced them. lol.&lt;br /&gt;Love them!!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased a pair of these tweezers to help me fix a very delicate gold chain necklace that had gotten tangled.  No other tool in the house was effective, but once I got these, I was able to fix the necklace very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes these tweezers so great is that they have a sharp tip that is very good at holding on to whatever it grabs.  They also hold their shape (i.e. they don&#x27;t bend) like other tweezers do.  I use these tweezers now for all my \\&quot;tweezing\\&quot; needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think everyone should have a pair of these tweezers on hand.</li>
            <li> These will do the job, excellent quality, readily available, easy to locate item on the web.</li>
            <li> We accidentally came across these tweezers while searching online.  We&#x27;ve purchased numerous tweezers and have become frustrated at finding ones that did the job.  Our experience with tweezers are that most hairs are too fine to be removed by most of the tweezers, and after time the tweezers become dull and useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Tweezerman tweezers out of the box is as sharp as a needle, so be careful.  It&#x27;s amazing at the hairs it removes that have not pierced the skin as of yet.  In addition, if or when they become dull, you can send the tweezers back to the company and they&#x27;ll resharpen them for free of charge.  Who knows if we&#x27;ll ever have the chance to do that but it&#x27;s nice to know that the option is there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why did it take us so long to find these tweezers--they are simply extraordinary!</li>
            <li> I have the regular tweezerman tweezers and I thought these would be even better.  Not even close.  They are sharp, and they will dig into your skin, but unless you get a hair exactly in their very,very tiny grip, you will just have a hole in your face and the hair will still be there.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> These are very nice, precise tweezers that will get to anything you have that&#x27;s under the skin.  They don&#x27;t do any damage to the surface of the skin...just get rid of what you don&#x27;t want under it.  Keep the plastic cover for the tips - they are very sharp!</li>
            <li> I thought that these tweezers were ultra sharp...perhaps a little too sharp. Even when I got the hair perfectly... the tweezers would act like scissors and cut it leaving little hair left for me to grab. It&#x27;s more than a little frustrating. I also found that mine aren&#x27;t perfectly aligned so even when I&#x27;m right on top of a hair it wont&#x27; grab it because the point is so specific. I think this tool is perfect to dig down to your ingrown hair and try to bring it above your skin surface and then use another pair of tweezers to actually pull it.</li>
            <li> Had a cyst on the bottom of my top eyelid for coupla years.  Attempted unsuccessfully several times to remove with a needle. These tweezers did the job.  Was able to grasp and penetrate the cyst resulting in puss removal.  The tweezers is very sharp, precise and high quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my third set of these tweezers in five months (one yellow, two stainless steel).  First, I am so impressed by these tweezers and their ability to pull hair close to the skin - hair so short that I have to be using a 15x magnification mirror to really know they are there.  However, there are problems with having tweezers with such fine tips.  The first is that the ends are easily damaged and warped.  With my first pair (the yellow), one of the tips was damaged and the tips could not grip correctly.  I did not throw them or drop them.  I think they probably reached me slightly crooked and I didn&#x27;t notice until the product couldn&#x27;t grip. After the bad experience, I swore off of Tweezerman because I had only had the yellow tweezers that warped for six weeks.  I searched and searched and could not find any tweezers that were as good at plucking fine hairs.  I spent a lot of money on products that were junk.  All the other tweezers broke the hair and/or left me with ugly red marks.  So, I bought another pair of Splintertweeze.  The second pair was great.  I plucked and plucked and everything came out cleanly until the day they didn&#x27;t.  After two months, the tips were dull and each and every hair that I pulled broke at the skin.  I ordered the third pair and they pull wonderfully. So here is the thing, these are fabulous for getting thin and short hairs but they will entail investment.  Tweezerman supposedly provides free sharpening and once my third pair becomes dull (I give them four more weeks), I will send the three off as a set.  Again, for fine hairs, these tweezers cannot be beat.  It is just incredibly annoying to have to keep purchasing new pairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is made in India.</li>
            <li> I idiotically purchased these Tweezerman tweezers because two I already have are useless at removing my very fine eyebrow hairs along with splinters from the plants in my front yard that are native to the Southwest deserts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From my experience with these tweezers, they are not designed for anyone with fine hair that is too fine, for removing splinters from plants that are so unusual as to be rare (lantana, cactus, etc.) and/or for those whose skin is unlike anyone else&#x27;s on the face of the earth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in addition to all the run-of-the-mill less expensive tweezers that can be found at drugstores, I now own three types of too sharp Tweezerman tweezers (recommended by various beauty experts as being the best) that will rip up my skin without removing facial hair -- especially stray eyebrow hairs -- or splinters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I relied on reviews from various sites, including Amazon, when deciding whether to buy these, as I did with the other Tweezerman products. I&#x27;ve learned my lesson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no clue what to recommend to anyone with very fine hair on their face, especially excess eyebrow hair, looking for tweezers. I&#x27;ve tried creams and lotions, which burn my skin without removing the hair; waxing, which inflames my skin without removing the hair; electric shavers, which don&#x27;t remove all the hair; manual razors, sugaring and so on. I can&#x27;t afford electrolysis so I&#x27;m clueless.</li>
            <li> I admit I&#x27;m an avid picker.  Since my acquisition of these I&#x27;ve gone to a whole new level.  Its easier than ever to get the most minute hair/pimple/flaw with these suckers.</li>
            <li> This works for getting tiny, fine splinters out your fingers after working outside, or tiny hairs under eyebrows.  Tweezerman is the best and should you get a tool that is out of alignment, they will try and repair the tool, just mail it in.  This is a quality product, better than any \\&quot;Wal-Mart\\&quot; tool ever thought of being.</li>
            <li> the concept is extremely cool and I think tweezerman has done a decent effort to live up to its job but it has some work left (for sure in the amateur) -- be very careful, be very precise and be very narrow in the width to pick (in fact a high price with mm. grade to open and lock would prob. make it improve a long way - I would pay the inc. in price too)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I was trying to remove ingrown hairs with cheap tweezers from the local drug store! These are 100x better, very very sharp, and can be very very precise.  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like these tweezers because the tips get bent easily and you can&#x27;t really bend them back to the original position. This creates an issue with the usability of them because they can&#x27;t ever have the same grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reason the tips bent was because I dropped them.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  I have used it before and that is why I have reordered them.</li>
            <li> Best tweezers for small problems.  Ingrown hairs are easily plucked away.  Splinters that are slightly under the skin are also not a problem.  These are super sharp, so keep the tip protector on there!  I have accidentally stabbed myself when I just threw them in the drawer and forgot they were there.  I will never be without these again!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice that I can get this at my local store.  At any rate, it was about the same price.  My hair is like splinters, so it helps whomever cut my hair.  Also, great at picking up tiny iPhone screws or anything at all</li>
            <li> There were some posts indicating that it was not pointy enough compared to an older model.  It seems sharp enough to do whatever I need to do so far - taking out a small piece of wood from my kid&#x27;s palm and shaping my eyebrow.  Compared to other tweezers I have from a drug store, this gives a better precision.  It&#x27;s not cheap for tweezers, but this purchase was worth it.</li>
            <li> If you have round and slant tip tweezers but some short hair get missed then this is the tweezer for the job. It requires precision but it will pull out ingrown hair, the grip is strong and feels comfortable to hold. Upon pressure it might leave a tiny dot mark on the skin, I am happy with this purchase it is an addition to grooming tools.</li>
            <li> The fact that they work says a lot for a pair of tweezers. The yellow makes them easier to find.</li>
            <li> Not really much that I can say about this product other then the fact that it does its job. Arrived on time and is handy to have</li>
            <li> I ordered these tweezers to help me remove splinters and small metal shavings and they work perfectly the shipper did an awesome job getting them to me.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time, more than I thought I would. I use it for ingrown facial hairs. I&#x27;m very happy with it personally. Works well. I&#x27;m able to dig hairs out, grab them, and pull them out without causing a lot of damage. The vast majority of the time it works flawlessly. Rarely it may break the hair, or you may have a hair that&#x27;s hard to grasp(usually because it&#x27;s very short).    It&#x27;s a very sharp precise fine tipped tool. If you have trouble with such a precise tool than maybe it isn&#x27;t for you. Just have a look at the product shot, it&#x27;s exactly what you&#x27;d expect it to be. It&#x27;s well made also, I don&#x27;t foresee it going bad anytime soon.</li>
            <li> These are the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever had. They have a very fine point and require little effort to compress.</li>
            <li> bought this over a year ago for $7.03 and I can&#x27;t find this item for under $9 anymore.  Due to the sharpness, I have poked myself several times.  Overall, it works well without haste.  By the way, I bent it slightly and it is now useless.</li>
            <li> A good tweezer but the sharpness didn&#x27;t last long so need to buy too often, will not buy this one again</li>
            <li> You will never be satisfied with another brand after using Tweezerman!  I highly recommend.  My boyfriend is able to remove splinters with no effort.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every tweezers out there, and this takes the cake. It works so well for tweeting eyebrows but is also awesome for removing splinters, it&#x27;s so narrow and precise!</li>
            <li> Way better than regular tweezers for removing wood splinters!  Also way better than using a single needle.  I bought one for the house and one for the car.</li>
            <li> I have used many tweezers in m time and these are the best I have encountered.  I get alot of ingrown hairs and these a perfect and sharp to get the in grown out.  I have had these tweezers for a couple of years and are still going strong.  Also tweezerman will sharpen these tweezers for free if they should ever need it you just need to pay for shipping.  If you get alot of ingrown hairs from shaving I recommend this tweezers they get the job done.</li>
            <li> I have tons of ingrown hairs on my face, these have helped me take care of them with the least damage. They are sharp and tend to grab well most of the time !!</li>
            <li> I used regular tweezers to try to get a small piece of glass out of my daughters foot and it pushed the glass deeper into her foot.  After that experience I realized the importance of having good tweezers on hand.</li>
            <li> fast delivery, good product, does the job, very helpful for those with sensitive skin, sturdy product, I do wish it had a light</li>
            <li> It does what it says it does. It penetrates your skin and find ingrowns. This is common for men who shave with straight razors and this very sharp tweezer does the job as well as any tweezer I have used.</li>
            <li> i love this tweezer. my cousin loved it so much, I had to get her one as well. now we&#x27;re both happy campers lol. it works really well.</li>
            <li> If you need and want tweezers that get right to the point these are the ones. I do a lot of woodworking and thus get a lot of splinters. These work great in removing them.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed!  I have had the Ingrown Tweezers from Tweezerman before and they were very pointed, thin and precise.  It must of been an old style. This style is not as pointed and the thickness does not allow the same precision.  I wish I could find what they made in the past!!  Not happy for the price or function.</li>
            <li> Tweezer forceps don&#x27;t line up so not good for most jobs. Not good or usable for splinters.  Would have returned.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are great for ingrown hairs. They work best to work out the hair you&#x27;re after, although sometimes I need to bust out my heavy-duty TM tweezers to actually get the whole hair out. The tips are so tiny and precise that it can be difficult to get a grip sometimes but I&#x27;ve never used a pair that worked so well to loosen up the ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> These are the greatest tweezers I have found. They are like harpoons and really help get deep when you need to</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, especially around my eyes.  For years, wearing makeup has tended to create infected eyelashes, even though I gave up mascara years ago, so I am regularly looking in a magnifying mirror with a pair of tweezers trying to extract the offending lash.  The tip of my finest-tipped tweezers had gotten dull and my vision wasn&#x27;t getting any better, so I was looking for a pair of new fine-tipped tweezers and came across these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been VERY pleased with these tweezers.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the tips are very sharp (they come with a cap for safety), so they can hone right in on a single lash (or ingrown hair) quite easily.  My only complaint (and the only reason I gave the tweezers 4 stars vs. 5) is the same one that others have made--it can be difficult to grasp the hair or lash and get enough hold on it to pull it out.  This is because only the very TIP of the tweezers come together--from there, they bow out--making it difficult to get a good grip.  However, now that I&#x27;ve been using the tweezers for a month or so, this is much less of a problem.  It&#x27;s just a matter of learning how to use this tweezer to its best advantage (at least that was the case for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for those with recurring ingrown hairs, lashes, etc.</li>
            <li> Easy to remove ingrown hair.  However, hair follicles get red afterward, not the product&#x27;s fault, I&#x27;m still getting used it.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love this tweezer.  I use it all the time.  Great for getting slivers out of your hand.  I have used it in art projects picking up and placing rhinestones on objects.  Tweezer has very fine pointed tip and is sharp, not to be used by children.  Best item I have bought in a long time.</li>
            <li> The brand tweezerman are the best! You will not go wrong with this brand! These are great for picking out ingrown hairs or stubborn hairs.</li>
            <li> These are the pointiest tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used and as such the best.  I&#x27;m not sure about the ingrown hair thing, but they are just great at anything you&#x27;d like stabbed or tweezed out of you..</li>
            <li> I have problems with ingrown hairs.  These tweezers are great for helping me to remove them.  Even though the points are very sharp and slender, they do not bend like other tweezers that I have had.  They are expensive but you probably will not need another pair... unless you want to have to tote them around.</li>
            <li> Fantastic! I love these tweezers they are sharp so be careful but then again who wants dull tweezers? Not me</li>
            <li> These tweezers are the BEST for ingrown hairs.  They are so pointed and sharp at the ends that they will get out any ingrown hair you have with ease, and the ends DO NOT bend which seems to be a frequent problem with other brands I have tried.  However be careful with them because they are so pointy you can prick yourself quite easy, i surely would not let my kids get ahold of these.</li>
            <li> These are very good tweezers. I have used them to remove splinters and for ingrown hairs the sharp pointed tip make them very good for the job</li>
            <li> The tips on these tweezerman tweezers are perfect for extricating those hard to grab splinters and are perfect for any task that needs precision.</li>
            <li> best tweezer ive ever had until i dropped them 2 feet on to the counter and the tip bent. they are just too fragile in my opinion.</li>
            <li> These are precision tweezers with long thin sharp points. They will get any hairs that are ingrown and just under the skin out of reach of your regular tweezers. I was suffering with painful ingrown chin hairs that I could never seem to remove. Within a few minutes after receiving these tweezers I was able to get them pulled out. It took a learning curve to figure out that it&#x27;s best to try to grab the hair at an angle and not straight on. Also I bought myself a new lighted magnifying mirror which helped tremendously. I am very relieved to have the hairs gone.</li>
            <li> After several rounds of painfully mashing away at my face with Drug store tweezers and a sewing needle trying to get out tiny ingrown beard hairs, I got a pair of these. Each ingrown hair I&#x27;ve attacked with these tweezers is out in under 30 seconds- it&#x27;s sooo much easier to isolate the right hair now- and I&#x27;m not ripping out the surrounding hairs by mistake anymore.</li>
            <li> These tweezers cost 2-3x any store type, were worth every penny. The tips are so fine they draw down to nearly needles, but they have superb traction &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; even at that level. I use it for the especially great performance on ingrowns. My only difficulty is trying to grabbing the end of a longer hair out of a group on my bushy eyebrows (not normal edge plucking, which is fine.) The tweezerman only meets for a short length at the tiny tips, so I often can&#x27;t get get the gripping area precisely applied on a longer hair. I&#x27;m talking about five attempts before I give up and break out my blunt store brand with the poor grip. (For comparison, I have better luck threading even the tiniest of needles.) So it&#x27;s great for individual hairs and edging - just can&#x27;t grab the occasional overly long hair muutant hair out of a cluster. The tweezerman is thus my workhorse - it&#x27;s always on my counter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 30 June 2015: I did NOT pay $30+ for the ones I bought - they were like $14!!! not sure why the price has changed since I bought mine over a year ago (reviewed after using a while), but this price change seems insane.</li>
            <li> Great finished product, as i find with most tweezerman, all their products so far are built well, and do what is required</li>
            <li> Reading all the reveiws on this I was expecting needle sharp fine tip tweezers. (what I wanted) These are not them!! Fine tip is laughfable. DULL!!! The only reason I gave these 2 stars is that when you finally get hairs they do remove them. But I was unable to use them for my ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> This Tweezers are amazing, hey just go ahead and buy it. After all, you are just going to buy them once and they last a long time and they are pretty good too specially to get those little tiny difficult hairs from your face.</li>
            <li> Tweezers are good quality and work very well for intended use.</li>
            <li> Was excited to get these, seem to work well.  Easier for my hands to use since they are wider where your fingers go</li>
            <li> We live in a fairly rural area and our back yard seems to be a haven for ticks. When it&#x27;s prime \\&quot;tick season\\&quot; we have even seen ticks crawling around in the house. Those critters are insidious. And tiny. Sometimes normal tweezers are just not precise enough to grab their pinhead-sized little bodies. That&#x27;s why we bought this needle-nosed Tweezerman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device is *awesome*. It is like tweezers on steroids. You&#x27;re pretty much working with a precise surgical item here. We have a high quality glass magnifying glass we use, and then we hone in on the critter with these. They&#x3D; tweezers are immensely accurate. You can get exactly the spot that you want, to pull the tick out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, they are great for ingrown hairs too. They can tease down under the skin and get those curled hairs back out again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are so pleased that we have these in the house now. Yes, we definitely have \\&quot;standard\\&quot; tweezers as well, for more typical tweezer types of activities. There are times that the larger base is helpful. But for cases where you need precise control, or you need to go into a very small area, these are just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is another one of those times when you search Amazon first for a &#x27;difficult to find&#x27; product. This item is PERFECT!! No problem now removing those tiny splinters etc.!! Their grasp is incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do keep the little end cap and replace it on the tip when not in use as these tweezers are veryyy sharp!! Certainly, they are for adults only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Sharon-Lee</li>
            <li> Essentially you&#x27;re buying the Tweezerman name. The tweezers worked great while they lasted, however after a few months use the tips aren&#x27;t nearly as sharp and the ends bent slightly which absolutely effects accuracy. In other words, unnecessary bleeding. If you don&#x27;t mind every 3 months buying a new pair then by all means make this purchase.</li>
            <li> I just received these tweezers in the mail and I&#x27;m very disappointed.  I bought them to replace an old pair of Tweezerman splinter tweezers that had a true needle point.  This new pair of Tweezerman splinter tweezers do not have a needle point; the tweezer&#x27;s point is squared off so they are not sharp enough to pierce the skin and grab ingrown hairs.     Also, the contact area when you have the tips pressed together is so small it&#x27;s difficult to grab any hair with these making them quite worthless.    They are being returned.</li>
            <li> I was recently out of town and picked up a $10 pair of Rite Aid tweezers  - I tried to use them and the first thing I muttered to myself was, &amp;#34;Now I remember why I spend a fortune on Tweezerman.&amp;#34; Need I say, I returned those others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are specifically wonderful if you need to coax out ingrown hairs or remove fine splinters. I even prefer them for my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Were good for the short time they lasted. These were great for a minute until they bent or did something and now won&#x27;t pull anything. I guess if you know up front to be super careful with them you might do better than I did?? Who knows, but they were expensive to break and not function so quickly. Its not like I throw them around or step on them:-)</li>
            <li> These are insanely sharp and great for removing ingrown hairs.  Just be careful you don&#x27;t drop them like I did as the tips are so thin they get easily bent, but they work so well I just bought another pair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find myself using these as much as I thought I would.  (the other tweezer man set I got does almost everything) But when you do need these things they do the job. Easy to clean and sharp too.</li>
            <li> The sharp tip means more precision when plucking any hairs, I&#x27;ve stopped using regular blunt tweezers as they are not as quick and easy to use, would definitely reccomend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually had two of these but I had to purchase the second one because I lost the first pair. I think these tweezers are really great because of the surface area it provides for your fingers to grip and the super pointy tips. The thing about the tips though is that since they are so slim they are easy to bend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Assume you hold tweezers between your index finger and thumb. Then let&#x27;s assume that you can&#x27;t squeeze both ends with the same amount of pressure. One of the points is going to become slightly more bent than the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given this a 5 out of 5 stars if this was build with a higher quality metal but I do understand that manufacturers can only go so far. They need that pointy end to get the hairs the best so it&#x27;s kind of a catch 22 of sorts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product! If you don&#x27;t use too much pressure then it will work perfectly fine on the tips. I will definitely be buying these again when I inevitably lose my current ones. You can&#x27;t really beat this product when it comes to price and performance.</li>
            <li> These are absolutely great tweezers, well worth the price.  The only downfall is that they are so delicate that if you drop them on their point they are worthless.  I have purchased over a half dozen Tweezerman&#x27;s because I love them, I guess I should carpet my bathroom!</li>
            <li> You should totally buy them. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. They are absolutely the best tweezers ever fashioned by man. Period.</li>
            <li> These are good quality tweezers! The tip is quite sharp which is what I was looking for. These are great for getting thorns, and things out of your fingers. Can&#x27;t come up with any cons, really..!</li>
            <li> These are super sharp with a very fine point.  These are full size tweezers, a bit longer than what I typically see sold in the drug store.  People need to use caution when using these tweezers, they are very sharp.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed. Helps get ingrowned hair out even when exfoliation can&#x27;t in legs, armpits and eyebrows. 100% recommended!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why it took me so long to find these.  I work with wood a lot and get splinters.  These make it very easy to get them out.  Couple it with a magnifier visor.</li>
            <li> I love these tweezers! I get glass, metal, wood splinters and used to cut spots open with knives to get them out. These are tough tweezers I use to open open wounds and get out whatever is buried under my skin. Needle point precision for splinters and ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Surgical forceps such as Dumont or Hamilton Bell #5 with Super Fine tips is the way to go to extracting ingrown hairs with needle precision.  The tips on the Tweezerman were not as fine and precise as desired.</li>
            <li> It does the job so perfectly and you will not need another tool to clean up your in grown hairs.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are not any better than regular tweezers, it is very difficult to get them to grab the hair, the only thing i accomplished with them is some unwanted cuts and bleeding from trying to grab ingrown hairs. really wish i hadnt bought these.</li>
            <li> Actually going to get a pair for my daughter, I would recommend this. Very precise for getting those stubborn hairs,</li>
            <li> I bought these for a first aid kit in case I ever need to removed splinters or stingers, should work well.</li>
            <li> Look well made, precise tweezer tips.</li>
            <li> I really like these tweezers. They are fine to hold, sharp-tip, but I think I&#x27;m going to use them for projects and other stuff besides plucking my eyebrows; my hair and skin is just to oily for these things to grasp.</li>
            <li> These are amazing! I get so many stubborn hairs for my husband!</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp for digging and grabbing  ingrown hairs out with great precision... Until you drop them! Then the fine tip gets bent and becomes pretty useless rather quickly. Having the plastic sheath in place helps to prevent this from happening during those accidental falls. I had to order another one which I&#x27;ll try to take better care of!</li>
            <li> These Tweezers work very well for ingrown hair. I highly recommend them and I trust Tweezerman it is the only brand that I buy.</li>
            <li> they were pretty cheaply priced so i figured id try them out because i like the tweezerman brand, they work great for the little strays when you do your eyebrows, also for me at least if you end up with an ingrown hair when you shave your legs, these make it very easy to remove, the tips are sharp enough to penetrate a couple layers of skin if they need to. only downside is, you gotta be careful they kinda bend easily</li>
            <li> These Tweezerman tweezers are hands down the best tweezers I have ever used. Incredible accuracy and can penetrate spots where deep ingrown hairs lie. I was skeptical at first about spending $10 on a pair of tweezers, coming from spending less than a couple of dollars for past tweezers but they are fully worth it and it is available for a great price here on Amazon. I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I really was hoping for something very precise.  These have a nice point but they are not as small at the tip as I had hoped.  The tip is certainly much larger than the Revlon Platinum Tweezer Slant Tip, which I have included in an image next to the Tweezerman - Ingrown Hair Splintertweeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am currently using these for crafting, which they are actually perfect for.  Anytime I need to grab something fine like a bead or brad they really do the trick.  They are also great for small stickers or stamped images or pretty much anything else.  If they were advertised for this, I would give them 5 stars.  As tweezers they fall a little short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I must say I&#x27;m a picker. I pick my face &amp; constantly pluck hairs from every where. These tweezers are awesome. They get the tiniest hairs.</li>
            <li> The tips of these things are like SHARP needles, and they are perfect for \\&quot;isolating ingrown hairs\\&quot; beneath the skin.  Like the other reviewer, I found it difficult at times to pluck hairs using the needle-like tip of the tool.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The trick is to use the flat area of the tweezer, located just \\&quot;before\\&quot; the tips are tapered into points;  from there you can grip the hair well enough to pluck it.  It&#x27;s enough of a hassle that I ordered a pair of Tweezerman&#x27;s slanted-cut tweezers to do the \\&quot;heavy lifting\\&quot; plucking, and will use these for the precision work (that is, isolating the hair or splinter or bullet fragment.) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Make certain you keep the clear-plastic tube that covers the tips in the packaging.  You will need something to keep from poking things as you retreive or sanitize them.  I skewered the tube the first time I tried to use it to cover the tips, so I need to find some kind of alternative sheath for travel. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;ve had them almost a month and I&#x27;m very impressed at how well they hold their edge.  The packaging material promises Tweezerman will gladly grind (re-sharpen) the tips for free -- you only pay postage.  They&#x27;re replace a broken or \\&quot;soiled\\&quot; tool for a flat $5 + postage, FWIW.</li>
            <li> I really like these tweezers. The only downside is the tips tend to get bent after a few months rolling around in my cosmetic bag. If there were a way to protect the tip better, I think they would last longer. Otherwise, excellent tweezers.</li>
            <li> Amazing! This thing is very sharp and accurate when trying to remove ingrown hairs. A must have if you get them often!</li>
            <li> These are great at getting unwanted hairs out the 1st time.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Great for small slivers or metal slivers. Really nice firs-aid tool.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are very sharp and easy to use for removing ingrown hairs. The tip is almost needle thin, I do not recommend these tweezers  unless you have a fairly steady hand. Excellent purchase!</li>
            <li> THEY ARE YELLOW. THEY ARE SHARP. THEY ARE VERY POINTY. THEY TWEEZE. THEY HAVE A CAP FOR THE POINTY END. THEY SIT IN MY MED CABINET IN MY WOOD SHOOP. WOW.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these for over a year now, they haven&#x27;t broken, or dulled in their ability to grab hair.  Excellent purchase.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from ingrown hair for years with my course hair so I was thrilled to find a tweezer made especially for this.  Tweezerman is a high quality tool.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite tweezers. Perfect for eyebrows and ingrown hairs. You need to grip hairs JUST right to prevent breakage, but it&#x27;s easy enough to learn. The tips are super sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I accidentally dropped my pair on the tile floor in the bathroom, the points bent out of true straight and no longer worked. I mailed them to Tweezerman, who does the repairs and then bills you. They accidentally double billed me. When I asked for clarification, they apologized, waived the fee entirely, and sent my tweezers back all nice and sharp!</li>
            <li> These tweezers are the best ones I have ever used.  They are able to get those tiny hairs around the chin that are such a nuisance.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman is the GREATEST tweezer there is, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> Tweezerman makes nice products.  Although, this one is not one of my favorites from them.  Kind of dangerous...!</li>
            <li> i should have returned these. i don&#x27;t like them at all. i love this brand but don&#x27;t like this version at all.</li>
            <li> I love these they are very sharp and I use them on my eyebrows. I would recommed them to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have alot of ingrown hairs and have bought about 6 different tweezers in my life. These Tweezerman&#x27;s are the best. Even my fiance uses them for her hair removal needs! A little about me, 30 year old male half Greek and half American. The Greek half is why I am super hairy. lol</li>
            <li> I love these tweezers. I have always have had a problem with ingrown eyebrow hairs, but using these have reduced that problem.</li>
            <li> For ingrown hair removal, this is a must-have tool. Also would make a good addition to any first aid kit. Ideal for things like tick removal too.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for individuals who need to make sure that they can get fine hair out of their skin or need precise tweezers. They can be dangerous though, so please be careful!</li>
            <li> Inspected thoroughly and I was surprised by the high quality for the price. Would recommend to anyone. Extremely percise! Must have for extracting splinters or urchin spines.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much I love these.  I cannot ever be without them now that I have tried them.  The tiniest shortest hair is grabbed by these.  My skin on my chin and upper lip is so soft and absolutely no hair.  Used in conjunction with a magnifying mirror, you will never have any stragglers left on your face.  They can pull any length facial hair out.  Even if it looks like a speck, it grabs it and removes it.  If these were twice the price I would still own them.  I have tried everything for facial hair removal and nothing no matter how high tech or costly it is, can remove ALL the hairs on the face except for these tweezers.  They have a very precise tip and it grabs anything.  Great for splinters as well.  I highly recommend these.  Best tweezers I have ever owned in my life and I am a senior citizen so I have tried many things over the years.</li>
            <li> This is not the tweezers you use everyday - this one is meant to break the skin, like for an ingrown hair or for a splinter.  It comes with good directions about safety and cleaniness and certainly does the job in getting under the skin.  I haven&#x27;t tried it on a splinter yet but will the next time my grandchildren give me the opportunity.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I got to my 30s before I found out this tool existed. If you&#x27;ve got an OCD streak about ingrown hairs, like me, this little guy will be your new best friend! Just wish I&#x27;d known about it sooner!!!&lt;br /&gt;Quality-wise, it&#x27;s great, but then again I don&#x27;t have a point of comparison there.</li>
            <li> These remove ingrown hairs quickly and easily with no discomfort. I have not had a splinter in a while but I believe these would work great for them too. I am so glad I made this purchase!</li>
            <li> These tweezers do exactly what they should.  Provide a sharp access to ingrown hairs and extracts with a firm grip.</li>
            <li> Precision implement, superbly does things have wished for in the past..  in grown hair, splinters.  There were more expensive models, greater precision not necessary for what i was doing.</li>
            <li> Best pair I&#x27;ve seen. Good quality</li>
            <li> I hated it.  It does not work!  I need a tweezer that pulls very fine hairs.I wish I could get my money back.  Normally I have been satisfied with the others I have purchased.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are great to pull out ingrown hairs but they don&#x27;t work so well when you just want to pull out regular hair.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use anything but Tweezerman.</li>
            <li> strong stable pointed tweezers.  I&#x27;m a hairy dude &amp; these are great for ingrown hairs.  The points have stayed aligned &amp; the quality is very good.  $11 bucks for tweezers?  Yep, I recommend you give &#x27;em a try.</li>
            <li> The Tweezerman stainless steel ingrown hair splintertweeze is an excellent product for dealing with ingrown hairs.  Easy to use and works well.</li>
            <li> This worked great to remove splinters, bee stingers, and cacti stickers...until i accidentally dropped it and the force of the fall bent the ends and now.....well i have a nice set of beginner chop sticks ...</li>
            <li> Amazing for removing ingrown hairs! I can finally remove them without causing damage to my skin. The tips of the tweezers are very sharp and thin, but still grab even the smallest hairs firmly.</li>
            <li> works really well in pulling ingrown hairs, just again be careful you dont want to poke yourself, it takes time getting used to how to be able to use it, but then again practice makes perfect.</li>
            <li> This is my first tweezerman tweezer, and it is a lot better than any other tweezer I have owned. It&#x27;s great for eyebrows and it is able to get almost every hair. It has trouble grasping very fine hair, and if you are not careful, you can poke yourself which is painful because these tweezers are very sharp. Overall, I find that if you are patient, it does almost as good a job as waxing.</li>
            <li> I love this!  It&#x27;s very easy to use.And great precision.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have 10 words to submit  Why would I want to do that if I love it???</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only used these twice. Once for removing a splinter, and once for removing an ingrown hair. Never have these usually painful processes been so easy, simple and actually painless.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are definitely very sharp so use with care. They are excellent at removing ingrown and small hairs which would otherwise be impossible to get without leaving a gaping hole behind.</li>
            <li> This is the best tweezer i have ever owned. great quality and works so well to remove ingrown hair painlessly. great buy</li>
            <li> and it loses its sharpness fast&lt;br /&gt;they say you can send it in for free to be resharpened but that&#x27;s a lot of trouble when the sharpness gets used up so quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several slanted tip tweezerman tweezers, and I love every one of them.  The design and construction of the tips is not fine, nor rigid enough to provide a solid pinch on a hair, so it doesn&#x27;t serve the purpose that I purchased it for.  It has become more of a craft pair of tweezers for me.  Not suitable for ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> These are awesome.  They work great for splinters.  We take these whenever we go on vacation; just in case we need for the kids. WAY better than fishing around in a kids finger with a needle.  Tips connect and hold a splinter way better than you&#x27;d think.</li>
            <li> Wow never knew there was such a thing out there, you need to have one of these. The tip is super sharp and skinny, will grab on to the splinter for easy removal.</li>
            <li> my husband loves to use these to get the ingrown hairs in his face this is an excellent product. and it was shipped quickly</li>
            <li> Extracted ingrowns easier than any other way I&#x27;ve tried. Heavy duty and very sharp tweezers manage to grab quite accurately</li>
            <li> Need I say more? If you don&#x27;t have one or ever used one, get one now! They should already be part of your beauty routine.</li>
            <li> I bought these tweezers not for tweezing splinters and the like. I bought these to weed vinyl stickers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently purchased a vinyl plotter so I can make my own vinyl decals. I needed a good set of tweezers to weed out the unwanted vinyl from cut designs, and the sharp point on these tweezers work perfectly, especially with very complex designs.</li>
            <li> Love these tweezers. Undoubtedly these are the best tweezers! Super sharp and super accurate! The wider flatbed of the tweezers also make it easier to hold with control.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my constant ingrown hair issue on my neck. These work great for getting the hairs out without making a bloody mess. However, I advise ordering two pairs as my wife claimed them almost immediately. These are. It just great tweezers for ingrown hairs. They are hands down the best tweezers I have ever used or seen!</li>
            <li> This tweezer has made the process of removing my boyfriend&#x27;s ingrown hairs less painful. It makes it easier to \\&quot;dig\\&quot; the hair out without burying a hole in his neck like with the regular tweezers lol I wish I had researched it sooner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male and often have ingrown hairs. I own Revlon tweezers which I purchased long time ago from Target. They work pretty well for most ingrown hair and grab the hair very firm.The problem with Revlon is though that first I have to slightly free the hair from the surrounding skin using a needle or other sharp tool.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Tweezerman tweezers based on mostly positive reviews, but I was not able to use them for ingrown hairs. The tip is sharp and thin. The tweezers either cut or fail to grab the hair. When I tried harder, they would cut the skin, cause bleeding and make more harm. They are pretty much useless.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I missed the window for return.</li>
            <li> if you need to stab and grab splinters or ingrown hairs these are the right tool for the job !</li>
            <li> These are the best tweezers I have ever owned.  They are very very sharp so be careful or you will cut yourself.  They will pull the finest hairs out.  They are so sharp they will even pull blackheads out.  Just go ahead and hit buy.  You will not regret!</li>
            <li> When you need &#x27;em, you can&#x27;t see to ever find &#x27;em and these tweezers help with that.  Who can&#x27;t find a pair of bright yellow tweezers in a cluttered cabinet or drawer!  Good quality product that does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and at a good price.</li>
            <li> But once you get the precision down these are  another great item as expected from Tweezerman.  Like twee-zing with two needles!</li>
            <li> but you hardly ever really need it. the few times that i thought it would come in handy (small hair that was pushed into skin), it didnt really help.</li>
            <li> Color makes it easy to find in a drawer, sharp points make it perfect for digging out splinters.  Good spring action and holding up well.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman is the best</li>
            <li> If you suffer from light to coarse ingrown hair on your face like side burns or on the chin this is the tool for you.  The tweezerman in the pharmacy doesn&#x27;t come close this instrument; helps maintain in between waxing.  For a woman appearance is everything, you will love this like I do.</li>
            <li> I bought these tweezers about 8 months ago and they have worked perfectly for ingrown hairs and splinters.  Occasionally, the tip will slip and cut whatever you are trying to pinch, but if you put just a little cross-pressure as you pinch, it will work without a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunate for me, I landed about 30 splinters the other day, and as I was removing the second one, I dropped the tweezers!  They hit tip-down on the tile floor and the tip on one side curled inward.  I wound up having to take a needle to my hand, and now my shredded fingers are all bandaged up with about 6 minor splinters still in there.</li>
            <li> The tweezers feel very heavy duty, and I tested by pulling several ingrown hairs, they did well. Now maybe my wife can keep the caterpillar off her fore head and upper lip. She is screaming at me not to submit this review. Hopefully, our marriage will surv</li>
            <li> I have used these for years. For splinters they are the best out there and well worth the money. Years ago only sold by select dealers and hard to get. Don&#x27;t use them for other projects as the tip bend easy and then they are useless for what they are designed for.</li>
            <li> I have bought many pairs of tweezers in my life for my husband. I would have to say these have been the best pair ever for ingrown hairs. I have gotten so many ingrown hairs with these. I want buy extra pair for back up.</li>
            <li> No one can compare to Tweezerman tweezers.  These are true to description.  Very sharp and serves well for both splinters and ingrown hairs.  I highly recommend this tweezer!</li>
            <li> After constantly pinching myself with other tweezers these seem like a god send. Very sturdy and super precise. Wish I had found these a long time ago.</li>
            <li> As a lady interested in keeping her eyebrows tame, I had always had regular Tweezerman slanted tweezers.  But these!  They are great for tight spaces like a blocked pore or scum in your trackball mouse.  These tweezers get used all over people and things, and are easily sanitized with a little rubbing alcohol or hand sanitizer.  I have actually considered buying multiples, so they can be conveniently placed around the house.  Seriously.</li>
            <li> I purchased this when I did some embroidery. I was almost finished when I noticed that it was the wrong size. I then tried to use a pin and found the old fingers did not like to hold the small pin. I searched for something that was very thin to put under the stitch to be able to take out. I got these and they work great for such a project. I have also used them for getting out a sliver and this was wonderful. I would like to purchase a second pair for placing in first aid kit in our automobiles. They are vey sharp so use caution when poking around your skin.</li>
            <li> I bought these tweezers for removing ingrown hairs that did not come out after I shaved.  My regular flat tweezers were not pointed enough to grab them.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This product&#x27;s graphic yellow design makes it more eye-catching than your traditional stainless steel model.  I realize the tips have to come to a point to pull splinters or small hairs, but these ended up being a little too sharp.  There doesn&#x27;t end up being enough surface area sometimes to easily grab what your trying to take out. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like the tweezers and would recommend them.</li>
            <li> I really love this tweezer! It&#x27;s like having a tiny pair of needlenose pliers for your personal grooming. The design allows you to carefully pluck just that one hair that&#x27;s messing up the line of your brow. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product does extactly what it says it does. Buy this item for those ingrown hair problems you may have trouble with. This is really great if you need to \\&quot;dig\\&quot; those troublesome ingrown hairs that are stuck right under the surface. I thought this product would of cause me pain or make me bleed by \\&quot;digging\\&quot; for those hairs, but no. It looks like since the hair is right under the surface of your skin it is painless to get them out. I will warn you to be careful since the ends of the tweezerman are very sharp. So make sure you don&#x27;t stab yourself, because you will. I just wish I bought this products a couple of years ago. I use to use the little scissors attachment from a small swiss army knife. It worked great but since these tweezers have pointy ends it is much faster and easier.</li>
            <li> Never thought I would truly understand how a pair of tweezers could be worth this much money but now I understand.  I would suggest if you think that anyone you may know or ever might meet in the future may at some point ever get a splinter please buy these Tweezerman tweezers and that recommendation is just for a splinter someone you might know could someday get a splinter and they are or so so much more. My 4 year old calls them the magic tweezers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a splinter in my hand for quite some time and haven&#x27;t been able to remove it.  I had tried several different tweezers and sewing needles without any luck.  I ordered the \\&quot;Splintertweeze\\&quot; and within 5 minutes of opening the package, I was able to remove that irritating little splinter that I thought was going to be a permanent attachment.  Thanks Tweezerman!</li>
            <li> these work pretty good but mine seem to have gone dull after awhile. I don&#x27;t think my skin is that thick I going to have use a sharping stone or something to sharpen them back up other than they work good to pull the little hairs out. When you can find them I also order some defense salve it helps to heal the spots up after if you get the hair out or you can put some on before trying to get the hair out to.</li>
            <li> these tweezers are really nice for getting out ingrown hairs of splinters. however, they are not as sturdy as they appear. if the tip gets bent, they no longer work properly. i have no idea what happened to mine to bend them as they are always in my makeup bag, but they did, and now the ends don&#x27;t touch enough in order to tweeze hairs. i haven&#x27;t contacted tweezerman yet about a possible replacement since it&#x27;s only a lifetime sharpening for free.</li>
            <li> This tweezer Ive had for a couple months now and it still doesnt add up to my lost tweezer. It really doesnt get the hair all that good! It makes me mad and frustrated when its tweezing time!</li>
            <li> Tweezerman&#x27;s quality is second to none.  It was tough to initially take the plunge, but now I know why they cost so much, they&#x27;re made perfectly for the job they do.  I&#x27;ve never owned tweezers that worked so well and were machined with such tight tolerances.</li>
            <li> Works just like it should! Very sharp, be careful with these!</li>
            <li> Some things take high precision tweezers that are very sharp. These are the ones.  The two sharp tips to align precisely.  The tweezers come with a small rubber tip to use during storage so you don&#x27;t prick your fingers while fumbling in the drawer.  The fact that the tweeezers need the rubber tip defines the value.</li>
            <li> I have a bunch of those 99 cent twezers and they definately are not as high quality as these. These get the job done and are very sharp for getting out splinters.</li>
            <li> The too is not as expected, and hard to use. The toe is too thick and not sharp. I will put it at the bottom of my drawer.</li>
            <li> This little piece of tool works wonders on little tiny splinters to get. Shipment is really fast.</li>
            <li> The tweezers are perfect for getting splinters out, which was our primary goal!  They are now kept in our First Aid kit and travel with us to the beach and park.  Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> These are great at pulling out ingrown hairs, popping pimples, lancing milia.  I love it!  I have to take breathers, though, because I get addicted to pulling out ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I actually like these ones better than all the other tweezerman styles (which are all more expensive!). I use these to pluck those unsightly chin hairs. Works wonders.</li>
            <li> Great tweezers.  Just sent in to Tweezerman for sharpening.  They sharpened for free and sent them back as advertised.  All i paid for was postage. I&#x27;d highly recommend. Pricey for tweezers but worth it.  Great quality and service.</li>
            <li> Love it. I consider myself a tweezer connoisseur and these meet my approval. I like to have both a fine tip and a slant tweezer, and between these two, I have everything I need. Tweezerman makes a good product that stand up over time.</li>
            <li> Works great for ingrown hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off one star for the fact that it is ONLY good for ingrown hairs.  With the needle-like tips, it&#x27;s not great for any other tweezing unless you&#x27;re patient.</li>
            <li> THe needle tweezers are pointy and a tad hard to get closed 100%. you need to pay extra attention when using them as they will miss hairs and be constant annoyance. Its really only good for getting out splinters I would got with the traditional slant style tweezer in general.</li>
            <li> I now own tweezer man tweezers,the nail grooming kit, and these ingrown hair tweezers. I will never own another pair of tweezers owned by anybody. I wish I knew about this brand years ago. They make all my old tweezers seem as dull as a butterknife. Anyway, these ingrown hair tweezers are no different. Now when my husband has an ingrown hair on his head I pull only the problem hair and not a patch on his head. I know he appreciates them. Because they are so pointy and sharp, keep them where a child can&#x27;t reach.</li>
            <li> I have had my angles tweezerman&#x27;s for a few years and finally decided to try the ingrown hair ones. Thats really the main reason i use them and let me stress how awesome these are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to pull out hairs that were barely visible with little to no work. These are keepers and id rather use these instead of regular tweezers.</li>
            <li> Great price for a really good pair of tweezers. It&#x27;s was convenient to shop for a good pair of tweezers that would come right to my home with out running all over town looking. Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> Perfect for splinters, of course, but also useful for removing stitches and wowing fellow construction workers when I pull them out of my center console.  It&#x27;s a good thing they are brightly colored, otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t be able to see one of my co-workers sneaking off with them.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It works very well for removing splinters and easily plucking fewer strands of hair from eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I have used these tweezers to get out splinters and hard to reach stubborn hairs. Have to be careful you don&#x27;t poke an eye out, they are really sharp.</li>
            <li> Either I don&#x27;t know how to use these bad boys or my hair is just SUPER stubborn. It&#x27;s hard to pull the hair out once I have it in between the tweezers. Though, when I do get the hair it does pull it ALL the way out, for me its just tough getting there. Definitely wouldn&#x27;t purchase these again though I will be trying their regular tweezers.</li>
            <li> They seem to work pretty well but over time they do become dull. I would order them again however. Thank you</li>
            <li> This is the only tweezer that works well for me.  Hold it flat against your skin to obtain results, but be careful not to point the end, very sharp. Works better than any expensive tweezer I&#x27;ve used. This is my go to tweezer.</li>
            <li> Conveniently enough, just about a week after I received these, I found I had a splinter in the sole of my foot.  I couldn&#x27;t get to it myself, and I had to wake up my husband, since--INconveniently enough--it was the middle of the night.  But as bleary-eyed and sleep-fogged as he was, he was able to isolate the splinter and remove it without any struggle or pain on my part.  And this is usually NOT a simple procedure, despite the fact that we have a whole arsenal of tweezers around the house.  I&#x27;m very happy with my Tweezerman tweezers, and I hope they make every splinter encounter as easy as this one was.  (He&#x27;s happy, too, since I&#x27;m the idiot who always walks around barefoot, so this is a tool more for his use than mine.)</li>
            <li> Work brilliantly, you do have to be careful with them as they are very sharp though. Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Good product, not the greatest tweezers. Have to press extra hard to grab hair.  looking for a finer tip tweezer.</li>
            <li> functions as it should. it is a simple device, and does not cause problems. still looking for the perfect tweezer, though. seller &#x27;s product was as was described and promptly shipped.</li>
            <li> This is great for getting at those dark hairs before its obvious to the world that &amp;#34; yes I am a girl and yes that is a chin hair!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I think these are excellent tweezers.  The only thing you have to be careful of when you use them is that they are very sharp.  I have actually accidentally sliced my finger open with them.  But they are great tweezers and work great for removing ingrown hair.  Great for splinter removal also.  Just be careful of the sharp points when you use them.</li>
            <li> These are quality tweezers suitable for both cosmetic endeavors and miniature hobby projects. As with many fine tools, there is a trade-off.  The extremely narrow tips are prone to damage if used aggressively. Perhaps Tweezerman should cryogenically treat the metal to increase their yield strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of the quality of the material, the suggestion that these tweezers be used to extract ingrown hairs is bad medicine. Don&#x27;t try to address the problem with any tweezers. Academic research and common sense indicate that ingrown hairs should be left alone or treated medically. To prevent the problem in the first place, use an electric razor and accept a not-so-close shave.</li>
            <li> These are the best tweezers that I have purchased for ingrown hairs.  They feel sturdy.... they feel like you are holding steel.  They are sharp, and can dig in and grip hairs hiding under the skin without inflicting too much collateral damage.</li>
            <li> a nice tool, very fine point. works fairly well. always a good thing to keep in the cabinet as inevitably you&#x27;ll need it</li>
            <li> Easily digs out ingrown hairs. So glad I bought this thing I should have bought 2 just in case they stop selling them.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey - but - beautifully made, easy to handle.  It should last for many years.  The handle is coated, and appears to be non-slip- worth the price&#x27;</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I have had for one year; I use them almost every day and they work like the first day I had them. My only complaint is that the paint is starting to chip/scrape away. Next time, I would get tweezers without paint.</li>
            <li> Well made for getting out splinters.  These have really sharp tips, so don&#x27;t have general purpose use (don&#x27;t use them around your eyes).</li>
            <li> My first go with these made me nervous--but after a few hairs, I got the hang of them. Now they&#x27;re my favorites!</li>
            <li> Yes, they are just right for grabbing or teasing out an in-grown hair from tender skin.  I hope I do not lose them -- will buy again if I do.  They have a life-time warranty.</li>
            <li> These will extract the tiniest little splinters or those nasty little cactus hairs with ease.  They work so well, you might want to buy a jeweler&#x27;s loupe to work at the level these perform.</li>
            <li> Great pair of tweezers for for tiny little hairs that only you can see or feel.  And it does wonders for tiny ingrown hairs too.  I&#x27;ve accidentally poked myself with the sharp point, but would highly recommend these to any one determined to get that hair the other tweezers won&#x27;t pull</li>
            <li> I never thought I would write a review for tweezers...I mean, they are just tweezers!!! but...if you are like me and hate it when things don&#x27;t work like they should, you will appreciate these!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are pointy. I mean pierce-your-skin-if-you-want-to pointy! Of course I am not advocating surgery with these, but you know that there are sometimes when you HAVE to get under your skin for a splinter or hair, and you have probably resorted to a pin to do it. Not with these!! And I hate even a tiny hair under my eyebrows (fussy, I know!) so these get them all! You can even grab a clogged pore thing with these! ha ha!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP!! I know Tweezerman offers a free sharpening service (I have included the web address under \\&quot;comments\\&quot;), but sometimes you don&#x27;t need complete sharpening...just a little adjustment. I have another pair of slant tip tweezers (also tweezerman) that I use for certain things (like I said, these are my favorites so I use these yellow ones 95% of the time.) I will use THOSE other tweezers and slide them up the points (while pinched together) to help reshape and align them. I pinch the yellow pointy ones together, then grab the shaft and slide the other pair up and off the tip a few times. ALSO! If they don&#x27;t feel like they are grabbing, I use the tweezers to \\&quot;pinch\\&quot; a nail file a few times (I like the glass ones) and slide it off. Almost like sanding. Not hard, just enough to rub and straighten those points. It really works to make them back to \\&quot;super\\&quot; grabbing! :)</li>
            <li> These tweezers are wonderful, I might never use a regular tweezer again. This tool makes for very precise grooming; It gets right under each individual hair. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> These are really nice to have around.  The fine tip makes it easy to remove small splinters.  It can also double as a lance.</li>
            <li> I purchased these tweezers to get to those tiny little eyebrow hairs (I am not blessed with thick eyebrows) and my little hairs defy most tweezers.  These do an OK job, but not recommended for baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> It acts as a needle and tweezers. He loves them and they are very easy to use. Very good tweezers</li>
            <li> awesome for ingrown hairs without damaging your skin, haven&#x27;t used it for splinters yet at this point, however I&#x27;m sure it would be awesome for that too.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman used to have a much better quality product. It&#x27;s no longer available and this one is just OK.</li>
            <li> I wear contacs and I will get these extremely fine eyelashes that grow under my eyelash line and poke/irritate my eyes.  I can only see these eyelashes with a flashlight, they&#x27;re so fine.  They slip between any tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used.  But THESE tweezers were my lifesaver.  They grip even the finest hair.  You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Point is too thick and not able to grasp a fine hair. This is 4th Tweezerman prodct I have purchased and none have performed as described. I count on brand names to be better, won&#x27;t buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> Have never owned such a good pair of tweezers before and have bought plenty in cosmetic departments over the years. So happy I learned of these. They take a little getting used to, but once you do, they&#x27;re great. Thank you for such a good product.</li>
            <li> I love their other tweezers which I own, but these don&#x27;t really do what they&#x27;re supposed to do.  In fact, I use their other tweezers to snag an ingrown hair after these FAIL to do so.  These tweezers are virtually worthless, other than to pierce the skin with their sharp points.  Grabbing a hair with these is an exercise in futility which succeeds only after many attempts to snare what it is that for which you&#x27;re looking to grab.  Their other tweezers got 5-stars from me.  I have updated this review (from two stars) as I can do much better &#x27;work&#x27; with virtually any other quality tweezers.</li>
            <li> When I first got these they seemed to work fairly well but the sharp points made them dangerous to use on softer skin (ie, don&#x27;t pluck eyebrows with these).  After a few months though, the tips started getting dull and now they aren&#x27;t really grippy anymore.  I would recommend the slant style of Tweezerman over these.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman makes outstanding products. I use them often and never have an issue with them getting dull.</li>
            <li> Really good for removing ingrown facial hairs.</li>
            <li> I use these to dig ingrown hairs out of my face. Disgusting. My wife subsequently stole these. They are extremely precise, not quite needle sharp but certainly sharp enough, and they work wonders. Indispensable.</li>
            <li> I have been using these tweezers for a number of years now, and continue to be pleased. They are all one could want in tweezers. Their precision is incredible. The tweezers come to a very fine point, and are capable of pulling anything from small eyebrow hairs to splinters, and anything in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only caveat is that you need to be careful with the tip. They are precisely cut, and if dropped on the point it will break or at the very least bend. There is a protective cap, but I think you&#x27;re most likely to drop them while your hands are wet, possibly just out of the shower. But, even with that one point I would recommend these to anyone looking for tweezers.</li>
            <li> I love these little tweezers! Great for ingrown hairs from shaving.  Its been about 4 months of a lot of use, and they are not as sharp as they originally were, but that is expected with any tweezers. Always put the little plastic protective cap back on after use to keep them as sharp as possible.</li>
            <li> Loved it - high quality, sharp, works excellently. Cut the mails of my two toddlers better than anything. Purchased 4 items, satisfied with every one.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if these would be fine enough for very delicate things, like removing splinters, but these tweezermans have such a fine point that you can literally penetrate your skin with the tip without feeling it.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Very well made and you wont regret spending a little on these. They are very precise. Even though the tips are very small, the grip at the tips is very tight. I was able to get a metal splinter out that I have had for a few months now... I couldnt even cut it out before I got this tweezer. These will last me for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a pair for a year, and for the price, I expected this to hold up better. The super sharp tips of the tweezers, bend easily, and break off, making it somewhat unusable, and unable to grab more difficult hairs. They do come with a plastic cover for the tip, however, this comes off easily and gets lost and then they&#x27;re easy to damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of performance, they&#x27;re great tweezers right out of the box.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman are my favorite, love the point!</li>
            <li> This is a great product, but as soon as you get used to how sharp they are, you WILL stab yourself in the hand. Deep.</li>
            <li> It is what it is, but its not worth the price. Tip is already losing its point. I wouldnt recommend it again</li>
            <li> In the past, I&#x27;ve used a needle for ingrown hairs or regular tweezers. I thought these tweezers would work better but they don&#x27;t. These are actually less effective and cause more damage. Because of their thickness, it rips the skin around the hair which can cause scarring more so than a needle and regular tweezers. It&#x27;s basically like using a thin nail to dig the hair out or at least that&#x27;s what it felt like using them. These were a complete waste of time and money for me and added nothing to the process of digging out an ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> A tweezer&#x27;s just a tweezer, right?  That&#x27;s what I thought before buying these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was on a quest to find the perfect tweezer for my job (petroleum geology), as it&#x27;s all but impossible to find a tweezer that can stand up to rough daily use, especially with the precision that these have to offer.  These Tweezerman tweezers are worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been so impressed with how sturdy these tweezers are after using them for over a year, and how accurate and precise they were designed to be.  When you&#x27;re looking under a microscope, it&#x27;s clear to see that most tweezers have a gap; they don&#x27;t really close all the way.  That might not matter so much if you&#x27;re plucking a hair, but if you are trying to pick up just one tiny grain of dolomite among a tray of other tiny particles, most tweezers just can&#x27;t do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife liked these tweezers so much, we ended up buying a second set for our medicine cabinet (as nothing works better for removing splinters than these Tweezerman tweezers!).  I&#x27;m buying a third now so I can include it in my field medical kit.  I&#x27;m betting that these will be perfect for removing ticks (though I hope I never have to find out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip (pun not intended!):  be sure to retain the rubbery plastic end cap to slide overtop the tweezers when they are not in use.  These things are SHARP and will stab through any fabric or plastic sleeve you try to put them in (you wouldn&#x27;t want to just toss these into a purse without the end cap).</li>
            <li> I have a few pair of these splinter tweezers for my occupation and they are simply the best out there.</li>
            <li> Tweezer does no pull out any hair or splinters because tips do not line up. I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> You can literally get every single little hair with this thing! Kind of sharp so be careful not to stab yourself.</li>
            <li> A very useful and oddly under-used piece of a medical kit. Great for splinters, stingers, glass, and yeah, ingrown hairs. Very sharp needle-like tip so it can really dig in under the skin as needed, springy but not difficult to pinch shut. The needle tips line up right on with one another very well, and it comes with a little protective cap to make sure no one drops it on their foot when it&#x27;s not being used. Stain and rust resistant- a big plus.</li>
            <li> Eek!  Hard to put these tweezers down.  They will work on any stubborn hair.  Very happy - wish I&#x27;d purchased years ago!</li>
            <li> This is a nicely made product and works really well. After repeat shavings, I get ingrown hairs on my face and these tweezers easily remove them. Using them may require some practice only because the tips are sharp and small pitch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product so much that I will buy other Tweezerman products in the future.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are *so* sharp, which should be a good thing, but the tips bent the second time I used them!  I ordered a replacement set from Amazon and so far those are working well, but I was really disappointed in the quality of the first pair.  I expected Tweezerman to produce a better quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:  my replacement pair did the same thing.  So annoying.  Review reduced from 3 stars to 1.  Ugh.  Don&#x27;t bother with these.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to regular tweezer.</li>
            <li> Some of the best needle-nose tweezers on the market. The tips are precision ground and grip firmly. The only negative really is the cost, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Amazing!! These tweezers are just amazing! Worth every penny! The difference between these tweezers and ones you get as part of some grooming set are night and day.</li>
            <li> good for ingrowns, and very fine hairs as well.</li>
            <li> As always Tweezerman tweezers do the job.  I love how pointed and sharp these tweezers and it makes them great for ingrown hair.  The sharp tips allows you to pierce the bump and force the hair free.  Although these are more expensive than your regular run of the mill tweezers, they are definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> And I really mean the best.  These tweezers take the drama out of plucking ingrown hairs.  Just makes it an extremely easy, drama-free task unlike other -cheaper- tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Why aren&#x27;t tweezers like these more popular??? Before learning about these I have even attempted to use a pin for releasing ingrown hairs. Somehow the tweezers work better, faster, and do not leave deep scars.</li>
            <li> These are amazing.  You can grab stubborn hairs days before you can get a grip with &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; tweezers.  I sure hope they last but I did just find that this brand will repair and resharpen them for free so I&#x27;m probably a life long fan now!</li>
            <li> Very sturdy, and super pointy.  You can really be specific when targeting a splinter, ingrown hair, or shard of glass.</li>
            <li> Amazing quality for the price,very useful in my practice,delivered on time and looks exactly as the picture Tweezeman show  I love it!</li>
            <li> For my husband, he likes it and they work great, arrived on time and just as described. Would have liked another color, but its ok</li>
            <li> These are my favorite needle nose tweezers ever.  They are so pointed.  They are like needles.  Perfect for splinters and in grown hairs.</li>
            <li> These tweezers don&#x27;t grasp anything. A waste of money.</li>
            <li> I bought these in 2010 and they&#x27;re still going strong! These are great tweezers for ingrown hairs or white/black heads and splinters for the kiddies. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them for much hair tweezing because the tips don&#x27;t have any grip. Make sure you keep the plastic cap for the tip to keep them sharp and avoid accidental puncture wounds! Would buy again if I ever needed to.</li>
            <li> This product does extactly what it says it does. Buy this item for those ingrown hair problems you may have trouble with. This is really great if you need to &amp;#34;dig&amp;#34; those troublesome ingrown hairs that are stuck right under the surface. I thought this product would of cause me pain or make me bleed by &amp;#34;digging&amp;#34; for those hairs, but no. It looks like since the hair is right under the surface of your skin it is painless to get them out. I will warn you to be careful since the ends of the tweezit  are very sharp. So make sure you don&#x27;t stab yourself, because you will. I just wish I bought this products a couple of years ago. I use to use the little scissors attachment from a small swiss army knife. It worked great but since these tweezers have pointy ends it is much faster and easier.</li>
