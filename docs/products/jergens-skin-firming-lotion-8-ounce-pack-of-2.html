            <li>Nice lotion... Don&#x27;t expect miracles</li>
            <li>and off the bat I liked it.</li>
            <li>nice neutral smell</li>
            <li>but I think its great because it does absorb quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling.</li>
            <li>Has a nice smell and a very rich and luxurious texture.</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>My favorite lotion to use at night.</li>
            <li>but I love the smell that&#x27;s why I continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li>Strong smell</li>
            <li>Best lotion I&#x27;ve found for hydrating my skin, keeping it soft and supple, and for absorbing quickly into the skin upon application.</li>
            <li>one of the better firming lotions, i did prefer the previous formula more but this formula is nice too</li>
            <li>but my skin certainly looks better.  </li>
            <li>Good product I personally prefer amilean</li>
            <li>It smells really fresh &amp; clean.</li>
            <li>nice lotion,  but not enough of it  </li>
            <li>so far its what i thought easy to put on and seems to be working i will be buying again</li>
            <li>Not my First Choice, leaves you feeling greasy although eventually it will soak in.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s higher price</li>
            <li>It soaks in quickly and leaves skin very soft.</li>
            <li>Smells odd and is kind of greasy</li>
            <li>Because of the fact that it&#x27;s a pretty thick lotion you will find yourself using a good bit of it</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the scent of it either.</li>
            <li>I feel my skin is firmer, much firmer.</li>
            <li>so.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this at the least as a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Many of the other skin firming lotions have an odd smell or go on sticky.  </li>
            <li>It does not attack the cellulite as much as I would like (trying a different product now and will review later)</li>
            <li>Decent lotion just not as &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; as expected.</li>

            <li> About the only product that I have found that actually gets rid of the appearance of turkey skin on the arms and sometimes on the neck area.  It is not a fountain of youth but it works just as long as you continue to reapply a couple of times a day.  If there were something out there that worked for 24 hours, I would buy it.</li>
            <li> Expensive, not terribly impressed. Decent lotion just not as &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; as expected.</li>
            <li> smells great feels wonderful but no firming action</li>
            <li> Great Stuff! Hard to find locally.</li>
            <li> Love the scent of this lotion, don&#x27;t know what it is but smells great. I love the way it feels on my skin. It seems to get my circulation and blood flow going. I feel my skin is firmer, much firmer. Thank You, Margaret</li>
            <li> Good product I personally prefer amilean it&#x27;s higher price but if your tight on money this is the way to go</li>
            <li> I have only been using this about a week now- and off the bat I liked it. It smells really fresh &amp; clean. It soaks in quickly and leaves skin very soft. I have acne-prone skin and this has not caused any breakouts for me. I have been using it on bottom half of body, plus neck and chest area only at night. Bought the big bottle with pump at Walmart for around $7. Because of the fact that it&#x27;s a pretty thick lotion you will find yourself using a good bit of it but I think its great because it does absorb quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling. Of course I can&#x27;t attest to it actually causing any skin-smoothing effects yet but I will update this review after a month or so.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this at the least as a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> So since turning 50 and losing a ton of weight.....my skin was taking on that dreaded &amp;#34;lizard look&amp;#34; and this product definitely helps.  It does not attack the cellulite as much as I would like (trying a different product now and will review later) but my skin certainly looks better.  After every shower, I put it on problem areas and use my other lotion for hydrating on the rest of me.  I do this to make it last.  Many of the other skin firming lotions have an odd smell or go on sticky.  Not Jergens.  Great product and won&#x27;t kill your budget.</li>
            <li> Smells odd and is kind of greasy</li>
            <li> one of the better firming lotions, i did prefer the previous formula more but this formula is nice too</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion to use at night. Strong smell but I love the smell that&#x27;s why I continue to purchase it. Hard to find in stores around where I live. No Walmart or Walgreens carry it anymore around here.</li>
            <li> Item as described....quick to ship!!</li>
            <li> i hope that this product works like it says it does. i have used it for years. nice neutral smell</li>
            <li> Bottles are a little small for the price, but works as it should.</li>
            <li> Caused a rash on my legs.</li>
            <li> nice lotion,  but not enough of it  Think about it, if we need a firming lotion we need a bunch of it every day</li>
            <li> Works great, does what it says it does</li>
            <li> Best lotion I&#x27;ve found for hydrating my skin, keeping it soft and supple, and for absorbing quickly into the skin upon application. I seek out this lotion whenever I&#x27;m shopping and would order it online if I had to. It&#x27;s that good! Has a nice smell and a very rich and luxurious texture. Doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling oily and sticky all day. Does create a firming effect by hydrating skin so well that it lessons the appearance of wrinkles.</li>
            <li> so far its what i thought easy to put on and seems to be working i will be buying again</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it very long but hope it helps to tighten up the sagging skin resulting from weight loss</li>
