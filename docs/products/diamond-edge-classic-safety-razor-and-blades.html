            <li>blades are great value considering price of razors today.  </li>
            <li>This seller should check their returns more thoroughly!!  </li>
            <li>Very nice product.  </li>
            <li>I read the reviews, and people said it was a good starter razor.</li>
            <li>it were good</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t anything fancy, just a good razor.</li>
            <li>The best part the shave, close and smooth</li>
            <li>With a good blade, this will probably suffice as a travel razor.</li>
            <li>Good buy for the money.</li>
            <li>It was a good buy.</li>
            <li>Good decision.</li>
            <li>good to get started with or as a backup or travel razor.  </li>
            <li>Now I am not throwing away good razor blades because they are packed with whiskers-</li>
            <li>Just like the title says, for the price it&#x27;s a good starter safety razor.  </li>
            <li>before it was in, cool, and retro like now, I got a perfect shave.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the service also.</li>
            <li>this are rely good price OK guys have a good day bye.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this razor!</li>
            <li>Their service was great and was delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li>thats amazing.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product because it&#x27;s amazing, and also its way cheaper</li>
            <li>The rewards are amazing if you do.</li>
            <li>but once you get the hang of it its amazing.</li>
            <li>Lathering your own soap is a lost art.  </li>
            <li>Nice to know they are still out there as that is what my husband loves to use.</li>
            <li>Personally, I liked this razor.  </li>
            <li>However, when I picked it up, it had a nice heft to it, and it functioned admirably.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a nice intro to this \\&quot;old-school\\&quot; way of shaving though.</li>
            <li>and if it lasts a couple of years its cost effective</li>
            <li>so you can decide if you like this kind of razor.</li>
            <li>ok this is a good handel,.solid</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice quality.</li>
            <li>kind.</li>
            <li>To be quite honest with you, I&#x27;ve tried the 2, and 3 blade injector models, and all they manage to do is clog.</li>
            <li>, at this point, I have no idea how the razor industry managed to get people to move away from this kind of razor--</li>
            <li>Nice close shave  </li>
            <li>This particular Shave Cream is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I missed my safety razor that I had for years and didn&#x27;t remember how good it felt to have a clean shave!  </li>
            <li>It has a very nice weight to it and quite durable, although the handle is a bit ehh its pretty freakin good.</li>
            <li>Plastic handle VERY light, having used a steel razor before meant some getting used to - comfortable shave, great value.</li>
            <li>i got it fast and sealed nicely for a great first use, also great price  !!</li>
            <li>How many more are they going to add to get a shave as good as one safety razor?</li>
            <li>make sure you have nice cream or soap to use with and not the can stuff as it does not work with that type of razor.  </li>
            <li>This is a good starter razor, but IS cheaply constructed, and will fall apart eventually.</li>
            <li>Having said that, it&#x27;s a great little razor, perfect for starters.  </li>
            <li>But after the first use I knew it was a great product.</li>
            <li>However, the Diamond Edge Safety Razor is very cheaply made...</li>
            <li>Does the job, but is very light.</li>
            <li>You find a better razor for the price anywhere.</li>
            <li>it arrived, she gave it a try and was really pleased with it.</li>
            <li>It gave her a nice close shave with no nicks or cuts on her legs, leaving them smooth and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and was glad that I made the purchase.</li>
            <li>The more I use this razor to shave, the better a shave I get and without any cuts or razor burn</li>
            <li>My problem for the most part comes with the packaging, as another reviewer stated it seems their razor had been used.</li>
            <li>If you have never had a proper shave or if it has been years since you had one, this is a wonderful way to remind yourself what it used to be like years ago.</li>
            <li>makes it even better.  </li>
            <li>I love this double-edged razor...</li>
            <li>I am still using it and love the hell out of it.  </li>
            <li>I love that product</li>
            <li>The thing shaves hairs like magic though.  </li>
            <li>Still better than a cartridge razor.</li>
            <li>You can always upgrade and buy an awesome $30+ razor later.  </li>
            <li>My husband says it is so much better than the disposable razors.  </li>
            <li>Husband is satisfied with the  razor.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s 10 times better.</li>
            <li>kidding really, ok so this is the &#x27;2&amp;#34;: second shaver i bought the best$ could find here on amazon</li>
            <li>more soap, pop, the top hinge comes off THE DAME HANDEL, WITH THE BLADE IN IT,</li>
            <li>Would prefer to pay more and be more satisfied.</li>
            <li>It is still better than almost anything for getting edges and sideburns.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It does a much better job then the throw-away</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE RAZOR and I&#x27;me</li>
            <li>My husband LOVES this razor and he said he&#x27;ll like it even more when he gets 100% comfortable with it!</li>
            <li>and you get a better shave.</li>
            <li>, I think that the Diamond Edge Classic is a great value.</li>
            <li>great basic razor easy to use gets a close shave and has a good grip</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got my eye on a 1906 model that looks pretty good. :)</li>
            <li>This was the cheapest double-edge razor that I could find, but they had pretty good reviews, so I ordered two of them.  </li>
            <li>, i dont, not cheep,plus who dot like a good shave, first day ,</li>
            <li>If your hair grows slower or you shave EVERY DAY religiously and want a cheap razor, this is perfect.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really need to get a better one because this one is still good.  </li>
            <li>All I wanted was a clean shave not a self sacrifice!</li>
            <li>&quot; is more accurate.</li>
            <li>but it was great until it completely fell apart and is now trash. :</li>
            <li>The blades are easy to swap.</li>
            <li>The razor has a twist handle that opens the razor for easy blade</li>
            <li>The item met my expectations, and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Butterfly design makes changing razors easy.</li>
            <li>the product has a sturdy feel and is surprisingly easy to use.</li>
            <li>This producer for its price is amazing and i am happy to say it was money well spent!</li>
            <li>Why continue wasting money on disposable shavers when you can get just a good a shave with a more enjoyable shaving experience and save money at the same time.</li>
            <li>While the razor looks nice on first appearance, looking closer: The butterfly doors do NOT close evenly.  </li>
            <li>I love the Merkur as it gives a clean comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>One attempts to compensate with more pressure to the face when using cartridge razors that are designed to wear out quickly.      </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m comfortable taking it to chin and neck.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I tagged this as a cheap safety razor, \\&quot;inexpensive\\</li>
            <li>My order was filled by Discount Jungle.</li>
            <li>it was cheap.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy your purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My order was filled by Wasatch Beauty...</li>
            <li>The safety razor is light and gives me a close shave.</li>
            <li>It does a huge number on skin irritation and combined with this razor, will leave your face as smooth as a babies a$$.</li>
            <li>The blade that came with it was duller than any cartridge razor i&#x27;ve ever used, even a cheap disposable.  </li>
            <li>He gets a smooth shave from it.</li>
            <li>It is easy to  clean  out the whiskers.</li>
            <li>I saw a TV ad for something like this and checked out what was available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Just the Ticket, take me back to the times when I started to shave and it works great.</li>
            <li>it was so cheap  </li>
            <li>love this,I looked at several stores and couldn&#x27;t find this type razor,the blades but no razor,lol,made good</li>
            <li>BUT, this is a significant caution: this is a cheaply made product - the &amp;#34;doors&amp;#34; do not line up correctly with our guidance when you are closing the razor.</li>
            <li>Made in India but good quality, I got this safety razor for my nephew who shaves all the time and has a very full beard; I was not going to get him a Merkur since I did not know if he was going to like Double Edge Razors</li>
            <li>This is a high quality razor with a nice weight and feel to it.</li>
            <li>The razor is okay if you are trying to just get a feel for this style of razor before looking into buying a higher quality one for every-day use, or using it as a travel razor.</li>
            <li>I was really excited about this purchase.  </li>
            <li>I swear this looks like the first razor I used for many years before disposables hit the market.</li>
            <li>Finding blades are not hard and you can not find this kind of razor in stores .  </li>
            <li>Not only is the shaving brush, and bar of soap cheaper to use, it is more effective than that which is sold today.  </li>
            <li>My son told me this was the way to go clean shave and save $$$.  </li>
            <li>The only good point about this razor is the replacement blades are cheap to buy.</li>
            <li>i can do one pass and be almost completely clean shaven</li>
            <li>Blades were ok, but lost their edge way too fast.</li>
            <li>It was good enough to hook me and my friends for life!</li>
            <li>makes shaving a breeze because it is so thick and 2) has lots of skin conditioners leaving your face feeling wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Going back to basics is sometimes a good thing.</li>
            <li>But it is good enough for me.</li>
            <li>This is a good starter if you&#x27;ve never used a double edge.</li>
            <li>Works good although like the more common razors it is more advisable to use a creme type lotion</li>
            <li>Not only is it easy to use, but the results are astounding.</li>
            <li>Like newer razors, it is also longer than most traditional offerings which makes it a bit more user friendly as a starter.  </li>
            <li>, has some residue on it, whole package did not look very clean.</li>
            <li>i have alittle cuts at first but as started tu use everuthing work fine thank you  </li>
            <li>Plus, the seller got it to me quick and well packaged.</li>
            <li>As I love older type of things and styles, I am a fan of safety razors etc</li>
            <li>A good safety razor will last you years anyway, so it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>This razor help tremendously</li>
            <li>you can pravent that by using a lot of shaving cream thanks for reading and one more thing it is preaty fun.</li>
            <li>To be honest, while the new one is much heavier, way more stylish and is sure to last much longer...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad i found this razor because where i live they don&#x27;t sell them in stores anymore.</li>
            <li>First safety razor!</li>
            <li>first time i bought a safety razor, and i was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>The longer handle on this razor is good for a lot of men, especially if they have large hands.  </li>
            <li>My husband really likes the smooth shave.</li>
            <li>As far as the razor itself goes I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>If I take my time, keep my face wet and use a gel type shaving cream, I get a good, close shave.</li>
            <li>Sometimes the old way is the better way.       </li>
            <li>Would not waste any more of my money on this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth what you pay for it.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was also worried about whether the razor might be more likely to slice me up than the more modern designs.</li>
            <li>I was most excited that it only costs $1 to get a pack of 5 and</li>
            <li>First let me say it arrived quickly I ordered it on Sat.</li>
            <li>Upon receiving mine I felt the same even though everything looked clean, I thoroughly disinfected it to make sure.</li>
            <li>and now I don&#x27;t know if i&#x27;m doing it right or not because my razor is all jacked up.</li>
            <li>This product shipped right to my house in under the estimated time.</li>
            <li>THE  INFORMATION WAS RIGHT</li>
            <li>It does not work right.</li>
            <li>Another great thing is I can buy a  pack of 5 replacement blades where I work (Dollar General) for only a buck!!!</li>
            <li>I grabbed this razor because it was cheap and had decent reviews.</li>
            <li>It was easy and fun to use, you feel so mature using it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using multi-bladed cartridge and disposable razors for many years, so my main concern was that a single-blade razor wouldn&#x27;t give me a decent trim.</li>
            <li>The original razor was lost in transit but amazon fixed that quickly with a replacement.  </li>
            <li>After all, I like a good shave wherever I go, and if I were to lose my razor, I can replace it for less than the cost of a pack of the multi-blade cartridges.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to find a better alternative to the modern safety razor.</li>
            <li>this is my first old fashioned razor iv tried and wow is it amazing.</li>
            <li>the base butterfly closes, ok fine, god to go ,i think what a nightmare to unfold , lather , hot, brush , good cream , ok shave, riight side,</li>
            <li>Holding the head of the razor under the hot water facet, heats up the head of the razor, and increases the effciency of the razor&#x27;s cut as the heated up razor head touches the skin, and opens up the skin&#x27;s pores.  </li>
            <li>And how many times have our razor blade cartridge manfactuors attempted to duplicate this process with various gimmicks which don&#x27;t work, from trying to heat up the soap in an arosol can to heating the cartridge razor with a battery.     </li>
            <li>The double edge razor cuts better.  </li>
            <li>those interested</li>
            <li>(thanks artofmanliness.com for the idea!)</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for My husband shaves every day and</li>
            <li>The top opens butterfly-style by rotating the ring beneath the head(a feature I like better than some of my more expensive replacements).  </li>
            <li>Why did I every pay for those \\&quot;modern\\&quot; razor blades,  These $.10 blades last longer and give me a shave I like better (not as close so</li>
            <li>I bought two of these and this was my first attempt at using a safety razor.</li>
            <li>I got this one and a two-piece razor at the same time, this one is the better of the two.</li>
            <li>It seems that it will last 5 or more years.   </li>
            <li>I will never go back to buying $6 or more razor blades...</li>
            <li>so keep that in mind you get what you pay for, however I do think I will get many years of service from this low cost alternative.</li>
            <li>but he really likes this Diamond Edge Razor!</li>
            <li>Selling used razors with used blades is very unprofessional!</li>
            <li>, head has some weight to it, ok, left side,</li>
            <li>I used it until I got the hang of it then bought a higher quality heavier one.</li>
            <li>This model has filled every expectation so far.</li>
            <li>Eventually, I will get a better model, but for now I&#x27;m hooked on the close shave of a double edge.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I had a self sacrifice.</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and buy this Diamond Edge safety razor, and you will be sold after your first shave.</li>
            <li>The supplied blades are very sharp, they do a lovely job, and it&#x27;s a comfortable</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not easy, which is good.  </li>
            <li>The butterfly opening is great and it holds the razor well, with a very small bit of the razor exposed.</li>
            <li>I was delighted to find a \\&quot;classic\\&quot; safety razor on the market for such a low price.</li>
            <li>The razor is very simple, a basic start up type as it hasn&#x27;t any adjustments therefore also good for the price.</li>
            <li>Just as good as the more expensive razors.</li>
            <li>I tried a straight razor several times, but this seems better.  </li>
            <li>I got this because of my ingrown hair issues, I have curly thick coarse hair, and while this didn&#x27;t help, it was the best shave</li>
            <li>the time it took to get here was very fast much faster</li>
            <li>The razor is light weight compared with the more expensive ones which makes it a bit more forgiving when, like a rookie, you \\&quot;press\\&quot; on it like newer style razors for a closer shave.</li>
            <li>And the proper shaving angle is easily attained.  </li>
            <li>I had decided to try single blade shaving, both as a means to save money, and to get a better feeling shave.  </li>
            <li>I use default blades; they work fine, even for starting out.  </li>
            <li>What I got was a cheap, crooked piece of junk.</li>
            <li>I have been using a modern safety razor ever since I started shaving and decided I was fed up with paying almost 20 dollars for a box of razors.</li>
            <li>I bought this razor not expecting much.  </li>
            <li>Blades are much cheaper than disposable razors.</li>
            <li>but there are a lot of cheap ways to get the same product.</li>
            <li>This thing is absolute junk.</li>
            <li>Your money would be better spent by just burning it to singe the hairs off of your face.</li>
            <li>I quote &amp;#34;in&amp;#34; because without the trap doors on the razor the blade wasn&#x27;t really in anything.</li>
            <li>The plastic handle is too light for properly balancing the head.</li>
            <li>Then again, when has shaving really ever been an emergency?  </li>
            <li>This product worked really well for me</li>
            <li>Initially before purchasing I thought this may be a light weight product made in China</li>
            <li>I dont think I&#x27;ve shaved this close to my skin before with the modern razors.</li>
            <li>Now my son wants one.  </li>
            <li>Also, the razor doesn&#x27;t fit well in smaller areas, like around the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really well</li>
            <li>thanks guys</li>
            <li>Very close shave</li>
            <li>This razor works very well</li>
            <li>This razor changed my whole outlook on shaving.</li>
            <li>and I really have no complaints at all.  </li>
            <li>But the blades are so much cheaper</li>
            <li>I plan on replacing it with a better quality razor in the near future and using this as a travel or spare.</li>
            <li>It still has enough heft in the head, however, for you to develop a good technique and feel for wet shaving.</li>
            <li>But my old razor was built better, different</li>
            <li>the  DLC head with Classic handle Weber 3-piece safety razor -- all stainless steel.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended if you feel that $30 to $40 is way too much for a double-edge razor.</li>
            <li>I was actually surprised this low cost razor does me well, wasn&#x27;t expecting much but for what it is it does its job fine for me.</li>
            <li>broke the first week of use where are the old time razors that stayed together.</li>
            <li>I checked the reviews and ordered the Diamond Edge Classic for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>The same process is achieved when putting your shaving brush under the hot water, and transfering hot water to your cheeks before administrating the soap, from the soap pan with the shaving brush.    </li>
            <li>(Again, if you are older like me)    The difference in expense speaks for it self.   </li>
            <li>These multiple cartridge type blades are designed to wear out quickly and can cost three to four dollars per throw.  </li>
            <li>I was using an antique all-metal razor that an elderly friend gave to me, but it finally broke from 50 years or more of total use.  </li>
            <li>The Diamond Edge classic razor has now become my travel razor</li>
            <li>While I was eager to try it, I was not eager to invest a ton of money into something that might not pan out, so I opted for the Diamond Edge Classic Safety Razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Razor is a decent weight.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li>The entire handle is plastic, the knurled bit at the top is what turns to open the blade doors.  </li>
            <li>open it , like it, opens form the top, screw the base, opens thetop like a wing, ok pop the blade in, make sure its in right side, theres markings actuallyon the blades 12-34 1-2 bottom 3-4 up, then screw close</li>
            <li>First one lasted a few years and this one seems better made so we will see it works so far</li>
            <li>I highly recommended going on YouTube or any video website to find an instructional video on how to shave with one of these.</li>
            <li>All in, I highly reccomend this as a starter razor or a gift for someone who hasn&#x27;t tried the safety razor \\&quot;experience\\&quot;...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another tip, use a high quality shave cream.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this for your started.</li>
            <li>Squeeze out a dime sized amount into a shaving bowl or mug, add a little hot water and use your brush to whip up a huge lather.  </li>
            <li>for.so If your into high end stuff you might want to spend a few more bucks.</li>
            <li>So far my husband really likes it.</li>
            <li>Reminds me of the old days when you felt a real shaver in your hands and not a piece of plastic.</li>
            <li>It is to top heavy.</li>
            <li>actually as good as some other more expensive razors I have used</li>
            <li>The difference in the actual shave is barely noticeable outside of perhaps a better heat transfer to the skin from the all metal construction.</li>
            <li>This was the first time any of us had tried the wet shave / safety razor technique and it was a real hit!  </li>
            <li>I was surprised to see the high prices of safety razors.</li>
            <li>With out the hassle of clogging the razor, The Razor rinses easily and the blade last a long time</li>
            <li>My first razor was a double edge safety razor</li>
            <li>I will probably invest in a higher quality handle in the future.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Diamond Edge Classic Safety Razor and Blades for my husband last year (2014) and he absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>so didn&#x27;t want to spend major money on something I might not use for more than a few weeks.</li>
            <li>Blades in separate container that was used to rid old razor blade and install new one in the razor.</li>
            <li>Those new fangled ones don&#x27;t work nearly as well.</li>
            <li>At first lets be honest, is not an expensive one, but it works...</li>
            <li>The positive reviews for this razor and the low price convinced me to buy 10 to combine with a tweezerman brush, mug and shaving soap as a gift for my guy friends... and myself.</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re dollar tight, this razor will save you tons of money since replacement blades are cheap compared to the disposables.</li>
            <li>This is an inexpensive way to see if single blade shaving is right for you.</li>
            <li>The double edge razor does not require as much pressure as the cartridge razor.</li>
            <li>To begin with, the product is completely unusable.</li>
            <li>and far between) that I may need to shave there.</li>
            <li>it was okay for the price and the quality was tolerable if not effective .</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my husband, he wanted the old fashioned razor and it is just what he wanted.</li>
            <li>I LIKE AND OLD FASHION SHAVE.</li>
            <li>This old school razor gives me the closest shave I&#x27;ve had in a while.</li>
            <li>If you want a close shave, go old school.</li>
            <li>I got it for my husband but his skin is too sensitive for it</li>
            <li>hubby uses along with old fashion shaving brush.  </li>
            <li>Does work as good as those expensive throw disposables?</li>
            <li>I usually suffer from razor burn and get skin irratation easily.  </li>
            <li>I have no doubt that you can buy better razors, but for the money (and especially if you are not sure if you will like this type of razor)</li>
            <li>The first razor,which was significantly more expensive than this one.  </li>
            <li>So far I have successfully shaved twice with this one while avoiding cutting myself.</li>
            <li>De89bl Double Edge Safety Razor Chrome Plated and i recommend and the Merkur \\&quot;1904\\&quot; Classic Safety Razor - Open-#41- Made in Germany and the Merkur \\&quot;1904\\&quot; Safety Razor 42C</li>
            <li>This razor is not bad just a little overpriced.</li>
            <li>I first looked at it, the black plastic handle did not inspire me to think it was a high quality item.  </li>
            <li>If you hair grows thick and fast and you don&#x27;t want to open it to clean it every stroke,..</li>
            <li>I used the Mach 3 for years, then switched to Gillette Sensor Excel, which was a major improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He shaves every other day and it doesn&#x27;t bother him at all, very close shave!</li>
            <li>and therefore can result in cuts if the user is not careful.   </li>
            <li>this is the closest shave you could ever hope to get, outside of a professional barber.  </li>
            <li>I had a double edged razor like this when I was young.</li>
            <li>when I looked at this, It looked the same as my old one.</li>
            <li>The razor it heavy in hand, but it feels right.</li>
            <li>The blade protrudes farther on one side than the other regardless of how much you try to adjust it.</li>
            <li>Yes, the handle is lightweight plastic, but seems durable enough to last a long time with a reasonable amount of care.  </li>
            <li>You can get packs of blades at Dollar General for next to nothing.</li>
            <li>First, the doors don&#x27;t close correctly, the outer corner juts out on both sides making both side uneven.</li>
            <li>I have several safety razors and it&#x27;s just simply worth spending the few extra bucks for a Murker or something else.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this I had a small cut on my left jaw line although it was no biggie since I barely noticed the cut after I was done shaving.</li>
            <li>(as other brands cost a lot more) The lot of razors that mine came from seem to be a little off because the safety bars aren&#x27;t even depths, making the blade edge further away from the skin on one end of the razor than the other; giving the appearance that the blade seats crooked.</li>

            <li> Seller was great.</li>
            <li> blades are great value considering price of razors today.  </li>
            <li> This seller should check their returns more thoroughly!!  </li>
            <li> Very nice product.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews, and people said it was a good starter razor.</li>
            <li> it were good</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t anything fancy, just a good razor.</li>

            <li> With a good blade, this will probably suffice as a travel razor.</li>
            <li> Good buy for the money.</li>
            <li> It was a good buy.</li>
            <li> Good decision.</li>
            <li> good to get started with or as a backup or travel razor.  </li>
            <li> Now I am not throwing away good razor blades because they are packed with whiskers-</li>
            <li> Just like the title says, for the price it&#x27;s a good starter safety razor.  </li>
            <li> before it was in, cool, and retro like now, I got a perfect shave.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the service also.</li>
            <li> this are rely good price OK guys have a good day bye.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this razor!</li>
            <li> Their service was great and was delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li> thats amazing.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product because it&#x27;s amazing, and also its way cheaper</li>
            <li> The rewards are amazing if you do.</li>
            <li> but once you get the hang of it its amazing.</li>
            <li> Lathering your own soap is a lost art.  </li>
            <li> Nice to know they are still out there as that is what my husband loves to use.</li>
            <li> Personally, I liked this razor.  </li>
            <li> However, when I picked it up, it had a nice heft to it, and it functioned admirably.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a nice intro to this \\&quot;old-school\\&quot; way of shaving though.</li>
            <li> and if it lasts a couple of years its cost effective</li>
            <li> so you can decide if you like this kind of razor.</li>
            <li> ok this is a good handel,.solid</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice quality.</li>
            <li> kind.</li>
            <li> To be quite honest with you, I&#x27;ve tried the 2, and 3 blade injector models, and all they manage to do is clog.</li>
            <li> , at this point, I have no idea how the razor industry managed to get people to move away from this kind of razor--</li>
            <li> Nice close shave  </li>
            <li> This particular Shave Cream is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I missed my safety razor that I had for years and didn&#x27;t remember how good it felt to have a clean shave!  </li>
            <li> It has a very nice weight to it and quite durable, although the handle is a bit ehh its pretty freakin good.</li>
            <li> Plastic handle VERY light, having used a steel razor before meant some getting used to - comfortable shave, great value.</li>
            <li> i got it fast and sealed nicely for a great first use, also great price  !!</li>
            <li> How many more are they going to add to get a shave as good as one safety razor?</li>
            <li> make sure you have nice cream or soap to use with and not the can stuff as it does not work with that type of razor.  </li>
            <li> This is a good starter razor, but IS cheaply constructed, and will fall apart eventually.</li>
            <li> Having said that, it&#x27;s a great little razor, perfect for starters.  </li>
            <li> But after the first use I knew it was a great product.</li>
            <li> However, the Diamond Edge Safety Razor is very cheaply made...</li>
            <li> Does the job, but is very light.</li>
            <li> You find a better razor for the price anywhere.</li>
            <li> it arrived, she gave it a try and was really pleased with it.</li>
            <li> It gave her a nice close shave with no nicks or cuts on her legs, leaving them smooth and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and was glad that I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> The more I use this razor to shave, the better a shave I get and without any cuts or razor burn</li>
            <li> My problem for the most part comes with the packaging, as another reviewer stated it seems their razor had been used.</li>
            <li> If you have never had a proper shave or if it has been years since you had one, this is a wonderful way to remind yourself what it used to be like years ago.</li>
            <li> makes it even better.  </li>
            <li> I love this double-edged razor...</li>
            <li> I am still using it and love the hell out of it.  </li>
            <li> I love that product</li>
            <li> The thing shaves hairs like magic though.  </li>
            <li> Still better than a cartridge razor.</li>
            <li> You can always upgrade and buy an awesome $30+ razor later.  </li>
            <li> My husband says it is so much better than the disposable razors.  </li>
            <li> Husband is satisfied with the  razor.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s 10 times better.</li>
            <li> kidding really, ok so this is the &#x27;2&amp;#34;: second shaver i bought the best$ could find here on amazon</li>
            <li> more soap, pop, the top hinge comes off THE DAME HANDEL, WITH THE BLADE IN IT,</li>
            <li> Would prefer to pay more and be more satisfied.</li>
            <li> It is still better than almost anything for getting edges and sideburns.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It does a much better job then the throw-away</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE RAZOR and I&#x27;me</li>
            <li> My husband LOVES this razor and he said he&#x27;ll like it even more when he gets 100% comfortable with it!</li>
            <li> and you get a better shave.</li>
            <li> , I think that the Diamond Edge Classic is a great value.</li>
            <li> great basic razor easy to use gets a close shave and has a good grip</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got my eye on a 1906 model that looks pretty good. :)</li>
            <li> This was the cheapest double-edge razor that I could find, but they had pretty good reviews, so I ordered two of them.  </li>
            <li> , i dont, not cheep,plus who dot like a good shave, first day ,</li>
            <li> If your hair grows slower or you shave EVERY DAY religiously and want a cheap razor, this is perfect.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really need to get a better one because this one is still good.  </li>
            <li> All I wanted was a clean shave not a self sacrifice!</li>
            <li> &quot; is more accurate.</li>
            <li> but it was great until it completely fell apart and is now trash. :</li>
            <li> The blades are easy to swap.</li>
            <li> The razor has a twist handle that opens the razor for easy blade</li>
            <li> The item met my expectations, and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Butterfly design makes changing razors easy.</li>
            <li> the product has a sturdy feel and is surprisingly easy to use.</li>
            <li> This producer for its price is amazing and i am happy to say it was money well spent!</li>
            <li> Why continue wasting money on disposable shavers when you can get just a good a shave with a more enjoyable shaving experience and save money at the same time.</li>
            <li> While the razor looks nice on first appearance, looking closer: The butterfly doors do NOT close evenly.  </li>
            <li> I love the Merkur as it gives a clean comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> One attempts to compensate with more pressure to the face when using cartridge razors that are designed to wear out quickly.      </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m comfortable taking it to chin and neck.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I tagged this as a cheap safety razor, \\&quot;inexpensive\\</li>
            <li> My order was filled by Discount Jungle.</li>
            <li> it was cheap.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy your purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My order was filled by Wasatch Beauty...</li>
            <li> The safety razor is light and gives me a close shave.</li>
            <li> It does a huge number on skin irritation and combined with this razor, will leave your face as smooth as a babies a$$.</li>
            <li> The blade that came with it was duller than any cartridge razor i&#x27;ve ever used, even a cheap disposable.  </li>
            <li> He gets a smooth shave from it.</li>
            <li> It is easy to  clean  out the whiskers.</li>
            <li> I saw a TV ad for something like this and checked out what was available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Just the Ticket, take me back to the times when I started to shave and it works great.</li>
            <li> it was so cheap  </li>
            <li> love this,I looked at several stores and couldn&#x27;t find this type razor,the blades but no razor,lol,made good</li>
            <li> BUT, this is a significant caution: this is a cheaply made product - the &amp;#34;doors&amp;#34; do not line up correctly with our guidance when you are closing the razor.</li>
            <li> Made in India but good quality, I got this safety razor for my nephew who shaves all the time and has a very full beard; I was not going to get him a Merkur since I did not know if he was going to like Double Edge Razors</li>
            <li> This is a high quality razor with a nice weight and feel to it.</li>
            <li> The razor is okay if you are trying to just get a feel for this style of razor before looking into buying a higher quality one for every-day use, or using it as a travel razor.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this purchase.  </li>
            <li> I swear this looks like the first razor I used for many years before disposables hit the market.</li>
            <li> Finding blades are not hard and you can not find this kind of razor in stores .  </li>
            <li> Not only is the shaving brush, and bar of soap cheaper to use, it is more effective than that which is sold today.  </li>
            <li> My son told me this was the way to go clean shave and save $$$.  </li>
            <li> The only good point about this razor is the replacement blades are cheap to buy.</li>
            <li> i can do one pass and be almost completely clean shaven</li>
            <li> Blades were ok, but lost their edge way too fast.</li>
            <li> It was good enough to hook me and my friends for life!</li>
            <li> makes shaving a breeze because it is so thick and 2) has lots of skin conditioners leaving your face feeling wonderful.  </li>
            <li> Going back to basics is sometimes a good thing.</li>
            <li> But it is good enough for me.</li>
            <li> This is a good starter if you&#x27;ve never used a double edge.</li>
            <li> Works good although like the more common razors it is more advisable to use a creme type lotion</li>
            <li> Not only is it easy to use, but the results are astounding.</li>
            <li> Like newer razors, it is also longer than most traditional offerings which makes it a bit more user friendly as a starter.  </li>
            <li> , has some residue on it, whole package did not look very clean.</li>
            <li> i have alittle cuts at first but as started tu use everuthing work fine thank you  </li>
            <li> Plus, the seller got it to me quick and well packaged.</li>
            <li> As I love older type of things and styles, I am a fan of safety razors etc</li>
            <li> A good safety razor will last you years anyway, so it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> This razor help tremendously</li>
            <li> you can pravent that by using a lot of shaving cream thanks for reading and one more thing it is preaty fun.</li>
            <li> To be honest, while the new one is much heavier, way more stylish and is sure to last much longer...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad i found this razor because where i live they don&#x27;t sell them in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> First safety razor!</li>
            <li> first time i bought a safety razor, and i was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> The longer handle on this razor is good for a lot of men, especially if they have large hands.  </li>
            <li> My husband really likes the smooth shave.</li>
            <li> As far as the razor itself goes I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> If I take my time, keep my face wet and use a gel type shaving cream, I get a good, close shave.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the old way is the better way.       </li>
            <li> Would not waste any more of my money on this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth what you pay for it.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was also worried about whether the razor might be more likely to slice me up than the more modern designs.</li>
            <li> I was most excited that it only costs $1 to get a pack of 5 and</li>
            <li> First let me say it arrived quickly I ordered it on Sat.</li>
            <li> Upon receiving mine I felt the same even though everything looked clean, I thoroughly disinfected it to make sure.</li>
            <li> and now I don&#x27;t know if i&#x27;m doing it right or not because my razor is all jacked up.</li>
            <li> This product shipped right to my house in under the estimated time.</li>
            <li> THE  INFORMATION WAS RIGHT</li>
            <li> It does not work right.</li>
            <li> Another great thing is I can buy a  pack of 5 replacement blades where I work (Dollar General) for only a buck!!!</li>
            <li> I grabbed this razor because it was cheap and had decent reviews.</li>
            <li> It was easy and fun to use, you feel so mature using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using multi-bladed cartridge and disposable razors for many years, so my main concern was that a single-blade razor wouldn&#x27;t give me a decent trim.</li>
            <li> The original razor was lost in transit but amazon fixed that quickly with a replacement.  </li>
            <li> After all, I like a good shave wherever I go, and if I were to lose my razor, I can replace it for less than the cost of a pack of the multi-blade cartridges.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to find a better alternative to the modern safety razor.</li>
            <li> this is my first old fashioned razor iv tried and wow is it amazing.</li>
            <li> the base butterfly closes, ok fine, god to go ,i think what a nightmare to unfold , lather , hot, brush , good cream , ok shave, riight side,</li>
            <li> Holding the head of the razor under the hot water facet, heats up the head of the razor, and increases the effciency of the razor&#x27;s cut as the heated up razor head touches the skin, and opens up the skin&#x27;s pores.  </li>
            <li> And how many times have our razor blade cartridge manfactuors attempted to duplicate this process with various gimmicks which don&#x27;t work, from trying to heat up the soap in an arosol can to heating the cartridge razor with a battery.     </li>
            <li> The double edge razor cuts better.  </li>
            <li> those interested</li>
            <li> (thanks artofmanliness.com for the idea!)</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for My husband shaves every day and</li>
            <li> The top opens butterfly-style by rotating the ring beneath the head(a feature I like better than some of my more expensive replacements).  </li>
            <li> Why did I every pay for those \\&quot;modern\\&quot; razor blades,  These $.10 blades last longer and give me a shave I like better (not as close so</li>
            <li> I bought two of these and this was my first attempt at using a safety razor.</li>
            <li> I got this one and a two-piece razor at the same time, this one is the better of the two.</li>
            <li> It seems that it will last 5 or more years.   </li>
            <li> I will never go back to buying $6 or more razor blades...</li>
            <li> so keep that in mind you get what you pay for, however I do think I will get many years of service from this low cost alternative.</li>
            <li> but he really likes this Diamond Edge Razor!</li>
            <li> Selling used razors with used blades is very unprofessional!</li>
            <li> , head has some weight to it, ok, left side,</li>
            <li> I used it until I got the hang of it then bought a higher quality heavier one.</li>
            <li> This model has filled every expectation so far.</li>
            <li> Eventually, I will get a better model, but for now I&#x27;m hooked on the close shave of a double edge.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I had a self sacrifice.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and buy this Diamond Edge safety razor, and you will be sold after your first shave.</li>
            <li> The supplied blades are very sharp, they do a lovely job, and it&#x27;s a comfortable</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy, which is good.  </li>
            <li> The butterfly opening is great and it holds the razor well, with a very small bit of the razor exposed.</li>
            <li> I was delighted to find a \\&quot;classic\\&quot; safety razor on the market for such a low price.</li>
            <li> The razor is very simple, a basic start up type as it hasn&#x27;t any adjustments therefore also good for the price.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the more expensive razors.</li>
            <li> I tried a straight razor several times, but this seems better.  </li>
            <li> I got this because of my ingrown hair issues, I have curly thick coarse hair, and while this didn&#x27;t help, it was the best shave</li>
            <li> the time it took to get here was very fast much faster</li>
            <li> The razor is light weight compared with the more expensive ones which makes it a bit more forgiving when, like a rookie, you \\&quot;press\\&quot; on it like newer style razors for a closer shave.</li>
            <li> And the proper shaving angle is easily attained.  </li>
            <li> I had decided to try single blade shaving, both as a means to save money, and to get a better feeling shave.  </li>
            <li> I use default blades; they work fine, even for starting out.  </li>
            <li> What I got was a cheap, crooked piece of junk.</li>
            <li> I have been using a modern safety razor ever since I started shaving and decided I was fed up with paying almost 20 dollars for a box of razors.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor not expecting much.  </li>
            <li> Blades are much cheaper than disposable razors.</li>
            <li> but there are a lot of cheap ways to get the same product.</li>
            <li> This thing is absolute junk.</li>
            <li> Your money would be better spent by just burning it to singe the hairs off of your face.</li>
            <li> I quote &amp;#34;in&amp;#34; because without the trap doors on the razor the blade wasn&#x27;t really in anything.</li>
            <li> The plastic handle is too light for properly balancing the head.</li>
            <li> Then again, when has shaving really ever been an emergency?  </li>
            <li> This product worked really well for me</li>
            <li> Initially before purchasing I thought this may be a light weight product made in China</li>
            <li> I dont think I&#x27;ve shaved this close to my skin before with the modern razors.</li>
            <li> Now my son wants one.  </li>
            <li> Also, the razor doesn&#x27;t fit well in smaller areas, like around the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> really well</li>
            <li> thanks guys</li>
            <li> Very close shave</li>
            <li> This razor works very well</li>
            <li> This razor changed my whole outlook on shaving.</li>
            <li> and I really have no complaints at all.  </li>
            <li> But the blades are so much cheaper</li>
            <li> I plan on replacing it with a better quality razor in the near future and using this as a travel or spare.</li>
            <li> It still has enough heft in the head, however, for you to develop a good technique and feel for wet shaving.</li>
            <li> But my old razor was built better, different</li>
            <li> the  DLC head with Classic handle Weber 3-piece safety razor -- all stainless steel.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended if you feel that $30 to $40 is way too much for a double-edge razor.</li>
            <li> I was actually surprised this low cost razor does me well, wasn&#x27;t expecting much but for what it is it does its job fine for me.</li>
            <li> broke the first week of use where are the old time razors that stayed together.</li>
            <li> I checked the reviews and ordered the Diamond Edge Classic for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> The same process is achieved when putting your shaving brush under the hot water, and transfering hot water to your cheeks before administrating the soap, from the soap pan with the shaving brush.    </li>
            <li> (Again, if you are older like me)    The difference in expense speaks for it self.   </li>
            <li> These multiple cartridge type blades are designed to wear out quickly and can cost three to four dollars per throw.  </li>
            <li> I was using an antique all-metal razor that an elderly friend gave to me, but it finally broke from 50 years or more of total use.  </li>
            <li> The Diamond Edge classic razor has now become my travel razor</li>
            <li> While I was eager to try it, I was not eager to invest a ton of money into something that might not pan out, so I opted for the Diamond Edge Classic Safety Razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Razor is a decent weight.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> The entire handle is plastic, the knurled bit at the top is what turns to open the blade doors.  </li>
            <li> open it , like it, opens form the top, screw the base, opens thetop like a wing, ok pop the blade in, make sure its in right side, theres markings actuallyon the blades 12-34 1-2 bottom 3-4 up, then screw close</li>
            <li> First one lasted a few years and this one seems better made so we will see it works so far</li>
            <li> I highly recommended going on YouTube or any video website to find an instructional video on how to shave with one of these.</li>
            <li> All in, I highly reccomend this as a starter razor or a gift for someone who hasn&#x27;t tried the safety razor \\&quot;experience\\&quot;...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another tip, use a high quality shave cream.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this for your started.</li>
            <li> Squeeze out a dime sized amount into a shaving bowl or mug, add a little hot water and use your brush to whip up a huge lather.  </li>
            <li> for.so If your into high end stuff you might want to spend a few more bucks.</li>
            <li> So far my husband really likes it.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of the old days when you felt a real shaver in your hands and not a piece of plastic.</li>
            <li> It is to top heavy.</li>
            <li> actually as good as some other more expensive razors I have used</li>
            <li> The difference in the actual shave is barely noticeable outside of perhaps a better heat transfer to the skin from the all metal construction.</li>
            <li> This was the first time any of us had tried the wet shave / safety razor technique and it was a real hit!  </li>
            <li> I was surprised to see the high prices of safety razors.</li>
            <li> With out the hassle of clogging the razor, The Razor rinses easily and the blade last a long time</li>
            <li> My first razor was a double edge safety razor</li>
            <li> I will probably invest in a higher quality handle in the future.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Diamond Edge Classic Safety Razor and Blades for my husband last year (2014) and he absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> so didn&#x27;t want to spend major money on something I might not use for more than a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Blades in separate container that was used to rid old razor blade and install new one in the razor.</li>
            <li> Those new fangled ones don&#x27;t work nearly as well.</li>
            <li> At first lets be honest, is not an expensive one, but it works...</li>
            <li> The positive reviews for this razor and the low price convinced me to buy 10 to combine with a tweezerman brush, mug and shaving soap as a gift for my guy friends... and myself.</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re dollar tight, this razor will save you tons of money since replacement blades are cheap compared to the disposables.</li>
            <li> This is an inexpensive way to see if single blade shaving is right for you.</li>
            <li> The double edge razor does not require as much pressure as the cartridge razor.</li>
            <li> To begin with, the product is completely unusable.</li>
            <li> and far between) that I may need to shave there.</li>
            <li> it was okay for the price and the quality was tolerable if not effective .</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband, he wanted the old fashioned razor and it is just what he wanted.</li>
            <li> I LIKE AND OLD FASHION SHAVE.</li>
            <li> This old school razor gives me the closest shave I&#x27;ve had in a while.</li>
            <li> If you want a close shave, go old school.</li>
            <li> I got it for my husband but his skin is too sensitive for it</li>
            <li> hubby uses along with old fashion shaving brush.  </li>
            <li> Does work as good as those expensive throw disposables?</li>
            <li> I usually suffer from razor burn and get skin irratation easily.  </li>
            <li> I have no doubt that you can buy better razors, but for the money (and especially if you are not sure if you will like this type of razor)</li>
            <li> The first razor,which was significantly more expensive than this one.  </li>
            <li> So far I have successfully shaved twice with this one while avoiding cutting myself.</li>
            <li> De89bl Double Edge Safety Razor Chrome Plated and i recommend and the Merkur \\&quot;1904\\&quot; Classic Safety Razor - Open-#41- Made in Germany and the Merkur \\&quot;1904\\&quot; Safety Razor 42C</li>
            <li> This razor is not bad just a little overpriced.</li>
            <li> I first looked at it, the black plastic handle did not inspire me to think it was a high quality item.  </li>
            <li> If you hair grows thick and fast and you don&#x27;t want to open it to clean it every stroke,..</li>
            <li> I used the Mach 3 for years, then switched to Gillette Sensor Excel, which was a major improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He shaves every other day and it doesn&#x27;t bother him at all, very close shave!</li>
            <li> and therefore can result in cuts if the user is not careful.   </li>
            <li> this is the closest shave you could ever hope to get, outside of a professional barber.  </li>
            <li> I had a double edged razor like this when I was young.</li>
            <li> when I looked at this, It looked the same as my old one.</li>
            <li> The razor it heavy in hand, but it feels right.</li>
            <li> The blade protrudes farther on one side than the other regardless of how much you try to adjust it.</li>
            <li> Yes, the handle is lightweight plastic, but seems durable enough to last a long time with a reasonable amount of care.  </li>
            <li> You can get packs of blades at Dollar General for next to nothing.</li>
            <li> First, the doors don&#x27;t close correctly, the outer corner juts out on both sides making both side uneven.</li>
            <li> I have several safety razors and it&#x27;s just simply worth spending the few extra bucks for a Murker or something else.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this I had a small cut on my left jaw line although it was no biggie since I barely noticed the cut after I was done shaving.</li>
            <li> (as other brands cost a lot more) The lot of razors that mine came from seem to be a little off because the safety bars aren&#x27;t even depths, making the blade edge further away from the skin on one end of the razor than the other; giving the appearance that the blade seats crooked.</li>
            <li> Although im new to this type of razor i get it down pat almost instantly but that might differ from person to person.</li>
            <li> soap and razor purchased elsewhere) for less than my normal cartridge refill.</li>
            <li> wit it, take little time to get use to, and i highly recommend going to badgerandblade.com to get some advice, also g on YouTube and watch Mantic59 videos.    </li>
            <li> Only real complaint is the gearing inside is obviously cheap because it stutters, but always closes after a couple tried (when it sticks).</li>
            <li> I had owned a classic safety razor years ago, but misplaced it.</li>
            <li> Consequently, when you put the blade in, it is sticking out too far on one end and not far enough on the other.  </li>
            <li> I had my dad&#x27;s old safety razor from his days in the military but somehow it was misplaced in a move, no comparison to the shave his old razor gave.</li>
            <li> The Main issue I have is that you are limited to smaller strokes due to hair getting stuck on the blade due to a lack of clearance.</li>
            <li> He went back to the single edge blade.</li>
            <li> The other one I bought for my dad who has always used the safety razor but for the last 7-8 years he was stuck using the Gillette/Schick or what not since he couldnt find one at the local stores.</li>
            <li> One side will have an end still partially open while the other end prevents further closure.  </li>
            <li> This razor is a keeper, especially at the price, and I will never go back to conventional razors again.</li>
            <li> Lousy balance and feels cheap to the touch.</li>
            <li> It works, so as long as you have patience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That is how I rate blades,  how long you can count on them holding a edge.</li>
            <li> So if you want a back up razor, or a newbie wanting to wet your feet without breaking the bank, buy it.</li>
            <li> This other item seems to be the  same handle except</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have noted, the razor does not close to hold the blade properly.</li>
            <li> The razors handle is made of cheap hollow plastic, and it was broken in half when it came in the mail.</li>
            <li> You can make your soap as thick or as thin asyou want and not have to be satisfied with what you get out of a can or a tube.    </li>
            <li> I an not new to shaving</li>
            <li> Thought it was going to be a let down, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, this razor costs less than ten bucks, depending on which vendor supplies your amazon order.  </li>
            <li> handle although plastic looks quite solid unlike previous reviewers mentioned.</li>
            <li> started off slow at first, but you get a feel of how to use it after a few times shaving.</li>
            <li> You should use as little pressure as needed, and the edge of the blade must be perpendicular to your face as possible.  </li>
            <li> I cannot get a comfortable shave with it, frequently cutting or getting shaving rash.  </li>
            <li> The plastic handle on this razor solved the holding slipping problem, and the butterfly doors stay shut.  </li>
            <li> then I was only out a few bucks.  </li>
            <li> and you have to be really careful using it because it will nick your face.  </li>
            <li> The blades do not seem to be seated correctly on one side and makes the blade look uneven and slightly crooked.</li>
            <li> If you want to try de shaving spent 40$ and get one that is quality and won&#x27;t cut ur face off.</li>
            <li> Poor quality and craftsmanship, Blade won&#x27;t sit straight, lid will not close evenly.</li>
            <li> Used one like this in the Military</li>
            <li> Cheap pakistani piece of crap, stay far away.</li>
            <li> There is definitely a technique to using one, it just takes a few tries to nail it.</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t for this clearance issue I would have continued to use it, but my shaves take twice as long vs other razors when I hadn&#x27;t shaved the previous day.    </li>
            <li> This razor is also lighter than the other, which makes it easier to control while shaving.     </li>
            <li> One wing of the head is mounted on the other to close.</li>
            <li> it came loaded with a gillete blade but came with 5 other off brand ones.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about this razor at first.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s still sharp.</li>
            <li> In fairness, this could have been partly due to postal delays.</li>
            <li> First ill say estamated sniping date was the 15</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way.  </li>
            <li> I broke down and spent the money on a German made razor and the difference is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> My only criticism for the razor was that the replacement blades included were not very good.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is the length of time it took to arrive.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is with the weight...</li>
            <li> When shaving your legs, use a shaving gel or cream and let the blade glide over your skin--don&#x27;t press the blade down against the skin.</li>
            <li> I WAS NOT LET DOWN.</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I think my dad probably has lost the touch to shave using the safety razor since he quit using this razor after a few nicks and cuts the first few days he tried shaving.</li>
            <li> I have had to relearn what was common thirty years ago, and have had little problems doing the same.    </li>
            <li> The razor is very sharp and would do well for beards.  </li>
            <li> I think they go for less than $2.00 in India.</li>
            <li> however I found it difficult finding proper blades in my local stores.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;What is not to like about spending half your paycheck for razor blades.</li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong, especially since it comes with 10 blades which is enough for a few weeks</li>
            <li> , you&#x27;ll probably cut yourself a few times and even end up with razor burn too, but hands down</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean foam, gels or even the expensive &amp;#34;cream in a tub&amp;#34; shave creams like Lab Series, (Although I am a huge fan, Lab Series can be too thick.)</li>
            <li> A little nitpicky given the price, I know.  </li>
            <li> You need to add a little pressure to get it where you want.</li>
            <li> but they are getting ridiculously expensive and do not last very long.</li>
            <li> I am already saving lots money on blades and believe that this razor will pay for itself in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> The razors head also looked uneven.</li>
            <li> I got this razor in the mail few days ago along with few Gillette 7 o&#x60;clock blades.</li>
            <li> Mine cam in the package missing part of the door and as soon as I opened the package the rest of the door fell off.</li>
            <li> Made in Pakistan, this razor&#x27;s middle ridge that the blade fits over is too thin.  </li>
            <li> and I have been using it for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> and then just catch the few hairs missed.</li>
            <li> Can be frustrating using a short one.</li>
            <li> This razor isn&#x27;t all that heavy</li>
            <li> Take it slowly, and carefully.</li>
            <li> The razor is not what I expected, not good quality.</li>
            <li> This is one item where the cheap price doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s crap.</li>
            <li> It comes in a small metal tube.  </li>
            <li> It proved to be too heavy, and was difficult to hold and had butterfly doors that became loose while using the razor.  </li>
            <li> It glides across your face so effortlessly, you can hardly tell it is cutting the facial hair, and it cuts shaving time down dramatically.</li>
            <li> The is just due to the poor butterfly mechanism as it does not seem to be aligned.</li>
            <li> Like this product -- for price it hard to beat.  </li>
            <li> they never got the chance to get dull.</li>
            <li> The Razor itself isn&#x27;t terrible, I was actually quite surprised at the value.</li>
            <li> It shaves well enough but feel awkward in the hand.</li>
            <li> the crazy cost of 3 bade razors, 5 blade razors; I went back to the safety razor.</li>
            <li> beard grows slow and I may have to shave every 2 or 3 days</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it was less expensive and if i didn&#x27;t like the product</li>
            <li> Not a good product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would tell anyone looking for a travel, beginner, or everyday razor that you cant go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> Not a good situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Got this to make the transition to safety razor (sick to death of disposables lasting 2 days).</li>
            <li> These types of blades are crazy sharp, like Gin-zu&#x27;s for your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> got tired of throwing all those disposable razors away not even used and dull poorly made.</li>
            <li> The prices of new all-metal razors gave me a bad case of sticker shock!  </li>
            <li> the other products out there are very expensive and this is the way to go .  </li>
            <li> Mine was fulfilled by cosmeticbeautyplace and the product is of poor quality.</li>
            <li> I was tired of getting razor bumps and ingrown hairs from shaving while using triple or quada bladed razors.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much to do wrong with this.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I ordered this razor.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t expensive made but it works well.</li>
            <li> how about sending another one prove me wrong if it works ill reove the feedback, dont it stays , its thet ruth make that up1</li>
            <li> Sad</li>
            <li> I am so done with the fancy garbage out there and the absolutely silly price of blades.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve switched.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> I was afraid to put it to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Furthermore, the blade that was already in looked a bit dirty (and oily).</li>
            <li> I was afraid to shave with it.  </li>
            <li> i was afraid to use it-tossed it in trash</li>
            <li> This leaves the edge of the blade at an angle making it impossible to shave without cutting your cheek or neck.  </li>
            <li> The razor has bad termination.</li>
            <li> but I had a bad feeling about it.</li>
            <li> The Razor is the worst I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> would not recommend this razor to my worst enemy.</li>
            <li> Absolutely disgusting and unsanitary.  </li>
            <li> you get what you pay for horrible Product you need to buy the Edwin Jagger</li>

            <li> I ordered this double edge safety razor to introduce me to safety razors and see if I like it. What I got was a cheap, crooked piece of junk. First, the doors don&#x27;t close correctly, the outer corner juts out on both sides making both side uneven. Second the head itself is crooked and there is a crooked gap above the blade on both sides. The blade protrudes farther on one side than the other regardless of how much you try to adjust it. I bought this to try to learn to shave with before I got a legitimate one and now I don&#x27;t know if i&#x27;m doing it right or not because my razor is all jacked up. Cheap pakistani piece of crap, stay far away.</li>
            <li> My first razor was a double edge safety razor and I&#x27;ve had several since but I always seemed to lose them. After spending years using disposable razors and paying a fortune for disposable blades I finally got this razor. First let me say it arrived quickly I ordered it on Sat. and I got it on Mon. As far as the razor itself goes I couldn&#x27;t ask for more. It&#x27;s in perfect condition, and the shave is great. I would recommend this to anyone. You find a better razor for the price anywhere.</li>
            <li> My daughter (who is in college) was complaining that the triple-edged cartridges for her razor have become so expensive that she can&#x27;t afford them any more. So, I decided to see if we could still buy the old-style double-edged safety razor. I looked on Amazon.com (my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; store for just about everything) and there they were! I checked the reviews and ordered the Diamond Edge Classic for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it arrived, she gave it a try and was really pleased with it. It gave her a nice close shave with no nicks or cuts on her legs, leaving them smooth and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She loves it, and I&#x27;m going to get one, too. For all the women out there, we recommend that you buy yourself a safety razor to save money on razor blades and still get a silky shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One warning, ladies. When shaving your legs, use a shaving gel or cream and let the blade glide over your skin--don&#x27;t press the blade down against the skin. That&#x27;s what causes the nicks and razor burn.</li>
            <li> Made this purchase after reading some helpful \\&quot;how to use\\&quot; reviews on Amazon &amp; the net. I did not want to spend a lot of money on one of these, so I went with this brand/model. I followed the suggestions of various reviewers (a must if you are going to buy a razor of this type!) and was glad that I made the purchase. I may even consider a more expensive razor and keep this one as a spare/travel razor at some point in time. I am already saving lots money on blades and believe that this razor will pay for itself in a few weeks. If I take my time, keep my face wet and use a gel type shaving cream, I get a good, close shave. The more I use this razor to shave, the better a shave I get and without any cuts or razor burn and I&#x27;m getting faster. I have no doubt that you can buy better razors, but for the money (and especially if you are not sure if you will like this type of razor), I think that the Diamond Edge Classic is a great value. Plus, the seller got it to me quick and well packaged.</li>
            <li> This was the purchase of my second double edge razor.  The first razor,which was significantly more expensive than this one.  It proved to be too heavy, and was difficult to hold and had butterfly doors that became loose while using the razor.  The plastic handle on this razor solved the holding slipping problem, and the butterfly doors stay shut.  This razor is also lighter than the other, which makes it easier to control while shaving.     And now I remember some of the advantages of using a double edge razor when compared to the cartridge type.  Holding the head of the razor under the hot water facet, heats up the head of the razor, and increases the effciency of the razor&#x27;s cut as the heated up razor head touches the skin, and opens up the skin&#x27;s pores.  The same process is achieved when putting your shaving brush under the hot water, and transfering hot water to your cheeks before administrating the soap, from the soap pan with the shaving brush.    And how many times have our razor blade cartridge manfactuors attempted to duplicate this process with various gimmicks which don&#x27;t work, from trying to heat up the soap in an arosol can to heating the cartridge razor with a battery.     Sometimes the old way is the better way.       One must relearn how to shave with the double edge razor.  The double edge razor does not require as much pressure as the cartridge razor. One is tempted to use extra pressure with the cartridge razor, which wears out after a couple of days of use.  One attempts to compensate with more pressure to the face when using cartridge razors that are designed to wear out quickly.      The double edge razor cuts better.  Therefore you have to learn how to use it. (Again, if you are older like me)    The difference in expense speaks for it self.   Not only is the shaving brush, and bar of soap cheaper to use, it is more effective than that which is sold today.  Lathering your own soap is a lost art.  You can make your soap as thick or as thin asyou want and not have to be satisfied with what you get out of a can or a tube.    You may have to teach your self how to shave again with the double edge razor, especially if you are a younger person. I have had to relearn what was common thirty years ago, and have had little problems doing the same.    You must teach yourself to have a lighter hand when using the double edge razor.  It&#x27;s a lot sharper than the different cartridge types. and therefore can result in cuts if the user is not careful.   These multiple cartridge type blades are designed to wear out quickly and can cost three to four dollars per throw.  Therefore the shaver uses heavier pressure to make the cartridge blade go further The double edge razor blades are about a nickel a piece and last a lot longer than the cartridge type.    Once you learn to use the double edge razor, you will see that the shaving is done a lot faster then when shaving with a cartridge razor.     Goodbye, cartridge razor companies.</li>
            <li> I have been using a modern safety razor ever since I started shaving and decided I was fed up with paying almost 20 dollars for a box of razors. I was delighted to find a \\&quot;classic\\&quot; safety razor on the market for such a low price. So far I have successfully shaved twice with this one while avoiding cutting myself. I highly recommended going on YouTube or any video website to find an instructional video on how to shave with one of these. There is definitely a technique to using one, it just takes a few tries to nail it. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to find a better alternative to the modern safety razor. It works, so as long as you have patience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To those interested, I also found that the razor came equipped with a Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock razor with 5 included in the box.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor because it was inexpensive to replace a simular one that my wife had thrown out. I don&#x27;t have that much facial hair so I didn&#x27;t want to spend alot of money on a razor whether disposable or not. It works for my situation. but remember you get what you pay for.so If your into high end stuff you might want to spend a few more bucks. but if you&#x27;re dollar tight, this razor will save you tons of money since replacement blades are cheap compared to the disposables.</li>
            <li> I grabbed this razor because it was cheap and had decent reviews. I had never used a safety razor so didn&#x27;t want to spend major money on something I might not use for more than a few weeks. The razor it heavy in hand, but it feels right. I&#x27;m comfortable taking it to chin and neck. The blades are easy to swap. There isn&#x27;t much to do wrong with this. I plan on replacing it with a better quality razor in the near future and using this as a travel or spare. Until then, it&#x27;ll work well.</li>
            <li> Lousy balance and feels cheap to the touch. I broke down and spent the money on a German made razor and the difference is unbelievable. Would not waste any more of my money on this product. Blades were ok, but lost their edge way too fast. When it comes to my face, I guess I will pay extra for the smoothness and comfort from now on.</li>
            <li> This razor that I had ordered was a great gift for myself. As I love older type of things and styles, I am a fan of safety razors etc and when I ordered this item, it came in well packaged on time as promised. The razor is very simple, a basic start up type as it hasn&#x27;t any adjustments therefore also good for the price.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband for Christmas. I read the reviews, and people said it was a good starter razor. So far my husband really likes it. I think it does a great job, and would recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> This was the cheapest double-edge razor that I could find, but they had pretty good reviews, so I ordered two of them.  This is a great product!  Yes, the handle is lightweight plastic, but seems durable enough to last a long time with a reasonable amount of care.  I was using an antique all-metal razor that an elderly friend gave to me, but it finally broke from 50 years or more of total use.  The prices of new all-metal razors gave me a bad case of sticker shock!  These Diamond Edge razors are under 10 dollars, and work great! Highly recommended if you feel that $30 to $40 is way too much for a double-edge razor.</li>
            <li> The positive reviews for this razor and the low price convinced me to buy 10 to combine with a tweezerman brush, mug and shaving soap as a gift for my guy friends... and myself. This was the first time any of us had tried the wet shave / safety razor technique and it was a real hit!  (thanks artofmanliness.com for the idea!) The razor is light weight compared with the more expensive ones which makes it a bit more forgiving when, like a rookie, you \\&quot;press\\&quot; on it like newer style razors for a closer shave. It still has enough heft in the head, however, for you to develop a good technique and feel for wet shaving. Like newer razors, it is also longer than most traditional offerings which makes it a bit more user friendly as a starter.  My only criticism for the razor was that the replacement blades included were not very good. I ordered a pack of derby&#x27;s for everyone, which solved that problem. A little nitpicky given the price, I know.  After using this razor for over a month I became fully hooked on safety razor shaving and decided to buy a high-end german razor... To be honest, while the new one is much heavier, way more stylish and is sure to last much longer... The difference in the actual shave is barely noticeable outside of perhaps a better heat transfer to the skin from the all metal construction. The Diamond Edge classic razor has now become my travel razor and I continue to use it regularly.  All in, I highly reccomend this as a starter razor or a gift for someone who hasn&#x27;t tried the safety razor \\&quot;experience\\&quot;... It was good enough to hook me and my friends for life!</li>
            <li> The razors handle is made of cheap hollow plastic, and it was broken in half when it came in the mail. The razors head also looked uneven. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Very nice product.  Nice to know they are still out there as that is what my husband loves to use.</li>
            <li> If I could, I would give this item a 3.5 star rating vs a 3 but I can&#x27;t and it definitely isn&#x27;t a 4. The Razor itself isn&#x27;t terrible, I was actually quite surprised at the value. My problem for the most part comes with the packaging, as another reviewer stated it seems their razor had been used. Upon receiving mine I felt the same even though everything looked clean, I thoroughly disinfected it to make sure. The razors it come with are stored in paper and nothing in this entire package is sealed OR stapled in any way.   Back to the razor, its sturdy and seems to function for its purpose. The razors don&#x27;t sit perfectly and sometimes need adjustment. The Main issue I have is that you are limited to smaller strokes due to hair getting stuck on the blade due to a lack of clearance. If it wasn&#x27;t for this clearance issue I would have continued to use it, but my shaves take twice as long vs other razors when I hadn&#x27;t shaved the previous day.    If your hair grows slower or you shave EVERY DAY religiously and want a cheap razor, this is perfect. If you hair grows thick and fast and you don&#x27;t want to open it to clean it every stroke,.. pass on this one.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for My husband shaves every day and the other products out there are very expensive and this is the way to go .  Finding blades are not hard and you can not find this kind of razor in stores .  This is the best and the time it took to get here was very fast much faster then they said it was going to</li>
            <li> i have alittle cuts at first but as started tu use everuthing work fine thank you  oh service goo and product arrive on time thank youuuuuuu</li>
            <li> Personally, I liked this razor.  It was loads cheaper than a Merkur or even a Parker.  I had decided to try single blade shaving, both as a means to save money, and to get a better feeling shave.  While I was eager to try it, I was not eager to invest a ton of money into something that might not pan out, so I opted for the Diamond Edge Classic Safety Razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first looked at it, the black plastic handle did not inspire me to think it was a high quality item.  However, when I picked it up, it had a nice heft to it, and it functioned admirably.  The top opens butterfly-style by rotating the ring beneath the head(a feature I like better than some of my more expensive replacements).  And the proper shaving angle is easily attained.  Even the pack of blades that came with it were good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I tagged this as a cheap safety razor, \\&quot;inexpensive\\&quot; is more accurate. I still have this one, and use it for travel.  After all, I like a good shave wherever I go, and if I were to lose my razor, I can replace it for less than the cost of a pack of the multi-blade cartridges. If you&#x27;re thinking of trying wet-shaving, start here.</li>
            <li> The razor is very sharp and would do well for beards.  I was looking for the \\&quot;old\\&quot; fashion Shick injector razor.  Blades in separate container that was used to rid old razor blade and install new one in the razor.</li>
            <li> The razor has bad termination. Obviously no quality control at the factory. One wing of the head is mounted on the other to close. Not a good product.</li>
            <li> If you have never had a proper shave or if it has been years since you had one, this is a wonderful way to remind yourself what it used to be like years ago. This is an inexpensive way to see if single blade shaving is right for you. BUT, this is a significant caution: this is a cheaply made product - the &amp;#34;doors&amp;#34; do not line up correctly with our guidance when you are closing the razor. Don&#x27;t buy this as your daily razor. Buy a more expensive one. It&#x27;s worth what you pay for it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I ordered this razor. Thought it was going to be a let down, especially for the price. I have a more expensive razor, but wanted a back up in case something happens to the nicer one. However, I now prefer this one! I like the lighter weight, the longer handle, the entire feel of it. It isn&#x27;t anything fancy, just a good razor. Love it! Shaves like a dream.</li>
            <li> My order was filled by Discount Jungle. Their service was great and was delivered very quickly. However, the Diamond Edge Safety Razor is very cheaply made...you get what you pay for here! (as other brands cost a lot more) The lot of razors that mine came from seem to be a little off because the safety bars aren&#x27;t even depths, making the blade edge further away from the skin on one end of the razor than the other; giving the appearance that the blade seats crooked. The razor is okay if you are trying to just get a feel for this style of razor before looking into buying a higher quality one for every-day use, or using it as a travel razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor not expecting much.  I travel a lot and wanted an inexpensive razor to take with me.  My thinking was if I lost the razor or if it gets damaged on the road no big deal it was cheap.  This razor is an excellent razor and the inexpensive price makes it even better.  I would and will buy this razor again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;. The razor has a twist handle that opens the razor for easy blade change.&lt;br /&gt;. The Razor is a decent weight.&lt;br /&gt;. The best part the shave, close and smooth every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would tell anyone looking for a travel, beginner, or everyday razor that you cant go wrong with this product. Enjoy your purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s This product shipped right to my house in under the estimated time. Very pleased with the service also.</li>
            <li> Like this product -- for price it hard to beat.  Blades are much cheaper than disposable razors.</li>
            <li> I got this razor in the mail few days ago along with few Gillette 7 o&#x60;clock blades. im very happy wit it, take little time to get use to, and i highly recommend going to badgerandblade.com to get some advice, also g on YouTube and watch Mantic59 videos.    make sure you have nice cream or soap to use with and not the can stuff as it does not work with that type of razor.  i got it fast and sealed nicely for a great first use, also great price  !!</li>
            <li> I love this double-edged razor...I no longer have to put up with disposible razors that wear out after just 1 or 2 uses. Another great thing is I can buy a  pack of 5 replacement blades where I work (Dollar General) for only a buck!!! ($1.00)</li>
            <li> even with care it will cut your face up</li>
            <li> This razor is not bad just a little overpriced. I think they go for less than $2.00 in India.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this purchase.  I was most excited that it only costs $1 to get a pack of 5 and thats amazing.  I bought this product because it was less expensive and if i didn&#x27;t like the product then I was only out a few bucks.  I am still using it and love the hell out of it.  Don&#x27;t really need to get a better one because this one is still good.  I recommend this product because it&#x27;s amazing, and also its way cheaper then the $30 for the Gillette pro glide.  I love that product but there are a lot of cheap ways to get the same product.</li>
            <li> This thing is absolute junk. Your money would be better spent by just burning it to singe the hairs off of your face. To begin with, the product is completely unusable. Mine cam in the package missing part of the door and as soon as I opened the package the rest of the door fell off. The blade that was already &amp;#34;in&amp;#34; the razor was bent and damaged. I quote &amp;#34;in&amp;#34; because without the trap doors on the razor the blade wasn&#x27;t really in anything. Just avoid this razor. I have several safety razors and it&#x27;s just simply worth spending the few extra bucks for a Murker or something else. A good safety razor will last you years anyway, so it&#x27;s worth the extra money instead of wasting it on this piece of junk.</li>
            <li> The razor is not what I expected, not good quality. Blades do not stay in. I will not purchase another oe again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy, which is good.  The thing shaves hairs like magic though.  I use default blades; they work fine, even for starting out.  Four stars because razor burn is not unheard of...though that may well be my technique.  But an excellent razor for beginners.</li>
            <li> Basically it looks like you might buy it in a grocery Isle. It isn&#x27;t expensive made but it works well. it came loaded with a gillete blade but came with 5 other off brand ones. shaves well though, nothing to complain about there, and the locking mechanism works well too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I got this as a travel razor. Does the job, but is very light. You need to add a little pressure to get it where you want. For a beginner on a budget though, it&#x27;s somewhere to start. Still better than a cartridge razor.</li>
            <li> Made in Pakistan, this razor&#x27;s middle ridge that the blade fits over is too thin.  Consequently, when you put the blade in, it is sticking out too far on one end and not far enough on the other.  I was afraid to put it to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up buying a razor made in America -- the  DLC head with Classic handle Weber 3-piece safety razor -- all stainless steel.</li>
            <li> My order was filled by Wasatch Beauty...fast...4 days...a week before Christmas. I had owned a classic safety razor years ago, but misplaced it. So, I&#x27;ve been using cartridge type and disposal razors. Since I retired, however, I don&#x27;t shave often and those razors don&#x27;t get the job done. I was surprised to see the high prices of safety razors. The Diamond Edge Razor was a bargain...$8.78 shipping included. The razor came loaded with one razor blade, and a pack of five Gillette razor blades. The safety razor is light and gives me a close shave. No complaints.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my husband.  He loves it!  Turned out to be a money saver as well.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about this razor at first. But after the first use I knew it was a great product. Inexpensive, sturdy construction, and it provides a really nice shave without cutting my face up. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, this razor costs less than ten bucks, depending on which vendor supplies your amazon order.  Having said that, it&#x27;s a great little razor, perfect for starters.  You can always upgrade and buy an awesome $30+ razor later.  If you&#x27;ve never used one of these, a word of advice, take plenty of time wetting your beard and lathering it up.  These don&#x27;t handle like your disposable Gillette&#x27;s.  You should use as little pressure as needed, and the edge of the blade must be perpendicular to your face as possible.  It takes getting used to, and I&#x27;m not going to lie, you&#x27;ll probably cut yourself a few times and even end up with razor burn too, but hands down this is the closest shave you could ever hope to get, outside of a professional barber.  These types of blades are crazy sharp, like Gin-zu&#x27;s for your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another tip, use a high quality shave cream.  I don&#x27;t mean foam, gels or even the expensive &amp;#34;cream in a tub&amp;#34; shave creams like Lab Series, (Although I am a huge fan, Lab Series can be too thick.) which you can get at department stores.  You can find a great shave creme here.  Search for Proraso Shaving Cream.  It comes in a small metal tube.  A little goes a very long way.  Squeeze out a dime sized amount into a shaving bowl or mug, add a little hot water and use your brush to whip up a huge lather.  This particular Shave Cream is wonderful.  I usually suffer from razor burn and get skin irratation easily.  This shave cream 1) makes shaving a breeze because it is so thick and 2) has lots of skin conditioners leaving your face feeling wonderful.  It does a huge number on skin irritation and combined with this razor, will leave your face as smooth as a babies a$$.</li>
            <li> My son told me this was the way to go clean shave and save $$$.  All I wanted was a clean shave not a self sacrifice!</li>
            <li> Why did I every pay for those \\&quot;modern\\&quot; razor blades,  These $.10 blades last longer and give me a shave I like better (not as close so no razor rash!).  Very happy with this razor.</li>
            <li> The plastic handle is too light for properly balancing the head. It shaves well enough but feel awkward in the hand. I&#x27;ll leave it at work for those times(few and far between) that I may need to shave there.</li>
            <li> The entire handle is plastic, the knurled bit at the top is what turns to open the blade doors.  The blade that came with it was duller than any cartridge razor i&#x27;ve ever used, even a cheap disposable.  If you need one for emergencies, this is a maybe.  Then again, when has shaving really ever been an emergency?  With a good blade, this will probably suffice as a travel razor.</li>
            <li> great basic razor easy to use gets a close shave and has a good grip so it wont have an accidental slip</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad i found this razor because where i live they don&#x27;t sell them in stores anymore. It works great.</li>
            <li> I swear this looks like the first razor I used for many years before disposables hit the market. It is great value for money. I have a Murker razor, but I have to unscrew it to get the blade in. anyhow, since I use to wet shave, before it was in, cool, and retro like now, I got a perfect shave. I whipped up the el cheapo drug store shaving soap, did the four pass beard reduction thing ( Google it). The blade is like all blades, great, but time will tell if by day four it&#x27;s still sharp. That is how I rate blades,  how long you can count on them holding a edge. So if you want a back up razor, or a newbie wanting to wet your feet without breaking the bank, buy it. Shaving is like brushing your teeth, something you do, it&#x27;s not a ritual to me. However when I walk out the bathroom, I want it over and done with. I don&#x27;t want a five o&#x27;clock shadow at nine in the morning. By the way, I am a garbage man, but I don&#x27;t want to look like garbage. This is one item where the cheap price doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s crap. Chow.</li>
            <li> The razor started to rust after a month and you have to be really careful using it because it will nick your face.  The only good point about this razor is the replacement blades are cheap to buy.</li>
            <li> The item met my expectations, and is easy to use. The only complaint I have is the length of time it took to arrive. In fairness, this could have been partly due to postal delays.</li>
            <li> Made my husband&#x27;s day when this arrived. Good buy for the money. Just as good as the more expensive razors.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my husband and he loves it. Safes tons of money from the disposable razors. You can get packs of blades at Dollar General for next to nothing.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift, and the recipient raved over it&#x27;s quality and weight.  This is a very good product for the money.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of the old days when you felt a real shaver in your hands and not a piece of plastic. Great for shaving your nuts.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these and this was my first attempt at using a safety razor. This product worked really well for me and I have been using it for a few weeks now. The first time I used this I had a small cut on my left jaw line although it was no biggie since I barely noticed the cut after I was done shaving. The other one I bought for my dad who has always used the safety razor but for the last 7-8 years he was stuck using the Gillette/Schick or what not since he couldnt find one at the local stores. Unfortunately I think my dad probably has lost the touch to shave using the safety razor since he quit using this razor after a few nicks and cuts the first few days he tried shaving. Initially before purchasing I thought this may be a light weight product made in China but it wasn&#x27;t and it is made in Pakistan.</li>
            <li> Mine was fulfilled by cosmeticbeautyplace and the product is of poor quality. The blades do not seem to be seated correctly on one side and makes the blade look uneven and slightly crooked. The is just due to the poor butterfly mechanism as it does not seem to be aligned. This other item seems to be the  same handle except it&#x27;s all metal ([[ASIN:B0050HO9MI Silver Double Shaver Nonslip Handle]] Furthermore, the blade that was already in looked a bit dirty (and oily). Not really a big deal as it comes with a pack of 5 blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a nice intro to this \\&quot;old-school\\&quot; way of shaving though. The blades are sharp! I dont think I&#x27;ve shaved this close to my skin before with the modern razors. It does take a bit of getting used to. I will probably invest in a higher quality handle in the future.</li>
            <li> This item came with a Gillette blade  which I thought was awesome.&lt;br /&gt;It gave me a great shave&lt;br /&gt;My beard grows slow and I may have to shave every 2 or 3 days&lt;br /&gt;For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong&lt;br /&gt;Comes w 5 generic blades</li>
            <li> First one lasted a few years and this one seems better made so we will see it works so far and if it lasts a couple of years its cost effective</li>
            <li> I got this one and a two-piece razor at the same time, this one is the better of the two. The butterfly opening is great and it holds the razor well, with a very small bit of the razor exposed.</li>
            <li> My husband says it is so much better than the disposable razors.  Now my son wants one.  It was a good buy.</li>
            <li> this is my first old fashioned razor iv tried and wow is it amazing. It has a very nice weight to it and quite durable, although the handle is a bit ehh its pretty freakin good. Although im new to this type of razor i get it down pat almost instantly but that might differ from person to person. I was tired of getting razor bumps and ingrown hairs from shaving while using triple or quada bladed razors. This razor help tremendously i can do one pass and be almost completely clean shaven and then just catch the few hairs missed. I would say throw out the razors it comes with and buy your 2 dollar pack of like 30 razor blades from cvs, walmart, wegman, ect. This producer for its price is amazing and i am happy to say it was money well spent!</li>
            <li> I used the Mach 3 for years, then switched to Gillette Sensor Excel, which was a major improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now using this is like nothing I&#x27;ve ever experienced.  I tried a straight razor several times, but this seems better.  This is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave a 5 star review years ago.  I got another one this last week and it&#x27;s already rusting.</li>
            <li> It seems that it will last 5 or more years.   My only complaint is with the weight...it&#x27;s too ligth and for a beginner this can be counterproductive because the newbie will tend to put pressure...DON&#x27;T EVER PUT PRESSURE ON A RAZOR or you will get razor burn.    I&#x27;m happy with this razor because it challenges me to improve my technique over the equipment.</li>
            <li> It just did not shave close like I was expecting. I had my dad&#x27;s old safety razor from his days in the military but somehow it was misplaced in a move, no comparison to the shave his old razor gave.</li>
            <li> Got this to make the transition to safety razor (sick to death of disposables lasting 2 days). I&#x27;d highly recommend this for your started. I&#x27;m still using it months after i bought it. Only real complaint is the gearing inside is obviously cheap because it stutters, but always closes after a couple tried (when it sticks). For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong, especially since it comes with 10 blades which is enough for a few weeks so you can decide if you like this kind of razor.</li>
            <li> Been using this for 3-5 years. Still works. You put razors in and shave, and hair comes off your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t beat the price! Butterfly design makes changing razors easy.</li>
            <li> Oh the money i will save!!! This has been a dream to use... I will never go back to buying $6 or more razor blades...</li>
            <li> My husband says it doesn&#x27;t balance well in his hand. Also, the razor doesn&#x27;t fit well in smaller areas, like around the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He also said, the razor blade itself, pulls. He went back to the single edge blade.</li>
            <li> Husband is satisfied with the  razor. He gets a smooth shave from it. Would recommend it to ours. It is easy to  clean  out the whiskers.</li>
            <li> The Razor is the worst I&#x27;ve ever seen. As other reviewers have noted, the razor does not close to hold the blade properly. This leads to scrapes and cuts. I&#x27;ve been shaving for 50 yrs, and I know what I&#x27;m talking about. I&#x27;ll be throwing this pos away promptly. A double edge blade is the way to go....but Not this one.</li>
            <li> If you want to try de shaving spent 40$ and get one that is quality and won&#x27;t cut ur face off. I an not new to shaving so trust me avoid the carnage.</li>
            <li> I was actually surprised this low cost razor does me well, wasn&#x27;t expecting much but for what it is it does its job fine for me. actually as good as some other more expensive razors I have used but  this is made with a lot of plastic so keep that in mind you get what you pay for, however I do think I will get many years of service from this low cost alternative.</li>
            <li> The longer handle on this razor is good for a lot of men, especially if they have large hands.  Can be frustrating using a short one.</li>
            <li> I have this size and the short one for travel. This is a great razor !</li>
            <li> it was okay for the price and the quality was tolerable if not effective . the handle never seemed to close properly as the closure kept falling apart</li>
            <li> Made in India but good quality, I got this safety razor for my nephew who shaves all the time and has a very full beard; I was not going to get him a Merkur since I did not know if he was going to like Double Edge Razors but he really likes this Diamond Edge Razor!</li>
            <li> might as well shave with a cardboard box. doesn&#x27;t deserve 1 star but cannot give it no stars</li>
            <li> got tired of throwing all those disposable razors away not even used and dull poorly made.</li>
            <li> I saw a TV ad for something like this and checked out what was available on Amazon. This is a high quality razor with a nice weight and feel to it. Why continue wasting money on disposable shavers when you can get just a good a shave with a more enjoyable shaving experience and save money at the same time. Good decision.</li>
            <li> While the razor looks nice on first appearance, looking closer: The butterfly doors do NOT close evenly.  One side will have an end still partially open while the other end prevents further closure.  This leaves the edge of the blade at an angle making it impossible to shave without cutting your cheek or neck.  Not a good situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this razor to my worst enemy.</li>
            <li> Going back to basics is sometimes a good thing. All these triple and quad blade razes work really well but they are getting ridiculously expensive and do not last very long. I bought this to give it a try and I&#x27;m glad I did. Does work as good as those expensive throw disposables? No! But it is good enough for me.</li>
            <li> I received this item promptly.  HOWEVER, the razor was USED and had a USED razor blade in the head of the razor.  Absolutely disgusting and unsanitary.  I did not get to try the razor out, obviously, so can&#x27;t comment on the products performance.  This seller should check their returns more thoroughly!!  Selling used razors with used blades is very unprofessional!</li>
            <li> The best shave I have had in years.  I missed my safety razor that I had for years and didn&#x27;t remember how good it felt to have a clean shave!  I bought this razor after listening to an ad about a five bladed razor.  How many more are they going to add to get a shave as good as one safety razor?</li>
            <li> love this,I looked at several stores and couldn&#x27;t find this type razor,the blades but no razor,lol,made good,i&#x27;ll buy another for my camping gear</li>
            <li> Poor quality and craftsmanship, Blade won&#x27;t sit straight, lid will not close evenly. Used it once and threw it in the junk drawer, and bought a vintage Gillette safety razor and it&#x27;s 10 times better.</li>
            <li> Hi&lt;br /&gt;It works good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Melitta</li>
            <li> broke the first week of use where are the old time razors that stayed together. I had one that I used for years lost it during moving that was my grandpas and can not find one like it that actually stays together when taking the blades in and out</li>
            <li> The original razor was lost in transit but amazon fixed that quickly with a replacement.  This was for my husband and he wasn&#x27;t a big fan, I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s because he isn&#x27;t used to it or the quality though,</li>
            <li> well  heres the story, of a lovly lady, kidding really, ok so this is the &#x27;2&amp;#34;: second shaver i bought the best$ could find here on amazon what htis ws 20-30 $ I think , I buy 10$ blades who buys 10$ blades men go for 2$ bics , i dont, not cheep,plus who dot like a good shave, first day , open it , like it, opens form the top, screw the base, opens thetop like a wing, ok pop the blade in, make sure its in right side, theres markings actuallyon the blades 12-34 1-2 bottom 3-4 up, then screw close the base butterfly closes, ok fine, god to go ,i think what a nightmare to unfold , lather , hot, brush , good cream , ok shave, riight side, ok this is a good handel,.solid, head has some weight to it, ok, left side, more soap, pop, the top hinge comes off THE DAME HANDEL, WITH THE BLADE IN IT, OMG NOW IM BLEEDINGA , TOTTALLY UPSET soap everwhere, snd i cut my thumb trying to remove the dame thing, i get the blade out, find out the tiny tiny hing, on th butterfly came off,, after an hr repair, redo the rest, whata joke, no matter the $$ junk again the head fell off the 1st one but was not using it , about to fel apart before i used ittank god. these products are not usa made, all overseas and this is what we get a 20-$ razor cut me myt humb  thanks guys any compinsation here how about sending another one prove me wrong if it works ill reove the feedback, dont it stays , its thet ruth make that up1</li>
            <li> It works for me. However when arrived it looked like it was used before - the blade was installed, has some residue on it, whole package did not look very clean. I guess for the price you can&#x27;t complain but I had a bad feeling about it. Would prefer to pay more and be more satisfied. Well, I keep learning that lesson over and over...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle although plastic looks quite solid unlike previous reviewers mentioned. Might even have metal inside. Looks like different people getting slightly different items. Mine was made in Pakistan.</li>
            <li> AWSOME, no need for 3,4 or 5 blabes anymore. Very close shave and I got a brush, shaving soap and razor (soap and razor purchased elsewhere) for less than my normal cartridge refill.</li>
            <li> At first lets be honest, is not an expensive one, but it works...only thing i don&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t fits the blade well,...i don&#x27;t know maybe it was only my one the one damage...but it works.</li>
            <li> The twist to open doors did not line up. I was afraid to shave with it.  I sent it back for a refund.</li>
            <li> This razor isn&#x27;t all that heavy but it works well.  good to get started with or as a backup or travel razor.  I used it until I got the hang of it then bought a higher quality heavier one.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband, he wanted the old fashioned razor and it is just what he wanted. It&#x27;s a nice quality.</li>
            <li> First ill say estamated sniping date was the 15 I got it the 23 . Second the blade wont lock properly .third don&#x27;t know how it asposto fill but it fills like you have a razor blade presed ugenst your face.lastly its just iratating I used it about 10 to 15 mind ago and my face is still iratated I geass you can pravent that by using a lot of shaving cream thanks for reading and one more thing it is preaty fun.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my gym bag.  I started using a safety razor about 3 months ago, purchasing a Merkur,  I love the Merkur as it gives a clean comfortable shave.  Because I didn&#x27;t want to spend the extra money for another Merkur, I got this Diamond Edge razor.  I cannot get a comfortable shave with it, frequently cutting or getting shaving rash.  I tried different brands of blades with it, but I do not like it.</li>
            <li> First safety razor! It was easy and fun to use, you feel so mature using it. I got this because of my ingrown hair issues, I have curly thick coarse hair, and while this didn&#x27;t help, it was the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had, it just glides like BUTTER across the hairs!</li>
            <li> I had a double edged razor like this when I was young. It is still better than almost anything for getting edges and sideburns. No frills. Does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> you get what you pay for horrible Product you need to buy the Edwin Jagger De89bl Double Edge Safety Razor Chrome Plated and i recommend and the Merkur \\&quot;1904\\&quot; Classic Safety Razor - Open-#41- Made in Germany and the Merkur \\&quot;1904\\&quot; Safety Razor 42C this are rely good price OK guys have a good day bye.</li>
            <li> I LIKE AND OLD FASHION SHAVE. HOW EVER THE RAZOR I HAVE WAS A BIT SHORT ON THE HANDLE. SO I ORDER THIS ONE. I WAS NOT LET DOWN. THE  INFORMATION WAS RIGHT AND THE IMAGE OF THE PRODUCT WAS THE SAME AS WHAT WAS DELIVER. THANK YOU.</li>
            <li> Just the Ticket, take me back to the times when I started to shave and it works great. Used one like this in the Military</li>
            <li> This razor works very well however I found it difficult finding proper blades in my local stores.  I had to purchase additional blades on Amazon as well.  However that was not a problem.  An order of 100 blades for about $20 bucks will last me well over a year!</li>
            <li> the crazy cost of 3 bade razors, 5 blade razors; I went back to the safety razor. This model has filled every expectation so far. Now I am not throwing away good razor blades because they are packed with whiskers- they never got the chance to get dull. i think my shave is closer than it ever was with a multiblade.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my grandpa since he likes to use safety razors. Let&#x27;s just say he doesn&#x27;t have to use his antique one anymore. LOL</li>
            <li> I love it. It does a much better job then the throw-away kind. The blades last a lot longer too.</li>
            <li> This is a good starter if you&#x27;ve never used a double edge. Take it slowly, and carefully. The rewards are amazing if you do. To be quite honest with you, I&#x27;ve tried the 2, and 3 blade injector models, and all they manage to do is clog. This old school razor gives me the closest shave I&#x27;ve had in a while. Those new fangled ones don&#x27;t work nearly as well. If you want a close shave, go old school. This is a good starter razor, but IS cheaply constructed, and will fall apart eventually. Eventually, I will get a better model, but for now I&#x27;m hooked on the close shave of a double edge. I&#x27;ve got my eye on a 1906 model that looks pretty good. :)</li>
            <li> Plastic handle VERY light, having used a steel razor before meant some getting used to - comfortable shave, great value.</li>
            <li> I found out after I bought it it is made in a country where men don&#x27;t shave.The first time I used it I had a self sacrifice. It is to top heavy. It does not work right. I found out it is already starting to rust. Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> Let me just start by saying I have ordered dozens of products from Amazon and have never been compelled to write a review. This razor changed my whole outlook on shaving. Not only is it easy to use, but the results are astounding. It glides across your face so effortlessly, you can hardly tell it is cutting the facial hair, and it cuts shaving time down dramatically. This razor is a keeper, especially at the price, and I will never go back to conventional razors again. Do yourself a favor and buy this Diamond Edge safety razor, and you will be sold after your first shave. 10/10</li>
            <li> Just like the title says, for the price it&#x27;s a good starter safety razor.  Wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to bu another if I ever lose mine.</li>
            <li> first time i bought a safety razor, and i was not disappointed. the product has a sturdy feel and is surprisingly easy to use. started off slow at first, but you get a feel of how to use it after a few times shaving. good deal!</li>
            <li> Well years ago, when I was younger. I had a razor like this. But my old razor was built better, different metals.&lt;br /&gt;So when I looked at this, It looked the same as my old one. It&#x27;s NOT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this razor! I got it for my husband but his skin is too sensitive for it so it&#x27;s mine now. I use it on my legs for the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. it takes some getting used to but once you get the hang of it its amazing.</li>
            <li> it was so cheap  i was afraid to use it-tossed it in trash</li>
            <li> After using the razor and attempting to change the blade the razor fell apart. Sad but it was great until it completely fell apart and is now trash. :-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is not to like about spending half your paycheck for razor blades. I am so done with the fancy garbage out there and the absolutely silly price of blades.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve switched. I LOVE THE RAZOR and I&#x27;me not going back.. Seller was great.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes the smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I have been using this razor for a while now and I really have no complaints at all.  A low key funtional razor.</li>
            <li> hubby uses along with old fashion shaving brush.  blades are great value considering price of razors today.  back to basics</li>
            <li> My husband LOVES this razor and he said he&#x27;ll like it even more when he gets 100% comfortable with it! He shaves every other day and it doesn&#x27;t bother him at all, very close shave!</li>
            <li> Works good although like the more common razors it is more advisable to use a creme type lotion and you must go slower. But the blades are so much cheaper and you get a better shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using multi-bladed cartridge and disposable razors for many years, so my main concern was that a single-blade razor wouldn&#x27;t give me a decent trim. This turned out not to be a problem. The supplied blades are very sharp, they do a lovely job, and it&#x27;s a comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also worried about whether the razor might be more likely to slice me up than the more modern designs. Not a bit. The housing for the blade is just perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, at this point, I have no idea how the razor industry managed to get people to move away from this kind of razor-- they&#x27;re affordable and efficient. I have no complaints at all.</li>
            <li> Nice close shave  With out the hassle of clogging the razor, The Razor rinses easily and the blade last a long time</li>
            <li> I purchased the Diamond Edge Classic Safety Razor and Blades for my husband last year (2014) and he absolutely loves it.  He told me that he wonders why he didn&#x27;t abandon electric razors earlier.  He used a safety razor for years, but stopped when he was given an electric razor.</li>
