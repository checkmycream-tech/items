            <li>It stays on all day and gives my skin and neck a wrinkle free and healthy appearance.</li>

            <li>I was given a sample of this and it has made a huge difference.  </li>

            <li>So creamy and great for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product if you have extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li>GREAT MOISTURIZING CREAM FOR DRY SKIN!  </li>
            <li>my face tends to dry more and more, thanks to the Denver Colorado dry weather -- this moisturizer keeps my skin nice and smooth from morning till evening -- the best I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>This includes having the jar actually be full.</li>
            <li>I used to be a Mary Kay loyal customer.</li>
            <li>good for dry skin..</li>
            <li>Does a good job on my forehead which is really dry.  </li>
            <li>WORTH</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I allegedly ordered Time Wise</li>
            <li>I was excited to find out I can order Mary Kay from Amazon, much easier.</li>
            <li>This gives me just the right amount of moisture without making my face feel greasy.</li>
            <li>It is pretty heavy and a great night time moisturizer</li>
            <li>The product is authentic, and arrived exactly as those I had ordered directly from Mary Kay.</li>
            <li>I had eye surgery many years ago which has made the area around my eyes very chemical sensitive.</li>
            <li>I received the product very fast and it was shipped and wrapped well.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time a little pricey but Mary Kay is a good product</li>
            <li>Some may not care for the &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34;  (although not &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;) feel until it has time to absorb</li>
            <li>I received a Mary Kay gift basket with a bunch of different products and have enjoyed trying them all out.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin looking smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>This is not the first time I have purchased this product but would purchase again.</li>
            <li>First time user.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly what it says intense moisturing.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>They deliver the items so fast, Thank you very much!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>THANK YOU SO MUCH</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t pay this much for this product ever again</li>
            <li>The Mary Kay Intense Moisturing Cream</li>
            <li>certainly doesn&#x27;t live up to its name.</li>
            <li>it does help my super dry super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The only problem when I ordered the cream this time was the jar wasn&#x27;t full.</li>
            <li>This does a good job keeping my skin moist, but it is too much like petroleum jelly and very hard to apply evenly.  </li>
            <li>As I get older (I&#x27;m 58)</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I thought  it used to a little more creamy.</li>
            <li>I have ordered a ton of these and live by this brand and particular product.  </li>
            <li>I wish it didn&#x27;t have the fragrance because sometimes it can irritate near my eyes when I moisturize my whole face.&lt;br /&gt;Goes</li>
            <li>My skin glows, my lines lessened and more soft so less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many many different products, some very high-end and expensive.  </li>
            <li>and I needed something new.  </li>
            <li>I use it at night since it is a heavy, rich moisturizer!</li>
            <li>My skin is also very sensitive</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li>I have tried many, many dry skin moisturizers only to have my skin feel dry and tight within a couple of hours and having to re-apply the moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I use it before I put makeup on and it makes my skin smooth and soft, or before bedtime to get extra moisture when I sleep, or when I have dry spots on my skin.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a huge divet where cream is missing.</li>
            <li>The intense moisturizing cream has helped the dry texture of my skin as I have gotten older.  </li>
            <li>Too early to tell</li>
            <li>$35 seems a bit much for face cream, so when I found the same brand/item here for $16.95 I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>Does not irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The only issue is you can&#x27;t use too much, or it will leave your face feeling a tad bit greasy.</li>
            <li>Everyone and every place selling facial/eye moisturizers tell you not to apply it  near the eye.  </li>
            <li>If I can use it then most of you can use it.&lt;br /&gt;Remember a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Using facial creams and lotions is both an aesthetic as well as a cosmetic experience, and the aesthetics of this Mary Kay cream gets it 4 stars for appearance and color (lovely pink), but only 1 for tactile -- so only a 2 star rating.</li>
            <li>,  i use it every night, i can really see that it does help with my dry skin on my face.  </li>
            <li>I wake up with soft skin, not dry and cracking and with a look and feel like you know it has done its job.</li>
            <li>I tend to have a few dry patches and this is much better than using standard moisturizing lotions which can add excess oil and lead to breakouts.</li>
            <li>If you are searching for a cream for very dry mature skin, baby you have found it!!!</li>
            <li>It is rich and goes on smoothly --- a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many other brands that are more expensive and have not liked them as much as this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have only used this a few times and it seems to be adequate.</li>
            <li>As you can see in the photos I&#x27;ve attached, the whole bottom left side of the jar is empty.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for those with dry skin such as mine.</li>
            <li>I have dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Very nice with moisture in this cold winter!</li>

            <li> The intense moisturizing cream has helped the dry texture of my skin as I have gotten older.  </li>
            <li> Too early to tell</li>
            <li> $35 seems a bit much for face cream, so when I found the same brand/item here for $16.95 I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> Does not irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The only issue is you can&#x27;t use too much, or it will leave your face feeling a tad bit greasy.</li>
            <li> Everyone and every place selling facial/eye moisturizers tell you not to apply it  near the eye.  </li>
            <li> If I can use it then most of you can use it.&lt;br /&gt;Remember a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using facial creams and lotions is both an aesthetic as well as a cosmetic experience, and the aesthetics of this Mary Kay cream gets it 4 stars for appearance and color (lovely pink), but only 1 for tactile -- so only a 2 star rating.</li>
            <li> ,  i use it every night, i can really see that it does help with my dry skin on my face.  </li>
            <li> I wake up with soft skin, not dry and cracking and with a look and feel like you know it has done its job.</li>
            <li> I tend to have a few dry patches and this is much better than using standard moisturizing lotions which can add excess oil and lead to breakouts.</li>
            <li> If you are searching for a cream for very dry mature skin, baby you have found it!!!</li>
            <li> It is rich and goes on smoothly --- a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many other brands that are more expensive and have not liked them as much as this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have only used this a few times and it seems to be adequate.</li>
            <li> As you can see in the photos I&#x27;ve attached, the whole bottom left side of the jar is empty.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for those with dry skin such as mine.</li>
            <li> I have dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Very nice with moisture in this cold winter!</li>
            <li> on very thick so you don&#x27;t need much but that can also make it harder to spread.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I really like this cream.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and need the extra moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have dry spots only on my forehead, nose &amp; chin</li>
            <li> I buy from different vendors but this jar did not come with the application wand and has a completely different consistency and odor than every other jar I have purchased.  </li>
            <li> It is an everyday cream for me as I live in a dry climate.</li>
            <li> and my face felt so soft and firm this morning.  </li>
            <li> A GOOD BASE FOR FOUNDATION.</li>
            <li> but it was just what I needed for my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> DRY GIRLS</li>
            <li> she said it is still dry after put on her face..</li>
            <li> If you are like me who has extremely dry skin, than this is the product for you.  </li>
            <li> I always used this product when I need moisturizing because of dry skin.  </li>
            <li> and I have dry skin</li>
            <li> It always cures the dry skin problems during the winter.</li>
            <li> She has horribly dry skin and eczema</li>
            <li> I have always had dry skin and this &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; which is supposed to be for dry skin</li>
            <li> After applying it my face doesn&#x27;t feel moisturized, it feel tacky and dry.</li>
            <li> I have only used a few Mary Kay products and this one has been the most disappointing.</li>

            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure I feel like using it long enough to find</li>
            <li> THIS IS A THICKER CONSISTENCY THAN I EXPECTED</li>
            <li> so she has to be careful what she uses.  </li>
            <li> I know Mary Kay products have less than 3 years till they expire since the manufactured date.</li>
            <li> Not at all like the previous formula Moisturizing Cream.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just heavier on my skin than the gel product that I used previously.</li>
            <li> A little greasy for daywear</li>
            <li> A trick to applying this cream, is little pea sized dabs.</li>
            <li> I give it a little time to absorb in before applying make up, and it lasts me all day.  </li>
            <li> and I use this everyday.</li>
            <li> It is not smooth and resembles glue.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have very delicate and extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> but the consistency is so thick you have rub hard to apply and that to me seems too harsh for delicate aging skin.</li>
            <li> This thing smelled like crap when I first opened it</li>
            <li> The consistency is quite thick and you need to use another moisturizer to thin it down.</li>
            <li> Texture is a bit too thick.</li>
            <li> but progress is slow</li>
            <li> but when I&#x27;m in need of serious moisture, I use this.</li>
            <li> but their packaging is not good..</li>
            <li> box was broken..</li>
            <li> This product is expensive</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I buy a lot of my facial products from Amazon. This product was like paste. I&#x27;ve used this exact product in the past (purchased from MK consultant) and this was not the same consistency.Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> Works great, Mary Kay is all I use and my consultant quit so it was easy to get it off of Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have used this moisturizer for years. Excellent product</li>
            <li> Works well, hydrates very dry skin.  Delivered on time excellent customer service.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I used to have oily skin but menopause changed all that.  The moisturizers I had been using for years suddenly didn&#x27;t work well and I needed something new.  I was given a sample of this and it has made a huge difference.  It is not for everyone though.  It is pretty heavy and a great night time moisturizer although I use it during the day too. Some may not care for the &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34;  (although not &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;) feel until it has time to absorb but it was just what I needed for my dry skin.  My skin is also very sensitive and I have not had any problems or reactions.  I use it on my eyes and throat as well.  I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Leaves face a bit shiny looking but when I&#x27;m in need of serious moisture, I use this. I wish it didn&#x27;t have the fragrance because sometimes it can irritate near my eyes when I moisturize my whole face.&lt;br /&gt;Goes on very thick so you don&#x27;t need much but that can also make it harder to spread.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I really like this cream.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best moisturizing cream for me.  It is rich and goes on smoothly --- a little goes a long way.  It stays on all day and gives my skin and neck a wrinkle free and healthy appearance.</li>
            <li> I received a Mary Kay gift basket with a bunch of different products and have enjoyed trying them all out. This moisturizer is fantastic. I tend to have a few dry patches and this is much better than using standard moisturizing lotions which can add excess oil and lead to breakouts. This gives me just the right amount of moisture without making my face feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff,  it is great for anyone with really dry skin,  Mary Kay extra emollient night cream,  i use it every night, i can really see that it does help with my dry skin on my face.  it&#x27;s GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> I use this cream for a night cream.  Have used it for years and get many compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li> This does a good job keeping my skin moist, but it is too much like petroleum jelly and very hard to apply evenly.  I thought  it used to a little more creamy.</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for years..it never changes in quality and performance. It is an everyday cream for me as I live in a dry climate.</li>
            <li> They deliver the items so fast, Thank you very much!!!&lt;br /&gt;I love Mary Kay&#x27;s Products!!!</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin.  It makes my face feel great.</li>
            <li> GREAT MOISTURIZING CREAM FOR DRY SKIN!  LOVE IT!! WORTH THE $$$  &amp; DOES&#x27;T TAKE A LOT TO FEEL GREAT!!!  DRY GIRLS WHO HAVEN&#x27;T TRIED THIS, YOU MUST.</li>
            <li> I love Mary Kay products..been using them for 20 yrs! I have very sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> good for dry skin.. i used this product with my roommate.. she said it is still dry after put on her face.. but mine was fine.. but their packaging is not good.. there was no cover.. box was broken..</li>
            <li> I have been using Mary Kay products for over 40 years, and they have kept my skin in excellent condition.  The intense moisturizing cream has helped the dry texture of my skin as I have gotten older.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have been a Mary Kay user and seller for over 30 years. I am 62 but honestly everyone thinks that I am in my 40&#x27;s! Mary Kay is the best beauty product that I can recommend for the average woman. I have very delicate and extremely dry skin. If I can use it then most of you can use it.&lt;br /&gt;Remember a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Works great! Not as good as Clinique super defense. But great for the price. Texture is a bit too thick.</li>
            <li> I think it adds moisture but the consistency is so thick you have rub hard to apply and that to me seems too harsh for delicate aging skin. Once rubbed in, does it help my skin retain moisture?  Too early to tell and I&#x27;m not sure I feel like using it long enough to find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using facial creams and lotions is both an aesthetic as well as a cosmetic experience, and the aesthetics of this Mary Kay cream gets it 4 stars for appearance and color (lovely pink), but only 1 for tactile -- so only a 2 star rating.</li>
            <li> I just love this product.  If you are like me who has extremely dry skin, than this is the product for you.  I have tried many, many dry skin moisturizers only to have my skin feel dry and tight within a couple of hours and having to re-apply the moisturizer.  Not with this product! It is so nice and doesn&#x27;t make your face break out either. Mary Kay, please don&#x27;t eliminate this from your product line!</li>
            <li> I love this cream,it works !!!!I my face looks smooth,I get skit if compliments on my skin!!!!</li>
            <li> $35 seems a bit much for face cream, so when I found the same brand/item here for $16.95 I decided to try it. The product is authentic, and arrived exactly as those I had ordered directly from Mary Kay. Same box, same jar, same cream.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A THICKER CONSISTENCY THAN I EXPECTED THEREFORE THE CREAM DOES HOLD MOISTURE WELL AND SERVES AS A GOOD BASE FOR FOUNDATION.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working well but progress is slow&lt;br /&gt;But I find it to be a great  product will continue to use it for desired results</li>
            <li> Does anyone notice that this cream leaves sparkles on your face?</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever for extremely dry skin and has no perfumes.  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I added this to the time wise cleanse and my face felt so soft and firm this morning.  This is a for sure must have with my cleanser.</li>
            <li> Great. Love it. Mary Kay has great products</li>
            <li> I always used this product when I need moisturizing because of dry skin.  It leaves my skin looking smooth and soft. I use it at night since it is a heavy, rich moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I have used mary kay for yrs &amp; was happy to find this on amazon. Love it at bedtime. A little greasy for daywear so I only use it at night. Wrinkles stay at bay with my mary kay!!</li>
            <li> thanks u for everithing i need i want, i pround the item, i like me, because the excellent quality, thanks so much.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I have very dry skin and I use this everyday. It&#x27;s mosturizing but not oily. It leaves my skin feeling amazing.  Just bought again! This is the only stuff I can use for moisturizing. I have dry and sensitive skin. Love it</li>
            <li> Love this moisturing cream</li>
            <li> I have ordered a ton of these and live by this brand and particular product.  I buy from different vendors but this jar did not come with the application wand and has a completely different consistency and odor than every other jar I have purchased.  It is not smooth and resembles glue.  Not too happy.</li>
            <li> Have used this moisturizing cream for years, and HATE to be without it.  It doesn&#x27;t take a lot to perform well, it is light and makes my skin feel wonderful..</li>
            <li> This thing smelled like crap when I first opened it and it still does. I know Mary Kay products have less than 3 years till they expire since the manufactured date. the seller didnt mention whether the product was expired or not. I am disappointed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using tihs product for years.  It is exactly what it says intense moisturing.  I use it as a nght cream and I have dry skin and it works great.</li>
            <li> This face cream is excellent!! One of the best creams yet for aging skin</li>
            <li> I am 72 and feel so refreshed with the  Mary Kay moisturizer.  Would n&#x27;t seitch it for anything.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It always cures the dry skin problems during the winter. After a week of application, my face is moisturized and radiant again</li>
            <li> Great product.  Arrived in timely manner.</li>
            <li> I love it. i buy over and over</li>
            <li> LOVED IT, BOUGHT IT TWICE, GREAT PRODUCT AND CAME IN PERFECT CONDITION. GREAT PRICE AND WILL PURCHASE AGAIN, THANK YOU SO MUCH</li>
            <li> The consistency is quite thick and you need to use another moisturizer to thin it down. Not at all like the previous formula Moisturizing Cream.</li>
            <li> I have only used this a few times and it seems to be adequate.</li>
            <li> lOVE THIS, I PUT THAT sh*T! ON EVERYTHING!!!</li>
            <li> I have used Mary Kay products for years and love everyone I have used.  This is not the first time I have purchased this product but would purchase again.</li>
            <li> this moisturizer was a gift for my mother, it was an okay moisturizer but it ran out very quick</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product! Thank you for this fabulous purchase! Will definitely use this seller again.</li>
            <li> Does a good job on my forehead which is really dry.  Does not irritate my sensitive skin.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for years and love it. I have dry skin and need the extra moisturizer. I have tried many other brands that are more expensive and have not liked them as much as this moisturizer. It goes on smooth and I do not feel greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service</li>
            <li> Horrible, pasty face cream. Cannot even spread on my face. Would never purchase this ever again. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I allegedly ordered Time Wise and I received the regular skin one and I do not care for it.  I always use the Time Wise.</li>
            <li> I used to be a Mary Kay loyal customer. But it seems her products are changing and this moisturizer is not as creamy as it used to be. I guess it&#x27;s time to shop around for something different.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I use it before I put makeup on and it makes my skin smooth and soft, or before bedtime to get extra moisture when I sleep, or when I have dry spots on my skin. Highly recommended for those with dry skin such as mine. The only issue is you can&#x27;t use too much, or it will leave your face feeling a tad bit greasy. I wouldn&#x27;t pay this much for this product ever again, you can get the same quality creams for a cheaper price at your local retail store. A trick to applying this cream, is little pea sized dabs.</li>
            <li> recommed this cream yes</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for over 20 years.  It is perfect for my dry skin, and use it at night and as a day cream.</li>
            <li> Very nice with moisture in this cold winter!</li>
            <li> If you are searching for a cream for very dry mature skin, baby you have found it!!! My skin glows, my lines lessened and more soft so less noticeable.  There is no scent so if you have allergies to fragrance this is the ticket!!! I purchased more jars, I am going to keep them coming!!</li>
            <li> Great product and keeps my skin nice and moist. I received the product very fast and it was shipped and wrapped well. I have used MK products for years and this is a quality company.</li>
            <li> it does help my super dry super sensitive skin. i use it as a night cream</li>
            <li> Proven over and over again. I wake up with soft skin, not dry and cracking and with a look and feel like you know it has done its job.</li>
            <li> As I get older (I&#x27;m 58) my face tends to dry more and more, thanks to the Denver Colorado dry weather -- this moisturizer keeps my skin nice and smooth from morning till evening -- the best I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> I loved this product.  First time user.  So creamy and great for dry skin.  Would buy it again and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this cream before. I&#x27;ve always loved it. The only problem when I ordered the cream this time was the jar wasn&#x27;t full. There&#x27;s a huge divet where cream is missing. This product is expensive so I expect to get what I pay for... This includes having the jar actually be full. I&#x27;ve never had this issue with this product before. Very disappointed. As you can see in the photos I&#x27;ve attached, the whole bottom left side of the jar is empty.</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you have extremely dry skin. I use it two to three times per day and it never causes me to break out.</li>
            <li> I had eye surgery many years ago which has made the area around my eyes very chemical sensitive. I have very dry skin.  Everyone and every place selling facial/eye moisturizers tell you not to apply it  near the eye.  That happens to be the dryest area of my face.  I have tried many many different products, some very high-end and expensive.  The Mary Kay Intense Moisturing Cream id the ONLY product I can apply all over my face, even a dab on eye lids.  I give it a little time to absorb in before applying make up, and it lasts me all day.  I also useit year around, and carry a travel size with me.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my daughter.  She has horribly dry skin and eczema so she has to be careful what she uses.  This helps moisturize without irritation.</li>
            <li> I have used Mary Kay products for many years and love them all. I was excited to find out I can order Mary Kay from Amazon, much easier.</li>
            <li> I have dry spots only on my forehead, nose &amp; chin and I use this for these areas only and use Mary Kay regular face moisturizer for the rest.  Works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time a little pricey but Mary Kay is a good product</li>
            <li> I have only used a few Mary Kay products and this one has been the most disappointing. I have always had dry skin and this &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; which is supposed to be for dry skin certainly doesn&#x27;t live up to its name. After applying it my face doesn&#x27;t feel moisturized, it feel tacky and dry. I won&#x27;t be buying this one again.</li>
            <li> I have tried the gel version of this product- I realize the product name says &#x27;creme&#x27; so it&#x27;s my own fault that I thought it was something else. Regardless, I like this product, it&#x27;s just heavier on my skin than the gel product that I used previously.</li>
