            <li>And when I run run out I will be coming back for more!</li>
            <li>Wow i love this stuff&lt;</li>
            <li>First time I used it</li>
            <li>My biggest gripe, and this goes for most gels, is that it makes your hair &amp;#34;crunchy.&amp;#34; Not a big deal, I&#x27;m just used to using pomades.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s to to having fun with NATURAL HAIR!!!</li>
            <li>Great product, harder to get the bigger size in this</li>
            <li>This should be good enough to last me another 6 months!</li>
            <li>This gel is strong enough to hold my hair until til I wash it to try something else.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much to do the trick.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>and it is real consentrated</li>
            <li>Holds very well</li>
            <li>, product works great as you only need a small amount of gel and it does lasts all day</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many gel styling products and this has become the only gel I have used for the past several years, this product really holds and never runs, it&#x27;s also very easy to wash out.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The price for the quantity you get is well worth it, this tub will last me awhile.</li>
            <li>I have Booty Length Dreads and like to try new styles with my hair.</li>
            <li>I was turned onto this product at a new barber shop I went to.  </li>
            <li>I have a lot of fine hair, it was so stiff</li>
            <li>the old gel was causing.  </li>
            <li>and now I have some extra on stock at a decent price.</li>
            <li>I went in with a different gel in my hair and right away the barber noticed the flakes and dry scalp</li>
            <li>It was good but the only thing that was wrong was that it wasn&#x27;t well packaged</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;great service and fast delivery.just how expected to be.</li>

            <li> great price compared to local store, product works great as you only need a small amount of gel and it does lasts all day</li>
            <li> I like the smell and the hold is quite strong. I was hoping for a gel that didn&#x27;t leave flakes and it doesn&#x27;t but it does leave some bits on my pillow. Not a big deal.. I will likely buy it again as ounce for ounce it is cheaper than salon gels and performs in a similar manner.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this gel to anyone , it really works great&lt;br /&gt;great service and fast delivery.just how expected to be. I&#x27;m really willing to buy more.</li>
            <li> Ultra hold gel.  Nothing compares to this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent gel, I always use it!</li>
            <li> I have Booty Length Dreads and like to try new styles with my hair. This gel is strong enough to hold my hair until til I wash it to try something else.&lt;br /&gt;I love this gel and now I have some extra on stock at a decent price. Here&#x27;s to to having fun with NATURAL HAIR!!!</li>
            <li> Great product. You don&#x27;t need much to do the trick. I&#x27;m a barber, so I use it after haircuts to style combovers and scissor cuts.</li>
            <li> I was turned onto this product at a new barber shop I went to.  I went in with a different gel in my hair and right away the barber noticed the flakes and dry scalp the old gel was causing.  They recommended I try this product so I did.  First time I used it I just put some in my hands and fingers and put it through my hair, what a MISTAKE! I have a lot of fine hair, it was so stiff it felt like it was a glue and not a gel.  As soon as I put some water in my hair it was a lot easier to work with.  This is a great product, I even believe it has cleared up some slight acne I had on my forehead compared to when I used LA Looks gel. Give this stuff a try!</li>
            <li> Hold is great with this gel; depending on the amount you put. First saw it at my barber&#x27;s and loved how well it worked. My biggest gripe, and this goes for most gels, is that it makes your hair &amp;#34;crunchy.&amp;#34; Not a big deal, I&#x27;m just used to using pomades. The price for the quantity you get is well worth it, this tub will last me awhile.</li>
            <li> Best gel I&#x27;ve ever used. Drys quick. No flakes. Great value for the price</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product</li>
            <li> Great product, harder to get the bigger size in this glad i got it at a cheap price.</li>
            <li> So far happy with this product. Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great all day hold in a non alcohol formula. The presence of alcohol weakens the hair shaft over time. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Came covered in gel because the lid wasn&#x27;t properly tightened. Other than that this stuff is great, I&#x27;ve been using it a couple years and it&#x27;s versatile and cost effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many gel styling products and this has become the only gel I have used for the past several years, this product really holds and never runs, it&#x27;s also very easy to wash out. You will not be disappointed in this product. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Wow i love this stuff&lt;br /&gt;It came sealed no problem with the package&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell it has and it is real consentrated all u need is a little bit of hairgel&lt;br /&gt;For the extreme hold&lt;br /&gt;I will sure be buying again when i run out of this stuff</li>
            <li> It was good but the only thing that was wrong was that it wasn&#x27;t well packaged so it spilled everywhere...so kinda a bumber</li>
            <li> Holds it all in place</li>
            <li> Great for curls you want to keep straight! Hair never feels hard.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, good product, as promised! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> The item was not properly seald so when it arrived i found a mess inside! Gel was all over....hopefully someone will think atleast..putting a bit of tape on a container lid! So this could be avoided!!!</li>
            <li> Love it! Holds very well</li>
            <li> Took 1 week. But the product is great!! This should be good enough to last me another 6 months! And when I run run out I will be coming back for more!</li>
            <li> Good value, quick delivery</li>
            <li> The product is great,  I have used it before.  But the mode of delivery left a little to be desired.  It was shipped with a DVD that I had ordered earlier.  The box of the DVD was a little smashed, and the Hair Gel was packed on its side, and the cover was not on completely tightened.  Some of the Gel leaked onto the DVD, but because it was wrapped in plastic, the box or DVD was not damaged.  Some of the Gel leaked out into the box and onto the delivery receipt.  More care should have been taken when shipping a product that could leak, like this.  Fortunately, only a little leaked out, and minimal damage was done.</li>
            <li> Product was not as promised , would not buy or recommend to others !!! Did not even meet minimum expectations bad product</li>
            <li> Everything was good and I love that gel</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful.</li>
            <li> Quick ship. Ordered 2-32oz containers, one leaked out a little. Don&#x27;t like the screw on lids, seems more cumbersome. I&#x27;m use to the snap on lids that are on the 24oz. Love the product! It doesn&#x27;t flake in my boys hair and you can freshen it up by running wet fingers thru your hair!</li>
            <li> This gel is amazing. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have tried about 6 diffrent gels in the past year and this is the best fit for me. I have 3 inch spiky hair and it holds it without a problem using a small amount . It does not flake and it lasts all day with a medium shine and it smells ok. The only con I found if you call it a con is you need dish soap to get it off your hands but most gels I have used require the samething. I will be purchasing this gel again!</li>
            <li> like gorilla snot but, with a gummy look and and a bit of shine.  Good stuff except I couldn&#x27;t give it five stars because it has a Cologne smell in it.  It&#x27;s not bad but, I like my hair product to be neutral in smell.</li>
