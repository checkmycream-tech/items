            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>so I was able to get it in allover without damaging my hair.  </li>
            <li>The oil that came with it was phenomenal.  </li>
            <li>it is definitely the best mix of moisture and protein that I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>GO FOR IT :)</li>
            <li>She did a superb job in applying, which left me with lots of texture and no scalp irritation whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>no lye Hawaiian silky , motions, and others, many others.</li>
            <li>I got better results using a kiddie texturizer.</li>
            <li>for.my hair has movement, body is shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Relaxes very effectively, leaves my hair soft.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t have that strong relaxer smell that I dislike, and it didn&#x27;t irritate my scalp at all</li>
            <li>I used type A Fine as a touch up.</li>
            <li>About me: 4c hair fine, shoulder length, coily course.  </li>
            <li>If you have 4 type hair (kinky, curly, course, fine</li>
            <li>and i am still looking for remedies for my fine (4c)</li>
            <li>The product seemed to work fine.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with the results and am happy to have a much less toxic product to relax my hair.</li>
            <li>I loved my natural 3C/4A curls; but I was worn out from all the time and effort to maintain my extremely fine, coily, curly, kinky not to mention frizz-prone hair.  </li>
            <li>I truly feel this is a huge innovation and step forward in relaxer systems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair smooth and sleek.</li>
            <li>Today my hair still looks just as good , but best off all my hair is thick, soft, healthy and has not fallen off in clumps like with ORS.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far this works good for me</li>
            <li>This is a VERY good relaxer for those wanting something a bit more &#x27;gentle&#x27; without the harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>my baby hairs were still there, my hair looks and feels so full</li>
            <li>I researched this relaxer and decided to try it as it appeared to be somewhat more gentle and nourishing with avocado, olive and coconut</li>
            <li>but I know they help some people), so it is mildly relaxed</li>
            <li>which was (in my opinion) stronger than CON type A, which are both considered the mild version.</li>
            <li>For years I struggled to find the right relaxer to effectively straighten my hair without burning my sensitive scalp or drying out my already thirst prone hair.</li>
            <li>Trying this perm because it appears to be natural and has the appearance of a healthy perm choice is not worth losing a great deal of your hair like I did.</li>
            <li>have been natural for many years, my hair is thick, strong and in good health with fine strands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27; m really glad  to see that Cream of Nature came out with an all natural relaxer.</li>
            <li>I was captured by the idea of natural and healthy ingredients, so I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>First I used Phytospecific type 1 mild</li>
            <li>the gentle formula for fine hair did Zero damage to my scalp and left me with smooth strong strands.</li>
            <li>product is also free from cheap fillers such as mineral oil and petroleum.</li>
            <li>Very mild relaxer for teenager, manageability without losing natural curls.  </li>
            <li>I have no regrets about going back to relaxed, and I cannot speak highly enough of this wonderful product.</li>
            <li>After the entire process was finished and rollerset, my hair had bounce, shine and looked very smooth like the model on the box.</li>
            <li>I am really excited about this new brand.</li>
            <li>It is silky and strong and growing really quickly after only 4 weeks post.  </li>
            <li>, I guess the end result was OK, if I were to use it again......I would probably only leave it in for 10min.</li>
            <li>My hair has been texlaxed ever since I&#x27;ve had my first relaxer not because I knew what texlaxing is</li>
            <li>and I was pretty</li>
            <li>Wanting a healthier option I ordered the Straight From Eden and ordered Type A for fine hair, ( even though my hair is by no means fine or thin) because I thought it&#x27;d be more gentle on my sensitive scalp, and I wanted to play it safe.</li>
            <li>Straight from Eden gave me exactly what I was looking</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to have had no issues with breakage or scalp problems or excessive shedding, and I have extremely sensitive and allergy-prone skin.</li>
            <li>I used this perm because many individuals said that it was a good perm choice because this particular perm did not have harsh ingredients that would damage the hair due to</li>
            <li>It absolutely relaxes bone straight, and I&#x27;m not fond of that</li>
            <li>Gave me the textured that I wanted which was not too straight.</li>
            <li>The final result is it does not look like i have a relaxer, which is my goal, my roots are smooth.</li>
            <li>I really luv this relaxer.</li>
            <li>So I was looking for something to relax my curl but, not make it bone straight.  </li>
            <li>you must use the the the whole thing and discard what is not used because the packaging is not resealable.  </li>
            <li>In the Philadelphia area I can find the relaxer and shampoo and conditioner at Walmart at times because it does sell out fast.  </li>
            <li>Shea Moisture Passionfruit and Manuka Honey lines and 100% pure argan oil (no silicone) are what I mainly use to maintain my hair.  </li>
            <li>hair was not bone straight, the relaxer gave me consistent soft waves.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, shiny and STRAIGHT! ....</li>
            <li>It is a dream  to relax your hair in a less harmful way . :)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>After using the perm, my scalp developed large sores.</li>
            <li>my natural hair became longer washing and blowdrying was becoming more tedious.</li>
            <li>I have included pics of my newly relaxed hair after washing and then after blow drying.  </li>
            <li>use a lot of shampoos in order to get all the product out (because my scalp will itch for months over even the slightest trace of relaxer left) and it was a first time</li>
            <li>It also left a normal amount of texture that I was so use to!!</li>
            <li>No chemical smells and this natural relaxer really keeps  your hair straight for a long time.</li>
            <li>A day later after being really upset with how my hair felt after using this product, I washed it with the eden conditioning shampoo and co-washed it with castor oil and the Eden conditioner.</li>
            <li>This product makes your hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Compared to the very expensive Phyto 1 and 2 relaxers, which I used for several years before going natural, this was much, much better for my very fine but medium-thick hair.</li>
            <li>so my hair was pretty dry but the conditioner delivered LIFE back to my hair</li>
            <li>I recently relaxed after being natural for 3 years.  </li>
            <li>I recently transitioned from relaxed to natural for about 8 months,  </li>
            <li>Now, after using this perm, some areas of my hair barely reach my shoulder.</li>

            <li> My story: natural for 3 yrs decided to relax 12 weeks ago but didn&#x27;t want harsh chemicals .</li>
            <li> and the curl was not as loose, but it was soft like a fluffy afro.</li>
            <li> As another reviewer commented, this perm leaves the hair excessively dry.</li>
            <li> My hair was dry for weeks after the perm.  </li>
            <li> ) Naturals who want a loose curl</li>
            <li> Works great but the smell is horrible...</li>
            <li> I am careful to maintain my hair with weekly moisture and protein.  </li>
            <li> and my hair was very loose curls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African American woman with kinky thick thirsty hair.</li>
            <li> I used this relaxer after stretching 6months and considering going all natural waves, it left my usually silky hair HARD and DRY!!</li>
            <li> However, this is still a CHEMICAL no lye relaxer, just less harsh than your traditional relaxer**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair didn&#x27;t have that hard, dry feel and wasn&#x27;t flat to my head.  </li>
            <li> On the fence about going back to relaxers and want to transition slightly with the option to go back natural without cutting off hair.</li>
            <li> I had long, thick hair before I used this perm.</li>
            <li> my curl pattern was to tight for me to manage.  </li>
            <li> However I was missing the conditioner from the seemingly unopened box.</li>
            <li> It straightens (bone-straight for my hair), and I have very little shedding.</li>
            <li> i could hardly believe it.</li>
            <li> I used it  and when I rinsed my hair it so so hard to comb.  </li>
            <li> I have only had a relaxer twice in my life time but after seeing my hair gradually thin out, break off and sadly fall out in clumps one day I decided that was end of the road with relaxers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It straightened my hair slowly</li>
            <li> This was too thick for me.</li>
            <li> I took one star away for the smell of CON, it was not as bad a traditional relaxers</li>
            <li> maybe (I&#x27;m not good with those</li>
            <li> like all relaxers and very hard to wash out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced that in my life.</li>
            <li> I was unable to comb my hair for two weeks because my hair had matted to my scalp.</li>
            <li> I have long hair , ended up cutting it because this product ruined  my hair!!!</li>
            <li> but because my scalp burns and itches like crazy after 5 mins of a relaxer being placed on my head.</li>
            <li> I did not experience a bad smell as some have indicated.  </li>
            <li> I did not use all products because smells bad.</li>
            <li> Grrrr</li>
            <li> but it does get annoying after a while.</li>
            <li> Boy, was I sadly disappointed!  </li>

            <li> I love the product. It doesn&#x27;t have a chemical smell. It leaves your hair smooth and sleek. I am really excited about this new brand. It is a dream  to relax your hair in a less harmful way . :)</li>
            <li> This relaxer worked well.  It straightened my hair slowly so I was able to get it in allover without damaging my hair.  (I have a ot of hair)  I will use it again because my hair is damaged (not by this relaxer) but this did not cause additional damage. (I followed the directions as printed.) I used Type A.  I did not experience a bad smell as some have indicated.  The oil that came with it was phenomenal.  I purchased two containers after I used the one in the relaxer box.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is NOT an an \\&quot;ALL NATURAL\\&quot; relaxer! Such a product to my knowledge does not exists! Relaxers contain chemicals and this one is no different! I used this relaxer after stretching 6months and considering going all natural waves, it left my usually silky hair HARD and DRY!! It absolutely relaxes bone straight, and I&#x27;m not fond of that texture!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* A day later after being really upset with how my hair felt after using this product, I washed it with the eden conditioning shampoo and co-washed it with castor oil and the Eden conditioner. I then sprayed the Eden leave-in treatment and sealed with jojoba oil. The following morning.....my hair was it&#x27;s SILKY self :)!! Still straighter than I want or need but I survived! LOL&lt;br /&gt;So, I guess the end result was OK, if I were to use it again......I would probably only leave it in for 10min. instead of the suggested 15min.</li>
            <li> Gave me the textured that I wanted which was not too straight. I would purchase it again. It didn&#x27;t burn</li>
            <li> I love love love this product! It didn&#x27;t have that strong relaxer smell that I dislike, and it didn&#x27;t irritate my scalp at all :) I will continue to purchase this product!</li>
            <li> My hair has been texlaxed ever since I&#x27;ve had my first relaxer not because I knew what texlaxing is but because my scalp burns and itches like crazy after 5 mins of a relaxer being placed on my head. I can tell you that this thing lasted 15 mins and DID NOT BURN. I&#x27;ve never experienced that in my life. EVER!! It also left a normal amount of texture that I was so use to!! my baby hairs were still there, my hair looks and feels so full I can&#x27;t even believe that the breakage was so low. i always compare the size of hair i lose in the washing and conditioning part and I was pretty impressed!!&lt;br /&gt;I use a lot of shampoos in order to get all the product out (because my scalp will itch for months over even the slightest trace of relaxer left) and it was a first time so my hair was pretty dry but the conditioner delivered LIFE back to my hair i could hardly believe it. it is definitely the best mix of moisture and protein that I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;And don&#x27;t get my started on the oil. I will be purchasing a lifetime supply of that thing it&#x27;s weightless magic! Heck, even the conditioner too! Bless Creme of Nature for making this and making it so healthy!!!</li>
            <li> So far this works good for me</li>
            <li> I used it  and when I rinsed my hair it so so hard to comb.  I have long hair , ended up cutting it because this product ruined  my hair!!! Grrrr</li>
            <li> Loved this product. I have only had a relaxer twice in my life time but after seeing my hair gradually thin out, break off and sadly fall out in clumps one day I decided that was end of the road with relaxers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been natural for many years, my hair is thick, strong and in good health with fine strands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As my natural hair became longer washing and blowdrying was becoming more tedious. I researched this relaxer and decided to try it as it appeared to be somewhat more gentle and nourishing with avocado, olive and coconut oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is also free from cheap fillers such as mineral oil and petroleum. ** However, this is still a CHEMICAL no lye relaxer, just less harsh than your traditional relaxer**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results: THIS RELAXER IS SUPERB. I truly feel this is a huge innovation and step forward in relaxer systems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was not bone straight, the relaxer gave me consistent soft waves. This is what I desired and left me with body yet manageability. When washing out my hair was very soft and silky and did not feel rough or dry. After the entire process was finished and rollerset, my hair had bounce, shine and looked very smooth like the model on the box. Today my hair still looks just as good , but best off all my hair is thick, soft, healthy and has not fallen off in clumps like with ORS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LAST WORDS: This is a VERY good relaxer for those wanting something a bit more &#x27;gentle&#x27; without the harsh chemicals. This relaxer does leave texture in your hair, so if you desire bone-straight hair this may not for you. However, for those naturals who have had enough with their hair THIS relaxer is for you. Straight from Eden is the happy medium between a relaxer and texturizer, where Type A ensured my hair was not overprocessed! GO FOR IT :)</li>
            <li> This relaxer is awesome!  I recently relaxed after being natural for 3 years.  I loved my natural 3C/4A curls; but I was worn out from all the time and effort to maintain my extremely fine, coily, curly, kinky not to mention frizz-prone hair.  After agonizing for months over whether to relax again, I allowed my stylist to apply this to my hair.  She did a superb job in applying, which left me with lots of texture and no scalp irritation whatsoever.  Compared to the very expensive Phyto 1 and 2 relaxers, which I used for several years before going natural, this was much, much better for my very fine but medium-thick hair. My hair didn&#x27;t have that hard, dry feel and wasn&#x27;t flat to my head.  I had lots of body in my hair from the beginning.  I would say my hair now looks like about a 2C/3A texture maybe (I&#x27;m not good with those but I know they help some people), so it is mildly relaxed or I guess some people say texlaxed.  I&#x27;m happy to have had no issues with breakage or scalp problems or excessive shedding, and I have extremely sensitive and allergy-prone skin. I am careful to maintain my hair with weekly moisture and protein.  Shea Moisture Passionfruit and Manuka Honey lines and 100% pure argan oil (no silicone) are what I mainly use to maintain my hair.  It is silky and strong and growing really quickly after only 4 weeks post.  I have no regrets about going back to relaxed, and I cannot speak highly enough of this wonderful product. I have included pics of my newly relaxed hair after washing and then after blow drying.  I hope this was helpful, especially to all the hair forum ladies.  Good luck with your hair journey!</li>
            <li> I used type A Fine as a touch up. About me: 4c hair fine, shoulder length, coily course.  Who this is for? 1. If you have 4 type hair (kinky, curly, course, fine) Naturals who want a loose curl/texturized look softer curls 2. Very mild relaxer for teenager, manageability without losing natural curls.  3. Transitioners from curly to kinky and vice versa. On the fence about going back to relaxers and want to transition slightly with the option to go back natural without cutting off hair. My story: natural for 3 yrs decided to relax 12 weeks ago but didn&#x27;t want harsh chemicals . First I used Phytospecific type 1 mild which was (in my opinion) stronger than CON type A, which are both considered the mild version. I only had that product in for 15 min and my hair was very loose curls. With CON type A i had it in for 20 min (NO scalp irritation at all!) and the curl was not as loose, but it was soft like a fluffy afro. It still gave me the manageability I wanted. I took one star away for the smell of CON, it was not as bad a traditional relaxers but it does get annoying after a while. The final result is it does not look like i have a relaxer, which is my goal, my roots are smooth. I will continue to use this as a touch up every 12 weeks. UPdated: Decided to go to type B to keep hair consistency closer to blow out look instead of afro look from type A. The smell no longer bothers me. I do experience breakage and i am still looking for remedies for my fine (4c) relaxed hair if anyone has suggestions.</li>
            <li> I really luv this relaxer. No chemical smells and this natural relaxer really keeps  your hair straight for a long time. There is a type a and type b therefore you can customize for your hair type. I&#x27; m really glad  to see that Cream of Nature came out with an all natural relaxer. I would recommend the shampoo, conditioner, and leave in conditioner. This product makes your hair soft and silky. Thank you Creme of Nature.</li>
            <li> Works great but the smell is horrible... like all relaxers and very hard to wash out. I did not use all products because smells bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African American woman with kinky thick thirsty hair. For years I struggled to find the right relaxer to effectively straighten my hair without burning my sensitive scalp or drying out my already thirst prone hair. I&#x27;ve tried lye , no lye Hawaiian silky , motions, and others, many others. Finally settled on Just for Me relaxer because it straightened my coarse resistant hair without burning my scalp, and I&#x27;ve used it the last several years with no complaints. Wanting a healthier option I ordered the Straight From Eden and ordered Type A for fine hair, ( even though my hair is by no means fine or thin) because I thought it&#x27;d be more gentle on my sensitive scalp, and I wanted to play it safe. I am more than pleased!!! My hair is soft, shiny and STRAIGHT! ....the gentle formula for fine hair did Zero damage to my scalp and left me with smooth strong strands. I did use everything in the kit, completed the application in 20 minutes and washed out promptly. I shampooed with the kits shampoo 4-5 times and then used the kits conditioner leaving it on an hour under heat. I am thrilled with the results and am happy to have a much less toxic product to relax my hair. Love love love!</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t straighten as well as described. I got better results using a kiddie texturizer.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!! Tried B Formula also, work about the same to me.</li>
            <li> does not have an odor, does not burn, does not plaster your hair to your head.  Relaxes very effectively, leaves my hair soft.  I recently transitioned from relaxed to natural for about 8 months,  my curl pattern was to tight for me to manage.  So I was looking for something to relax my curl but, not make it bone straight.  Straight from Eden gave me exactly what I was looking for.my hair has movement, body is shiny and healthy. I will definitely purchase this again and again.  This product is AMAZING.  I LOVE it. My hair is weightless I feel like a goddess.  This stuff needs to be sold everywhere. The only con about this relaxer is you can&#x27;t save any like if you&#x27;re doing a touch up you must use the the the whole thing and discard what is not used because the packaging is not resealable.  With traditional relaxers you could save some.  In the Philadelphia area I can find the relaxer and shampoo and conditioner at Walmart at times because it does sell out fast.  I can never find the repairing oil so I have to order thru Amazon .</li>
            <li> The product seemed to work fine. However I was missing the conditioner from the seemingly unopened box. I used what I had in the house to condition my hair. I loved the way it relaxed my hair and the way it felt after styling it. I am making my switch. I may use the B instead of the A next time.</li>
            <li> I used this perm because many individuals said that it was a good perm choice because this particular perm did not have harsh ingredients that would damage the hair due to it being &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34;. I was captured by the idea of natural and healthy ingredients, so I decided to try it. Boy, was I sadly disappointed!  After using the perm, my scalp developed large sores. I was unable to comb my hair for two weeks because my hair had matted to my scalp. As another reviewer commented, this perm leaves the hair excessively dry. My hair was dry for weeks after the perm.  Ladies, please listen to me. I had long, thick hair before I used this perm. My hair was well into my back. Now, after using this perm, some areas of my hair barely reach my shoulder. Trying this perm because it appears to be natural and has the appearance of a healthy perm choice is not worth losing a great deal of your hair like I did. Please save yourself heartache and search elsewhere for a perm because this perm is not for everyone.</li>
            <li> This was too thick for me.</li>
