            <li>The essential oils in this salt are PERFECT!  </li>
            <li>I feel relaxed and really enjoy this product!  </li>
            <li>Would buy again :)</li>
            <li>You need to use a lot more than the package recommends.  </li>

            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this soak.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love the smell too.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>My wife love it too.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I felt so much better</li>
            <li>but now, when the time comes (and believe me, I&#x27;m making time more often now)</li>
            <li>This product worked like a champ and is much better than the stand alone product of just mineral salts.</li>
            <li>Shipping was excellent and arrived before time and shipped the next day after order.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love the price and quantity.</li>
            <li>Love the scent.</li>
            <li>I wish I&#x27;d ordered one for myself:)</li>
            <li>and I sleep better.</li>
            <li>The mix of scents keeps it from being overly strong and I find clary sage is very good for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It does have a strong smell in the bath so make sure to use the scooper</li>
            <li>My smaller joints, like my fingers, felt very good.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin and relaxation.</li>
            <li>I noticed a distinct relaxed feel during and after the bath, and it left my skin feeling wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I really liked how this bath salt was perfectly scented, not too harsh, but scented just right.</li>
            <li>Some bath salts smell great but aside from the hot water, do nothing really therapeutic for the body and mind.  </li>
            <li>Such a great smell.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice, but there are much cheaper options that have a stronger smell.</li>
            <li>I wish a sea didn&#x27;t have to die for me to enjoy this product, but,</li>
            <li>My husband and I both enjoy using these to unwind.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!</li>
            <li>Having just started to venture into oils and aromatherapy kind of stuff, I was eager to try something I&#x27;d long heard about, which was the soothing pleasure of adding some salts to a bath, for a nice relaxing soak.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t often have time for a nice soak -- too often a high speed shower and out the door --</li>
            <li>It looks to me like about 3 baths worth of product - a bit too pricey!</li>
            <li>Even the next morning I still feel nice!</li>
            <li>my luxury is worth the death of a sea or two!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong out of the bag, but just right in the bath.</li>
            <li>Not too sweet.</li>
            <li>Adding four ounces to a full bath (chest covering full)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the full scoop that you get with it, but</li>
            <li>Clean, fresh, enchanting scent fills my bathroom.</li>
            <li>Salts dissolve quickly and thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>It does go quickly.</li>
            <li>I added a smaller amount of these salts to Epson salts and have enjoyed many rejuvenating soaks.  </li>
            <li>and when I use it it relaxes me a lot very fast!</li>
            <li>Perfect for meditation or simply soothing the mind after a long day.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite bath salt by far!  </li>
            <li>I love to take a fragrant bath before bed after a long stressful day and this bath soak smells amazing and leaves me feeling relaxed and ready to sleep.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li>I plan on buying more to give to my friends to help us all relax after busy summer days with the kids home!</li>
            <li>The smell was slight and perfect, the bath was relaxing and my skin is really soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and most bath products</li>
            <li>The product description says, &amp;#34;Simple and effective, guaranteed.&amp;#34; - I can actually confirm this!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also considered a natural cleanser, which makes you feel even better after using it.</li>
            <li>The smell alone is worth it.  </li>
            <li>I liked that the ingredients were gentle and natural</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overly scented but just the right amount.  </li>
            <li>Really nice salts, I spilt the bag and put some in a nice container and mixed in some other spa items and gave as gift for a friend who was going thru a divorce</li>
            <li>but instead I found the perfect combination of essential oils of Lavender, Clary Sage, and Palma Rosa with the Dead Sea Salt.</li>
            <li>Indeed I was pleased because this product smelled real and natural.</li>
            <li>For my showers, I mixed some of the dead sea salt to my body wash for a great body scrub!</li>
            <li>Very soothing!</li>
            <li>I have tried many different kinds of bath salt over the years.  </li>
            <li>My niece sent this to me for a Christmas present, and I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>To get such a quality product for such a reasonable price is great.</li>
            <li>Aroma is potent enough, on par with the Abra brand.</li>
            <li>It really makes baths relaxing!</li>
            <li>so much that I didn&#x27;t want to get out of the tub!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten much more relaxed prior to bedtime and slept really well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to the company for complimentary scooper, very usefull.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Works really well for relaxing in a hot bath.</li>
            <li>The salt crystals are rather large when you pour them out</li>
            <li>use them when I soak in the bathtub (I do add a 1/2 cup of Epson salts because I have a large tub)</li>
            <li>Pretty spendy seems to be a good quality product just pricey for small pouch !</li>
            <li>The great side benefit is that the lavender fragrance permeated the back half of the house for two days.  </li>
            <li>My ankle pain came back maybe a half hour later, but I was very happy to have some relief.</li>
            <li>This is a very high quality product.</li>
            <li>and today the next day; after only one bath I feel amazing.  </li>
            <li>Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li>Very relaxing.</li>
            <li>It is a very relaxing Bath Salt, I’m a stressed person</li>
            <li>This product was sent in a very timely fashion and was packaged very well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on the skin and very relaxing.</li>
            <li>Very relaxing.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Very calming during bath.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much, it is working on my wife&#x27;s  psoriasis on her hand and foot.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t notice a difference in quality per say, however Very foul odor from this stuff.</li>
            <li>It really soothed my joints and ankle.</li>
            <li>Really would recommend this to people.</li>
            <li>Adding a scoop of this to bath really is relaxing.</li>
            <li>The lavender scent was very relaxing.</li>
            <li>I looked all over for real &amp;#34;Dead Sea Salts&amp;#34; and couldn&#x27;t find them in any of the stores</li>
            <li>I know I&#x27;m very relaxed after my bath</li>
            <li>At almost a dollar an ounce , however it&#x27;s a nice splurge but at this price it should be all Dead Sea salt without Epsom added in.</li>
            <li>These dead sea salts were amazing and left me super relaxed</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to anyone who wants to add some relaxation to their life, and couldn&#x27;t we all use some?</li>
            <li>but my hip felt better within a half hour of my soak.  </li>
            <li>Love this product over previous products I have purchased.</li>
            <li>I have used many different products and can truly say that this one is different.  </li>
            <li>High quality stuff.  </li>
            <li>These are fantastic and reasonably priced compared to other bath salts that are not even organic.</li>
            <li>They could add a little more Lavender to it to make it a little more smelly, but it worked well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these salts if you love the soothing, calming affect of dead sea salts enhanced with the smell of lavender.  </li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling revived and fresh.</li>
            <li>This is one of the few purchases I&#x27;ve made online where I can say I was completely satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the order and will be reordering in the future.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s definitely an experience worth savoring!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a high stress job and can deal with a lot of emotionally toxic scenarios - the comfort of hot water, a handful of these salts and off I float.  </li>
            <li>and I feel like a new woman.</li>
            <li>Used these salts after having the flu, and I walked out of the bath feeling like a new person.</li>
            <li>I am a &amp;#34;bath girl&amp;#34; so am always looking for new products to enhance my &amp;#34;me&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>I keep a very busy schedule</li>
            <li>They seem to have just the right combination of dead sea and epsom salts that leave me feeling fresh and energized, yet relaxed and focused after every use.</li>
            <li>I plan on purchasing more of this product for families and friends who are in the professional field because we all know how hard it is to work long hours, then coming home and not be able to relax easily (especially if you have children).</li>
            <li>In addition it is a natural product and gives no side effects, recommended!</li>
            <li>This is a much appreciated present, and I am anxious to try more products from Maple Holistics.</li>
            <li>seems to be helping clear the molescum.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been going on this natural journey for a bit of time</li>
            <li>I use this for my husband and in a detox bath for my 2 year old who has eczema.</li>
            <li>It is all natural and no chemicals in the product will harm you in any type of way.</li>
            <li>Everything seems to dissolve completely.</li>
            <li>These bath salts are just what I was looking for in an all natural product.</li>
            <li>Very relaxing and helped soothed my aching muscles after such a strenuous workout.  </li>
            <li>although it seemed a bit expensive, I wanted a quality product, and after reading the packaging, i feel I made a good purchase.  </li>
            <li>I added some Four Thieves and a little Good Night blend from Edens Garden and, a few candles, a bit of meditation music, and it&#x27;s seriously the most relaxing bath</li>
            <li>Directions call for a third to a half cup of salt which is more than enough.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not hugely a bath person in the first place but this salt leaves you feeling very relaxed.  </li>
            <li>and I always try to find products that actually do what they say they will do and that have REAL natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s strange - at the same time, it energizes me and makes my skin feel alive - but it&#x27;s all in a positive way</li>
            <li>Left my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>Not only did it relax me, my skin was clear of any of scaly patches.</li>
            <li>Definitely going to use it in the future, perhaps toxins will go completely away.</li>

            <li> There is barely a lavender smell...not even close how it was described...not impressed at all and would not recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It has a very nice aroma and makes bathing a real treat!</li>
            <li> hope to buy more of this.</li>
            <li> Love the lavender smell.</li>
            <li> Love these bath salts.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff, and this brand.</li>
            <li> Lovely scent to these bath salts.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift but will be purchasing more for myself.</li>
            <li> The essential oils in this salt are PERFECT!  </li>
            <li> I feel relaxed and really enjoy this product!  </li>
            <li> Would buy again :)</li>
            <li> You need to use a lot more than the package recommends.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this soak.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love the smell too.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> My wife love it too.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I felt so much better</li>
            <li> but now, when the time comes (and believe me, I&#x27;m making time more often now)</li>
            <li> This product worked like a champ and is much better than the stand alone product of just mineral salts.</li>
            <li> Shipping was excellent and arrived before time and shipped the next day after order.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love the price and quantity.</li>
            <li> Love the scent.</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d ordered one for myself:)</li>
            <li> and I sleep better.</li>
            <li> The mix of scents keeps it from being overly strong and I find clary sage is very good for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It does have a strong smell in the bath so make sure to use the scooper</li>
            <li> My smaller joints, like my fingers, felt very good.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin and relaxation.</li>
            <li> I noticed a distinct relaxed feel during and after the bath, and it left my skin feeling wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I really liked how this bath salt was perfectly scented, not too harsh, but scented just right.</li>
            <li> Some bath salts smell great but aside from the hot water, do nothing really therapeutic for the body and mind.  </li>
            <li> Such a great smell.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice, but there are much cheaper options that have a stronger smell.</li>
            <li> I wish a sea didn&#x27;t have to die for me to enjoy this product, but,</li>
            <li> My husband and I both enjoy using these to unwind.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!</li>
            <li> Having just started to venture into oils and aromatherapy kind of stuff, I was eager to try something I&#x27;d long heard about, which was the soothing pleasure of adding some salts to a bath, for a nice relaxing soak.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often have time for a nice soak -- too often a high speed shower and out the door --</li>
            <li> It looks to me like about 3 baths worth of product - a bit too pricey!</li>
            <li> Even the next morning I still feel nice!</li>
            <li> my luxury is worth the death of a sea or two!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong out of the bag, but just right in the bath.</li>
            <li> Not too sweet.</li>
            <li> Adding four ounces to a full bath (chest covering full)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the full scoop that you get with it, but</li>
            <li> Clean, fresh, enchanting scent fills my bathroom.</li>
            <li> Salts dissolve quickly and thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> It does go quickly.</li>
            <li> I added a smaller amount of these salts to Epson salts and have enjoyed many rejuvenating soaks.  </li>
            <li> and when I use it it relaxes me a lot very fast!</li>
            <li> Perfect for meditation or simply soothing the mind after a long day.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite bath salt by far!  </li>
            <li> I love to take a fragrant bath before bed after a long stressful day and this bath soak smells amazing and leaves me feeling relaxed and ready to sleep.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li> I plan on buying more to give to my friends to help us all relax after busy summer days with the kids home!</li>
            <li> The smell was slight and perfect, the bath was relaxing and my skin is really soft.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and most bath products</li>
            <li> The product description says, &amp;#34;Simple and effective, guaranteed.&amp;#34; - I can actually confirm this!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also considered a natural cleanser, which makes you feel even better after using it.</li>
            <li> The smell alone is worth it.  </li>
            <li> I liked that the ingredients were gentle and natural</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overly scented but just the right amount.  </li>
            <li> Really nice salts, I spilt the bag and put some in a nice container and mixed in some other spa items and gave as gift for a friend who was going thru a divorce</li>
            <li> but instead I found the perfect combination of essential oils of Lavender, Clary Sage, and Palma Rosa with the Dead Sea Salt.</li>
            <li> Indeed I was pleased because this product smelled real and natural.</li>
            <li> For my showers, I mixed some of the dead sea salt to my body wash for a great body scrub!</li>
            <li> Very soothing!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different kinds of bath salt over the years.  </li>
            <li> My niece sent this to me for a Christmas present, and I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> To get such a quality product for such a reasonable price is great.</li>
            <li> Aroma is potent enough, on par with the Abra brand.</li>
            <li> It really makes baths relaxing!</li>
            <li> so much that I didn&#x27;t want to get out of the tub!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten much more relaxed prior to bedtime and slept really well.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to the company for complimentary scooper, very usefull.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Works really well for relaxing in a hot bath.</li>
            <li> The salt crystals are rather large when you pour them out</li>
            <li> use them when I soak in the bathtub (I do add a 1/2 cup of Epson salts because I have a large tub)</li>
            <li> Pretty spendy seems to be a good quality product just pricey for small pouch !</li>
            <li> The great side benefit is that the lavender fragrance permeated the back half of the house for two days.  </li>
            <li> My ankle pain came back maybe a half hour later, but I was very happy to have some relief.</li>
            <li> This is a very high quality product.</li>
            <li> and today the next day; after only one bath I feel amazing.  </li>
            <li> Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> Very relaxing.</li>
            <li> It is a very relaxing Bath Salt, I’m a stressed person</li>
            <li> This product was sent in a very timely fashion and was packaged very well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle on the skin and very relaxing.</li>
            <li> Very relaxing.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Very calming during bath.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much, it is working on my wife&#x27;s  psoriasis on her hand and foot.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a difference in quality per say, however Very foul odor from this stuff.</li>
            <li> It really soothed my joints and ankle.</li>
            <li> Really would recommend this to people.</li>
            <li> Adding a scoop of this to bath really is relaxing.</li>
            <li> The lavender scent was very relaxing.</li>
            <li> I looked all over for real &amp;#34;Dead Sea Salts&amp;#34; and couldn&#x27;t find them in any of the stores</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;m very relaxed after my bath</li>
            <li> At almost a dollar an ounce , however it&#x27;s a nice splurge but at this price it should be all Dead Sea salt without Epsom added in.</li>
            <li> These dead sea salts were amazing and left me super relaxed</li>
            <li> Highly recommended to anyone who wants to add some relaxation to their life, and couldn&#x27;t we all use some?</li>
            <li> but my hip felt better within a half hour of my soak.  </li>
            <li> Love this product over previous products I have purchased.</li>
            <li> I have used many different products and can truly say that this one is different.  </li>
            <li> High quality stuff.  </li>
            <li> These are fantastic and reasonably priced compared to other bath salts that are not even organic.</li>
            <li> They could add a little more Lavender to it to make it a little more smelly, but it worked well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these salts if you love the soothing, calming affect of dead sea salts enhanced with the smell of lavender.  </li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling revived and fresh.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few purchases I&#x27;ve made online where I can say I was completely satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the order and will be reordering in the future.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s definitely an experience worth savoring!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a high stress job and can deal with a lot of emotionally toxic scenarios - the comfort of hot water, a handful of these salts and off I float.  </li>
            <li> and I feel like a new woman.</li>
            <li> Used these salts after having the flu, and I walked out of the bath feeling like a new person.</li>
            <li> I am a &amp;#34;bath girl&amp;#34; so am always looking for new products to enhance my &amp;#34;me&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> I keep a very busy schedule</li>
            <li> They seem to have just the right combination of dead sea and epsom salts that leave me feeling fresh and energized, yet relaxed and focused after every use.</li>
            <li> I plan on purchasing more of this product for families and friends who are in the professional field because we all know how hard it is to work long hours, then coming home and not be able to relax easily (especially if you have children).</li>
            <li> In addition it is a natural product and gives no side effects, recommended!</li>
            <li> This is a much appreciated present, and I am anxious to try more products from Maple Holistics.</li>
            <li> seems to be helping clear the molescum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been going on this natural journey for a bit of time</li>
            <li> I use this for my husband and in a detox bath for my 2 year old who has eczema.</li>
            <li> It is all natural and no chemicals in the product will harm you in any type of way.</li>
            <li> Everything seems to dissolve completely.</li>
            <li> These bath salts are just what I was looking for in an all natural product.</li>
            <li> Very relaxing and helped soothed my aching muscles after such a strenuous workout.  </li>
            <li> although it seemed a bit expensive, I wanted a quality product, and after reading the packaging, i feel I made a good purchase.  </li>
            <li> I added some Four Thieves and a little Good Night blend from Edens Garden and, a few candles, a bit of meditation music, and it&#x27;s seriously the most relaxing bath</li>
            <li> Directions call for a third to a half cup of salt which is more than enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not hugely a bath person in the first place but this salt leaves you feeling very relaxed.  </li>
            <li> and I always try to find products that actually do what they say they will do and that have REAL natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s strange - at the same time, it energizes me and makes my skin feel alive - but it&#x27;s all in a positive way</li>
            <li> Left my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> Not only did it relax me, my skin was clear of any of scaly patches.</li>
            <li> Definitely going to use it in the future, perhaps toxins will go completely away.</li>
            <li> The scoop is way too large to use with small bag.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so far!</li>
            <li> Nice, but very expensive for the amount you recieve</li>
            <li> so &amp;#34;at ease&amp;#34; with yourself, no matter how long of a day you&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> The soft lavender scent is not overpowering and the dead sea salt soothes my sore muscles.</li>
            <li> the rainy weather and long day did not mix well with my arthritis.</li>
            <li> Very relaxing soothing bath salt , subtle Lavender oil aroma .</li>
            <li> Lavender Hybrid definitely gives you that wind it down effect</li>
            <li> A little goes long way and concentrated smell of essential oils, relaxing but not sleep inducing blend.</li>
            <li> I have found that this stuff goes a long way compared to other bath salts.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised by the quality of this product compared to other bath salt blends I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> I look forward to trying other products from this company!</li>
            <li> As previously stated, what I ordered was a 10 oz.</li>
            <li> I have had autoimmune arthritis all my life and recently have been dealing with serious tendon issues in my ankle even after surgery in the fall.</li>
            <li> but I did find it a little pricey.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I read an article that said that dead sea salts help relieve osteoarthritis pain.  </li>
            <li> I wanted palin Dead Sea salts.</li>
            <li> Package difficult to tear open without spilling n forget the rezip to close, I put mine in jar.</li>
            <li> Package too small to get the benefit of the soak.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m wondering why people view that as a negative.</li>
            <li> they help to reduce my achy muscles &amp; joints due to Fibromyalgia &amp; Arthritis (and a horrible pinched nerve that causes me so much pain)</li>
            <li> Came with a small scoop too!</li>
            <li> Instead I received this ugly sack with a given price of $14.99&#x27;  What a disappointment as the pretty jar of salts was intended to be given as a gift...</li>
            <li> These salts have some tan colored stuff that stick to the tub and are very hard to get off.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical until I used this product into the bathtub.</li>
            <li> a cold was coming on.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing for the price.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Hello Amazon! I tried this product on a whim because I was about to buy some essential oils for bath... but instead I found the perfect combination of essential oils of Lavender, Clary Sage, and Palma Rosa with the Dead Sea Salt. Indeed I was pleased because this product smelled real and natural. Especially after I had tried a different product from another company which had dehydrated and rashed me skin. Thank you Maple Holistics!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Aurangzeb &#x27;Ozzy&#x27; Sheikh</li>

Highly recommended to anyone who wants to add some relaxation to their life, and couldn&#x27;t we all use some?</li>
            <li> Love this salt! The lavender scent is perfect and not overwhelming, &amp; makes for the perfect bath that relaxes and eases muscle tightness! Definitely worth the order and will be reordering in the future.</li>
            <li> Package difficult to tear open without spilling n forget the rezip to close, I put mine in jar. The scoop is way too large to use with small bag. A little goes long way and concentrated smell of essential oils, relaxing but not sleep inducing blend. Nice.</li>
            <li> This product was sent in a very timely fashion and was packaged very well.  It has a very nice aroma and makes bathing a real treat!</li>
            <li> I use this for my husband and in a detox bath for my 2 year old who has eczema. It&#x27;s gentle on the skin and very relaxing. And a great price. I will be purchasing this product from now on.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. I was able to get three soaks out of one package!</li>
            <li> The mix of scents keeps it from being overly strong and I find clary sage is very good for my sensitive skin.  To get such a quality product for such a reasonable price is great. I was concerned it might be a tiny package, but it is a substantial amount. Came with a small scoop too!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I read an article that said that dead sea salts help relieve osteoarthritis pain.  It may be all in my head but my hip felt better within a half hour of my soak.  The great side benefit is that the lavender fragrance permeated the back half of the house for two days.  Great to drift off to sleep with that calming smell.</li>
            <li> I wonder, who is writing reviews? There is barely a lavender smell...not even close how it was described...not impressed at all and would not recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Really nice salts, I spilt the bag and put some in a nice container and mixed in some other spa items and gave as gift for a friend who was going thru a divorce and she raved about them! I agree but the price is the only reason I gave it 4 stars. At almost a dollar an ounce , however it&#x27;s a nice splurge but at this price it should be all Dead Sea salt without Epsom added in.</li>
            <li> As previously stated, what I ordered was a 10 oz. jar with silver tone lid of the Lavender Sea Salts, price given: $19.77, from your vendor Maple Holistics.  Instead I received this ugly sack with a given price of $14.99&#x27;  What a disappointment as the pretty jar of salts was intended to be given as a gift...Never again will I order anything from Maple Holistics.</li>
            <li> Very relaxing soothing bath salt , subtle Lavender oil aroma .</li>
            <li> You need to use a lot more than the package recommends.  The smell is nice, but there are much cheaper options that have a stronger smell.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Wonderful aroma and very relaxing when taking my bath.  Leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> I love this product. When you try it, you feel so relaxed and so &amp;#34;at ease&amp;#34; with yourself, no matter how long of a day you&#x27;ve had. I do not regret purchasing it. It is all natural and no chemicals in the product will harm you in any type of way. The product description says, &amp;#34;Simple and effective, guaranteed.&amp;#34; - I can actually confirm this! It is definitely effective. I plan on purchasing more of this product for families and friends who are in the professional field because we all know how hard it is to work long hours, then coming home and not be able to relax easily (especially if you have children). This is item perfect! Thank you, MH. Continue making amazing products!</li>
            <li> I wanted palin Dead Sea salts. How I chose lavender scented ones is beyond me. and I thought I&#x27;d chosen a 5lb bag. X_X I will try it out and see if it works. Then update.</li>
            <li> Very relaxing. Directions call for a third to a half cup of salt which is more than enough. Best used with a glass of wine.</li>
            <li> I have used many different products and can truly say that this one is different.  I actually feel physically different.  Aches and pains are relieved and stress fades.  I can still feel the effects when I wake up the next day.  Impressive!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I thought it would help me relax.  It doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> High quality stuff.  Salts dissolve quickly and thoroughly.  Aroma is potent enough, on par with the Abra brand. Scent is pleasant.  Adding four ounces to a full bath (chest covering full) the blend&#x27;s scent is still prevalent.  The &amp;#34;formula&amp;#34; is not just hype.  Some bath salts smell great but aside from the hot water, do nothing really therapeutic for the body and mind.  Lavender Hybrid definitely gives you that wind it down effect you may be looking for in your evening soak.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> I love to take a fragrant bath before bed after a long stressful day and this bath soak smells amazing and leaves me feeling relaxed and ready to sleep. I look forward to trying other products from this company!</li>
            <li> Love this soak. Will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li> Gave to my mom as a present- she loved them!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product! It smells wonderful! It really makes baths relaxing!</li>
            <li> Great quality and does the job</li>
            <li> Purchased to make bath gifts for the holidays. Love this product over previous products I have purchased. I have tried this product myself, as I do with all the products I make. I felt heavenly</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It&#x27;s also considered a natural cleanser, which makes you feel even better after using it. I&#x27;m on my 2nd bag now. It does go quickly. I don&#x27;t use the full scoop that you get with it, but probably 3/4 of it. There is no actual lavender leaves in the salts that stay after your bath is over. Everything seems to dissolve completely. Love the smell too. It&#x27;s strong out of the bag, but just right in the bath. I look forward to bath time like I did when I was a &amp;#34;yout!&amp;#34; lol</li>
            <li> Gave as a gift, my Mom said she was very pleased with it.  Shipped promptly.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing for the price.  Y</li>
            <li> this product is amazing. love it. My wife love it too. so relaxing.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these salts if you love the soothing, calming affect of dead sea salts enhanced with the smell of lavender.  I added a smaller amount of these salts to Epson salts and have enjoyed many rejuvenating soaks.  The smell alone is worth it.  Clean, fresh, enchanting scent fills my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I loved them.  I liked that the ingredients were gentle and natural</li>
            <li> Smells so great right off the package.  Very calming during bath.</li>
            <li> This product is Great! I just love the way it smell!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I keep a very busy schedule and I was feeling like a cold was coming on.  I took a bath in this for about 25 mins afterwards I felt so much better and today the next day; after only one bath I feel amazing.  It has that spa feeling to it also.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much, it is working on my wife&#x27;s  psoriasis on her hand and foot. Thank you once again.  Charles</li>
            <li> These dead sea salts were amazing and left me super relaxed so much that I didn&#x27;t want to get out of the tub!  Love the lavender smell as well!</li>
            <li> Just wonderful for a good night sleep.</li>
            <li> Having just started to venture into oils and aromatherapy kind of stuff, I was eager to try something I&#x27;d long heard about, which was the soothing pleasure of adding some salts to a bath, for a nice relaxing soak.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how GREAT the aroma was, of this combination blend, and it just filled the whole bathroom with the most relaxing and soothing symphony of smells!!!!  I added some Four Thieves and a little Good Night blend from Edens Garden and, a few candles, a bit of meditation music, and it&#x27;s seriously the most relaxing bath I&#x27;ve ever had -- felt great!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very very pleased with this product, and will order up more when I run out.  I don&#x27;t often have time for a nice soak -- too often a high speed shower and out the door -- but now, when the time comes (and believe me, I&#x27;m making time more often now) it&#x27;s definitely an experience worth savoring!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!</li>
            <li> Smells delicious.  Wish they had a larger bag.</li>
            <li> got the product very quickly I am so happy  thank you</li>
            <li> The cheapest and most effective DSS I&#x27;ve found to date. For my showers, I mixed some of the dead sea salt to my body wash for a great body scrub! Not only did it relax me, my skin was clear of any of scaly patches.</li>
            <li> seems to be helping clear the molescum.</li>
            <li> The soft lavender scent is not overpowering and the dead sea salt soothes my sore muscles. Thirty minutes in the tub and I feel like a new woman.</li>
            <li> These salts have some tan colored stuff that stick to the tub and are very hard to get off. otherwise they are awesome salts</li>
            <li> I received this product as a gift. As some of the reviews state, the lavender scent is more faint than overpowering but I&#x27;m wondering why people view that as a negative. The smell was slight and perfect, the bath was relaxing and my skin is really soft. Five stars, for sure!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a difference in quality per say, however Very foul odor from this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have had autoimmune arthritis all my life and recently have been dealing with serious tendon issues in my ankle even after surgery in the fall. I used this last night and was extra achy bc the rainy weather and long day did not mix well with my arthritis. This product is amazing! I could feel my pain being softened while I was relaxing in my bath and breathing in the lavender scent. It really soothed my joints and ankle. My larger joints still hurt a bit, but did feel improved. My smaller joints, like my fingers, felt very good. My ankle pain came back maybe a half hour later, but I was very happy to have some relief. Even the next morning I still feel nice! It is a great product for practical temporary pain relief plus I loved feeling like I went to a spa bc the amazing smell.</li>
            <li> This product worked like a champ and is much better than the stand alone product of just mineral salts. The conditioners and Lavender added to it help stop you from drying out. They could add a little more Lavender to it to make it a little more smelly, but it worked well. Shipping was excellent and arrived before time and shipped the next day after order.</li>
            <li> Delicious smelling and very soothing to the skin.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> Used these salts after having the flu, and I walked out of the bath feeling like a new person. I loved the calming feel and the refreshing lavender scent. Left my skin very soft. I would recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Works really well for relaxing in a hot bath.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was dying of itch from mosquito bites. This bath salt did miracles. Love the price and quantity. Will order again when I&#x27;ll finish it.</li>
            <li> These bath salts are just what I was looking for in an all natural product. I plan on buying more to give to my friends to help us all relax after busy summer days with the kids home!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a couple of great benefits from this product and I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so far! I&#x27;ve gotten much more relaxed prior to bedtime and slept really well.  But it&#x27;s strange - at the same time, it energizes me and makes my skin feel alive - but it&#x27;s all in a positive way so it doesn&#x27;t wake me up, just perks me up emotionally. Love the scent. Sometimes lavender can be overpowering but this is just the perfect amount. And I have chronic pain and I believe it&#x27;s helped my pain level when I soak in the tub. The salt crystals are rather large when you pour them out and I was worried how they would dissolve but they do a great job of that. Really would recommend this to people. Nice treat for yourself! Give it as a gift to someone who needs pampering.</li>
            <li> I wish a sea didn&#x27;t have to die for me to enjoy this product, but, oh well...my luxury is worth the death of a sea or two!</li>
            <li> this was the best product I ever purchased for a soothing, refreshing, softening bath.  I will want to reorder it again as soon as possible but I did find it a little pricey.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as part of a gift basket I&#x27;m putting together for someone, so I can&#x27;t give a review on the quality of the product itself.  It arrived on time, undamaged.  It&#x27;s a good size package, although it seemed a bit expensive, I wanted a quality product, and after reading the packaging, i feel I made a good purchase.  I wish I&#x27;d ordered one for myself:)</li>
            <li> Adding a scoop of this to bath really is relaxing. Has helped with sleep at night. It does have a strong smell in the bath so make sure to use the scooper but smell does not linger after the bath.</li>
            <li> Package too small to get the benefit of the soak.</li>
            <li> Very relaxing and helped soothed my aching muscles after such a strenuous workout.  Will definitely use it again.  The lavender scent was very relaxing.</li>
            <li> Great product! Smells heavenly, feels amazing! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Lovely, lovely bath salts!  I am a &amp;#34;bath girl&amp;#34; so am always looking for new products to enhance my &amp;#34;me&amp;#34; time and unwind before I go to bed.  These salts fill the ticket - pleasant relaxing Lavender fragrance with an underlying tone of Clary Sage.  Perfect for after an overworked day.  I have a high stress job and can deal with a lot of emotionally toxic scenarios - the comfort of hot water, a handful of these salts and off I float.  Definitely will buy again.</li>
            <li> Good transaction, good product.</li>
            <li> I looked all over for real &amp;#34;Dead Sea Salts&amp;#34; and couldn&#x27;t find them in any of the stores so I was very happy to be able to get them on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;I use them when I soak in the bathtub (I do add a 1/2 cup of Epson salts because I have a large tub) they help to reduce my achy muscles &amp; joints due to Fibromyalgia &amp; Arthritis (and a horrible pinched nerve that causes me so much pain) I know I&#x27;m very relaxed after my bath and I sleep better. They help detox you as well!  They arrived quickly and in good condition, I&#x27;ll order this again!</li>
            <li> These are fantastic and reasonably priced compared to other bath salts that are not even organic. Great for sensitive skin and relaxation. My husband and I both enjoy using these to unwind.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical until I used this product into the bathtub. Indeed, I felt afterwards, refreshed and relaxed. Definitely going to use it in the future, perhaps toxins will go completely away. Thanks to the company for complimentary scooper, very usefull.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend</li>
