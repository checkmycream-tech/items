            <li>Nice customer service.  </li>
            <li>Nice msm drops.</li>
            <li>if it&#x27;s ok, i will boost the concentration to 7 percent msm with saline eye wash in a sterile glass eye dropper.</li>
            <li>But for me it doesn&#x27;t look safe to drop this into eyes.</li>
            <li>but thank goodness for the amazing costumer service everything was handled smoothly.</li>
            <li>my eyes feels better</li>
            <li>this is a great product to keep your eyes supple and clean of dirt and other toxins and greatly enhance the eye sight too,</li>
            <li>I cannot tolerate prescription anti-inflammatory medication due to digestive problems, so this is a perfect substitute.  </li>
            <li>Takes the pain right away!</li>
            <li>The vendor was quick to ship</li>
            <li>This product is just as good as the other MSM drops I use to use</li>

            <li>They burn a tiny bit when I first put them in my eyes, but my eyes feel better the next day.</li>
            <li>It reduces the dryness and intolerance to light, and cuts back use of constant eye drops to soothe the discomfort.  </li>
            <li>I get very dry eyes from being on the computer and these drops soothe my eyes quickly.</li>
            <li>I have a 13 year old dog with some eye problems.  </li>
            <li>I do eye exercises and take supplements that are specifically recommended for eye health and so far have avoided the need for glasses.</li>
            <li>I read about using eyedrops containing MSM to help keep the tissues soft and moist and decided to try these.  </li>
            <li>At first I was skeptical about these MSM drops I heard mixed reviews about these kinda things because they involve your eyes, you know those two balls that help you see and are very important and once they go bust</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve not tried the product long enough to verify such results.</li>
            <li> Well I decided to go for it and went ahead and bought these anyways (despite the negative feedback) I&#x27;ve been using them for a week and my eyes no longer get dried so easily</li>
            <li> Long term result are speculative, but some authors assert that gas permeability and nutrient uptake to the eye can be facilitated.</li>
            <li> Maybe it takes a long time.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to be anything special, just expensive.</li>
            <li> Always want to keep it around for when I&#x27;ve spent too long in front of a computer screen.</li>
            <li> No effect other than dry eyes</li>
            <li> I cannot say definitely that the cause was this product, but it was the one &#x27;alien&#x27; thing I used for treatment.</li>
            <li> My eyelids have a strange heavy feeling immediate.</li>
            <li> I started using this product to help with inflammation due to Ocular Rosacea of my eyes.  </li>
            <li> , I also noticed seeing less floaters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s helping or not.</li>
            <li> I must say that I bought this product with high expectations in clearing a cataract and that I was totally disappointed.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything for my dry eyes or my ears that cannot stand cold</li>
            <li> I tried other products in the interim until I discovered Knutek and all were disappointing.</li>
            <li> i will make them weak in case they sting.</li>
            <li> I had a terrible reaction to this product and had to seek medical attention.  </li>
            <li> This company refused to refund my purchase which I think is just deplorable considering the pain it caused me.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is good stuff! Very refreshing and (supposedly) very good for your eyes. I&#x27;m using it regularly since I got it and like the way my eyes feel these days.</li>
            <li> Soothing rinse.  Long term result are speculative, but some authors assert that gas permeability and nutrient uptake to the eye can be facilitated. I&#x27;ve not tried the product long enough to verify such results.</li>
            <li> I had a terrible reaction to this product and had to seek medical attention.  After only three days of using these drops my eye swelled shut.  This company refused to refund my purchase which I think is just deplorable considering the pain it caused me.  Nice customer service.  BUYER BEWARE!!!</li>
            <li> i have not used this product, but i did research it. the drops were not banned by the FDA because they contained msm. they were banned because they were found to be contaminated with bacteria. i will make drops myself using msm powder and saline solution. i will make them weak in case they sting. if it&#x27;s ok, i will boost the concentration to 7 percent msm with saline eye wash in a sterile glass eye dropper. [...]  i only rated this because i could not post without giving a star rating. i&#x27;ve never used this product.</li>
            <li> I must say that I bought this product with high expectations in clearing a cataract and that I was totally disappointed. If anything, it appears as though it worsened the condition. I recently had the cataract removed and the doctor commented on the overall size of the cataract. When I was first diagnosed I was told I would need surgery within 5 years. It was at this time that I purchased this item. My eyesight diminished greatly within a matter of months. I cannot say definitely that the cause was this product, but it was the one &#x27;alien&#x27; thing I used for treatment. No eye specialist I have spoken with have mentioned this to be something that will help the cataract condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A definite DO NOT PURCHASE.</li>
            <li> this is a great product to keep your eyes supple and clean of dirt and other toxins and greatly enhance the eye sight too,</li>
            <li> I got it yesterday and used it twice yesterday before sleep. My eyelids have a strange heavy feeling immediate. The feeling will gone in abou 1 minute, which doesn&#x27;t hurt but I&#x27;d like to know what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle doesn&#x27;t have any expire date on it. The only date is \\&quot;copyrighted by 2001\\&quot;. Is this legal for an eye drop product?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, according to some video at youtube. \\&quot;MSM eye drop\\&quot; was banned by the government (serveral years ago). kNutek renamed it to \\&quot;MSM Water\\&quot; to start reselling them. The bottle I got is named \\&quot;MSM eye drop\\&quot; which is the version that been banned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know the reason that it&#x27;s been banned. But for me it doesn&#x27;t look safe to drop this into eyes.</li>
            <li> Eye drops have helped a lot</li>
            <li> I definitely think these help my eyes. They burn a tiny bit when I first put them in my eyes, but my eyes feel better the next day. I am going to keep using these!</li>
            <li> No effect other than dry eyes</li>
            <li> I used a different MSM eye drop product for years before it was discontinued (I think the vendor passed away). I tried other products in the interim until I discovered Knutek and all were disappointing. This product is just as good as the other MSM drops I use to use and I’m very happy with it. I get very dry eyes from being on the computer and these drops soothe my eyes quickly. The vendor was quick to ship and I’m very happy with the product. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I started using this product to help with inflammation due to Ocular Rosacea of my eyes.  I cannot tolerate prescription anti-inflammatory medication due to digestive problems, so this is a perfect substitute.  It reduces the dryness and intolerance to light, and cuts back use of constant eye drops to soothe the discomfort.  I use regular oral MSM for other inflammation challenges, it&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li> I received my product and I noticed there was white particles floating in it but thank goodness for the amazing costumer service everything was handled smoothly.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to be anything special, just expensive.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff! Always want to keep it around for when I&#x27;ve spent too long in front of a computer screen.</li>
            <li> I think these drops help. I have retina issues and use the drops twice daily, along with taking lutein supplements. My vision is noticeablepy sharper and I feel these drops and the lutein help resolve and decrease floaters.</li>
            <li> Just started using but I like it my eyes feels better</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical about these MSM drops I heard mixed reviews about these kinda things because they involve your eyes, you know those two balls that help you see and are very important and once they go bust you can&#x27;t replace them, Well I decided to go for it and went ahead and bought these anyways (despite the negative feedback) I&#x27;ve been using them for a week and my eyes no longer get dried so easily, I also noticed seeing less floaters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I found out about the people complaining is that they might have an allergic reaction to MSM.</li>
            <li> Worked as advertised. A couple drops 4 times a day, very easy.&lt;br /&gt;Eye exams at VA much improved so fewer visits.&lt;br /&gt;I am Happy, what can I say.</li>
            <li> incredible healing for eyes</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything for my dry eyes or my ears that cannot stand cold but it is marvelous on my sore wrist after I exercise.  Takes the pain right away!</li>
            <li> Good shipping. Good product. No complaints.</li>
            <li> No effect was experienced with the used of this product.</li>
            <li> Still using to soon to connent</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed much. I was hopeful. Maybe it takes a long time. It doesn&#x27;t hurt. It doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> Provides relief to my eyes when they are watering, burning or itching.</li>
            <li> been using msm for years its the best for eye care</li>
            <li> Nice msm drops. No scent, no sting.</li>
            <li> I have a 13 year old dog with some eye problems.  He has cataracts.  No diabetes though.  These drops seem to have been improving his vision.  He isn&#x27;t bumping into walls anymore and has been going down the stairs on his own.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Just a drop in each eye once a day.  Be consistent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s helping or not.</li>
            <li> Being of &amp;#34;a certain age&amp;#34; my eyes are showing signs of wear and tear. I do eye exercises and take supplements that are specifically recommended for eye health and so far have avoided the need for glasses. I read about using eyedrops containing MSM to help keep the tissues soft and moist and decided to try these.  I&#x27;ve been using them for about a year now and have noticed some improvements in my vision and a lessening of the &amp;#34;gritty&amp;#34; feeling under my eyelids.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by a healer and I do believe it to be a helpful product for the eyes.</li>
