            <li>I just came from a Halloween Carnival where I face painted 50 kids, I am reordering this palette because I ran out of the brown (SO many puppies!)</li>

            <li>Item as described, fast shipping, very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li>The colors worked wonderfully and the paint didn&#x27;t irritate his skin at all, and he has very sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>and it has this great light coconut scent which is an added bonus :)</li>
            <li>Very easily build-able coverage.</li>
            <li>Megatron is by far the best face paint, and this is a quality product with an affordable price tag.</li>
            <li>But its amazing :)</li>
            <li>The Paradise face paints in general are excellent; easy us use with brilliant coverage and colors that stay true on skin without chance of skin reactions.  </li>
            <li>So easy!</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>These are a safe aloe, cocoa butter, and avocado oil paint - which is awesome for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>,it&#x27;s very smooth and it covers well.</li>
            <li>Everyone was in love with the quality of the face paint.</li>
            <li>I used most of it on 5 faces-</li>
            <li>Even when dancing ALLLLL night :)</li>
            <li>I fell in love the minute I saw the metal top of the pallet with &amp;#34;Mehron&amp;#34; carved on it.</li>
            <li>Really enjoyed this product</li>
            <li>felt like I was painting with water colors :)</li>
            <li>I was also able to blend/layer colors on our faces.</li>
            <li>- this is the brand professionals use the most.</li>
            <li>Most of the colors are nice and smooth when applied.</li>
            <li>I must say I LOVE, LOVE,</li>
            <li>Me and my wife used it for a recent larping event and everybody was Betty impressed with the vibrancy of the colors.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>and you will be stocked for most occasions.</li>
            <li>This is the best paint, and I have tried several brands.</li>
            <li>Love the colours.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Doesnt get any better than this.  </li>
            <li>wow, I didn&#x27;t know face paint could be so good!</li>
            <li>Highly pigmented, great color.</li>
            <li>Coverage is excellent and it is very fluid and makes creative design easy and fun.</li>
            <li>Amazing pallet I used for Halloween to make a cool sugar school stayed on all night and didn&#x27;t make my face feel greasy since it is water based paint super in love with mehron</li>
            <li>Was very useful for the many face paintings we did.</li>
            <li>Easy to put on and easy to wash off.</li>
            <li>Because the paint was so easy to use the face</li>
            <li>So easy to use.</li>
            <li>So easy to wash off.</li>
            <li>The colors are gorgeous, and you get a really decent amount for the quality and price.</li>
            <li>I loved the texture and the way the paints went on with vibrant color.</li>
            <li>Safe for kids and dries quickly</li>
            <li>This is a great color pallet, especially for this fall, and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Applies smooth and sets to a matte finish.</li>
            <li>so happy I&#x27;m making a smaller and easier C SPAN case that I&#x27;ve got my huge thing with this fits great into my smaller one</li>
            <li>I am a first time face painter and these paints were perfect to get my feet wet.</li>
            <li>This was my introduction into higher end product paints, and I really felt it was good purchase.</li>
            <li>These paint were so easy to work with and had super concentrated color.</li>
            <li>love that it&#x27;s water activated &amp; it easily to mix &amp; create new colors.</li>
            <li>Very good quality and the smaller pallet fits better in your pocket or in a smaller bag.</li>
            <li>painting was pretty easy.</li>
            <li>I bought face paint for a quick diy costume for my kids.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping but</li>
            <li>and I immediately went online to find this along with the mehron special FX Kit( wich is worth the money)</li>
            <li>I am very pleased overall with the pallet though and play to get the rest of them as well.</li>
            <li>But the product is great, not so sure how long it will last though</li>
            <li>Wish the white was more pigmented!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy &amp; fun to use especially if you&#x27;re into special fx &amp; painting.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>but well worth it.  </li>
            <li>had no problem blending colors right on the palette.</li>
            <li>I was informed you could mix colors right on the pallet.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use, different levels of pigmentation easy to achieve, very usable set of colors...</li>
            <li>It really helps me when I use it for special fx, it gives GREAT coverage with very little product &amp; I</li>
            <li>My daughter really likes to get her face painted and after buying many cheap face paints at craft stores and such</li>
            <li>, I decided to spend a little bit more money and get better quality face paints.  </li>
            <li>Coconut oil based pigment means that it doesn&#x27;t run, doesn&#x27;t stain your skin, comes off easily with baby wipes, and leaves your skin baby soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with these face paints and am going to purchase other colors.</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend this product to anyone in need of face paint. :)</li>
            <li>The shipping was insanely FAST, too!</li>
            <li>They are pretty opaque.  </li>
            <li>Overall I would recommend the product but just make sure you know what you need it for before purchasing.</li>
            <li>and so glad I finally got it.  </li>
            <li>The effect I was going for looked very realistic with these paints.</li>
            <li>and I would suggest purchasing the most used basic colors (white etc) in full size to compliment this collection.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The palette is affordable and more than enough product to paint faces dozens and dozens of times at parties or for personal cosmetic and artistic needs.</li>
            <li>Product as described with fast shipping</li>
            <li>Very opaque.</li>
            <li>and I really didn&#x27;t want makeup smudging off so soon after doing it or smearing all over my stuff.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper here than from websites that cater to professionals.</li>
            <li>and it was surprisingly very streaky and not at all opaque.</li>
            <li>It is also a reasonably priced way to try the product out.  </li>
            <li>The colors are very pigmented and you don&#x27;t need much water to activate them.</li>
            <li>dont use these colors as much</li>
            <li>and yes it really does smell like coconuts</li>
            <li>Work very well.</li>
            <li>Seriously, Paradise is easy to activate with little water, applies great with a brush or sponge, very pigmented, washes off with soap and water and it SMELLS LIKE COCONUT!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve enough paint for at least 10 Halloweens and it washed off beautifully with soap and water -- much easier than with oil based cosmetics.  </li>
            <li>It dries very quickly on the skin and once dry it won&#x27;t move unless water is applied.</li>
            <li>High quality paint with lots of pigment;</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to turn my little cousins into something else . . .  :))))))))))))))</li>
            <li>They do not rub off on others or other things easily.  </li>
            <li>I really suggest these for the professional or the beginner.</li>
            <li>Stay away from Snazzaroo and Wolfe is great, but too expensive.</li>
            <li>And the vendor was polite enough to refund my money right away.</li>
            <li>I definitely got more than expected out of this product.</li>
            <li>I take this to comic con to do my personal face painting.</li>
            <li>Bought this after researching a vibrant fast drying, low smudge face paint.&lt;br /&gt;Great purchase for my kiddo for her halloween costume.</li>
            <li>I rubbed layers off until the white was true white again.</li>
            <li>This may be all sunshine and roses if you&#x27;re using it for adults and keeping it on your cheeks as far as I know.  </li>
            <li>She demands having her face painted quite frequently</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m getting to be an old pro at</li>
            <li>They feel soft to the touch after they&#x27;ve been applied.  </li>
            <li>Water based, they can be applied with soft brush (like water color brushes) and soft makeup sponges.  </li>
            <li>The colors are very pigmented but the white tends doesn&#x27;t seem to cover as opaquely as the others do.</li>
            <li>This palette will last a LONG time unless you are doing full body paint.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t sticky like some paints and dry pretty quickly with very minimal smudging.</li>
            <li>I plan to get larger pans of several of the colors; white and black especially run out more quickly.  </li>
            <li>Ive been through MANY of the basic and several of the other 5 in the series.  </li>
            <li>I did a test on my upper arm and neck area and barely had to use much.</li>
            <li>You can wipe the colors back to new again with a baby wipe.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s pretty active</li>
            <li>But you can&#x27;t use red, orange, or yellow near the eyes, and you aren&#x27;t supposed to use it on anyone under three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even the pink on my lips stayed decently through drinking all night.  </li>
            <li>I used a cheaper base and this palette to paint detailed work on top.</li>
            <li>this palette was smaller than expected but went through 12 hours of nonstop face painting and only the white hot pan at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>Small but worth the money.</li>
            <li>I did not use it that much because I did not want to waste it on broad coverage.</li>
            <li>It did smear off a little by the end of the night but much less than the cheap halloween makeup you can pick up</li>
            <li>I suggest getting the large white and black individual paints as well</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The colors worked wonderfully and the paint didn&#x27;t irritate his skin at all, and he has very sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> and it has this great light coconut scent which is an added bonus :)</li>
            <li> Very easily build-able coverage.</li>
            <li> Megatron is by far the best face paint, and this is a quality product with an affordable price tag.</li>
            <li> But its amazing :)</li>
            <li> The Paradise face paints in general are excellent; easy us use with brilliant coverage and colors that stay true on skin without chance of skin reactions.  </li>
            <li> So easy!</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> These are a safe aloe, cocoa butter, and avocado oil paint - which is awesome for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> ,it&#x27;s very smooth and it covers well.</li>
            <li> Everyone was in love with the quality of the face paint.</li>
            <li> I used most of it on 5 faces-</li>
            <li> Even when dancing ALLLLL night :)</li>
            <li> I fell in love the minute I saw the metal top of the pallet with &amp;#34;Mehron&amp;#34; carved on it.</li>
            <li> Really enjoyed this product</li>
            <li> felt like I was painting with water colors :)</li>
            <li> I was also able to blend/layer colors on our faces.</li>
            <li> - this is the brand professionals use the most.</li>
            <li> Most of the colors are nice and smooth when applied.</li>
            <li> I must say I LOVE, LOVE,</li>
            <li> Me and my wife used it for a recent larping event and everybody was Betty impressed with the vibrancy of the colors.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> and you will be stocked for most occasions.</li>
            <li> This is the best paint, and I have tried several brands.</li>
            <li> Love the colours.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Doesnt get any better than this.  </li>
            <li> wow, I didn&#x27;t know face paint could be so good!</li>
            <li> Highly pigmented, great color.</li>
            <li> Coverage is excellent and it is very fluid and makes creative design easy and fun.</li>
            <li> Amazing pallet I used for Halloween to make a cool sugar school stayed on all night and didn&#x27;t make my face feel greasy since it is water based paint super in love with mehron</li>
            <li> Was very useful for the many face paintings we did.</li>
            <li> Easy to put on and easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> Because the paint was so easy to use the face</li>
            <li> So easy to use.</li>
            <li> So easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> The colors are gorgeous, and you get a really decent amount for the quality and price.</li>
            <li> I loved the texture and the way the paints went on with vibrant color.</li>
            <li> Safe for kids and dries quickly</li>
            <li> This is a great color pallet, especially for this fall, and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Applies smooth and sets to a matte finish.</li>
            <li> so happy I&#x27;m making a smaller and easier C SPAN case that I&#x27;ve got my huge thing with this fits great into my smaller one</li>
            <li> I am a first time face painter and these paints were perfect to get my feet wet.</li>
            <li> This was my introduction into higher end product paints, and I really felt it was good purchase.</li>
            <li> These paint were so easy to work with and had super concentrated color.</li>
            <li> love that it&#x27;s water activated &amp; it easily to mix &amp; create new colors.</li>
            <li> Very good quality and the smaller pallet fits better in your pocket or in a smaller bag.</li>
            <li> painting was pretty easy.</li>
            <li> I bought face paint for a quick diy costume for my kids.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping but</li>
            <li> and I immediately went online to find this along with the mehron special FX Kit( wich is worth the money)</li>
            <li> I am very pleased overall with the pallet though and play to get the rest of them as well.</li>
            <li> But the product is great, not so sure how long it will last though</li>
            <li> Wish the white was more pigmented!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy &amp; fun to use especially if you&#x27;re into special fx &amp; painting.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> but well worth it.  </li>
            <li> had no problem blending colors right on the palette.</li>
            <li> I was informed you could mix colors right on the pallet.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use, different levels of pigmentation easy to achieve, very usable set of colors...</li>
            <li> It really helps me when I use it for special fx, it gives GREAT coverage with very little product &amp; I</li>
            <li> My daughter really likes to get her face painted and after buying many cheap face paints at craft stores and such</li>
            <li> , I decided to spend a little bit more money and get better quality face paints.  </li>
            <li> Coconut oil based pigment means that it doesn&#x27;t run, doesn&#x27;t stain your skin, comes off easily with baby wipes, and leaves your skin baby soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with these face paints and am going to purchase other colors.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend this product to anyone in need of face paint. :)</li>
            <li> The shipping was insanely FAST, too!</li>
            <li> They are pretty opaque.  </li>
            <li> Overall I would recommend the product but just make sure you know what you need it for before purchasing.</li>
            <li> and so glad I finally got it.  </li>
            <li> The effect I was going for looked very realistic with these paints.</li>
            <li> and I would suggest purchasing the most used basic colors (white etc) in full size to compliment this collection.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The palette is affordable and more than enough product to paint faces dozens and dozens of times at parties or for personal cosmetic and artistic needs.</li>
            <li> Product as described with fast shipping</li>
            <li> Very opaque.</li>
            <li> and I really didn&#x27;t want makeup smudging off so soon after doing it or smearing all over my stuff.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper here than from websites that cater to professionals.</li>
            <li> and it was surprisingly very streaky and not at all opaque.</li>
            <li> It is also a reasonably priced way to try the product out.  </li>
            <li> The colors are very pigmented and you don&#x27;t need much water to activate them.</li>
            <li> dont use these colors as much</li>
            <li> and yes it really does smell like coconuts</li>
            <li> Work very well.</li>
            <li> Seriously, Paradise is easy to activate with little water, applies great with a brush or sponge, very pigmented, washes off with soap and water and it SMELLS LIKE COCONUT!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enough paint for at least 10 Halloweens and it washed off beautifully with soap and water -- much easier than with oil based cosmetics.  </li>
            <li> It dries very quickly on the skin and once dry it won&#x27;t move unless water is applied.</li>
            <li> High quality paint with lots of pigment;</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to turn my little cousins into something else . . .  :))))))))))))))</li>
            <li> They do not rub off on others or other things easily.  </li>
            <li> I really suggest these for the professional or the beginner.</li>
            <li> Stay away from Snazzaroo and Wolfe is great, but too expensive.</li>
            <li> And the vendor was polite enough to refund my money right away.</li>
            <li> I definitely got more than expected out of this product.</li>
            <li> I take this to comic con to do my personal face painting.</li>
            <li> Bought this after researching a vibrant fast drying, low smudge face paint.&lt;br /&gt;Great purchase for my kiddo for her halloween costume.</li>
            <li> I rubbed layers off until the white was true white again.</li>
            <li> This may be all sunshine and roses if you&#x27;re using it for adults and keeping it on your cheeks as far as I know.  </li>
            <li> She demands having her face painted quite frequently</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m getting to be an old pro at</li>
            <li> They feel soft to the touch after they&#x27;ve been applied.  </li>
            <li> Water based, they can be applied with soft brush (like water color brushes) and soft makeup sponges.  </li>
            <li> The colors are very pigmented but the white tends doesn&#x27;t seem to cover as opaquely as the others do.</li>
            <li> This palette will last a LONG time unless you are doing full body paint.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t sticky like some paints and dry pretty quickly with very minimal smudging.</li>
            <li> I plan to get larger pans of several of the colors; white and black especially run out more quickly.  </li>
            <li> Ive been through MANY of the basic and several of the other 5 in the series.  </li>
            <li> I did a test on my upper arm and neck area and barely had to use much.</li>
            <li> You can wipe the colors back to new again with a baby wipe.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s pretty active</li>
            <li> But you can&#x27;t use red, orange, or yellow near the eyes, and you aren&#x27;t supposed to use it on anyone under three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even the pink on my lips stayed decently through drinking all night.  </li>
            <li> I used a cheaper base and this palette to paint detailed work on top.</li>
            <li> this palette was smaller than expected but went through 12 hours of nonstop face painting and only the white hot pan at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Small but worth the money.</li>
            <li> I did not use it that much because I did not want to waste it on broad coverage.</li>
            <li> It did smear off a little by the end of the night but much less than the cheap halloween makeup you can pick up</li>
            <li> I suggest getting the large white and black individual paints as well</li>
            <li> Depending on how much water you use is how opaque the product will be - my ONE complaint, and the reason this got 4 instead of 5 stars, is no matter how little water you use, the white still seems to come out kind of thin and see-through.</li>
            <li> I used the brown, black and red to shade my metallic paint to look like different colors, and to draw the screws on my face.</li>
            <li> A simple drop off pink from the other paradise pallet landed on my white and stained through.</li>
            <li> But the other colors last a long time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Which is unfortunate for me this halloween, because my 2 year old would make a really kickass Ziggy Stardust/ Aladdin Sane.  </li>
            <li> , I suggest purchasing a single cake of the black and white instead.</li>
            <li> Not sure how much paint was wasted.</li>
            <li> Folks thought I&#x27;d spent hours, but it just took this kit, a bunch of makeup brushes, a YouTube video and about an hour.  </li>
            <li> It lasted longer than what I expected</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little can go a long way!  </li>
            <li> otherwise it&#x27;s not worth keeping in your kit.</li>
            <li> the black as well</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;These are not full size like some people might be thinking.</li>
            <li> I was nominated to face paint at my nephews birthday party and I having not ever face painted kids was a little nervous.</li>
            <li> The most unsanitized and unwarranted as description is false and nothing like the used up item shipped without explanation seller emails back in vulgar mannerism and tone!</li>
            <li> I painted myself up to be a Day of the Dead &amp;#34;Candy Skull&amp;#34; and looked like a  million bucks for Halloween!  </li>
            <li> Hardly any drying time at all</li>
            <li> Unfortunately mine was crushed in the mail after being lost for a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Was kinda disappointed I thought they were bigger ...</li>
            <li> Sorry for the late review I rarley use Amazon</li>
            <li> and now I&#x27;m addicted.</li>
            <li> That crap they sell at Hobby Lobby is not worth the packaging.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed I orders the basic pallet and received a terrible pastel pallet</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed omg had to use it</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great product!! I want to buy more!</li>
            <li> I bought face paint for a quick diy costume for my kids. Everyone was in love with the quality of the face paint.</li>

(It&#x27;s David Bowie.  Google it).</li>
            <li> Amazing pallet I used for Halloween to make a cool sugar school stayed on all night and didn&#x27;t make my face feel greasy since it is water based paint super in love with mehron and it has this great light coconut scent which is an added bonus :)</li>

            <li> awesome works great. With the white was bigger I used most of it on 5 faces- the black as well, I suggest purchasing a single cake of the black and white instead.</li>
            <li> BEST facepaint I have ever used. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> the BEST makeup i&#x27;ve ever purchased. Dries like a powder, no smearing. Even when dancing ALLLLL night :)</li>
            <li> i saw MadeYewLook use this and I immediately went online to find this along with the mehron special FX Kit( wich is worth the money) I fell in love the minute I saw the metal top of the pallet with &amp;#34;Mehron&amp;#34; carved on it. Thanks a lot to Amazon and Mehron for creating and selling an amazing product at an incredible price!!!</li>
            <li> I love this palette! These paints are easy to use and remove and the best part is that they smell like coconut!! They aren&#x27;t sticky like some paints and dry pretty quickly with very minimal smudging. I am a first time face painter and these paints were perfect to get my feet wet.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping but the pallete was smaller than imagined. But the product is great, not so sure how long it will last though</li>

            <li> Add water and then paint! Highly pigmented, great color. I used the brown, black and red to shade my metallic paint to look like different colors, and to draw the screws on my face. It was cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt like I was painting with water colors :)</li>
            <li> They worked well and covered great!</li>
            <li> Loved this paet i wished i could find every color in these compacts.</li>
            <li> Pallets were smaller than I was expecting</li>
            <li> Colors is not so bright as on the picture.</li>
            <li> Very opaque. Easy to put on and easy to wash off. Blends well too.</li>
            <li> Amazing paints they were very bright and didn&#x27;t smug they lasted over 24 hours</li>

            <li> My Wife&#x27;s Favorite brand !!!</li>
            <li> These paint were so easy to work with and had super concentrated color. A little goes a long way. I was nominated to face paint at my nephews birthday party and I having not ever face painted kids was a little nervous. Because the paint was so easy to use the face painting was pretty easy. Paint isn&#x27;t greasy like Halloween face paint you get at party stores, making it a great choice for kids without the worry of traces of smeared paint all over house, clothes, etc.</li>
            <li> Bought this after researching a vibrant fast drying, low smudge face paint.&lt;br /&gt;Great purchase for my kiddo for her halloween costume. She&#x27;s pretty active and I really didn&#x27;t want makeup smudging off so soon after doing it or smearing all over my stuff. It did smear off a little by the end of the night but much less than the cheap halloween makeup you can pick up anywhere.&lt;br /&gt; She demands having her face painted quite frequently and I&#x27;m getting to be an old pro at it.&lt;br /&gt;These are not full size like some people might be thinking. Definitely a smaller size and I would suggest purchasing the most used basic colors (white etc) in full size to compliment this collection.&lt;br /&gt;I had no problem blending colors right on the palette. You can wipe the colors back to new again with a baby wipe. I was also able to blend/layer colors on our faces. Love it!</li>
            <li> Great paint and great price - this is the brand professionals use the most. Much cheaper here than from websites that cater to professionals.</li>
            <li> Was very useful for the many face paintings we did.</li>
            <li> Paradise is the best face paint I&#x27;ve found to date. Coconut oil based pigment means that it doesn&#x27;t run, doesn&#x27;t stain your skin, comes off easily with baby wipes, and leaves your skin baby soft. Best of all, it doesn&#x27;t flake. At all. I recommend it to all my face painting and theatrical friends.</li>
            <li> Excellent timing with shipping, great product!</li>
            <li> They are pretty opaque.  Good quality.</li>
            <li> Most of the colors are nice and smooth when applied. However I tried using the white to cover my entire face and it was surprisingly very streaky and not at all opaque. Overall I would recommend the product but just make sure you know what you need it for before purchasing.</li>
            <li> Very good quality and the smaller pallet fits better in your pocket or in a smaller bag. Megatron is by far the best face paint, and this is a quality product with an affordable price tag.</li>
            <li> Everything I was expecting. Watched a tutorial on Youtube and was able to attend a costume party as a parrot!  I&#x27;ve never face painted in my life.  To be honest, I&#x27;m not so great with make-up, ha.  This was a great puchase.  Can&#x27;t wait to turn my little cousins into something else . . .  :))))))))))))))</li>
            <li> I love this brand of face paint, it has great texture,it&#x27;s very smooth and it covers well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my eye on this pallete for a while and so glad I finally got it.  It&#x27;s a definite staple in my kit. Smells so pleasant, like coconut. Applies smooth and sets to a matte finish. No setting powder needed. No breakouts!</li>
            <li> Excellent product !!!</li>
            <li> A great intro to quality body makeup.  The palette has the basics, as advertised.</li>
            <li> Amazing. great shipping time. Superb product</li>
            <li> My daughter really likes to get her face painted and after buying many cheap face paints at craft stores and such, I decided to spend a little bit more money and get better quality face paints.  I must say I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these paints!  They&#x27;re not oily, or goopy.  They feel soft to the touch after they&#x27;ve been applied.  Hardly any drying time at all and they last a really long time (as long as the child - or adult - doesn&#x27;t rub their face).  I&#x27;m very pleased with these face paints and am going to purchase other colors.</li>
            <li> The Paradise face paints in general are excellent; easy us use with brilliant coverage and colors that stay true on skin without chance of skin reactions.  Water based, they can be applied with soft brush (like water color brushes) and soft makeup sponges.  The palette is very handy since you can hold all the colors in one hand.  It is also a reasonably priced way to try the product out.  I plan to get larger pans of several of the colors; white and black especially run out more quickly.  But the other colors last a long time.  I really suggest these for the professional or the beginner.</li>
            <li> so happy I&#x27;m making a smaller and easier C SPAN case that I&#x27;ve got my huge thing with this fits great into my smaller one thank you thank</li>
            <li> The paint works and looks great! Me and my wife used it for a recent larping event and everybody was Betty impressed with the vibrancy of the colors.</li>
            <li> Works great and arrived promptly</li>
            <li> This body paint is incredible! It dries very quickly on the skin and once dry it won&#x27;t move unless water is applied. Very easily build-able coverage. The colors are very pigmented and you don&#x27;t need much water to activate them. This palette will last a LONG time unless you are doing full body paint. I did a test on my upper arm and neck area and barely had to use much. The effect I was going for looked very realistic with these paints. These are a safe aloe, cocoa butter, and avocado oil paint - which is awesome for people with sensitive skin. This company also doesn&#x27;t test on animals. Could not be happier with this product.</li>
            <li> Was kinda disappointed I thought they were bigger ... But it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> this palette was smaller than expected but went through 12 hours of nonstop face painting and only the white hot pan at the end of the day. It has really great coverage, I suggest buying it if you are a beginner otherwise it&#x27;s not worth keeping in your kit. But it was great for what it was!</li>
            <li> Really nice face paints!</li>
            <li> I loved the texture and the way the paints went on with vibrant color.</li>
            <li> dont use these colors as much but when i do they are great.</li>
            <li> This face paint is excellent quality. The palette is affordable and more than enough product to paint faces dozens and dozens of times at parties or for personal cosmetic and artistic needs.</li>
            <li> perfect Halloween makeup!</li>
            <li> I was informed you could mix colors right on the pallet. Don&#x27;t do it. A simple drop off pink from the other paradise pallet landed on my white and stained through. I rubbed layers off until the white was true white again. Not sure how much paint was wasted.</li>
            <li> This palette is great for face painting.  I definitely got more than expected out of this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great color pallet, especially for this fall, and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love it! So easy! Wish the white was more pigmented! But I love it!</li>
            <li> I just came from a Halloween Carnival where I face painted 50 kids, I am reordering this palette because I ran out of the brown (SO many puppies!) I suggest getting the large white and black individual paints as well and you will be stocked for most occasions. This is the best paint, and I have tried several brands. Stay away from Snazzaroo and Wolfe is great, but too expensive. That crap they sell at Hobby Lobby is not worth the packaging. Seriously, Paradise is easy to activate with little water, applies great with a brush or sponge, very pigmented, washes off with soap and water and it SMELLS LIKE COCONUT!  Can&#x27;t tell you how nice that is when you are inches away from stinky, sweaty kids.</li>
            <li> Llego exacto el dia y hora que tenia que llegar me encanto los colores</li>
            <li> OMG.  I painted myself up to be a Day of the Dead &amp;#34;Candy Skull&amp;#34; and looked like a  million bucks for Halloween!  Folks thought I&#x27;d spent hours, but it just took this kit, a bunch of makeup brushes, a YouTube video and about an hour.  Never used face paint before.  Once I knew to add water (like with water colors) I was off and running.  Amazing results!  I&#x27;ve enough paint for at least 10 Halloweens and it washed off beautifully with soap and water -- much easier than with oil based cosmetics.  I suspect perspiration would have caused it to run though.</li>
            <li> Love the colours. It yield  lots</li>
            <li> The most unsanitized and unwarranted as description is false and nothing like the used up item shipped without explanation seller emails back in vulgar mannerism and tone!</li>
            <li> Amazing thank you. Sorry for the late review I rarley use Amazon and I didn&#x27;t know how to review this product. But its amazing :)</li>
            <li> I bought this just to play with and now I&#x27;m addicted. The colors are very pigmented but the white tends doesn&#x27;t seem to cover as opaquely as the others do. I am very pleased overall with the pallet though and play to get the rest of them as well.</li>
            <li> Great set of colors with great pigment.  A little can go a long way!  They do not rub off on others or other things easily.  Even the pink on my lips stayed decently through drinking all night.  Not the easiest to get off in the world but well worth it.  Best face paint I have ever used!</li>
            <li> I love it and yes it really does smell like coconuts</li>
            <li> It was great! It lasted longer than what I expected</li>
            <li> These face paints work well, excellent colors.</li>
            <li> The packaging is beautiful. And I do love all my merlon products! Unfortunately mine was crushed in the mail after being lost for a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give 5 stars, as I know the product. And the vendor was polite enough to refund my money right away. Things happen. No big.</li>
            <li> Best face/ body paint ever!</li>
            <li> High quality paint with lots of pigment; perfect for cosplay</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! It&#x27;s very easy &amp; fun to use especially if you&#x27;re into special fx &amp; painting. It really helps me when I use it for special fx, it gives GREAT coverage with very little product &amp; I love that it&#x27;s water activated &amp; it easily to mix &amp; create new colors. I would definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed I orders the basic pallet and received a terrible pastel pallet I was so disappointed omg had to use it and now I have to go buy colors somewhere else</li>
            <li> 17 y/o dtr uses all the time</li>
            <li> Paint ran, as kids that I had painted started to run, play and get sweaty! It was embarrassing after just spending all that time on the art work! Thought that the product for the price, would be more stable after drying!</li>
            <li> Item as described, fast shipping, very happy with my purchase! smells awesome, easy to activate and apply.</li>
            <li> Small but worth the money.</li>
            <li> So easy to use. So easy to wash off. GREAT</li>
            <li> Amazing face paints. Work very well.</li>
            <li> Its Mehron!!! Doesnt get any better than this.  Ive been through MANY of the basic and several of the other 5 in the series.  Alll of them are matte with the exception of the &#x27;brilliant&#x27; pallet, that one being metallic.  They are ALL superior.</li>
            <li> Great, bright, strong pigments</li>
            <li> Very good makeup. I will use this every time that I am painting my face. Coverage is excellent and it is very fluid and makes creative design easy and fun. Highly recommended. Used for sugar skull face this time with teeth, flowers, and henna style patterns. The white is alright. I did not use it that much because I did not want to waste it on broad coverage. I used a cheaper base and this palette to paint detailed work on top.</li>
