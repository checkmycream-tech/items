            <li>that´s ok, a good piece, grand seller</li>
            <li>LOVE the cute Hello Kitty in disguise designs too.</li>
            <li>The best part is, I never have to actually touch it or the head of my toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s just adorable.</li>
            <li>Love this</li>
            <li>They love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s adorable.</li>
            <li>This tooth brush holder is so cute, but not functional for me.</li>
            <li>I have a 2, 4 and 7 year old and all of them have done a great job of keeping their brushes in the container.  </li>
            <li>Very quick shipping.</li>
            <li>The suction on my mirror is strong too.</li>
            <li>My grand children think i&#x27;m a cool grandma.</li>
            <li>Its fabulous because I can put them on the wall at their height</li>
            <li>but it didnt fit...</li>
            <li>I am pretty satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Cutest tooth brush protector ever I was so excited when I received the product</li>
            <li>It has helped keep the sink area clean.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a toothbrush case and at the moment I saw this one I fall in love because I really like HK.</li>
            <li>It ships quickly.</li>
            <li>I love that it helps to keep the counter space clear of toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>and i had to have it worth the price.</li>
            <li>Keeps my toothbrush handy and dry.</li>
            <li>I did love the design however and the suction cups on back!</li>
            <li>My dad had to use his cutters to adjust the hole large enough to fit my toothbrush (which is why I gave it a four)</li>
            <li>You can but it for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Her sister&#x27;s has worked just fine for the past 2 years and it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
            <li>Love that they flip closed!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>The doors open and close easily, but not too loose.</li>
            <li>I have zero counter space in my crowded, shared, bathroom and have been unable to find a good way to store my toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It is super easy to clean and really fun for a boring bathroom!</li>
            <li>Also, since it&#x27;s mounted to the mirror, we can keep it high enough that the girls can&#x27;t get to their toothbrushes and play with them.  </li>
            <li>Apparently it shipped from overseas.  </li>
            <li>Hope this new one lasts a very long time for us.  </li>
            <li>Shipping took quite a long time (nearly 1 month) as I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the ship date.  </li>

            <li> I usually have trouble finding a toothpaste holder like this that a standard Oral B tooth brush will fit in, but this one works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Plus, it puts a smile on my face every morning when I see this ridiculous hello kitty cat dressed as a frog.</li>
            <li> Also, sometimes one of the sides will come off if I&#x27;m not careful, but they slide back into place with a little pressure.</li>
            <li> I love it because it hangs in order to make the tooth brush dry and one does not have to use a cup that gets filthy over time</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to pull too hard or the doors pop off.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had it a few months now.</li>
            <li> We have a small bathroom and not a lot of counter space.  </li>
            <li> , I wanted to use it on my electric hello kitty toothbrush I purchased at walmart but the toothbrush hole was too small, so this product does not work for electric tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> and I could not use this properly :(</li>
            <li> Cups get dirty or soapy water dripped in them from handwashing, and toothbrush covers still require that I put the toothbrush on the counter (where it gets knocked into the sink and onto the floor, not the mention that the counter gets dripped on and covered in hair).</li>

            <li> We have a small bathroom and not a lot of counter space.  This is a great idea, in my opinion, for that reason alone.  I also like that it keeps the brushes away from the germs and ant splatter from the sink.  The kids love them, too!</li>
            <li> BEST ITEM FOR THE BATHROOM!   It is super easy to clean and really fun for a boring bathroom! So Great that I bought two of them!</li>
            <li> I take my daughter to work with me and this is ideal for holding her toothbrush there.  No one can knock it over in a cup or having it laying on the sink and get knocked off onto the bathroom floor.  Suction is excellent.</li>
            <li> It keeps my toothbrush off the counter and away from my sister, who &amp;#34;forgets&amp;#34; which on is hers. Really happy with this. Just be careful not to pull too hard or the doors pop off. They snap back, but still.</li>
            <li> I bought three of these for my three kids, each a different color.  I then bought them toothbrushes of the same color.  They love the system!  I have a 2, 4 and 7 year old and all of them have done a great job of keeping their brushes in the container.  Its fabulous because I can put them on the wall at their height and we can even take them on vacation (I would not have thought to pack them, but the kids grabbed them and packed them and stuck them on the wall in the bathroom at our beach house rental).  I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas present for my niece. She just loved it, since she likes frogs and Hello Kitty. Plus it has a practical purpose too being a tooth brush holder.</li>
            <li> Shipping took quite a long time (nearly 1 month) as I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the ship date.  Apparently it shipped from overseas.  My daughter loves it and it works great.  The suction cups work well and I haven&#x27;t had a problem with them yet.  I did purchase another one for my daughter (was an elephant, different brand) and have difficulties with one of those suction cups not working.  This one however is still holding on well.</li>
            <li> Somehow, my daughter&#x27;s toothbrush holder wouldn&#x27;t close and hold the toothbrush any longer.  This was my replacement.  Her sister&#x27;s has worked just fine for the past 2 years and it&#x27;s still going strong.  Hope this new one lasts a very long time for us.  But if not, I&#x27;ll just buy another one.  I love that it helps to keep the counter space clear of toothbrushes.  Also, since it&#x27;s mounted to the mirror, we can keep it high enough that the girls can&#x27;t get to their toothbrushes and play with them.  Great to travel with.  LOVE the cute Hello Kitty in disguise designs too.</li>
            <li> Affordable and fits nicely on the mirror. Keeps my toothbrush handy and dry. My grand children think i&#x27;m a cool grandma.</li>

            <li> that´s ok, a good piece, grand seller</li>
            <li> I used this as a stocking stuffer for my daughter who loves hello kitty. It was perfect and she was happy.</li>
            <li> Convenient, sanitary and cute! I have had several people when over ask where i got them and what they are called! Love that they flip closed!!</li>
            <li> I have zero counter space in my crowded, shared, bathroom and have been unable to find a good way to store my toothbrush. Cups get dirty or soapy water dripped in them from handwashing, and toothbrush covers still require that I put the toothbrush on the counter (where it gets knocked into the sink and onto the floor, not the mention that the counter gets dripped on and covered in hair). All this means that being the germaphobe I am I go through about 5 toothbrushes a month, until this. This thing is PERFECT. it cannot be knocked over, it is thoroughly protected from dust and grime. The best part is, I never have to actually touch it or the head of my toothbrush. I just pull on the bottom of my toothbrush and push it back in. I am buying several of these in case it somehow breaks or gets lost. Plus it&#x27;s just adorable.</li>
            <li> Very quick shipping. I am very happy with this purchase...it&#x27;s just perfect for my dorm room! I am pretty satisfied with this purchase. I would buy again from this seller</li>
            <li> This toothbrush holder is beyond cute!!! love it!! It has a suction cup on the back so you can attach to the mirror too!! love it!!</li>
            <li> Cutest tooth brush protector ever I was so excited when I received the product, I wanted to use it on my electric hello kitty toothbrush I purchased at walmart but the toothbrush hole was too small, so this product does not work for electric tooth brushes. My dad had to use his cutters to adjust the hole large enough to fit my toothbrush (which is why I gave it a four) Wish I could have gave it a five but it didnt fit... I did love the design however and the suction cups on back! (though they didnt work well) The alligator costume on hello kitty reminds me on my birth state and childhood (florida) &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I was looking for a toothbrush case and at the moment I saw this one I fall in love because I really like HK. It&#x27;s perfect, opens and close easily.</li>
            <li> So cute! Love this and i had to have it worth the price.</li>
            <li> You can but it for a reasonable price. It ships quickly. And it works well. Neither the frog nor the panda have broke yet.</li>
            <li> Thi is wonderful. Kids kove it, adults too. Suction  great on mirror. We&#x27;ve had it a few months now. Bravo</li>
            <li> My kids had to get this after a friend of ours had it.  It has helped keep the sink area clean.  They love it.</li>
            <li> This is the cutest tooth brush holder I have ever had. I love it because it hangs in order to make the tooth brush dry and one does not have to use a cup that gets filthy over time</li>
            <li> I love this! It&#x27;s adorable. It MUST be hung on a mirror, though. It will not stick to tile. Also, sometimes one of the sides will come off if I&#x27;m not careful, but they slide back into place with a little pressure.</li>
            <li> It sticks on my tile in my shower and I&#x27;ve never had any problems with it falling off even with the numerous times of me pulling my toothbrush out. The doors open and close easily, but not too loose. You don&#x27;t even have to touch it because pushing your toothbrush in closes the doors. Great for traveling... I lost one of the suction cups &amp;it still holds up! Really good gift idea &amp;so very cute. :)</li>
            <li> This tooth brush holder is so cute, but not functional for me. The suction cup would not adhere to my bathroom mirror and I could not use this properly :(</li>
