            <li>I&#x27;m so glad this is offered on Amazon and at a good price.  </li>
            <li>and I may have to get a bar of my own</li>
            <li>I have also used Lemon Sage and the Rose Petal Flavor.  </li>
            <li>I had no problem with the Rose Petal.</li>
            <li>When I ran out of my own soap a couple of years ago, I tried One With Nature brand soaps--several.  </li>
            <li>for most people I think this would be 5 stars as it is very nice and rich</li>
            <li>But what really matters is that using this soap is a fricken&#x27; fantastic, delicious experience which you must try for yourself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this soap and love the brand.  </li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>I already ordered more in this scent and some others.</li>
            <li>Received in a timely fashion and love the product.</li>
            <li>My dear husband is a connoisseur of peppermint soaps: we have tried the peppermint soaps you can get from Trader Joe&#x27;s and Whole Foods (Dr. Bronner&#x27;s I believe), and up until now he was happy with them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to order more soaps for everyone.</li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>It is my newest favorite and I am so pleased with this peppermint soap.</li>
            <li>Lovely.</li>

            <li>My husband loves interesting soap scents.  </li>
            <li>Love all the &amp;#34;dead sea minerals&amp;#34; soaps by this company.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I also enjoyed the smell.</li>
            <li>What more can I say?</li>
            <li>Nice scent rinses off quickly.</li>
            <li>Great peppermint soap, love the fresh minty scent, not too strong, just right.</li>
            <li>this is a very good product, feels better than other soaps,, glad I purchased it</li>
            <li>Rich, dense and satisfying.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve made a lot of soap using only organic ingredients and had fun in the process of making really good and good smelling soap.  </li>
            <li>Filled all my expectations.</li>
            <li>The lather is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Love the cool fresh, sudsy fragrance of this special soap.  </li>
            <li>This soap lasts a really long time and it smells great.</li>
            <li>The peppermint tingles and makes you feel really clean and relaxed.</li>
            <li>This soap smells great and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>There is no heavy overwhelming scent, just a lovely smell while showering.  </li>
            <li>It has plenty of moisture, makes washing very easy to clean, and so far no allergens.</li>
            <li>As long as I have a good moisturizer and zit cream for back up in case of a rare breakout - I&#x27;m good.  </li>
            <li>All 3 lather so rich &amp; leave my skin SO SOFT &amp; SMOOTH!</li>
            <li>At first I only lathered my skin, but decided to try it on my hair as well and loved the result.  </li>
            <li>Highly Recommend!!!  </li>
            <li>The peppermint oil that is infused with the soap is taken up by my skin and never fails to leave me with a refreshed and clean feeling that is unmistakably the properties of a high-end product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth every penney.  </li>
            <li>Not among my favorite One With Nature bars, but a great feeling natural soap none the less!</li>
            <li>This particular soap lasts a good while, too, as long as you don&#x27;t leave it in a soggy place.</li>
            <li>My order came super fast and now everyone in my family is using my soap.</li>
            <li>I have not used the soap yet, but due to the ingredients, I am sure I will enjoy what it has to offer.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>First, lather up</li>
            <li>any good peppermint soap, this one has peppermint essential oil which gives an instant cooling sensation on the skin and perks you up.</li>
            <li>My skin is combination &amp; very sensitive - the ingredients in here are mild on my skin.  </li>
            <li>This alone would warrant a 2 star review from me as i bought it with the only intention being a strong peppermint, which i found lackluster here.</li>
            <li>it s so large.</li>
            <li>the price I expected a mush better product then received.</li>
            <li>$2.50 would be reasonable.</li>
            <li>This is really great/awesome soap.....</li>
            <li>Thanks a million...</li>
            <li>It really does feel like a spa soap.  </li>
            <li>I fell in love with this one and stopped using the other peppermint soap.  </li>
            <li>Decent soap</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is now my favorite everyday bath bar.  </li>
            <li>My favorite was the plain shea butter.  </li>
            <li>However i am adding a star because the smell, though not exactly what i wanted, is quite pleasant, and the bar itself lasted almost DOUBLE what i expected.</li>
            <li>The bar is pretty big.</li>
            <li>Most commercial soaps I end up deciding they won&#x27;t work for me in the long run, because they dry my skin out, don&#x27;t lather well, have too much scent in them, contain ingredients I prefer to avoid having in on-going contact with my body, etc.  </li>
            <li>Lathered and Cleaned well, and lasted twice as long as many other brands.</li>
            <li>Lathers up nicely, smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on the shower doors (a plus for me since I hate having to wash the doors down constantly).</li>
            <li>They lather well, and leave your skin squeaky clean without being dried out.</li>
            <li>Smell is weak dries out skin.&lt;br /&gt;Bar will last to the very end.&lt;br /&gt;The mud bar is better in my opinion from using both.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They claim mineral from the dead sea, this doesn&#x27;t seem to be true.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried nearly every brand of facial wash and bar soaps from $1 - $60 and for me, it&#x27;s all just hype.  </li>

            <li> Unfortunately, it is on Amazon at a higher price than some of the other One With Nature soaps, so I just bought more online from another company at half the Amazon price.  </li>
            <li> However, my main purpose in purchasing it was for the abrasive material which is completely missing.</li>
            <li> One With Nature&#x27;s soap are long lasting as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bar is pretty thick and for me it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> but enough other smells involved to detract from the peppermint.</li>
            <li> ** sucks,leaves skin dry the soap itself dries out and cracks</li>
            <li> Let it dry out a bit</li>
            <li> I have been through numerous soap products that have only irritated or overly dried out my skin.</li>
            <li> I happened to have one bar of One With Nature peppermint, not a essential oil/scent I ever used in my soaps in the past, left over from making up gift packs for friends and</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a bar of soap that meet my extremely picky skin needs for a long time.</li>
            <li> Just received my peppermint soap, faster than expected!</li>
            <li> Have used One With Nature Soap for at least the last two years.  </li>
            <li> Other soaps I have with minerals of the dead sea has a pebbly feel to it.</li>
            <li> but the scent is not very strong</li>
            <li> Lasted a little over 2 weeks (1 person use).</li>
            <li> Product listed that it contained menthol but there was so little I couldn&#x27;t tell.</li>
            <li> so it costs no more than other One With Nature soaps they sell.</li>
            <li> Probably the dead sea minerals in this soap are also nourishing in ways we can&#x27;t perceive.</li>
            <li> This is very hard milled soap and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I actually ordered the &amp;#34;OLive oil&amp;#34; soap &amp; unfortunately received this by mistake.</li>
            <li> There is nothing like the feeling of dead cells falling away after dirty house work!</li>
            <li> Too expensive for what you get.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Just received my peppermint soap, faster than expected! It smells awesome. I can&#x27;t wait to try it out. I like to have 2 or 3 different big bars so I can switch soapy moods. :D</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this soap and love the brand.  I use this on my face.  My skin is combination &amp; very sensitive - the ingredients in here are mild on my skin.  I&#x27;ve tried nearly every brand of facial wash and bar soaps from $1 - $60 and for me, it&#x27;s all just hype.  As long as I have a good moisturizer and zit cream for back up in case of a rare breakout - I&#x27;m good.  I&#x27;m so glad this is offered on Amazon and at a good price.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love this soap. Lathers up nicely, smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on the shower doors (a plus for me since I hate having to wash the doors down constantly). I already ordered more in this scent and some others. The bar is pretty big. Lasted a little over 2 weeks (1 person use). I recommend this soap.</li>
            <li> Great peppermint soap, love the fresh minty scent, not too strong, just right. And shea soap washes off well.</li>
            <li> This soap lasts a really long time and it smells great.</li>
            <li> Received in a timely fashion and love the product.</li>
            <li> this is a very good product, feels better than other soaps,, glad I purchased it</li>
            <li> Smell is weak dries out skin.&lt;br /&gt;Bar will last to the very end.&lt;br /&gt;The mud bar is better in my opinion from using both.&lt;br /&gt;GET Natur&#x27;s best Mud bar!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with these soaps.</li>
            <li> Love the cool fresh, sudsy fragrance of this special soap.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great soap, but I prefer the &amp;#34;mud&amp;#34; , &amp;#34;shea butter&amp;#34;, &amp; &amp;#34;Dead sea salt&amp;#34; varieties. All 3 lather so rich &amp; leave my skin SO SOFT &amp; SMOOTH! I actually ordered the &amp;#34;OLive oil&amp;#34; soap &amp; unfortunately received this by mistake. Not among my favorite One With Nature bars, but a great feeling natural soap none the less!</li>
            <li> Big bar but the scent is not very strong</li>
            <li> Product listed that it contained menthol but there was so little I couldn&#x27;t tell. Decent soap</li>
            <li> My dear husband is a connoisseur of peppermint soaps: we have tried the peppermint soaps you can get from Trader Joe&#x27;s and Whole Foods (Dr. Bronner&#x27;s I believe), and up until now he was happy with them. Now that I have spoiled him with this peppermint soap in his Christmas stocking, he will never slum it with Dr. Bronner again :D.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like any good peppermint soap, this one has peppermint essential oil which gives an instant cooling sensation on the skin and perks you up. The One With Nature brand also has extra-luxurious ingredients which make for a creamier lather than the castile soap  types. Probably the dead sea minerals in this soap are also nourishing in ways we can&#x27;t perceive. But what really matters is that using this soap is a fricken&#x27; fantastic, delicious experience which you must try for yourself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loving it...and I may have to get a bar of my own</li>
            <li> Great scent, stands on it s side it s so large. I d prefer smaller bars, with smaller prices.</li>
            <li> Great lather and smells so nice.</li>
            <li> Soap has a great mint aroma and lathers well.  However, my main purpose in purchasing it was for the abrasive material which is completely missing.</li>
            <li> The soap smells good, but when you use it doesn&#x27;t foam well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price I expected a mush better product then received. They claim mineral from the dead sea, this doesn&#x27;t seem to be true. Other soaps I have with minerals of the dead sea has a pebbly feel to it. This does not.</li>
            <li> Excellent product !! Filled all my expectations. My order came super fast and now everyone in my family is using my soap. I&#x27;ll have to order more soaps for everyone.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. It is absolutely refreshing and just delightful. The peppermint tingles and makes you feel really clean and relaxed. This particular soap lasts a good while, too, as long as you don&#x27;t leave it in a soggy place. Let it dry out a bit and it will harden up again. It is my newest favorite and I am so pleased with this peppermint soap. Lovely.</li>
            <li> I have not used the soap yet, but due to the ingredients, I am sure I will enjoy what it has to offer.</li>
            <li> When I received this soap, it smelled like mint soap...why?  I have no clue.  But it does smell good and it&#x27;s a great exfoliator.</li>
            <li> There is nothing like the feeling of dead cells falling away after dirty house work! Will be buying again sooner or later.</li>
            <li> Refreshing and Invigorating!!! I really LOVE this Soap with all it minerals.  Although it&#x27;s somewhat pricey it&#x27;s worth every penney.  The bar is pretty thick and for me it lasts a long time.  I have also used Lemon Sage and the Rose Petal Flavor.  Have used One With Nature Soap for at least the last two years.  Highly Recommend!!!  I should add that the Lemon Sage Flavor did not agree with me it caused my skin to itch; therefore I am choosing to stick with the  Peppermint.  I had no problem with the Rose Petal.</li>
            <li> Nice scent rinses off quickly.</li>
            <li> Not as Peppermint Scented as i had hoped. Still quite good smelling and some peppermint it noticeable, but enough other smells involved to detract from the peppermint. This alone would warrant a 2 star review from me as i bought it with the only intention being a strong peppermint, which i found lackluster here. However i am adding a star because the smell, though not exactly what i wanted, is quite pleasant, and the bar itself lasted almost DOUBLE what i expected. Lathered and Cleaned well, and lasted twice as long as many other brands.</li>
            <li> My husband loves interesting soap scents.  This was one of several different bars that I bought him for Christmas and I believe he was very pleased.</li>
            <li> Love all the &amp;#34;dead sea minerals&amp;#34; soaps by this company. They lather well, and leave your skin squeaky clean without being dried out.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful soap I use it every day I love the scent . I will buy again thank you.</li>
            <li> A bit too glycerin for me.., needs more organic peppermint!</li>
            <li> for most people I think this would be 5 stars as it is very nice and rich I wish it was a stronger mint smelling soap. It does smell good but I just wanted something REALLY,REALLY minty.Actually I wanted to brush my teeth with it.</li>
            <li> Great smell, nice tingle, nice lather</li>
            <li> love it. Get you some</li>
            <li> Too expensive for what you get. $2.50 would be reasonable.</li>
            <li> This is really great/awesome soap..... Last along time... Great smelling as well... I&#x27;ve very happy with my order.. Thanks a million...</li>
            <li> Love it. I have been searching for a good soap, now have found it.</li>
            <li> This soap smells great and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> One of the best soaps I have ever tried.  It has plenty of moisture, makes washing very easy to clean, and so far no allergens.</li>
            <li> Great soap ... works good..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made a lot of soap using only organic ingredients and had fun in the process of making really good and good smelling soap.  When I ran out of my own soap a couple of years ago, I tried One With Nature brand soaps--several.  My favorite was the plain shea butter.  Then someone mentioned how good peppermint soap was and suggested I try some.  I happened to have one bar of One With Nature peppermint, not a essential oil/scent I ever used in my soaps in the past, left over from making up gift packs for friends and relatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am bowled over by how good this soap is.  First, lather up and you feel the peppermint tingling your skin.  There is no heavy overwhelming scent, just a lovely smell while showering.  And lots of lather.  The lather is fantastic.  Rich, dense and satisfying.  At first I only lathered my skin, but decided to try it on my hair as well and loved the result.  So I have found what for me is the perfect bar soap.  It is great for showering and baths, and it works wonderfully as a shampoo lather.  Makes a great shaving lather as well.  Most commercial soaps I end up deciding they won&#x27;t work for me in the long run, because they dry my skin out, don&#x27;t lather well, have too much scent in them, contain ingredients I prefer to avoid having in on-going contact with my body, etc.  Now I&#x27;ve found an all-purpose bath soap that I can take along on a trip and leave the shampoo at home.  I like the big substantial bar.  It is a slippery soap so the indent for a handhold on one side that One With Nature puts on all its soaps helps me grab it.  One With Nature&#x27;s soap are long lasting as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is now my favorite everyday bath bar.  Unfortunately, it is on Amazon at a higher price than some of the other One With Nature soaps, so I just bought more online from another company at half the Amazon price.  Hopefully, Amazon will lower the price so it costs no more than other One With Nature soaps they sell.</li>
            <li> I purchased this soap while looking at another brand of soap.  I fell in love with this one and stopped using the other peppermint soap.  This is very hard milled soap and it lasts a long time. It does not have a very strong smell, but the smell is great and the lathers well.  It really does feel like a spa soap.  It makes me want to stay in the shower and wear it a bit longer.</li>
            <li> I have been through numerous soap products that have only irritated or overly dried out my skin. I have been looking for a bar of soap that meet my extremely picky skin needs for a long time. The peppermint oil that is infused with the soap is taken up by my skin and never fails to leave me with a refreshed and clean feeling that is unmistakably the properties of a high-end product.</li>
            <li> I use all of their soaps. I buy a combination of them and switch every time I run out of one. Great soap. Great product.</li>
            <li> This soap was excellent for my oily skin. I also enjoyed the smell. I highly reccomend it. What more can I say? The price is wonderful too.</li>
