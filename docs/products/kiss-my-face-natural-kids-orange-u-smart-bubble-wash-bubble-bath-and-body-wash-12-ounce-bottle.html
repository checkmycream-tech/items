            <li>We love the smell of this stuff.</li>
            <li>I wish it was more bubbly though.  </li>
            <li>and I have to add more.  </li>
            <li>My kids and I really love this orange bubble wash.</li>
            <li>We love Kiss My Face products.</li>
            <li>it smells lovely and orangey.  </li>
            <li>Love it -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>My kids love this bubble bath.</li>
            <li>But trust me, I&#x27;d rather do that knowing this is full of safe ingredients!</li>
            <li>Nice aroma and a subjectively gentler clean than the Burt&#x27;s Baby products.</li>
            <li>The orange smell is quite strong</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make as many bubbles as I expected but smells great</li>
            <li>Good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Smells great, no harsh chemicals and creates lots of bubbles to the pure delight of my toddler.</li>
            <li>Not too sweet smelling.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, like a natural, sweet orange.</li>
            <li>and they quickly go away.</li>
            <li>There are much better natural bubble baths available.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on a search for a natural bath product for my kids that smells good &amp; is gentle on their skin.</li>
            <li>It smells great and lasts surprisingly long considering how much I used!</li>
            <li>Lovely aroma, non irritating, makes great foamy bubbles, gets the kids clean and they dont even know it.  </li>
            <li>I actually need to order more now!</li>
            <li>and I love how natural it is.</li>
            <li>but my kids are worth it.</li>
            <li>The lovely orange smell of this bubble bath makes me want to allow the extra bath time for my son (and me) to enjoy it.</li>
            <li>The scent is like fresh squeezed oranges.</li>
            <li>Smells like freshly zested orange peels.</li>
            <li>It makes just the right amount of bubbles.</li>
            <li>My daughter uses this frequently and her skin is fine.</li>
            <li>But, even though it works very well as one, don&#x27;t use it as a bubble bath!  </li>
            <li>Going to go back to Alaffia, better value for the $ and better longer lasting bubbles.</li>
            <li>They love the smell, and it gives just enough lather without leaving a film on their skin.</li>
            <li>While we can find this at the local organic market, Amazon&#x27;s price is much better.</li>
            <li>I use it for myself (a 41 year old male) and really dig the nice orange scent.</li>
            <li>It smells lovely, and leaves her skin soft and does not dry her out.</li>
            <li>You will make the bottle last far longer that way! :)</li>
            <li>It cleans very well.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s gentle and yet cleans well.  </li>
            <li>, doesn&#x27;t lather very well, and isn&#x27;t really much of a bubble maker.</li>
            <li>The smell is very orange and citrusy.</li>
            <li>but it might be much for some (although child doesn&#x27;t smell like citrus after bath).</li>
            <li>They disolve into the water quite fast</li>
            <li>Smells very orange.  </li>
            <li>My son has very severe allergies and eczema.</li>
            <li>Extremely gentle.</li>
            <li>like this so much that I added it to my subscribe and save list.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s on the high end of my demand curve.</li>
            <li>The kids love jt, a little goes a long way, &amp; it gets them clean without drying out their skin.</li>
            <li>I prefer a little more lather, but that&#x27;s just me.  </li>
            <li>All natural kids soap that has the scariest warning label I&#x27;ve ever seen...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supper bubbly and all natural.  </li>
            <li>this does wonders for our son&#x27;s sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Takes several squirts to really get bubbly.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t found middle ground of no bubbles vs too much yet . ..</li>
            <li>I am surprised my kids did not try to eat any yet.</li>
            <li>I like the scent and didn&#x27;t irritate my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This wash has a good safety rating and it&#x27;s difficult to find a bubble bath that doesn&#x27;t have lots of chemicals.</li>
            <li>I wanted a natural bubble bath for my daughter, and even it a big deep bath</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this one star because it smells wonderful, but unfortunately the bubbling factor is poor.</li>

            <li> I feel like it&#x27;s quite thin and watery</li>
            <li> I was suprised the consistency is thin but that does not affect the performance.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it does not make bubbles.  </li>

            <li> LOVE this stuff.  I use it for myself (a 41 year old male) and really dig the nice orange scent.</li>

            <li> I am writing this review for my daughter.  She loves the smell and bubbles.  It cleans very well.  Also, a little goes a long way.</li>

            <li> this is great - it&#x27;s gentle and yet cleans well.  It&#x27;s supper bubbly and all natural.  Best thing is my son smells like a real fresh orange! But, even though it works very well as one, don&#x27;t use it as a bubble bath!  You will make the bottle last far longer that way! :)</li>
            <li> Smells good but doesn&#x27;t make a lot of bubbles unless you use a lot and they quickly go away.</li>
            <li> It smells great. It does not give as many bubbles as people have been saying per quantity. I don&#x27;t think it suffices as a cleaning product to wash hair.</li>
            <li> Love the scent! I do wish that it would produce more bubbles, but it does an ok job.</li>
            <li> this does wonders for our son&#x27;s sensitive skin.  he also loves it because he says it makes him &#x27;smell like an orange popsicle&#x27; :)</li>

            <li> We love the smell of this stuff. Our granddaughter loves it.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and the smell lasts on skin for hours!  It doesnt irritate my son&#x27;s skin and cause eczema like popular bubble baths do.  I wish it was more bubbly though.  They disolve into the water quite fast and I have to add more.  But trust me, I&#x27;d rather do that knowing this is full of safe ingredients!</li>
            <li> A little does not go along way but my kids are worth it. Great suds and it smells delicious. Leaves no residue.</li>

            <li> This is one of the few body washes we can use on my 4 year old daughter. She has eczema and skin sensitivities, and has not had a reaction to this. It smells lovely, and leaves her skin soft and does not dry her out. It smells so amazing that I even use it when I need a pick-me-up! We love Kiss My Face products.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t wait to review this!  I wanted a natural bubble bath for my daughter, and even it a big deep bath it smells lovely and orangey.  She asks for it.  I also used a little bit myself.</li>
            <li> Body wash is easy to use for kids and this one smells great and is free of chemical junk.  Love this for my kiddos!</li>

I&#x27;ve been a fan of the lavender Babo soap, but my 3 &amp; 5 yr olds don&#x27;t care for the scent. This product from Kiss My Face smells like a fresh squeezed orange, not like a bunch of chemicals concocted to smell like fake citrus. The kids love jt, a little goes a long way, &amp; it gets them clean without drying out their skin. I will continue to buy!</li>
            <li> Nice orange scent.  My daughter uses this frequently and her skin is fine.</li>
            <li> The smell was not pleasant, for that reason I&#x27;m going with a different product.</li>
            <li> The lovely orange smell of this bubble bath makes me want to allow the extra bath time for my son (and me) to enjoy it.</li>
            <li> This product makes great bubbles. I was suprised the consistency is thin but that does not affect the performance. The scent is like fresh squeezed oranges. Kids love it and so does mama!</li>
            <li> Love it - I keep rebuying it.  Smells awesome, makes awesome bubbles and from what I know, the ingredients are safe.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my kids.  My son has very severe allergies and eczema. He can use it without a problem.  I have severe skin allergies and eczema.  This is one of the few scented products that I can use.  It smells nice, like a natural, sweet orange. We have purchased several products in this line.  While we can find this at the local organic market, Amazon&#x27;s price is much better.</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling bath scent ever.  I am surprised my kids did not try to eat any yet. Smells like freshly zested orange peels.</li>
            <li> Excellent wash, smells amazing. I use it too! Extremely gentle.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and so do the kids!</li>
            <li> It smells great and lasts surprisingly long considering how much I used! The bubbles are descent enough.&lt;br /&gt;I like this so much that I added it to my subscribe and save list.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay but you have to use a lot to actually make bubbles. Pros:  This wash has a good safety rating and it&#x27;s difficult to find a bubble bath that doesn&#x27;t have lots of chemicals. I like the scent and didn&#x27;t irritate my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin. Cons:  Seems watery and you have to add a ton to the bath to actually make bubbles!  It didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> A smaller container than I&#x27;d pictured.</li>
            <li> My kids love this bubble bath. It has a great orange smell. It makes just the right amount of bubbles. I will continue to reorder.</li>
            <li> Good amount of bubbles.  Not too sweet smelling.</li>
