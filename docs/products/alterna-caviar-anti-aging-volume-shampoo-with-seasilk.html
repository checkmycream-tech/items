            <li>It&#x27;s a good shampoo but too pricy</li>
            <li>and I love them both!</li>
            <li>Alterna is fabulous!!</li>
            <li>shampoo is amazing.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is amazing.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>The improvement was astounding.  </li>
            <li>I love the shampoo and conditioner from Alterna Caviar Volume line.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>that I don&#x27;t think I will be able to continue to use it.  </li>
            <li>I bought this on a whim at the recommendation of a Sephora employee and have been in love with it from day one.</li>
            <li>I love the scent too.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for several years now and find it to be the best for volume.  </li>
            <li>I love their hairspray and mousse.</li>
            <li>The one they sent is a plastic bottle without the silver top.</li>
            <li>I sure hope this helps save someone the time and energy expended in order to get it right!</li>
            <li>This shampoo moisturizes and strengthens my fine strands.</li>
            <li>Bottle is a light shade of purple/lilac.&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li>This was my first sulfate-free shampoo splurge and I am so glad I went for it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Keeps hair healthy and absolutely creates volume without drying out hair.</li>
            <li>The texture and body of my hair improved with the very first use.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair, which is even more fine with dry winter weather.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even need the conditioner (which I actually DO own and only use about once ever two weeks) to add volume.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Now, the vendor needs to make this right on the website.&lt;br /&gt;Link</li>
            <li>Have tried a number of different shampoos and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>but this seriously lathers up AMAZINGLY for a sulfate free</li>
            <li>scrutinized the picture and description before placing my order to be certain it was the correct formula.</li>
            <li>Since I started using it my hair stopped falling out as much as it used to.</li>
            <li>I really, really wanted this shampoo to work.</li>
            <li>I assumed that since it said it did not have so many chemicals in it that the scent would be a light, natural, not terribly noticeable one, but I was wrong.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>and the bottle is not that big but other wise</li>
            <li>This might be a great shampoo if it were unscented or came in unscented or if they just toned the scent down and made it less perfumey smelling..  </li>
            <li>The smell was nice, and a little bit would go a long way.</li>
            <li>I have fine, color-treated hair and this shampoo moisturizes my hair and makes it shiny without making it limp.  </li>
            <li>It has definitely amped up the volume in my hair and has given my strands a little more life and density.</li>
            <li>But I had no way of knowing whether this shampoo was used before or not as the cap was taped with an un-evenly cut piece of clear tape to prevent opening.</li>
            <li>Seriously, this is one of my favorite \\&quot;luxury\\&quot; products.</li>
            <li>I have short, fine, color-treated hair, and I try to keep the color lasting as long as possible.</li>
            <li>First of all, when I received this shampoo it was in a a bottle different than what was in the picture including a strangely designed cap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyone buying this product for the first time, unaware of how it actually looks and performs, is not getting actual representation if receiving theformat I&#x27;ve described and should contact Amazon for remediation.</li>
            <li>No other products are needed.</li>
            <li>However, my color did not last very well while using this shampoo, and it even seemed to dry my hair out.</li>
            <li>The Bodybuilding formula, at least on my fine, tinted hair, does not moisturize nor deliver the overall benefits as AntiAging Volume Shampoo with Seasillk.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It does not dry or weigh down my fine hair and a small amount</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have only used it once and cannot tell if it has had any effect on my hair as it does not seem any different than when I have used other shampoos, but the smell is so strong and offensive to me (and my sinuses have been very uncomfortable)</li>

            <li> but I can see how this bottle might be small for women with a ton of hair to work with</li>
            <li> It has an awful lot of ingredients in it and, although it says it has no Phthalates, it is my understanding that if it says it has fragrance in it and a fragrance this strong, it comes from Phthalates.  </li>
            <li> I can hardly believe it!  </li>
            <li> Not happy with my order.</li>
            <li> Works well on thin hair, not too expensive.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe I got a bad bottle, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>

            <li> The shampoo I received was not the one depicted or described. I have been using Alterna Caviar AntiAging Volume Shampoo with Seasilk for years. The product pictured as well as the description are misrepresentative as the product I received is a different version - I received Alterna Caviar AntiAging Bodybuilding Volume shampoo which gives completely different results.&lt;br /&gt;I scrutinized the picture and description before placing my order to be certain it was the correct formula. The product in the picture is the product I wanted, has a silver cap and lettering CAVIAR runs vertically on the bottle. Bottle is a light shade of purple/lilac.&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward: Product I received has cap the same lilac color as bottle, lettering runs horizontally, and the wording on the front is Caviar Bodybuilding Volume. Bottle color is also darker shade of purple/lilac.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: a different formula than what is described was sent. It does not moisturize nor overall perform at the level of the Caviar AntiAging Volume Shampoo with Seasilk.&lt;br /&gt;This can be tricky as at cursory glance, products look similar, but beware when you see the word BODYBUILDING, know it is not the same as the AntiAging Volume formula. The Bodybuilding formula, at least on my fine, tinted hair, does not moisturize nor deliver the overall benefits as AntiAging Volume Shampoo with Seasillk.&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Amazon and they understood the issue. Now, the vendor needs to make this right on the website.&lt;br /&gt;Link to: Alterna Caviar Antiaging Volume Shampoo with Seasilk&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000VHAA84 Alterna Caviar Seasilk Volume Shampoo, 8.5-Ounce Bottle]]&lt;br /&gt;(correct description, but what is being sent is found in the link below)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Link to: Bodybuilding version&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B007MI4O0A Alterna Caviar Anti Aging Bodybuilding Volume Shampoo, 8.5 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone buying this product for the first time, unaware of how it actually looks and performs, is not getting actual representation if receiving theformat I&#x27;ve described and should contact Amazon for remediation. I sure hope this helps save someone the time and energy expended in order to get it right!</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo and conditioner from Alterna Caviar Volume line.  My hair feels thicker, shinier and I got lots of compliments when I started using it!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. I have fine, color-treated hair and this shampoo moisturizes my hair and makes it shiny without making it limp.  Have tried a number of different shampoos and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> The shampoo came in on time. Since I started using it my hair stopped falling out as much as it used to. It&#x27;s a good shampoo but too pricy and the bottle is not that big but other wise I recommend it to who ever has a hair loss problem.</li>
            <li> I really, really wanted this shampoo to work. I have short, fine, color-treated hair, and I try to keep the color lasting as long as possible. My styling routine is just letting my hair air-dry. I used this shampoo for about a month. The smell was nice, and a little bit would go a long way. However, my color did not last very well while using this shampoo, and it even seemed to dry my hair out. I&#x27;ve never had problems with tangles, but this seemed to encourage them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I got a bad bottle, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. It does not dry or weigh down my fine hair and a small amount goes a long way! I especially appreciate the price I paid in comparison to $35+ in a salon!</li>
            <li> Not sure what the hype is as it did&#x27;t make a difference on my hair. Not bad but not good either.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of the other positive reviews on it, but am very disappointed at the very strong, perfumey scent it has.  I have only used it once and cannot tell if it has had any effect on my hair as it does not seem any different than when I have used other shampoos, but the smell is so strong and offensive to me (and my sinuses have been very uncomfortable) that I don&#x27;t think I will be able to continue to use it.  I assumed that since it said it did not have so many chemicals in it that the scent would be a light, natural, not terribly noticeable one, but I was wrong.  It has an awful lot of ingredients in it and, although it says it has no Phthalates, it is my understanding that if it says it has fragrance in it and a fragrance this strong, it comes from Phthalates.  This might be a great shampoo if it were unscented or came in unscented or if they just toned the scent down and made it less perfumey smelling..  I definitely would not recommend it to anyone with the slightest sensitivity to scented products.</li>
            <li> The best shampoo to add volume and body to your hair.  The scent is great!!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, which is even more fine with dry winter weather.  This product fits the bill for me.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this is one of my favorite \\&quot;luxury\\&quot; products. I bought this on a whim at the recommendation of a Sephora employee and have been in love with it from day one. I found that my hair had become less porous in texture in the last couple of years and the amount of strands lost in the shower was drastically increasing. This shouldn&#x27;t be a surprise to a male as one ages but as someone who has literally no baldness in his family I was a little worried. I wanted to start washing my hair with sulfate-free products only. This was my first sulfate-free shampoo splurge and I am so glad I went for it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is amazing. It has definitely amped up the volume in my hair and has given my strands a little more life and density. I like that this literally volumizes on it&#x27;s own. No other products are needed. I don&#x27;t even need the conditioner (which I actually DO own and only use about once ever two weeks) to add volume. This shampoo moisturizes and strengthens my fine strands. I love the scent too. It smells amazing!! Now, I can&#x27;t complain about the price since I only need to use a tiny dime size amount each wash but I can see how this bottle might be small for women with a ton of hair to work with but this seriously lathers up AMAZINGLY for a sulfate free product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this shampoo!!! I can&#x27;t rave enough about it! I just bought the Caviar Moisture shampoo as well as the Bamboo Volumizing Shampoo and I love them both! This is my go-to though!! Definitely worth a try. I would at least go to your local sephora and request a sample! Alterna is fabulous!!</li>
            <li> Keeps hair healthy and absolutely creates volume without drying out hair. Use with corresponding conditioner for best effect. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The texture and body of my hair improved with the very first use.  The improvement was astounding.  I can hardly believe it!  Also, you need to use very little product and hair/scalp stay cleaner longer.  Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years now and find it to be the best for volume.  I have white hair and this product gives my hair substance.</li>
            <li> This is not the product describedor pictured. Do not buy this product. It is listed in error. They sent the same brand but not the same product.</li>
            <li> Works well on thin hair, not too expensive.  Good stuff, nice smell, not girly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need to buy more.  !!!!!!</li>
            <li> Volume works for a couple of days then hair falls back. Also tangles seem to make hair easier to break while drying. I love their hairspray and mousse.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is amazing. It has definitely amped up the volume in my hair. You need to use a tiny dime size amount each wash.</li>
            <li> First of all, when I received this shampoo it was in a a bottle different than what was in the picture including a strangely designed cap. However, the branding did match. But I had no way of knowing whether this shampoo was used before or not as the cap was taped with an un-evenly cut piece of clear tape to prevent opening. After only one use, my hair felt like wires, flatter and heavier than I&#x27;ve ever had it. Completely opposite of what I was expecting for this price. I would never use this shampoo again and would definitely NOT recommend it!</li>
            <li> The product&#x27;s bottle is not the same as the picture one. The first time I ordered I thought I ordered the wrong product. But this is the second time I am ordering this product and I am not getting the same bottle as the picture. The one they sent is a plastic bottle without the silver top. I am not sure if they are the same. Not happy with my order.</li>
