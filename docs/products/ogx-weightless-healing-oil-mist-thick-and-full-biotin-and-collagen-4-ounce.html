            <li>This stuff is AMAZING</li>
            <li>Let me be honest.  </li>
            <li>often this stuff is amazing best here rejuvenating product I&#x27;ve ever tried and great price I have paid hundreds for more expensive that don&#x27;t work as well as this great stuff</li>
            <li>My hair feels very strong, I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I was pretty happy with it</li>
            <li>I would recommend for fine hair!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very light</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of this brand of spray hair oils!</li>
            <li>looking at it, I realized that the ingredients mostly consisted of words I couldn&#x27;t pronounce.  </li>
            <li>, this gives it a more moisturized look.</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>In the stores it is 2 to 4 dollars more.</li>
            <li>Works better than anything else for her frizzles.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and nice and light.</li>
            <li>I thought it was great, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>then I blowed dried my hair with very good results.</li>
            <li>Works great for untangling wet hair-and I&#x27;ve got lots of it.</li>
            <li>IT MAKES MY HAIR FEEL NICE AND SOFT</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many others and they&#x27;re always very greasy looking.  </li>
            <li>Smelled great and didn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy or weighed down</li>
            <li>More studies will be needed to support it, but current findings were enough to convince Canada to outlaw them in 2009.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, from what I gather these products are made to coat your hair and make them FEEL good</li>
            <li>Price is right also.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if the exact ingredients in the sprays matter, but they all smell good and make my hair feel really soft :)</li>
            <li>I praised this product at first.  </li>
            <li>I decided to use a hot comb on my hair because I was reading that this oil will protect your hair from heat styling.</li>
            <li>Not what I really was looking for</li>
            <li>Not too greasy in the mist form and allows you to not use too much at one time.</li>
            <li>This product works very well and does the job as stated on the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Very lightweight.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine, limp-ish hair and this does not weigh it down.  </li>
            <li>particularly if your hair (like mine) tends toward dryness..</li>
            <li>After applying to the ends of dry hair it will look wet/greasy for about 10-20 minutes, but once the oil is absorbed you are left with smooth and shiny hair.</li>
            <li>This stuff is probably great, unfortunately I won&#x27;t know from this shipment.</li>
            <li>I also have their argan oil, keratin, and vitamin B sprays, and I think they all work pretty much the same.</li>
            <li>Actual oil was nice but spray bottle was broken and I can&#x27;t spray it out of the original bottle .</li>
            <li>As it turns out, cyclotetrasiloxane, the first ingredient, is an ingredient that is generally considered safe but may actually not really be okay.  </li>
            <li>After reading on Pinterest  that this product (especially when paired with the shampoo and conditioner) makes your hair super thick and healthy, a friend</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since my cousin Arial dropped into my life, however, I&#x27;ve become a little more responsible with researching the products I use beyond just simply reading Amazon reviews.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned now to research individual ingredients, not just the whole product on ius own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon</li>
            <li>makes my hair soooo soft</li>
            <li>I added a little more of this oil to my dried hair and then ran a hot comb thru my hair and my hair had a lot of body and movement and it was just so soft.</li>
            <li>I mean, Amazon is very helpful, but there aren&#x27;t always people who know exactly what they are talking about.  </li>
            <li>The bottle leaked oil in everything and it arrived less than half full with the remaining product crystallized in the bottle.</li>

            <li> It was a complete disappointment</li>
            <li> There have been studies that suggest that this chemical and its sister chemicals cyclotetrasiloxane and cyclopentasiloxane can have some serious side effects on us.  </li>
            <li> It use to be so thin and unhealthy looking</li>

            <li> This spray perfectly softens and my hair feels -amazing- after I blow dry it.</li>
            <li> Let me be honest.  I praised this product at first.  After reading on Pinterest  that this product (especially when paired with the shampoo and conditioner) makes your hair super thick and healthy, a friend and I decided we would try it....  Well, of course its been a valuable lesson learned to not trust everything you read on Pinterest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does, in its own way, hold true to making your hair feel awesome!  I was pretty convinced that my hair was thicker and that it was feeling healthier and the mist smells great!  I thought it was great, especially for the price.  I was pretty happy with it and I&#x27;d hardly used half a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my cousin Arial dropped into my life, however, I&#x27;ve become a little more responsible with researching the products I use beyond just simply reading Amazon reviews.

Also, you&#x27;re potentially exposing yourself to harmful chemicals&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say for every OGX product, but this one is one I&#x27;ve definitely thrown out.</li>
            <li> Great product. After I blowdry and style my hair, it&#x27;s a tad dry because of all the thickening products I use, this gives it a more moisturized look. Definitely a must have if you use othe OGX biotin thickening products.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT MAKES MY HAIR FEEL NICE AND SOFT</li>
            <li> Works great for untangling wet hair-and I&#x27;ve got lots of it.</li>
            <li> love this stuff. makes my hair soooo soft</li>
            <li> Product smells amazing and shows good results.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Works great! My hair has gotten thicker and longer in a short period of time. I have used it for about 3 months. People are always making comments about my hair. It use to be so thin and unhealthy looking and now it is great! Price is right also. In the stores it is 2 to 4 dollars more.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this stuff.  Works better than anything else for her frizzles.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of this brand of spray hair oils! I use them all throughout the day to keep the ends of my hair hydrated and shiny. If the ends of your hair get dry, or you are wanting to keep your hair from frizzing, I would recommend this oil. To use: spray this oil on the ends of dry hair and let it soak in. I have tried it on wet hair and did not have the same results -- my hair looked greasy all day. After applying to the ends of dry hair it will look wet/greasy for about 10-20 minutes, but once the oil is absorbed you are left with smooth and shiny hair. Do not brush your hair until the oil has soaked in. If you do you will transfer the oil to your scalp and be left with greasy looking hair. I have a spray bottle of this stuff stashed everywhere -- bathroom, purse, desk at work, beach bag. It&#x27;s that great! I have long, wavy hair of average thickness that has not been color treated.</li>
            <li> This stuff is probably great, unfortunately I won&#x27;t know from this shipment. The bottle leaked oil in everything and it arrived less than half full with the remaining product crystallized in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I love all organix products! this one smells wonderful just like all their others, and it adds a very pretty weightless shine to my hair. I also have their argan oil, keratin, and vitamin B sprays, and I think they all work pretty much the same. I&#x27;m not sure if the exact ingredients in the sprays matter, but they all smell good and make my hair feel really soft :)</li>
            <li> Smelled great and didn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy or weighed down but I still got the frizzies.</li>
            <li> It worked good but i ordered two and both of them has been leaking in the package they need to do something about that cus that&#x27;s rediculous</li>
            <li> Very good styling tool particularly if your hair (like mine) tends toward dryness..</li>
            <li> I bleach and dye my hair often this stuff is amazing best here rejuvenating product I&#x27;ve ever tried and great price I have paid hundreds for more expensive that don&#x27;t work as well as this great stuff</li>
            <li> Not what I really was looking for</li>
            <li> Very pleased. Easy to use and nice and light.</li>
            <li> Love it. A small amt on ends of my hair actually thicken it a bit, makes it shine. Works great on baby fine hair...just a touch on the ends</li>
            <li> I love this! Not too greasy in the mist form and allows you to not use too much at one time. My hair is even stronger now</li>
            <li> I am well please with this product</li>
            <li> I co-washed my hair with a biotin conditioner and after I towel dried my hair some I added this awesome oil all over my head then I blowed dried my hair with very good results. I decided to use a hot comb on my hair because I was reading that this oil will protect your hair from heat styling. I added a little more of this oil to my dried hair and then ran a hot comb thru my hair and my hair had a lot of body and movement and it was just so soft. My hair feels very strong, I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> When I received the box, the oil was spilled inside the box. The bottle was Empty. It was a complete disappointment</li>
            <li> This product works very well and does the job as stated on the bottle.  I have very fine, limp-ish hair and this does not weigh it down.  It provides a beautiful shine and helps to make my hair look healthy.  I will continue to use it and would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Very nice oil mist.  Very lightweight.  I use this for curl definition on very fine hair and it does great without looking too greasy.  I&#x27;ve tried so many others and they&#x27;re always very greasy looking.  Very glad I found this!!  I would recommend for fine hair!</li>
            <li> love it for hair and skin!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair like everything else. I work at Sally beauty supply and nothing works like this product</li>
            <li> Actual oil was nice but spray bottle was broken and I can&#x27;t spray it out of the original bottle .</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING I will never use anything else I relax my hair all the time and everyone says my hair is the healthiest and softest relaxed hair they have ever seen. It&#x27;s growing better as well!</li>
