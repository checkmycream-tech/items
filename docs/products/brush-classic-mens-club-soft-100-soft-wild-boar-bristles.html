            <li>I have thinning, very fine hair.</li>
            <li>my beard for a lack of better words.</li>
            <li>I bought it for the dogs, and they love it.</li>
            <li>It was even better than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>Love this Brush.</li>
            <li>but it turns out to be even better.  </li>
            <li>Nice brush with a comfortable handle.  </li>
            <li>and I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the bamboo handle.</li>
            <li>Many are synthetic (appear to be nylon).</li>
            <li>I really love it and so does my husband.</li>
            <li>The bristle part is okay.  </li>
            <li>I have short hair and this brushes perfectly</li>
            <li>It is still ok.</li>
            <li>I got this mostly as a mustache and bear grooming product.  </li>
            <li>Definitely pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Now brushing my man-mane is more enjoyable.</li>
            <li>I use this every day on my beard and it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li>I like this Brush , it feels much better then</li>
            <li>Glad i Got it.</li>
            <li>one star because there are 4 screws in top of handle--for looks</li>
            <li>This brush is excellent for short and/or thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>I love that and am thankful for that every morning when I use it.</li>
            <li>It really is so soft it feels good to use it on my head anyway!</li>
            <li>I realize a boar brush would smooth my hair better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made very well and feels good on the scalp @</li>
            <li>This brush is easy on my husband&#x27;s scalp as his hair is thinning.</li>
            <li>This product could easily sell for twice the price.</li>
            <li>This brush is nicely made but it is too soft to be effective on my husband&#x27;s hair...</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it has thinned.  </li>
            <li>I have fairly fine hair &amp; this brush does not get to the bottom at all.</li>
            <li>im pretty sure my husband will love it.</li>
            <li>maybe someone with really fine hair would like this brush.</li>
            <li>It is not often these days that there is a fine gentleman&#x27;s grooming product found.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>I used Fullerbrush for over 30 years and its no longer available.  </li>
            <li>He wanted this specific one and when it arrived, it looked like a great brush.  </li>
            <li>The quality of the wood is excellent and the bristles remain firm inside the wood with no shedding.  </li>
            <li>Great workmanship overall.</li>
            <li>This brush does the job and is comfortable to my scalp.</li>
            <li>Bristles go through hair but are smooth on the scalp.</li>
            <li>Feels comfortable in your hand.</li>
            <li>nice brush and much like the Fuller brush I used to buy.</li>
            <li>Bristles medium soft and good for thinning hair.</li>
            <li>Solid construction, high quality bristles, excellent!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really nice and soft!</li>
            <li>It is much softer than most describe it.</li>
            <li>nice soft brush for my son</li>
            <li>This is a good brush feels the same as a Kent</li>
            <li>100 % true to their word on this product.</li>
            <li>my Synthetic fiber brush i was using, Seems to pull the hair better and does not hurt my face as much when i Condition my Beard with Oil or Balm.</li>
            <li>First of all the bristles don&#x27;t fall out like on cheap brushes.  </li>
            <li>(what hair there is) is very fine and soft.  </li>
            <li>I use it as a beard brush twice daily, it feels nice and is holding up well.</li>
            <li>It is considerably better than my old brush.  </li>
            <li>It might be perfect, however, for a man whose hair is thin.</li>
            <li>Received package early and box looks great from outside.</li>
            <li>I love the wood handle and natural boar bristles.  </li>
            <li>Excellent brush, firm but soft.</li>
            <li>Had to go to Amazon to find this, but well worth it.</li>
            <li>The quality of the brush seems very good, the construction appears solid and the reviews about the handle breaking off from the main part of the brush so early make no sense to me.</li>
            <li>Feels right in your hand.</li>
            <li>It is just the right strength and firmness as well.</li>
            <li>The handle is the right size for my hand (I have been told I have bear paws for a hand).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased it&#x27;s soft yet firm and the wood is gorgeous.</li>
            <li>It does have a short handle but he even seems to be happy with that consider he has big hands.</li>
            <li>Medium soft bristles good for hair that is cut low.</li>
            <li>Very high quality USA made solid wood 100% Boar bristle Hairbrush perfect for my 10 year old boy and a travel essential.</li>
            <li>I like this brush very much.</li>
            <li>I like this brush very much.  </li>
            <li>This is my first boars hair brush.</li>
            <li>and I hope this wood handle holds up better than the last one ( plastic ) which broke at the bristle/handle juncture.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it is top quality, and does the job well!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>I would have rated this brush higher but the bristles keep falling out.</li>
            <li>The first use I found a ton.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how soft it is especially on my very tender head.  </li>
            <li>However, other buyers may not be happy with getting a &amp;#34;switch&amp;#34;; generally, neither would I.</li>
            <li>The soft bristles are perfect against my face, yet firm enough to groom my mustache and beard.  </li>
            <li>The treatments have long since ended but I&#x27;ve grown to love this brush.  </li>
            <li>Very high quality brush.</li>
            <li>It was a &amp;#34;Classic Men&#x27;s Club (Soft) 100% Soft Boar Bristles in a Light Wood Handle.</li>
            <li>the bristles are really firm so they do a great job of combing my hair back in one motion and than i come it forward again</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s precise enough to make a part--no comb.  </li>
            <li>He really enjoys using the Brush.  </li>
            <li>The bristles flatten then just drag over the top of my hair.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this brush</li>
            <li>I would really recommend it.</li>
            <li>Size great..shipping fast..</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a good boar bristle brush at a very reasonable price point, not to mention one thats made from such green materials, this should be your choice.</li>
            <li>The brush is excellent at styling my beard especially when used in conjunction with some beard oil, the hair is left soft and yet firmly in place.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately not all of the bristles are wild boar.</li>
            <li>You have to brush pretty lightly in sensitive areas with not a lot of hair.</li>
            <li>The soft bristles gentle on the skin and manage the hair very well.</li>
            <li>Was a gift for my husband and he really likes it said it is so much nicer than the old one he  was using that broke.</li>
            <li>Decent brush...</li>
            <li>I use it mainly for my beard as my hair is buzz cut.</li>
            <li>The handle is short but the head is broad making it easy to hold this brush in your hand.  </li>
            <li>This brush was just what I was looking for the bristles are stiff enough to give my scalp a good massage while taming my unruly hair</li>
            <li>I am not sure how well it would work for a very long tangly beard, but it works great for my 3 inch beard.</li>
            <li>I have very thick and coarse facial hair, but this brush tames it masterfully.</li>
            <li>A few bristles have come out, but otherwise&lt;br /&gt;Brushes are ok, but would have preferred to get what was ordered.</li>
            <li>His scalp probably needs the stimulation so this is not a complaint.  </li>
            <li>If you have a few strands of hair, this would probably be able to help</li>
            <li>but I can live with it.</li>
            <li>Nice brushes, thought I brought the hard ones and not the soft.</li>
            <li>It is soft, and all boar brushes seem to get softer after they break in, all ans all a decent brush for the price.</li>
            <li>The bristles are strong enough yet soft enough.</li>
            <li>I got this brush when I cut my hair very short (1/8&amp;#34;) during radiation and chemo treatments for a tumor in my neck.  </li>
            <li>Soft my foot!  </li>
            <li>I am pretty low maintance and was previously using a cheap plastic brush that was falling apart.  </li>
            <li>Clearly a quality brush.</li>
            <li>My scalp was quite sensitive and my hair</li>
            <li>I was using an goody brush from the early eighties no lie.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have that much hair left!</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft, just the way I like them.  </li>
            <li>Modest price</li>
            <li>Soft bristles.</li>
            <li>Way too soft for this sr. guy.</li>
            <li>I have had it for a month or so waiting for the smell to dissipate, but so far it hasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>The selling point for me, was that it was a natural bristle in a natural wood handle.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t expect REALLY soft.</li>
            <li>brush is definitely soft</li>
            <li>really soft.</li>
            <li>Wow what a difference.  </li>
            <li>The brush is soft on my scalp and almost feels relaxing when I brush my hair.  </li>
            <li>but, if you have hair, it is too soft to move or control it.</li>
            <li>Solid quality (wood, firm handle &amp; size), nicer &amp; more smoother bristles.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not thick as in my salad days and second</li>
            <li>Great for &amp;#34;enviros&amp;#34;, bad for aesthetics.  </li>
            <li>At least the pungent smell confirms it&#x27;s real boar hair, but it makes my beard smell like hot garbage after i use it.</li>
            <li>He has short hair and this soft brush seems to manage it well.</li>
            <li>I guess only babies get truly soft hairbrushes and my husband says he will use it anyway.  </li>
            <li>nice brush but the wrong color.</li>
            <li>Started off a nice brush, yesterday on 03/03/2014, the handle fell apart leaving me with two parts in my hand and unable to use.  </li>
            <li>Right size &amp; shape, wish bristles were a little softer.</li>
            <li>, The bristles are not too soft and coarse enough to do the job.</li>
            <li>When the description said the brush was soft, I really expected soft.  </li>
            <li>I have thin dreads and use it mostly around my scalp line and occasionally on the dreads themselves.</li>

            <li> This brush is perfect for gently but effectively massaging my scalp.  </li>
            <li> He liked the size of it.</li>
            <li> But all around,,, nice brush.</li>
            <li> Nice bristles which don&#x27;t hurt the scalp.</li>

            <li> Super happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful 100% boar hair bristles are very soft.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and the brush works flawlessly.</li>
            <li> I have thinning, very fine hair.</li>
            <li> my beard for a lack of better words.</li>
            <li> I bought it for the dogs, and they love it.</li>
            <li> It was even better than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Love this Brush.</li>
            <li> but it turns out to be even better.  </li>
            <li> Nice brush with a comfortable handle.  </li>
            <li> and I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the bamboo handle.</li>
            <li> Many are synthetic (appear to be nylon).</li>
            <li> I really love it and so does my husband.</li>
            <li> The bristle part is okay.  </li>
            <li> I have short hair and this brushes perfectly</li>
            <li> It is still ok.</li>
            <li> I got this mostly as a mustache and bear grooming product.  </li>
            <li> Definitely pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Now brushing my man-mane is more enjoyable.</li>
            <li> I use this every day on my beard and it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li> I like this Brush , it feels much better then</li>
            <li> Glad i Got it.</li>
            <li> one star because there are 4 screws in top of handle--for looks</li>
            <li> This brush is excellent for short and/or thinning hair.  </li>
            <li> I love that and am thankful for that every morning when I use it.</li>
            <li> It really is so soft it feels good to use it on my head anyway!</li>
            <li> I realize a boar brush would smooth my hair better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made very well and feels good on the scalp @</li>
            <li> This brush is easy on my husband&#x27;s scalp as his hair is thinning.</li>
            <li> This product could easily sell for twice the price.</li>
            <li> This brush is nicely made but it is too soft to be effective on my husband&#x27;s hair...</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and it has thinned.  </li>
            <li> I have fairly fine hair &amp; this brush does not get to the bottom at all.</li>
            <li> im pretty sure my husband will love it.</li>
            <li> maybe someone with really fine hair would like this brush.</li>
            <li> It is not often these days that there is a fine gentleman&#x27;s grooming product found.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> I used Fullerbrush for over 30 years and its no longer available.  </li>
            <li> He wanted this specific one and when it arrived, it looked like a great brush.  </li>
            <li> The quality of the wood is excellent and the bristles remain firm inside the wood with no shedding.  </li>
            <li> Great workmanship overall.</li>
            <li> This brush does the job and is comfortable to my scalp.</li>
            <li> Bristles go through hair but are smooth on the scalp.</li>
            <li> Feels comfortable in your hand.</li>
            <li> nice brush and much like the Fuller brush I used to buy.</li>
            <li> Bristles medium soft and good for thinning hair.</li>
            <li> Solid construction, high quality bristles, excellent!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice and soft!</li>
            <li> It is much softer than most describe it.</li>
            <li> nice soft brush for my son</li>
            <li> This is a good brush feels the same as a Kent</li>
            <li> 100 % true to their word on this product.</li>
            <li> my Synthetic fiber brush i was using, Seems to pull the hair better and does not hurt my face as much when i Condition my Beard with Oil or Balm.</li>
            <li> First of all the bristles don&#x27;t fall out like on cheap brushes.  </li>
            <li> (what hair there is) is very fine and soft.  </li>
            <li> I use it as a beard brush twice daily, it feels nice and is holding up well.</li>
            <li> It is considerably better than my old brush.  </li>
            <li> It might be perfect, however, for a man whose hair is thin.</li>
            <li> Received package early and box looks great from outside.</li>
            <li> I love the wood handle and natural boar bristles.  </li>
            <li> Excellent brush, firm but soft.</li>
            <li> Had to go to Amazon to find this, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> The quality of the brush seems very good, the construction appears solid and the reviews about the handle breaking off from the main part of the brush so early make no sense to me.</li>
            <li> Feels right in your hand.</li>
            <li> It is just the right strength and firmness as well.</li>
            <li> The handle is the right size for my hand (I have been told I have bear paws for a hand).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased it&#x27;s soft yet firm and the wood is gorgeous.</li>
            <li> It does have a short handle but he even seems to be happy with that consider he has big hands.</li>
            <li> Medium soft bristles good for hair that is cut low.</li>
            <li> Very high quality USA made solid wood 100% Boar bristle Hairbrush perfect for my 10 year old boy and a travel essential.</li>
            <li> I like this brush very much.</li>
            <li> I like this brush very much.  </li>
            <li> This is my first boars hair brush.</li>
            <li> and I hope this wood handle holds up better than the last one ( plastic ) which broke at the bristle/handle juncture.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it is top quality, and does the job well!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> I would have rated this brush higher but the bristles keep falling out.</li>
            <li> The first use I found a ton.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how soft it is especially on my very tender head.  </li>
            <li> However, other buyers may not be happy with getting a &amp;#34;switch&amp;#34;; generally, neither would I.</li>
            <li> The soft bristles are perfect against my face, yet firm enough to groom my mustache and beard.  </li>
            <li> The treatments have long since ended but I&#x27;ve grown to love this brush.  </li>
            <li> Very high quality brush.</li>
            <li> It was a &amp;#34;Classic Men&#x27;s Club (Soft) 100% Soft Boar Bristles in a Light Wood Handle.</li>
            <li> the bristles are really firm so they do a great job of combing my hair back in one motion and than i come it forward again</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s precise enough to make a part--no comb.  </li>
            <li> He really enjoys using the Brush.  </li>
            <li> The bristles flatten then just drag over the top of my hair.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this brush</li>
            <li> I would really recommend it.</li>
            <li> Size great..shipping fast..</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a good boar bristle brush at a very reasonable price point, not to mention one thats made from such green materials, this should be your choice.</li>
            <li> The brush is excellent at styling my beard especially when used in conjunction with some beard oil, the hair is left soft and yet firmly in place.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately not all of the bristles are wild boar.</li>
            <li> You have to brush pretty lightly in sensitive areas with not a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> The soft bristles gentle on the skin and manage the hair very well.</li>
            <li> Was a gift for my husband and he really likes it said it is so much nicer than the old one he  was using that broke.</li>
            <li> Decent brush...</li>
            <li> I use it mainly for my beard as my hair is buzz cut.</li>
            <li> The handle is short but the head is broad making it easy to hold this brush in your hand.  </li>
            <li> This brush was just what I was looking for the bristles are stiff enough to give my scalp a good massage while taming my unruly hair</li>
            <li> I am not sure how well it would work for a very long tangly beard, but it works great for my 3 inch beard.</li>
            <li> I have very thick and coarse facial hair, but this brush tames it masterfully.</li>
            <li> A few bristles have come out, but otherwise&lt;br /&gt;Brushes are ok, but would have preferred to get what was ordered.</li>
            <li> His scalp probably needs the stimulation so this is not a complaint.  </li>
            <li> If you have a few strands of hair, this would probably be able to help</li>
            <li> but I can live with it.</li>
            <li> Nice brushes, thought I brought the hard ones and not the soft.</li>
            <li> It is soft, and all boar brushes seem to get softer after they break in, all ans all a decent brush for the price.</li>
            <li> The bristles are strong enough yet soft enough.</li>
            <li> I got this brush when I cut my hair very short (1/8&amp;#34;) during radiation and chemo treatments for a tumor in my neck.  </li>
            <li> Soft my foot!  </li>
            <li> I am pretty low maintance and was previously using a cheap plastic brush that was falling apart.  </li>
            <li> Clearly a quality brush.</li>
            <li> My scalp was quite sensitive and my hair</li>
            <li> I was using an goody brush from the early eighties no lie.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have that much hair left!</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft, just the way I like them.  </li>
            <li> Modest price</li>
            <li> Soft bristles.</li>
            <li> Way too soft for this sr. guy.</li>
            <li> I have had it for a month or so waiting for the smell to dissipate, but so far it hasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> The selling point for me, was that it was a natural bristle in a natural wood handle.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t expect REALLY soft.</li>
            <li> brush is definitely soft</li>
            <li> really soft.</li>
            <li> Wow what a difference.  </li>
            <li> The brush is soft on my scalp and almost feels relaxing when I brush my hair.  </li>
            <li> but, if you have hair, it is too soft to move or control it.</li>
            <li> Solid quality (wood, firm handle &amp; size), nicer &amp; more smoother bristles.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not thick as in my salad days and second</li>
            <li> Great for &amp;#34;enviros&amp;#34;, bad for aesthetics.  </li>
            <li> At least the pungent smell confirms it&#x27;s real boar hair, but it makes my beard smell like hot garbage after i use it.</li>
            <li> He has short hair and this soft brush seems to manage it well.</li>
            <li> I guess only babies get truly soft hairbrushes and my husband says he will use it anyway.  </li>
            <li> nice brush but the wrong color.</li>
            <li> Started off a nice brush, yesterday on 03/03/2014, the handle fell apart leaving me with two parts in my hand and unable to use.  </li>
            <li> Right size &amp; shape, wish bristles were a little softer.</li>
            <li> , The bristles are not too soft and coarse enough to do the job.</li>
            <li> When the description said the brush was soft, I really expected soft.  </li>
            <li> I have thin dreads and use it mostly around my scalp line and occasionally on the dreads themselves.</li>
            <li> The brush feels solid and seems like it will last for a very long time.</li>
            <li> The handle is a bit thick and chunky (I have large hands) and the decorative brass screws on the back attract dirt, so I removed them.</li>
            <li> bristles are soft yet firm enough to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles are firm enough to stimulate scalp.  </li>
            <li> Not too harsh and not too soft.  </li>
            <li> a n is frankly what I preferred  for my grey hair.</li>
            <li> Brushes were ordered as one soft and one firm.</li>
            <li> Now I question myself as to why it took so long to purchase this one.</li>
            <li> Mine has white boar bristles in a brown heavy plastic housing &amp; handle.</li>
            <li> everything I expected</li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> Lost a few bristles initially, but after that not much else.  </li>
            <li> Based on other comments, I thought it would work for me.</li>
            <li> In addition, I have only seen maybe 1 hair fall out from it in the past month.</li>
            <li> Lest you think I have weird hair, first I&#x27;m a senior</li>
            <li> No more combs for me as long as I have this boar bristle brush.</li>
            <li> Not a fun thing to find.</li>
            <li> The Bass boar brush that I received is not the one pictured.</li>
            <li> There is not much hair to work with but this brush does not harm my dome like my previous  stiff bristled where I would come away in pain after using it.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a much less hefty bamboo.  </li>
            <li> Finding less and less, but they&#x27;re sharp and stiff.</li>
            <li> It can serve as a massager too, loosening any dead skin on the scalp.  </li>
            <li> Delivery promise was dead on.</li>
            <li> Will update after he uses it a few times.</li>
            <li> so if you want a firm bristle I would get the firm version.</li>
            <li> Especially if you have thin hair like me.</li>
            <li> a brush out of the past</li>
            <li> Both were very firm.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, for someone with hair, this is useless and I fail to understand the accolades above.</li>
            <li> Almost TOO thick for my bad ass beard.</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> Useless.</li>
            <li> This brush smells like crap.  </li>

            <li> Very good.  Just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> I got this brush when I cut my hair very short (1/8&amp;#34;) during radiation and chemo treatments for a tumor in my neck.  My scalp was quite sensitive and my hair (what hair there is) is very fine and soft.  This brush is perfect for gently but effectively massaging my scalp.  The treatments have long since ended but I&#x27;ve grown to love this brush.  No more combs for me as long as I have this boar bristle brush.</li>
            <li> Great beard brush! I love it!</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. I was using an goody brush from the early eighties no lie. I&#x27;ve been asking my stylist suggestions as well as watching YouTube. I realize a boar brush would smooth my hair better. I&#x27;m pleased it&#x27;s soft yet firm and the wood is gorgeous.</li>
            <li> This is my first boars hair brush. I enjoy using it. After I put oil or balm in my beard I use this brush to &amp;#34;shape&amp;#34; my beard for a lack of better words. Great brush.</li>
            <li> A nice brush which is the perfect size for my beard, The bristles are not too soft and coarse enough to do the job.</li>
            <li> Its a great quality brush and I plan on buying another one soon. It&#x27;s perfect for my beard.</li>
            <li> A mix of boar it feels like. I bought it for the dogs, and they love it. It is soft, and all boar brushes seem to get softer after they break in, all ans all a decent brush for the price.</li>
            <li> Very high quality brush. I use it for my beard. The soft bristles gentle on the skin and manage the hair very well.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and it has thinned.  This is the perfect brush for me.  Not too harsh and not too soft.  It can serve as a massager too, loosening any dead skin on the scalp.  And it&#x27;s precise enough to make a part--no comb.  Well-made too.  Would make a great gift.</li>
            <li> It was even better than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my son.  He really enjoys using the Brush.  He liked the size of it.</li>
            <li> Clearly a quality brush. Bristles medium soft and good for thinning hair. Excellent finish on the wood body of the brush. Feels right in your hand. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this Brush. I use it as a beard brush twice daily, it feels nice and is holding up well.</li>
            <li> My husband used this brush for his winter beard and it worked great!  It was a good price for the quality of brush too!</li>
            <li> Bought these for someone else. He said they are good..</li>
            <li> Brush is well made. bristles are soft yet firm enough to get the job done. Doesn&#x27;t feel like you are using a rake to brush your hair.</li>
            <li> The Bass boar brush that I received is not the one pictured. Mine has white boar bristles in a brown heavy plastic housing &amp; handle. It is very attractive a n is frankly what I preferred  for my grey hair. However, other buyers may not be happy with getting a &amp;#34;switch&amp;#34;; generally, neither would I.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for the price. Would order again. Delivery promise was dead on.</li>
            <li> Works great for my beard</li>
            <li> nice brush but the wrong color.The sent the striped wood but I can live with it.</li>
            <li> Solid quality (wood, firm handle &amp; size), nicer &amp; more smoother bristles.  I used Fullerbrush for over 30 years and its no longer available.  I bought this is an alternative but it turns out to be even better.  Thank you Amazon for bringing it to my attention!</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Right size &amp; shape, wish bristles were a little softer. I don&#x27;t have that much hair left! This replaces a similar brush from Fuller.</li>
            <li> Nice brush with a comfortable handle.  The bristles are soft, just the way I like them.  Modest price and I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I like this brush very much. It works great for fine hair.  Quality is good and bristles are attached well, no problems with this brush</li>
            <li> Great hair brush.  Soft bristles.</li>
            <li> Way too soft for this sr. guy. I have fairly fine hair &amp; this brush does not get to the bottom at all. The bristles flatten then just drag over the top of my hair. Wish I wouldn&#x27;t have bought this one. Based on other comments, I thought it would work for me. It is much softer than most describe it.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and my husband seems happy with it.  He has short hair and this soft brush seems to manage it well.</li>
            <li> nice soft brush for my son</li>
            <li> I like this brush. I absolutely love the bamboo handle. Unfortunately not all of the bristles are wild boar. Many are synthetic (appear to be nylon).</li>
            <li> The bristles are strong enough yet soft enough. They feel great on my scalp and do the job perfectly. The brush feels solid and seems like it will last for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Came on time, love it!!</li>
            <li> This brush was just what I was looking for the bristles are stiff enough to give my scalp a good massage while taming my unruly hair and I hope this wood handle holds up better than the last one ( plastic ) which broke at the bristle/handle juncture. This brush is just great and I would recommend it to anyone ( man or woman ) looking for a semi-stiff brush to give their scalp a good message while controlling their hair. I would give this brush (5) stars.</li>
            <li> Bristles fall out quite often, just like the hair on my head!</li>
            <li> I really love it and so does my husband. However, (and I do not have another boar bristle brush to compare it to) the bristles are not that &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;. You have to brush pretty lightly in sensitive areas with not a lot of hair. Other than that, it is top quality, and does the job well!</li>
            <li> The bristle part is okay.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the screws on the back that I guess hold it together.  The screws don&#x27;t look attractive at all.  So it is kept bristle side up.</li>
            <li> Excellent hair brush for thinning hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does the job with no pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is a PAIN because it requires a minimum level of words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t volunteer to review.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed. I been for a hair brush and I found it. I have short hair and this brushes perfectly</li>
            <li> Brushes were ordered as one soft and one firm. Both were very firm. A few bristles have come out, but otherwise&lt;br /&gt;Brushes are ok, but would have preferred to get what was ordered.</li>
            <li> Nice brushes, thought I brought the hard ones and not the soft. But all around,,, nice brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is easy on my husband&#x27;s scalp as his hair is thinning.</li>
            <li> Too soft, not what I expected from the description.</li>
            <li> my husband was delighted with this brush</li>
            <li> Some bristles are falling out every time I use it.  It is considerably better than my old brush.  It is still ok.</li>
            <li> This is a good brush feels the same as a Kent I have on the dresser</li>
            <li> Too soft...bristles don&#x27;t go through the hair.  It might be perfect, however, for a man whose hair is thin.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush. Surpassed my expectations.</li>
            <li> I would have rated this brush higher but the bristles keep falling out.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my dad as part of his Christmas gift.  He wanted this specific one and when it arrived, it looked like a great brush.  I can&#x27;t say whether it is or not...yet.  Will update after he uses it a few times.</li>
            <li> I got this mostly as a mustache and bear grooming product.  The soft bristles are perfect against my face, yet firm enough to groom my mustache and beard.  The quality of the wood is excellent and the bristles remain firm inside the wood with no shedding.  This product could easily sell for twice the price.</li>
            <li> Great Brush! I use this every day on my beard after a shower and beard oil. This is perfect for me because I do not have a huge mangly beard. I am not sure how well it would work for a very long tangly beard, but it works great for my 3 inch beard. It is just the right strength and firmness as well.In addition, I have only seen maybe 1 hair fall out from it in the past month.</li>
            <li> 100 % true to their word on this product.</li>
            <li> Received package early and box looks great from outside.This brush is awesome im pretty sure my husband will love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what Dad neded.</li>
            <li> Was a gift for my husband and he really likes it said it is so much nicer than the old one he  was using that broke. It does have a short handle but he even seems to be happy with that consider he has big hands. Definitely pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Real nice brush was perfect!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son and he loves it.  It&#x27;s made very well and feels good on the scalp @ the price is very good.</li>
            <li> Brush is very nice, Time will tell if it holds up, but for the moment it is great! The bristles are nice and the handle has a really good feel to it. Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This brush smells like crap.  I have had it for a month or so waiting for the smell to dissipate, but so far it hasn&#x27;t.  I read that people suggest to use Oxyclean to get the smell out, i guess i will have to give that a try.  At least the pungent smell confirms it&#x27;s real boar hair, but it makes my beard smell like hot garbage after i use it.</li>
            <li> This is my second attempt at writing this review. I&#x27;m not Teresa. I&#x27;m her husband. What I ordered was what was pictured and advertised. It was a &amp;#34;Classic Men&#x27;s Club (Soft) 100% Soft Boar Bristles in a Light Wood Handle. The selling point for me, was that it was a natural bristle in a natural wood handle. What I got was just a plastic brush with boar bristles. If I wanted that, I could of picked one up in a drug store. I don&#x27;t like the brush, because it&#x27;s plastic not the advertised wood.</li>
            <li> Started off a nice brush, yesterday on 03/03/2014, the handle fell apart leaving me with two parts in my hand and unable to use.  It just broke off was not dropped or misused in any way.  Request a replacement.</li>
            <li> Great brush for my beard. Picks up the oils.</li>
            <li> a brush out of the past</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and the brush works flawlessly. And, it has the finish and heft of quality - so, it is a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> everything I expected</li>
            <li> When the description said the brush was soft, I really expected soft.  I guess only babies get truly soft hairbrushes and my husband says he will use it anyway.  His scalp probably needs the stimulation so this is not a complaint.  Just don&#x27;t expect REALLY soft.</li>
            <li> Decent brush... Nice bristles which don&#x27;t hurt the scalp. The handle is a bit thick and chunky (I have large hands) and the decorative brass screws on the back attract dirt, so I removed them. For the price; a Good Value...</li>
            <li> Listen to none of the negitive reviews the are incorrect great brush for the money</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice and soft!</li>
            <li> Very high quality USA made solid wood 100% Boar bristle Hairbrush perfect for my 10 year old boy and a travel essential.</li>
            <li> Much smaller than anticipated.</li>
            <li> Great brush. Bought this for my beard, which is glorious by the way. Now brushing my man-mane is more enjoyable.</li>
            <li> I came upon this brush with the expectation that it would be easier on my head than a comb. I really wanted to like this brush but it smelled kinda funky to me. Plus it didn&#x27;t brush as good as I would have liked. Sorry but I just wasn&#x27;t very impressed.</li>
            <li> excellent brush I would really recommend it.</li>
            <li> A gift for my husband, which he loves.</li>
            <li> I have thin dreads and use it mostly around my scalp line and occasionally on the dreads themselves. Soft bristles are firm enough to stimulate scalp.  I love the wood handle and natural boar bristles.  Lost a few bristles initially, but after that not much else.  Great workmanship overall.</li>
            <li> Excellent brush for fine hair!</li>
            <li> I use this every day on my beard and it&#x27;s fantastic! I have very thick and coarse facial hair, but this brush tames it masterfully. Super happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Nice sturdy looking and feeling brush. However, every time I brush with it I end up finding lots of bristles in my hair later. The first use I found a ton. Finding less and less, but they&#x27;re sharp and stiff. Not a fun thing to find.</li>
            <li> Soft my foot!  Returned it.</li>
            <li> This brush is nicely made but it is too soft to be effective on my husband&#x27;s hair...maybe someone with really fine hair would like this brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush a couple of weeks now and I look forward to using it each day.  I can&#x27;t believe how soft it is especially on my very tender head.  There is not much hair to work with but this brush does not harm my dome like my previous  stiff bristled where I would come away in pain after using it.  Now I question myself as to why it took so long to purchase this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the quality and function of this brush.  If you need an excellent, well made hairbrush this is your brush.</li>
            <li> Excellent brush, firm but soft. The brush is excellent at styling my beard especially when used in conjunction with some beard oil, the hair is left soft and yet firmly in place. The quality of the brush seems very good, the construction appears solid and the reviews about the handle breaking off from the main part of the brush so early make no sense to me. If you&#x27;re looking for a good boar bristle brush at a very reasonable price point, not to mention one thats made from such green materials, this should be your choice.</li>
            <li> The handle is short but the head is broad making it easy to hold this brush in your hand.  Wonderful 100% boar hair bristles are very soft. Good for your hair and won&#x27;t scratch your scalp like plastic.&lt;br /&gt;Base is two-tone bamboo with hi-gloss shellack.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
            <li> This is a great brush. I use it mainly for my beard as my hair is buzz cut. Also I have not had any problem shedding bristles.It really is so soft it feels good to use it on my head anyway!</li>
            <li> I like this Brush , it feels much better then my Synthetic fiber brush i was using, Seems to pull the hair better and does not hurt my face as much when i Condition my Beard with Oil or Balm. Glad i Got it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright. Almost TOO thick for my bad ass beard. I think next time I&#x27;ll go for a brush that isn&#x27;t so dense.</li>
            <li> been using it over a month now and no noticeable bristle loss. the handle is very nice looking and seems well constructed.&lt;br /&gt;lost one star because there are 4 screws in top of handle--for looks I guess but they are not set in properly and protrude a bit.&lt;br /&gt;this brush is definitely soft so if you want a firm bristle I would get the firm version.</li>
            <li> It is not often these days that there is a fine gentleman&#x27;s grooming product found. Had to go to Amazon to find this, but well worth it. Solid construction, high quality bristles, excellent!</li>
            <li> This brush is excellent for short and/or thinning hair.  Best I&#x27;ve ever used.  However, the description is inaccurate; it&#x27;s no longer oak/maple it&#x27;s a much less hefty bamboo.  Great for &amp;#34;enviros&amp;#34;, bad for aesthetics.  Still a 5 star performer.</li>
            <li> Everything it&#x27;s supposed to be. Very nice brush.</li>
            <li> Good quality! really soft.</li>
            <li> I have thinning, very fine hair. This brush does the job and is comfortable to my scalp. Great value.</li>
            <li> I like this brush very much.  Bristles go through hair but are smooth on the scalp.</li>
            <li> This is a nice quality brush. Feels comfortable in your hand. Works well. Especially if you have thin hair like me.</li>
            <li> Size great..shipping fast..but bristles fall out each time it&#x27;s used</li>
            <li> The wood is multicolor stripes, which took some getting used to.  And I wish they had used a matte finish varnish instead of the shiny.  But the quality is excellent and it works stupendously well - I love that and am thankful for that every morning when I use it.</li>
            <li> nice brush and much like the Fuller brush I used to buy.</li>
            <li> As expected. Nice quality.Medium soft bristles good for hair that is cut low.</li>
            <li> I am pretty low maintance and was previously using a cheap plastic brush that was falling apart.  My wife said I should upgrade to a brush with bristles.  Wow what a difference.  First of all the bristles don&#x27;t fall out like on cheap brushes.  Second the bristles are really firm so they do a great job of combing my hair back in one motion and than i come it forward again (I have a modified ceasers cut).  The brush is soft on my scalp and almost feels relaxing when I brush my hair.  The handle is the right size for my hand (I have been told I have bear paws for a hand).  This is a sturdy brush that works great.</li>
            <li> Useless. If you have a few strands of hair, this would probably be able to help but, if you have hair, it is too soft to move or control it. Lest you think I have weird hair, first I&#x27;m a senior so it&#x27;s not thick as in my salad days and second, I keep it fairly short as a former Marine is likely to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, for someone with hair, this is useless and I fail to understand the accolades above.</li>
