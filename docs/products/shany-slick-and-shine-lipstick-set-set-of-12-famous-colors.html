            <li>Expedient shipping and excellent sellers!</li>

            <li>But if you like your lipsticks looking perfect in the tube (and not like you&#x27;ve dropped them or a kid has used them), then you may want to avoid this set.</li>

            <li>Wouldve loved to get these colors!</li>
            <li>colors are absolutely beautiful, just don&#x27;t rely on the colored stickers on the bottom...</li>
            <li>This is so beautiful</li>
            <li>Although the color is beautiful I would never buy them again.</li>
            <li>They look beautiful on, which is what one would want.  </li>
            <li>A wonderful product and my wife loved him ..</li>

            <li>the packaging s beautiful.</li>
            <li>Either way, I recommend because they&#x27;re beautiful colors, and it&#x27;s a lot of variety.</li>
            <li>The colors were extremely beautiful but after applying it, the lipstick would just kinda clump up on the outline of my lips.</li>
            <li>Pros - these are some beautiful colors.</li>
            <li>Great gifts for my friends and really good on price!</li>
            <li>I was hella nervous  Lol.</li>
            <li>the lipstick has a nice texture and for the Price could have been perfect.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too happy with the quality of these lipsticks.</li>
            <li>Great job.</li>
            <li>but they were nt happy with the quality,,</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m not to happy with this product.</li>
            <li>This set has a great color selection varying from a couple of nudes, to an orange, to a bunch of pinks, couple of mauves,  and 2 maroon/purplish tones.</li>
            <li>They came in great time.</li>
            <li>These lipsticks come in great colors and the color goes on evenly.</li>
            <li>The colors are great.</li>
            <li>But over all a great choice for a gift.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great price for 12 lipsticks versus paying $5-10 for just ONE lipstick.</li>
            <li>But after leaving them in room temperature for a while they have been working great.</li>
            <li>Lol even the purple goes well with me.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s loveable lol</li>
            <li>The colours are great though.</li>
            <li>great for the money.</li>
            <li>Came in great condition.</li>
            <li>the colors were great but upon opening all of the lipsticks were smashed into the lids.</li>
            <li>I got my lipsticks and the two I wanted for my mom were great</li>
            <li>Colors are great and I like them all.</li>
            <li>This is a great buy and would buy again.</li>

            <li>But i brought them in good shape.</li>
            <li>The quality isn&#x27;t that good, and almost all of them were stuck when I opened</li>
            <li>It contains good quality lipsticks</li>
            <li>uve used good lipsticks</li>
            <li>these were a good price, but sometimes you get what you pay for as when these lipsticks showed up they had all detached from their posts, causing all the lipsticks to be damaged.</li>
            <li>and I did get some good colors out of it, but there are pinks in here that I don&#x27;t use and also some darker/bland colors.</li>
            <li>Lipstick has no scent or taste (good thing).</li>
            <li>not the variety of colors I had wanted, but a good bang for the buck</li>
            <li>had no problems with the packaging, the lipsticks all came in good shape, none were damaged or falling out.</li>
            <li>The colors were just not soo good.</li>
            <li>The products is good but the envelop to send  no</li>
            <li>Really nice lipstick in very nice colors.</li>
            <li>The lipsticks got here in perfect state, the colors are beautiful and very pigmented.  </li>
            <li>It Came In So Fast , And The Colors Are So Beautiful , Plus They Are Wonderful When Put Upon Lips</li>
            <li>Amazing product and amazing sellers!</li>
            <li>I had never heard of this brand, but took a chance when the reviews were so good, and I am very glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Some of the sticks broke easily, some sticks were chalky, but some were very good.</li>
            <li>The colors were o.k.; nothing exceptional</li>
            <li>Exceptional quality and affordable too.</li>

            <li>i kind of knew what i was getting myself into because of the reviews..</li>
            <li>They Was so excited!!</li>
            <li>Received this as a Christmas gift and they came in perfect condition, my husband did a great blind buy, and they colors are absolutely beautiful!</li>
            <li>The product came very quickly and was in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>The colors are a large variety and very bright.</li>
            <li>I JUST RECEIVED THEM ON THE MAIL RIGHT NOW!!!</li>
            <li>bought them directly from them and came in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>Though the shades was nice, I should have known better, 12 lipsticks for $19.90 that&#x27;s too cheap to get good quality lipstick.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smoothly and my lips feel so good, almost like lip balm with color.  </li>
            <li>I tried on each lipstick and they aren&#x27;t as pigmented as I&#x27;d hoped, they seem cheaply made and I have to continuously rub the lipstick on my lips for it to show up good.</li>
            <li>I love Shany Cosmetics because of their level of quality and affordability, but I was not too thrilled about this product.</li>
            <li>Also, the lipstick goes on smoothly and for the price, this is a good set.</li>
            <li>I love, love, LOVE these lipsticks!  </li>
            <li>These are great - you get a huge variety and they are all super creamy and pigmented!</li>
            <li>Very good lip product - I didn&#x27;t know what to expect when getting these because it&#x27;s such a good price for that amount of lipstick.</li>
            <li>Great quality for such a great price.</li>
            <li>The box is a great packaging which is a great present for someone that you do not know who to shop for.  </li>
            <li>I received these very fast and when I looked at all the beautiful colors, I was very impressed with the vast selection for the price I paid for these lipsticks.  </li>
            <li>I would give u 10 stars if I could thanks a lot for making us look beautiful with ure product</li>
            <li>Quality of the lipsticks are very cheap.</li>
            <li>and it goes on very smooth.  </li>
            <li>another thing the package looks very nice elegant not cheap and it was awesome buy .....................</li>
            <li>These are very smooth lipsticks, with beautiful pigmentation and last a good amount of time on your lips.</li>
            <li>(Although in my opinion, the colors are more beautiful in real life.)</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty, a good variety, and the lipsticks ARE nice.</li>
            <li>Shany Cosmetics also ships super fast and has great  customer service!</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love them!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most of them have a glossy finish -</li>
            <li>But all in all, I was satisfied</li>
            <li>Cheap!</li>
            <li>I love all of them.</li>
            <li>Better buy them in a store..</li>
            <li>&amp; I am sure she will purchase more when needed.</li>
            <li>Some were stuck in the top of the cap.  </li>
            <li>, what more can you expect?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>they give my lips a nice smooth texture   </li>
            <li>I love the price and the product.  </li>
            <li>Most of the lipsticks were stuck to the lid.</li>
            <li>it was ok like this product as dicribed  </li>
            <li>Most of them are chipped.  </li>
            <li>in love with this set, everything about it just gets me going!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The one that is supposed to be &amp;#34;true red&amp;#34; is more of a purple-pink.</li>
            <li>Once I put them back together and gave them a try, they were excellent!!</li>
            <li>and I was beyond satisfied with the quality again.</li>
            <li>If you purchase a SHANY lipstick you will be glad you did.  </li>
            <li>but I already know you will like it and purchase more.  </li>
            <li>It was a great product in theory but really missed the mark.</li>
            <li>But, there are many others to choose from.  </li>
            <li>I love 12 and 07, and use others also.</li>
            <li>so they love them as well.</li>
            <li>I love these lipsticks.</li>
            <li>I love the variety in colors.</li>
            <li>Love love</li>
            <li>Pigmentation is ok, could be better though.</li>
            <li>Huge hit with my lipstick loving teenager.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d rather pay more for a better quality product.</li>
            <li>My lips hold moisture much better and the color stays on.</li>
            <li>Overall, for the price I think the product is excellent.</li>
            <li>The tip were damaged and most of it looks melting.</li>
            <li>After using these lipsticks with a primer, I enjoyed them even more.</li>
            <li>I read most of the reviews and everyone kept complaining about how they were smushed at the top.</li>
            <li>I love them, They exceeded my expectations :)</li>
            <li>I love the colors.</li>
            <li>&amp; i love how they wear.</li>
            <li>I  love the lipstick I am a darker color women</li>
            <li>but I love the way it shine the pigments of color....</li>
            <li>i just wish they had more colors to buy.....</li>
            <li>NOW interesting thing is, the tag on bottom of each lipstick showing what color they should be match the colors in this picture just not whats in the tube.</li>
            <li>well it was STUCK to the top of the lid .</li>
            <li>I went on the check the rest &amp; most of them were stuck to the top as well.</li>
            <li>I love this brand because it goes with my skin tone.</li>
            <li>She loves I love it</li>
            <li>I would have given more stars if I had had fewer break with one use.</li>
            <li>I love the selection of colors and the quality of the lipsticks.  </li>
            <li>You cannot beat this price for so many colors.  </li>
            <li>I will buy more for gifts.  </li>
            <li>and I LOVE THIS PRODUCT..</li>
            <li>I really love Shany lipstick</li>
            <li>I love the colors included in the SHANY 12 color Lipstick Set.</li>
            <li>Most of these accentuated my face color, and I got a lot of compliments about my looks when I wore these lipsticks.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>This is a smile for happiness about the product.  </li>
            <li>I love the colors are well.</li>
            <li>There are so many colors to pick from and they are all so opaque.</li>
            <li>I love the lipsticks.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li>but actually for the price there awesome !</li>
            <li>I love the colors, I would give it 5</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy so thanks</li>
            <li>I love the lipsticks!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Each &amp; every one of the lipsticks were melted onto the inside of the top.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>If you are hesitating to buy this set because most lipstick sets come with some tacky colors that you would never wear....</li>
            <li>I love every color.</li>
            <li>and there is so many to choose from.</li>
            <li>Normally I love shany</li>
            <li>I use their brush set every day and love their neutral eyeshadow pallette.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, just wanted better colors</li>
            <li>The slimtubed shany lipstick I have are much better would recommend those instead.</li>
            <li>The lipsticks were in great condition, no broken or smushed tips.  </li>
            <li>You do not need to add more colors to your make up bag.</li>
            <li>and we both love them.</li>
            <li>This product is okay..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they get tons of complains.</li>
            <li>The colors are ok.</li>
            <li>NYX is wayyyy better.</li>
            <li>If you love lipstick like I do this is a must have.</li>
            <li>The lipstick is amazing and it goes on so smoothly.</li>
            <li>Thank you Shany for such wonderful lipstick!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THESE LIPSTICKS order for my moms bIRTHDAY:)</li>
            <li>SHE LOVE THEM</li>
            <li>and I love the fact that it&#x27;s not animal tested.</li>
            <li>i hope to try out more of the SHANY cosmetics soon(:</li>
            <li>There are a plethora of colors for every mood and outfit and they leave your lips feeling smooth and hydrated!</li>
            <li>I love every color.</li>
            <li>Ok they were alright</li>
            <li>My bf bought me this lipsticks and I absolutely love them .</li>
            <li>but when I picked them up most of them fell out</li>
            <li>more wonderful&lt;br /&gt;Product</li>
            <li>and I got many duplicates.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even layered them to create a custom shade I really love :)</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get the reds and pinks in the photo, the colours I got were more orange, pinks, and creams than anything.</li>
            <li>but because there are so many it is not a problem.</li>
            <li>so I would say the quality is better than drugstore brand that is comparable price.</li>
            <li>Something anyone would love :)</li>
            <li>I just got my package and I am in love ðwith the product shany</li>
            <li>I love all the make up</li>
            <li>absolutely  love this line</li>
            <li>The box was packaged appropriately and nothing inside was damaged.  </li>
            <li>I will say that I love all the colors.</li>
            <li>However, Im ok with that</li>
            <li>She love fixing herself up.  </li>
            <li>Drugstore make up doesn&#x27;t even come that cheap!</li>
            <li>The colors last all day and have a beautiful finish!</li>
            <li>The lipsticks fall apart when you take the top off.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>Some, of course, I love better than others because of the color payoff.  </li>
            <li>would recommend this as a gift to someone, or yourself:)</li>
            <li>These lipsticks are nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>I wanted more reds when I ordered this</li>
            <li>If you prefer light and shine this is just the item you are looking for!</li>
            <li>These lipsticks go on more like a lip gloss.</li>
            <li>I def won&#x27;t be purchasing any more lipsticks from this company.</li>
            <li>Colors are versatile and could be worn by many.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>The colors are lovely and the lipstick is creamy.  </li>
            <li>Bottom line is that these are wonderful lipsticks, most especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Like everyone says when shipping the lipstick will smoosh against the top of the cap of the lipstick tube.</li>
            <li>Except theres a dent on the top of the lipstick which with use will go away.</li>
            <li>Its okay for yourself but not a gift for others just because of that shipping problem.</li>
            <li>Do not waist your time all 12 lipsticks were melted to the top of the lids</li>
            <li>2 were smudged at the top of the lipstick, and  MOST were in the cap.</li>
            <li>These are okay-</li>
            <li>I am glad I purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>I figured perhaps the box could have been more cushioned, or that they were exposed to heat somehow during transit.</li>
            <li>I will be a repeat customer! :)</li>
            <li>I love all the colors.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li>I was very excited to receive this because ive been looking for a set of pinks and reds in lipsticks.</li>
            <li>These colors are so nice and do much useful !</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re smooth and pretty, the colors are great.</li>
            <li>I love to try different lipsticks, these are just great!With 12 Beautiful colors, you have many to choose from, and they have great pigmentation and are very moisturizing!</li>
            <li>Great lipstick very pigmented, creamy, and easy to apply I am highly satisfied with this purchase and do recommend to any lipstick lover</li>
            <li>These lipsticks are a great value particularly when compared with luxury brands of make up.</li>
            <li>But I would rather if colors were more strong, more pigmented.</li>
            <li>They go on smooth and easy!</li>
            <li>They are super pigmented and have a nice scent.</li>
            <li>I opened each one individually, and they are beautifully colored and look nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>I am super excited to use these lipsticks more! :)</li>
            <li>after a couple of applications it applies a bit more smoothly.</li>
            <li>The set comes with some wonderful colors, I wide array of reds &amp; pinks.  </li>
            <li>I was extremly happy when i recieved my SHANY Slick &amp; Shine Lipstick Set, GREAT shipping &amp; handling.</li>
            <li>They seem fairly cheaply made and most of them had fallen out of the bottom of the tube when I received them.</li>
            <li>Mine were in perfect condition when they came, they are very pigmented and great for everyday use.</li>
            <li>The lipstick isn&#x27;t securely attached to the applicator so most of mine were stuck to the lid.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It stays on for a while and doesn&#x27;t wipe right off (which is nice).</li>
            <li>These are very smooth, satiny/shining finish to them, and come in a good variety (pure orange, classic red, purple tones and even a perfect nude for my skin tone!)</li>
            <li>I love the different colors they are great for traveling</li>
            <li>The light pink one works best for me.</li>
            <li>for the price they are a great bargain, but the quality of the lipstick is only ok.</li>
            <li>, just wish it didnt rub of so easily</li>
            <li>I really liked the colours, there are only 2 that I wouldn&#x27;t wear with my fair skin.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>nothing special.. save your money and spend more on quality not quantity.</li>
            <li>.they are such beautiful shades only if they got it right ,it would av been perfect.</li>
            <li>great colors pigmented and very slick great buy</li>
            <li>then, this is a good buy, especially since it applies on smoothly and feels nice on the lips.</li>
            <li>Of course not all of them work with me personally, but they&#x27;re all beautiful.</li>
            <li>Overall they were quite beautiful.</li>
            <li>but the colors are pretty and transfer quite nice.</li>
            <li>Colors are not as  true asthe picture, but l still love them.</li>
            <li>Wear this with a pair of hot heels and a nice bag from ShoeDazzle or Just Fab.</li>
            <li>However, you have to apply more than one coat to get the full color.</li>
            <li>All the different colors are beautiful</li>
            <li>I made sure to get a full refund</li>
            <li>lipsticks themselves are very pretty in addition to transfers to the lips very smoothly.</li>
            <li>The lipstick isn&#x27;t as smooth and easy to apply as I would like.</li>
            <li>these were fine.</li>
            <li>They were bold!</li>
            <li>The packaging is super sleek too!</li>
            <li>Super Dissapointed!</li>
            <li>The color label on each tube really isn&#x27;t accurate to the color of lipstick.  </li>
            <li>so yes i am happy with with the overall experience.</li>
            <li>I think the problem might be with the formula which, while making the lipstick feel smooth, makes the lipstick easier to damage with almost no effort.</li>
            <li>The lipstick goes on smooth and has just the slightest shimmer in the lighter colors.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Application is smooth and velvety</li>
            <li>Just fantastic.</li>
            <li>AND they were of such great quality.  </li>
            <li>They weren&#x27;t transparent or cheap.</li>
            <li>This lipstick slides on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>It applies smoothly and the colors lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li>they are cheaper and with free shipping and samples with orders over $50.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Lipstick goes on smoothly, stays on well (not extended wear).  </li>
            <li>There were around 4 that were too warm/peach toned and some that were too light.  </li>
            <li>However, they feel fairly smooth and moisturizing, not tacky.</li>
            <li>Look cheap &amp; flimsy.</li>
            <li>They are cheap too.</li>
            <li>and they go on so smooth.</li>
            <li>I thought these lipsticks were going to be cheap</li>
            <li>I am definitely a shany-holic lol.</li>

            <li>The lipsticks are so smooth and glide on effortlessly.</li>
            <li>Colors seemed to go on smooth on my finger, but these were meant to be a gift and it would have been embarrassing.</li>

            <li>you&#x27;re looking for good lipstick for cheap just to have a variety to choose from, this is definitely for you.</li>
            <li>They go on really smooth and are very creamy :)</li>
            <li>Lasts a long time and the color stays true and the shine is great.</li>
            <li>I feel most of the other reviews are people expecting something too good for the price they are paying</li>
            <li>The quality is great, really creamy and doesn&#x27;t dry out your lips the way that most lipsticks do.</li>
            <li>#3 - it matches my natural lip color PERFECTLY, but maybe just a little better.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t include a bright red as I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>The lipstick is very creamy not that pigmented but lovely spring lipstick  </li>
            <li>But once you try them on, they actually look good.</li>
            <li>There was one color in the whole box that looked okay on.  </li>
            <li>Good variety of color/, only tossed one--kept the remaining eleven!</li>
            <li>one cap was already off when it was shipped and the colors were not the same but its good lipstick</li>
            <li>Simply place them or the melted one in the fridge for about an hour and your good to go.</li>
            <li>There are so many colors and they are very pigmented.</li>
            <li>True to their words &amp;#34;Slick &amp; Shine&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It was possible good shopping you used to gift</li>
            <li>colors are cool.</li>
            <li>Thank u love it so much</li>
            <li>My fav is the Orange No 01, and always thought orange was an absolute no for me, I am extremly satisfied</li>
            <li>and I order 24 pieces and out of that only 2 were not in good shape.</li>
            <li>You get 12 shades of mostly cool colors.</li>
            <li>She ended up giving me most of them because she doesn&#x27;t wear lipstick very often.</li>
            <li>This is a good product if you need lots of colors quick and cant afford to buy each individually at wal-greens or what not.</li>
            <li>is pretty easy.</li>
            <li>They went on smoothly and were rich and creamy and the colors were exactly like the color of the lipstick or what the label shows.  </li>
            <li>The color is so rich and it is really worth the price.</li>
            <li>Purchased to have more color options outside the bright reds and nudes I normally purchase.</li>
            <li>Excellent all the primary colors are there.&lt;br /&gt;Creamy and long last lipsticks.</li>
            <li>I was excited and opend the box up to check out my new lipsticks and was extremely satisfied with the quality of the product just looking at it.  </li>
            <li>The package also came quickly.  </li>
            <li>Also please note that most colors are peach/brown not these vibrant colors.</li>
            <li>Overall great product and very moisturizing</li>
            <li>I can say it arrived quick in two days ð</li>
            <li>Probably because there was high expectation from this product even though the latest review mentioned it arrived defective.  </li>
            <li>Now all I need to get myself is a cute little way to carry my 3 or 4 favorite colors. :)</li>
            <li>the colors were very pretty</li>
            <li>Very reasonable!</li>
            <li>12 colors makes it easy to choose to match with certain looks.</li>
            <li>Colors are true to the sticker on the bottom and great colors, even if some were too dark for me!</li>
            <li>If you want something better you can look for something is sephora or mac but for a new price level.</li>
            <li>What a lovely new product.  </li>
            <li>With 12 colors to choose from, you get a little bit of everything and some great dupes of your favorite high end products.</li>
            <li>The color is long lasting and looks great!</li>
            <li>I bought this product because of the price is so cheap and positive review.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try and find red lipstick from this company, because it was some seriously outstanding quality!</li>
            <li>AND THEY ARE VERY PIGMENTED!!</li>
            <li>Thank you Shany, I will be back to order more when needed!</li>
            <li>the cap tend come off easily but overall it was an ok product.</li>
            <li>Each color has good pigmentation for everyday, easy wear.</li>
            <li>Product was very good but instead of 12 lipsticks there were only ten in the package.</li>
            <li>I like this lipstick great color choices and it feels silky smooth and last for several hours.</li>
            <li>They came fast the color lasts gose on smooth and</li>
            <li>The colors are very different from the picture, but all of the colors are more accurately described in the description.</li>
            <li>the deep violet color looks amazing.</li>
            <li>Not the same colors as shown but some colors are nice..</li>
            <li>Ive been able to pull up a smokey eye, soft evening, and</li>
            <li>Is it worth the money?</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I bought the set for $12 and it is worth keeping for that price.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the pros are worth it.</li>
            <li>I rarely if ever wear corral colors.  </li>
            <li>I still think it was worth the price.</li>
            <li>They are really pigmented and last a fair amount of time which is something I expect for the price.</li>
            <li>Worth the price, fun to play with.</li>
            <li>I loved the reds and pink they are showing.</li>
            <li>My skin tone is a golden brown.</li>
            <li>These lipsticks are so fun to experiment with.</li>
            <li>-- it must depend on shipping and handling, and hopefully this is a rare issue.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat the deal, but 4 lipsticks were stuck in top lid, completely damaged, and 3 others</li>
            <li>Get your moneys worth elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Overall Ä± liked them..</li>
            <li>and I use them for fun.</li>
            <li>Set of 12 lipstics for 20$s is totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>This product is just as described, and definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>The ingredients and color of these lipsticks are worth what you pay.</li>
            <li>guess i read the reviews and decided to give it a try,but it wasnt worth</li>
            <li>The lipsticks are vibrant and wild colors i love it!</li>
            <li>I purchased this product as a gift for my mom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially decided to purchase this brand due to the pricing, but I found out afterwards that it is a wonderful product.  </li>
            <li>other then that the colors are nice n smooth.</li>
            <li>I know right</li>
            <li>The price was right.</li>
            <li>They just fall right out of the tubes.</li>
            <li>, however there are about 5 that I can never use and will probably give to someone with the right coloring to use.  </li>
            <li>I think they give the right amount of color for me</li>
            <li>And most of these colours are better for lighter skin tones than dark.</li>
            <li>The lipsticks are very creamy,the colors are beautiful, it goes on smooth, it&#x27;s long lasting and it goes with</li>
            <li>If you want a moderately to highly pigmented lipstick that goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>I truly expected a wider range in the difference of color most of them are similar and not as bright as they appear online.</li>
            <li>I had absolutely no problems with this product, and I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Beautiful long lasting color.</li>
            <li>Overall I really like the lipstick set and all the colors are really nice</li>
            <li>This lipstick set is great value for money and would have gotten a fourth star if the colors were not so similar.</li>
            <li>These are the easy to wear, apply without a mirror, natural lipsticks.</li>
            <li>I got it on black Friday for a pretty good price.  </li>
            <li>beautiful shades but half of the bullets were broke in the tubes and fell out as soon as I opened them, may have just been an old set.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast though.</li>
            <li>The colors are totally different than what is labeled and don&#x27;t feel very smooth when applied.</li>
            <li>It came as a normal clean box ..</li>
            <li>This is obviously not a super high quality brand, however the quality is still very nice.  </li>
            <li>After the second time theyre really nice and vibrant.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t rub off the first time you take a bite of a sandwhich</li>
            <li>I love the different colors and the packaging.</li>
            <li>These colors are pretty.</li>
            <li>Then there was only one that was stuck to the top</li>
            <li>Maybe it was because of the shipping they were placed in hot conditions</li>
            <li>and my husband loves when I do my make up and add the red lip stick on :}</li>
            <li>Very creamy!</li>
            <li>I will buy again, but I will contact the seller first to see what colors come with it.</li>
            <li>this is her first set of lipstick I&#x27;am glade that I was there to share in that moment ,</li>
            <li>but the colors were pretty</li>
            <li>I only gave this product one star because all the lipsticks were stuck in the top of the tubes.</li>
            <li>quality, these cosmetics do not work the first day of use and some do not paint descoronaron me</li>
            <li>Make sure when you open lipstick cover, its on up side direction orelse lipstick will come out.</li>
            <li>But overall it is okay.</li>
            <li>Most of the colors are the same.</li>
            <li>it looked nice in the picture but not really in person.</li>
            <li>The colors are so pretty</li>
            <li>$19 for 12 different color lipstick is cheap !</li>
            <li>The only issue is the closing of the stick that lays over the top of the case.  </li>
            <li>That soft, barely touching it glide left a smooth line of the color.</li>
            <li>but you can&#x27;t really tell !</li>
            <li>was very disjointed!</li>
            <li>Colors are great and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used this brand</li>
            <li>I love all the colors -- there&#x27;s only 1 out of 12 that doesn&#x27;t seem like it would work with my skin tone</li>
            <li>Pretty colors.</li>
            <li>Overall, they are okay.</li>
            <li>The temperature is most likely the cause for the sticks to fall out when arrived.</li>
            <li>I would really like a refund!</li>
            <li>The colors are really pretty..</li>
            <li>The first tube I opened the lip stick came flying out and landed on the floor.</li>
            <li>Also, all the colors matched almost exactly as the shades on the bottom stickers indicated.</li>
            <li>the actual lipstick part was stuck in the top</li>
            <li>.. they need to come up with a light skin and dark skin collection because now I&#x27;m stuck with seven lipsticks that I won&#x27;t be able to</li>
            <li>ae really pretty and the price was reasoable.</li>
            <li>Love the colors all of them last forever while on the lips</li>
            <li>Like most lipsticks, the color tab doesn&#x27;t match exactly with the actual lipstick color</li>
            <li>I borrowed one from her one day and she had to ask me more than once to get it back.</li>
            <li>I had higher hopes for this</li>
            <li>The only downside is that most of the colours didn&#x27;t match my skin tone.</li>
            <li>However, that lipstick also kind of fell onto its cap and got crushed.</li>
            <li>Worked for exactly what I needed</li>
            <li>You get 12 GREAT lipsticks for 25.00 that mean you&#x27;re paying 2.03 per lipstick.</li>
            <li>pretty positive you&#x27;ll become a returning SHANY customer.</li>
            <li>I would say overall the low price makes these a pretty good buy.</li>
            <li>The box is full of dust and dark stains, there was lipstick smudged on the lipsticks to top it off.</li>
            <li>Took a while to receive, and I&#x27;m actually quite displease with the fact that in the pictures posted, it shows a good array of red colors.</li>
            <li>they pretty much just take up room in my makeup box at this point.</li>
            <li>Most of mine came broke and don&#x27;t stay on long they also smudge.</li>
            <li>When I first ordered these I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li>hot sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are varied and not as intense as the image.</li>
            <li>The colors are all very bright and vibrant, and only a few would have went with my olive skin/ brunette tones.  </li>
            <li>- And some of them arrived with the lipstick popped out of the bullet, but that&#x27;s easy enough to fix.</li>
            <li>The black lipstick cases are nice also.</li>
            <li>The color swatches don&#x27;t match the actual color of lipstick, they come off easy</li>
            <li>If you tap strongly on the tops the stick will unstick and go back in place.</li>
            <li>Every single tube of lipstick was smashed in the top lid and the stick had fallen out.</li>
            <li>The were all very pale shades that I can&#x27;t imagine they would look good on anyone except a ghost.  </li>
            <li>Most of the colors of the lipsticks are great but half of them were either broken or literally fell right out of the tube when I first tried to use them...</li>
            <li>However, I was super shocked by the incredible colors that did come!</li>
            <li>I was able to release it and press it down to stick in the right place.  </li>
            <li>Not a single one was in good shape one of them was broken and the rest of them will all smashed on the top.  </li>
            <li>When I first ordered this set, I was excited because I thought that I would be getting some red lipstick!</li>
            <li>To my relief, as stated earlier, they were fine.</li>
            <li>The color lasts and is so vibrant!</li>
            <li>The main reason why I purchased this set was because I thought there would be a lot of pretty reds, but there is none.</li>
            <li>None of the Lipsticks were broken or smashed,Giving as gift so very pleased!</li>
            <li>The colors that come in this pack are so vibrant, and sexy, and it lasts a long while  .</li>
            <li>I love EVERY SINGLE color!</li>
            <li>I love every single color from this lipstick set!</li>
            <li>color sticker on the bottom of the lipstick bullet doesn&#x27;t really match what&#x27;s in the tube</li>
            <li>most of us have lines above our upper lip that regular lipstick runs up the Crack unless it&#x27;s matte love the colors</li>
            <li>i really didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>So far it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>There very oily</li>
            <li>set arrived with no broken or damaged sticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Also, very creamy and non-drying.</li>
            <li>The tubes are cheap and the end pops off when you try to open the lipsticks.</li>
            <li>You do need to reapply these a bit throughout the day, but I don&#x27;t see that as too much of a problem.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>All very shiny - none are matte.</li>
            <li>say, they got here fast</li>
            <li>The lipstick blends well and lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Very soothing on my lips.</li>
            <li>I recieved this product really fast about 4 days time.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend getting these!</li>
            <li>The color is very pigmented.</li>
            <li>This product is really more than what I expected.  </li>
            <li>They go on smooth and seem to last well.</li>
            <li>100 % honesty is always appreciated in business.</li>
            <li>The colors are much more pigmented than I expected.</li>
            <li>Not whaf i expected... could be better</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m light brown skin and only two</li>
            <li>REALLY WELL</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing</li>
            <li>This Lipstick was very moisturizing to my lips.</li>
            <li>and yes the tip of them came as crashed but isn&#x27;t much of a problem..</li>
            <li>The colors also don&#x27;t really match the stickers on the bottom.</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>Was rather dissatisfied with whole order.</li>
            <li>The colors of lipstick in the collection don&#x27;t really make much sense.</li>
            <li>the color stay on the whole time and</li>
            <li>As an extra bonus, they even moisturize your lips keeping them smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>The lipsticks however aren&#x27;t secure in the tube several of them fell out when opened.</li>
            <li>They were damaged the whole lipstick just fell out.</li>
            <li>i really dont know y</li>
            <li>dont even show ,and u have to keep applying before u see the real thing.well</li>
            <li>In brand stores, one lipstick can cost as much as $30</li>
            <li>so I am very upset with these product..</li>
            <li>I love the wide range of colors, the creaminess, and the box for storing the lipsticks.</li>
            <li>So much better than expected.</li>
            <li>I really like them and would recommend at this price for quality.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>it goes on very well  </li>
            <li>lipsticks were a very creamy and moist combination.</li>
            <li>Colors are nice too for everyday use.</li>
            <li>The only downfall was that 10 tubes of lipsticks were touching the top of the lids so every color was very slightly dented in.</li>
            <li>I thought that the lipsticks would be sheer but they are very colorful.</li>
            <li>the colors all go on smooth, and they seem to last decently well.  </li>
            <li>and I love the fact that I can read other customers reviews because it has impacted my purchasing.  </li>
            <li>There were about two other lipsticks that were smudged against the top of the lid.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say they&#x27;re slightly better than Revlon or other drugstore lipsticks.</li>
            <li>As far as shipping time, the package arrived in a decent time frame.&lt;br /&gt;Going through each color, I noticed it took a little more effort to get the full color on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really sure why these have such great reviews...</li>
            <li>but I honestly didn&#x27;t care, the lipstick last long and looks good on me and for 12 different colors for less that 20$</li>
            <li>My lips usually dry, but these lipsticks are nice on my lips and they are low maintenance  </li>
            <li>The colors are amazing, highly pigmented, It last long</li>
            <li>The bright pink kind of looks weird on me but</li>
            <li>The lipsticks are full size and are complementary to different skin tones.</li>
            <li>the colors are beautiful unfortunately the lipstick was falling apart when opening it the color would fall off and stay in the cap....</li>
            <li>When i got the lipsticks they seem cool until you open it.</li>
            <li>The packaging is good the only thing was the tips on some were a little smudged</li>
            <li>I received this half lipsticks were stuck in the top of the lids.</li>
            <li>Most of the lipsticks in both of our orders arrived cracked in half.</li>
            <li>The products were smaller than I expected but the lipsticks were nice colors.</li>
            <li>I have lipsticks older than these and never have mold on it.</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant and as they appear in the photograph.</li>
            <li>If you are fortunate enough to get a complete set undamaged, you&lt;br /&gt;will</li>
            <li>The colores are vibrant and the lipstick stays on well.</li>
            <li>I do love several of these colors, but especially color</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall they&#x27;re decent for the price you get for 12 assorted lipsticks.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I am an African American woman and love the options.</li>
            <li>THERE ARE NO RED LIPSTICKS IN THIS SET which I was a tad upset about that seeing as the picture makes them look more red, but this set does come with nudes, oranges, pinks, and plums.</li>
            <li>I did not let them sit outside either I made sure to get them inside as soon as they arived because I thought that might happen after reading all theses coments with the same story as me.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive lips and wearing lipstick too much always drys my lips out</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for these considering the decent reviews.</li>
            <li>this are rich and creamy.last long</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li>When I bought it I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The quality of the lipsticks is high end.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find them to be highly pigmented as others have said</li>
            <li>I was expecting the colors to be a little richer, but they are more on the translucent side.</li>
            <li>do not waste your money!!</li>
            <li>There was little to no color pigment with most colors.</li>
            <li>WoW!!</li>
            <li>I would prefer a more textured lipstick that would stay on your lips a little longer.</li>
            <li>They are really moist and shinny without being sparkly or shimmer, can be worn by themselves or add some gloss on top for a more dramatic, voluminous effect, no fragrance at all , and there is not enough I can say about this set.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t turn them upside down! :)</li>
            <li>but they are absolutely beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;Second, when I opened the Amazon box, the box of lipstick was completely ripped apart where it&#x27;s supposed to be together.</li>
            <li>but I expected them to have a deeper pigmentation, as they apply on quite lightly.</li>
            <li>I bought two as gifts, after opening it I kept one for myself, absolutely adorable colors and long lasting.</li>
            <li>What a waste of money I&#x27;m gonna make sure Shany cosmetics know about this.</li>
            <li>Pretty disapointed I was really looking foward to giving them as a present for christmas.</li>
            <li>I love the colors of these lipsticks but the wearing does not last long.</li>
            <li>Also, not a huge fan of most of the colors in the set</li>
            <li>I opened the box to make sure all of the lipsticks were there and were in acceptable condition, and half of the lipsticks had come out of the container and had smushed against the lid before I even opened them!</li>
            <li>Ranges from very light pink to coral to deep plum.</li>
            <li>I tried out the brightest shade and the color stayed vibrant and pretty for several hours even through eating and</li>
            <li>colors are very pretty, creamy, and long wearing</li>
            <li>I am fairly new to wearing lipsticks</li>
            <li>I can mix my lipsticks to make new colors.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>Colour only a few looks nice to me.</li>
            <li>Though a couple were melted and damaged during shipping:( I must say beautiful colors, wears so soft and very pigmented.its outcome from what I expected for the price was beyond expectations:)</li>
            <li>Glad to have such a wide selection of colors</li>
            <li>I was very surprised.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my wife &amp; she tells me she likes the different colors very much.</li>
            <li>The one that had a hot pink sticker was more of a purple/fuchsia and the one that looked plum on the outside was actually red.</li>
            <li>Also be careful, the lip color will fall right out of the tube!</li>
            <li>Some of the colors are very similar but they&#x27;re all unique in their different ways.</li>
            <li>And I got like four or five of them that look exactly the same color...  </li>
            <li>When they came I had to manually put the lipsticks back in their containers but that was probably because of the shipping process, it&#x27;s kinda hot here in Florida also.</li>
            <li>THEY CAME COMPLETELY MELTED!</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty (most, the orange is pretty orange and nude is weird) and stay on well after food and stuff.</li>
            <li>i do wish that i didnt have the same problem as other people, which was that the lipstick is broken..or stuck at the top.</li>
            <li>It came with two plum colors, two mauve colors, two nude colors, four bright pink and four light pink, Three of them i had to press back down in the case.</li>
            <li>They went on so smooth and last all day long.</li>
            <li>the lipsticks are smooth, not gooey and long lasting.</li>
            <li>The lipsticks are smooth to apply &amp; surprisingly long lasting.</li>
            <li>and I had to push them back down by touching the sides, but i didn&#x27;t leave dents.</li>
            <li>The only problem I had with them is that they should of put the labels of color on the top instead of the bottom because I turned them upside down</li>
            <li>The price is worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend getting this set because you will be wasting money purchasing a single tube of lipstick from the store.</li>
            <li>huge mess...</li>
            <li>I like the product, however, the lipstick remained stuck at the opposite end of the tube, causing many of them to crack in half.  </li>
            <li>Has a slight shine and is very pigmented and definitely worth $20 ð</li>
            <li>last longer than others.&lt;br /&gt;They are really smooth and don&#x27;t dry out my lips.</li>
            <li>and I believe Japonesque has a few, but there are some lower ended ones that are just fine as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>its color is not good at all, most of them look like for older people.&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
            <li>I bought these lipsticks due to the large selection for the price and all of the positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>A must have for those who love to play as hard as they work.....</li>
            <li>The case top sort of makes it hard to close at times.</li>
            <li>unlike many other lipsticks out there, these feel so moist and don&#x27;t dry out your lips after wearing it all day.</li>
            <li>Was supposed to be a gift, but that clearly isn&#x27;t going to happen.</li>
            <li>Packaging is a flexible, mostly clear plastic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pigmented and there&#x27;s several colors to choose from.</li>
            <li>I have been busy and forgot about them</li>
            <li>where near the color sticker on the bottom of the tube.&lt;br /&gt;None</li>
            <li>once opened, nearly all the lipsticks had come out of their socked.</li>
            <li>but I had to share my input because I&#x27;ve become a frequent Amazon shopper now</li>
            <li>If I see too many negative reviews I avoid the product.</li>
            <li>so I decided to purchase this VERY affordable set just to play around with the variety of different shades.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast but it really only has 4 colors</li>
            <li>do not waste your time or money  </li>
            <li>, please do not waste your money on this.</li>
            <li>The colors are a bit matte but that is easily fixed by adding a clear gloss over the lipstick.  </li>
            <li>Each lipstick completely fell out of the tube when I went to look at them.  </li>
            <li>old fashioned scented&lt;br /&gt;Feels</li>
            <li>I really wanted to returm it actually.</li>
            <li>idk, maybe some of the reviews are really young.</li>
            <li>Something for everyone and ever outfit, I kept the packaging for storage, it makes it much easier to find them, and experiment with a different color</li>
            <li>My biggest complaint with these lipsticks is the fact that wen I opened most of them the lipstick stuck to the cap.</li>
            <li>the lipsticks are very greasy and need to be applied numerous times.</li>
            <li>Everyday her lips are a different color which is pretty cool</li>
            <li>Although they last lomger than most afforadble lipsticks tou may have to reapply after a  few hours.</li>
            <li>I got them on a gold box special for less than $1</li>
            <li>They last a long time, and are super moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>(super creamy) and lasts long enough!</li>
            <li>Also if you&#x27;re a fan of pink, purple, and beige lipsticks, this is the right thing for you.</li>
            <li>Over all very pretty colors and long lasting!</li>
            <li>Also fair warning, if the box (Or actual tube) is ever left upside down, the next time you open it</li>
            <li>Out of all 12, only 2 didn&#x27;t suit me but the major complaint was after applying, the lipstick would seem to clump on lips, kind of grainy.</li>
            <li>First of all, the box the lipsticks came in was entirely busted open.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way! :)</li>
            <li>So careful upon opening and make sure you push the lip color down into the tube.  </li>
            <li>The other colors wasnt right.</li>
            <li>It was an easy enough fix to push the lipstick firmly against the grips at the bottom.  </li>
            <li>This was a gift for my granddaughter who was very pleased she sad</li>
            <li>First, they&#x27;re not very close to the lipsticks in the picture.</li>
            <li>When I received them I had low expectations, but was shocked when I saw the first few lipsticks were in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>I do not know why they were sent that way, but of course as I paying customer I am very disappointed and would not recommend this purchase unless you happen to get more lucky than me and the lip sticks come fine....</li>
            <li>The colors and very light and doesn&#x27;t should up, just a little shine, that doesn&#x27;t last long!</li>
            <li>The lipsticks are very creamy, they don&#x27;t leave your lips dry</li>
            <li>Some came broken but overall a nice collection.</li>
            <li>Keep a few for yourself and give a few away, they make a nice gift to a friend.</li>
            <li>The colors were different than the picture, and several of the colors looked the exact same to me.</li>
            <li>The lipsticks are NOT crushed, it is possible to GENTLY remove them from inside of the lid and place them back in the tube casing.</li>
            <li>colors were really pretty but other than that i am never ordering from them</li>
            <li>My main concern is the fact that many of the lipsticks were damaged as if someone had twisted the lipsticks up while the caps were still on.</li>
            <li>Two or three of them completely fell out of their casing when I opened them to look at the colors, and there are a couple that look like the only thing keeping them in the casing</li>
            <li>The picture showed red colors and there was only one red in the whole box.</li>
            <li>your natural lips just happen to be red.</li>
            <li>Its not an expensive quality so you&#x27;ll have to apply it more often then normal but can&#x27;t beat</li>
            <li>Most of them were broken....</li>
            <li>Most of the lipsticks were broken when I opened the tubes upon receiving the delivery.  </li>
            <li>One broken and the rest smudge on the top.</li>
            <li>Every lipstick came broken all the lip stick stuck in the top of the lid...</li>
            <li>All lipstick was broken and stuck to top of lid</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t get all the colors in the picuture and most of the ones i received were broken.</li>
            <li>most of them is broken.</li>
            <li>not one was melted or broken like most reviews</li>
            <li>Even the ones that didn&#x27;t come broken started falling out and got stuck at the top of the cap.</li>
            <li>Colors came broken, and stuck inside of the top cap.</li>
            <li>I gave away the other half to friends who liked the other colors.</li>
            <li>I love lipsticks and trying new colors but sadly, this purchase was a bust.  </li>
            <li>The lipsticks no longer look new and I&#x27;m debating whether or not I should actually give this as a present anymore.</li>
            <li>The swatch colors on the bottom of each lip stick aren&#x27;t accurate at all to the color of the lipstick and half of the colors aren&#x27;t close to pink or red.</li>
            <li>And then open the tube gingerly and softly push the stick back in place and its like it never happened.</li>
            <li>: Most of the lipsticks have now broken within three weeks, even after only using them once or twice</li>
            <li>That said, the price is right even if you only end up using half of them!</li>
            <li>Messy, not long lasting, doesn&#x27;t have the real colors as marked</li>
            <li>waste of money  3 of the lipsticks have already fallen out of the tube upon first use.  </li>
            <li>The colours are less red than they seem in the picture (with all 12 lipsticks beside each other) - they&#x27;re more neutral or pink with a couple of almost purples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are soft to the lips and don&#x27;t dry them out.  </li>
            <li>I like this product, not so much for the coverage, because it is not a true lipstick, I would consider it as a lip gloss.</li>
            <li>Not long lasting at all.</li>
            <li>Lipstick is a very creamy consistency and goes on looking very natural, not junky &amp; thick at all.</li>
            <li>I have a really hard time with lipstick - between the multiple cups of coffee I inhale during the morning or the chapped lips I have during the winter, I rarely even bother.  </li>

            <li> it&#x27;s a great price for 12 lipsticks versus paying $5-10 for just ONE lipstick.</li>

            <li> These lipsticks seem to be good</li>
            <li> loved this product.</li>
            <li> not all in good shape</li>
            <li> They all had good pigmentation and lasted a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> But i brought them in good shape.</li>
            <li> The quality isn&#x27;t that good, and almost all of them were stuck when I opened</li>
            <li> It contains good quality lipsticks</li>
            <li> uve used good lipsticks</li>
            <li> these were a good price, but sometimes you get what you pay for as when these lipsticks showed up they had all detached from their posts, causing all the lipsticks to be damaged.</li>
            <li> and I did get some good colors out of it, but there are pinks in here that I don&#x27;t use and also some darker/bland colors.</li>
            <li> Lipstick has no scent or taste (good thing).</li>
            <li> not the variety of colors I had wanted, but a good bang for the buck</li>
            <li> had no problems with the packaging, the lipsticks all came in good shape, none were damaged or falling out.</li>
            <li> The colors were just not soo good.</li>
            <li> The products is good but the envelop to send  no</li>
            <li> Really nice lipstick in very nice colors.</li>
            <li> The lipsticks got here in perfect state, the colors are beautiful and very pigmented.  </li>
            <li> It Came In So Fast , And The Colors Are So Beautiful , Plus They Are Wonderful When Put Upon Lips</li>
            <li> Amazing product and amazing sellers!</li>
            <li> I had never heard of this brand, but took a chance when the reviews were so good, and I am very glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Some of the sticks broke easily, some sticks were chalky, but some were very good.</li>
            <li> The colors were o.k.; nothing exceptional</li>
            <li> Exceptional quality and affordable too.</li>
            <li> Love the colors the quality of the product isn&#x27;t so great but their good shape.</li>

            <li> Shany&#x27;s lipstick is perfect - long wearing, moisturizing and GREAT color payoff!!</li>
            <li> This product is great for many reasons but I will keep it at five for time sake.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure it work great for someone else.  </li>
            <li> I must confess they are not the most pigmented I have owned, but for the price I am happy to aplply in a 3-4 sequence way.</li>

            <li> Over all its a nice set.</li>
            <li> i kind of knew what i was getting myself into because of the reviews..</li>
            <li> They Was so excited!!</li>
            <li> Received this as a Christmas gift and they came in perfect condition, my husband did a great blind buy, and they colors are absolutely beautiful!</li>
            <li> The product came very quickly and was in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> The colors are a large variety and very bright.</li>
            <li> I JUST RECEIVED THEM ON THE MAIL RIGHT NOW!!!</li>
            <li> bought them directly from them and came in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Though the shades was nice, I should have known better, 12 lipsticks for $19.90 that&#x27;s too cheap to get good quality lipstick.</li>
            <li> It goes on so smoothly and my lips feel so good, almost like lip balm with color.  </li>
            <li> I tried on each lipstick and they aren&#x27;t as pigmented as I&#x27;d hoped, they seem cheaply made and I have to continuously rub the lipstick on my lips for it to show up good.</li>
            <li> I love Shany Cosmetics because of their level of quality and affordability, but I was not too thrilled about this product.</li>
            <li> Also, the lipstick goes on smoothly and for the price, this is a good set.</li>
            <li> I love, love, LOVE these lipsticks!  </li>
            <li> These are great - you get a huge variety and they are all super creamy and pigmented!</li>
            <li> Very good lip product - I didn&#x27;t know what to expect when getting these because it&#x27;s such a good price for that amount of lipstick.</li>
            <li> Great quality for such a great price.</li>
            <li> The box is a great packaging which is a great present for someone that you do not know who to shop for.  </li>
            <li> I received these very fast and when I looked at all the beautiful colors, I was very impressed with the vast selection for the price I paid for these lipsticks.  </li>
            <li> I would give u 10 stars if I could thanks a lot for making us look beautiful with ure product</li>
            <li> Quality of the lipsticks are very cheap.</li>
            <li> and it goes on very smooth.  </li>
            <li> another thing the package looks very nice elegant not cheap and it was awesome buy .....................</li>
            <li> These are very smooth lipsticks, with beautiful pigmentation and last a good amount of time on your lips.</li>
            <li> (Although in my opinion, the colors are more beautiful in real life.)</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty, a good variety, and the lipsticks ARE nice.</li>
            <li> Shany Cosmetics also ships super fast and has great  customer service!</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love them!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most of them have a glossy finish -</li>
            <li> But all in all, I was satisfied</li>
            <li> Cheap!</li>
            <li> I love all of them.</li>
            <li> Better buy them in a store..</li>
            <li> &amp; I am sure she will purchase more when needed.</li>
            <li> Some were stuck in the top of the cap.  </li>
            <li> , what more can you expect?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> they give my lips a nice smooth texture   </li>
            <li> I love the price and the product.  </li>
            <li> Most of the lipsticks were stuck to the lid.</li>
            <li> it was ok like this product as dicribed  </li>
            <li> Most of them are chipped.  </li>
            <li> in love with this set, everything about it just gets me going!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The one that is supposed to be &amp;#34;true red&amp;#34; is more of a purple-pink.</li>
            <li> Once I put them back together and gave them a try, they were excellent!!</li>
            <li> and I was beyond satisfied with the quality again.</li>
            <li> If you purchase a SHANY lipstick you will be glad you did.  </li>
            <li> but I already know you will like it and purchase more.  </li>
            <li> It was a great product in theory but really missed the mark.</li>
            <li> But, there are many others to choose from.  </li>
            <li> I love 12 and 07, and use others also.</li>
            <li> so they love them as well.</li>
            <li> I love these lipsticks.</li>
            <li> I love the variety in colors.</li>
            <li> Love love</li>
            <li> Pigmentation is ok, could be better though.</li>
            <li> Huge hit with my lipstick loving teenager.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d rather pay more for a better quality product.</li>
            <li> My lips hold moisture much better and the color stays on.</li>
            <li> Overall, for the price I think the product is excellent.</li>
            <li> The tip were damaged and most of it looks melting.</li>
            <li> After using these lipsticks with a primer, I enjoyed them even more.</li>
            <li> I read most of the reviews and everyone kept complaining about how they were smushed at the top.</li>
            <li> I love them, They exceeded my expectations :)</li>
            <li> I love the colors.</li>
            <li> &amp; i love how they wear.</li>
            <li> I  love the lipstick I am a darker color women</li>
            <li> but I love the way it shine the pigments of color....</li>
            <li> i just wish they had more colors to buy.....</li>
            <li> NOW interesting thing is, the tag on bottom of each lipstick showing what color they should be match the colors in this picture just not whats in the tube.</li>
            <li> well it was STUCK to the top of the lid .</li>
            <li> I went on the check the rest &amp; most of them were stuck to the top as well.</li>
            <li> I love this brand because it goes with my skin tone.</li>
            <li> She loves I love it</li>
            <li> I would have given more stars if I had had fewer break with one use.</li>
            <li> I love the selection of colors and the quality of the lipsticks.  </li>
            <li> You cannot beat this price for so many colors.  </li>
            <li> I will buy more for gifts.  </li>
            <li> and I LOVE THIS PRODUCT..</li>

            <li> Each &amp; every one of the lipsticks were melted onto the inside of the top.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>

            <li> and there is so many to choose from.</li>
            <li> Normally I love shany</li>
            <li> I use their brush set every day and love their neutral eyeshadow pallette.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, just wanted better colors</li>
            <li> The slimtubed shany lipstick I have are much better would recommend those instead.</li>
            <li> The lipsticks were in great condition, no broken or smushed tips.  </li>
            <li> You do not need to add more colors to your make up bag.</li>
            <li> and we both love them.</li>
            <li> This product is okay..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they get tons of complains.</li>
            <li> The colors are ok.</li>
            <li> NYX is wayyyy better.</li>
            <li> If you love lipstick like I do this is a must have.</li>
            <li> The lipstick is amazing and it goes on so smoothly.</li>
            <li> Thank you Shany for such wonderful lipstick!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE LIPSTICKS order for my moms bIRTHDAY:)</li>
            <li> SHE LOVE THEM</li>
            <li> and I love the fact that it&#x27;s not animal tested.</li>
            <li> i hope to try out more of the SHANY cosmetics soon(:</li>
            <li> There are a plethora of colors for every mood and outfit and they leave your lips feeling smooth and hydrated!</li>
            <li> I love every color.</li>
            <li> Ok they were alright</li>
            <li> My bf bought me this lipsticks and I absolutely love them .</li>
            <li> but when I picked them up most of them fell out</li>
            <li> more wonderful&lt;br /&gt;Product</li>
            <li> and I got many duplicates.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even layered them to create a custom shade I really love :)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the reds and pinks in the photo, the colours I got were more orange, pinks, and creams than anything.</li>
            <li> but because there are so many it is not a problem.</li>
            <li> so I would say the quality is better than drugstore brand that is comparable price.</li>
            <li> Something anyone would love :)</li>
            <li> I just got my package and I am in love ðwith the product shany</li>
            <li> I love all the make up</li>
            <li> absolutely  love this line</li>
            <li> The box was packaged appropriately and nothing inside was damaged.  </li>
            <li> I will say that I love all the colors.</li>
            <li> However, Im ok with that</li>
            <li> She love fixing herself up.  </li>
            <li> Drugstore make up doesn&#x27;t even come that cheap!</li>
            <li> The colors last all day and have a beautiful finish!</li>
            <li> The lipsticks fall apart when you take the top off.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> Some, of course, I love better than others because of the color payoff.  </li>
            <li> would recommend this as a gift to someone, or yourself:)</li>
            <li> These lipsticks are nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I wanted more reds when I ordered this</li>
            <li> If you prefer light and shine this is just the item you are looking for!</li>
            <li> These lipsticks go on more like a lip gloss.</li>
            <li> I def won&#x27;t be purchasing any more lipsticks from this company.</li>
            <li> Colors are versatile and could be worn by many.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> The colors are lovely and the lipstick is creamy.  </li>
            <li> Bottom line is that these are wonderful lipsticks, most especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Like everyone says when shipping the lipstick will smoosh against the top of the cap of the lipstick tube.</li>
            <li> Except theres a dent on the top of the lipstick which with use will go away.</li>
            <li> Its okay for yourself but not a gift for others just because of that shipping problem.</li>
            <li> Do not waist your time all 12 lipsticks were melted to the top of the lids</li>
            <li> 2 were smudged at the top of the lipstick, and  MOST were in the cap.</li>
            <li> These are okay-</li>
            <li> I am glad I purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> I figured perhaps the box could have been more cushioned, or that they were exposed to heat somehow during transit.</li>
            <li> I will be a repeat customer! :)</li>
            <li> I love all the colors.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive this because ive been looking for a set of pinks and reds in lipsticks.</li>
            <li> These colors are so nice and do much useful !</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re smooth and pretty, the colors are great.</li>
            <li> I love to try different lipsticks, these are just great!With 12 Beautiful colors, you have many to choose from, and they have great pigmentation and are very moisturizing!</li>
            <li> Great lipstick very pigmented, creamy, and easy to apply I am highly satisfied with this purchase and do recommend to any lipstick lover</li>
            <li> These lipsticks are a great value particularly when compared with luxury brands of make up.</li>
            <li> But I would rather if colors were more strong, more pigmented.</li>
            <li> They go on smooth and easy!</li>
            <li> They are super pigmented and have a nice scent.</li>
            <li> I opened each one individually, and they are beautifully colored and look nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I am super excited to use these lipsticks more! :)</li>
            <li> after a couple of applications it applies a bit more smoothly.</li>
            <li> The set comes with some wonderful colors, I wide array of reds &amp; pinks.  </li>
            <li> I was extremly happy when i recieved my SHANY Slick &amp; Shine Lipstick Set, GREAT shipping &amp; handling.</li>
            <li> They seem fairly cheaply made and most of them had fallen out of the bottom of the tube when I received them.</li>
            <li> Mine were in perfect condition when they came, they are very pigmented and great for everyday use.</li>
            <li> The lipstick isn&#x27;t securely attached to the applicator so most of mine were stuck to the lid.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It stays on for a while and doesn&#x27;t wipe right off (which is nice).</li>
            <li> These are very smooth, satiny/shining finish to them, and come in a good variety (pure orange, classic red, purple tones and even a perfect nude for my skin tone!)</li>
            <li> I love the different colors they are great for traveling</li>
            <li> The light pink one works best for me.</li>
            <li> for the price they are a great bargain, but the quality of the lipstick is only ok.</li>
            <li> , just wish it didnt rub of so easily</li>
            <li> I really liked the colours, there are only 2 that I wouldn&#x27;t wear with my fair skin.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> nothing special.. save your money and spend more on quality not quantity.</li>
            <li> .they are such beautiful shades only if they got it right ,it would av been perfect.</li>
            <li> great colors pigmented and very slick great buy</li>
            <li> then, this is a good buy, especially since it applies on smoothly and feels nice on the lips.</li>
            <li> Of course not all of them work with me personally, but they&#x27;re all beautiful.</li>
            <li> Overall they were quite beautiful.</li>
            <li> but the colors are pretty and transfer quite nice.</li>
            <li> Colors are not as  true asthe picture, but l still love them.</li>
            <li> Wear this with a pair of hot heels and a nice bag from ShoeDazzle or Just Fab.</li>
            <li> However, you have to apply more than one coat to get the full color.</li>
            <li> All the different colors are beautiful</li>
            <li> I made sure to get a full refund</li>
            <li> lipsticks themselves are very pretty in addition to transfers to the lips very smoothly.</li>
            <li> The lipstick isn&#x27;t as smooth and easy to apply as I would like.</li>
            <li> these were fine.</li>
            <li> They were bold!</li>
            <li> The packaging is super sleek too!</li>
            <li> Super Dissapointed!</li>
            <li> The color label on each tube really isn&#x27;t accurate to the color of lipstick.  </li>
            <li> so yes i am happy with with the overall experience.</li>
            <li> I think the problem might be with the formula which, while making the lipstick feel smooth, makes the lipstick easier to damage with almost no effort.</li>
            <li> The lipstick goes on smooth and has just the slightest shimmer in the lighter colors.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Application is smooth and velvety</li>
            <li> Just fantastic.</li>
            <li> AND they were of such great quality.  </li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t transparent or cheap.</li>
            <li> This lipstick slides on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> It applies smoothly and the colors lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li> they are cheaper and with free shipping and samples with orders over $50.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Lipstick goes on smoothly, stays on well (not extended wear).  </li>
            <li> There were around 4 that were too warm/peach toned and some that were too light.  </li>
            <li> However, they feel fairly smooth and moisturizing, not tacky.</li>
            <li> Look cheap &amp; flimsy.</li>
            <li> They are cheap too.</li>
            <li> and they go on so smooth.</li>
            <li> I thought these lipsticks were going to be cheap</li>
            <li> I am definitely a shany-holic lol.</li>
            <li> Cheap</li>

            <li> I suppose this is what I get for buying cheap lipsticks in bulk, but they serve their purpose</li>
            <li> The lipsticks are so smooth and glide on effortlessly.</li>
            <li> Colors seemed to go on smooth on my finger, but these were meant to be a gift and it would have been embarrassing.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect anything mush as it cheap</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally worth it. :)</li>
            <li> All of the lipsticks are so smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> , I smile and tell him it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li> it.it felt like i had some cheap groundnutoil or baby oil on my lips.if</li>
            <li> Too Cheap of a price means Cheap Product.</li>
            <li> Being lipstick, I would plan to have them delivered when you are available to pick up or to your office to avoid melting in the</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and lasts.</li>
            <li> Even the colors that I thought wouldn&#x27;t look good on me far exceeded my expectations.</li>

            <li> The colors are everyday use ,nice on lips beautiful look although my first time using the product</li>

            <li> I was so excited when I tried them on.</li>
            <li> I am in love with the whole set!</li>
            <li> I think the lipsticks are pretty decent still and good for what I wanted which was to try out a variety of colors.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for good lipstick for cheap just to have a variety to choose from, this is definitely for you.</li>
            <li> They go on really smooth and are very creamy :)</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time and the color stays true and the shine is great.</li>
            <li> I feel most of the other reviews are people expecting something too good for the price they are paying</li>
            <li> The quality is great, really creamy and doesn&#x27;t dry out your lips the way that most lipsticks do.</li>
            <li> #3 - it matches my natural lip color PERFECTLY, but maybe just a little better.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t include a bright red as I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> The lipstick is very creamy not that pigmented but lovely spring lipstick  </li>
            <li> But once you try them on, they actually look good.</li>
            <li> There was one color in the whole box that looked okay on.  </li>
            <li> Good variety of color/, only tossed one--kept the remaining eleven!</li>
            <li> one cap was already off when it was shipped and the colors were not the same but its good lipstick</li>
            <li> Simply place them or the melted one in the fridge for about an hour and your good to go.</li>
            <li> There are so many colors and they are very pigmented.</li>
            <li> True to their words &amp;#34;Slick &amp; Shine&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It was possible good shopping you used to gift</li>
            <li> colors are cool.</li>
            <li> Thank u love it so much</li>
            <li> My fav is the Orange No 01, and always thought orange was an absolute no for me, I am extremly satisfied</li>
            <li> and I order 24 pieces and out of that only 2 were not in good shape.</li>
            <li> You get 12 shades of mostly cool colors.</li>
            <li> She ended up giving me most of them because she doesn&#x27;t wear lipstick very often.</li>
            <li> This is a good product if you need lots of colors quick and cant afford to buy each individually at wal-greens or what not.</li>
            <li> is pretty easy.</li>
            <li> They went on smoothly and were rich and creamy and the colors were exactly like the color of the lipstick or what the label shows.  </li>
            <li> The color is so rich and it is really worth the price.</li>
            <li> Purchased to have more color options outside the bright reds and nudes I normally purchase.</li>
            <li> Excellent all the primary colors are there.&lt;br /&gt;Creamy and long last lipsticks.</li>
            <li> I was excited and opend the box up to check out my new lipsticks and was extremely satisfied with the quality of the product just looking at it.  </li>
            <li> The package also came quickly.  </li>
            <li> Also please note that most colors are peach/brown not these vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> Overall great product and very moisturizing</li>
            <li> I can say it arrived quick in two days ð</li>
            <li> Probably because there was high expectation from this product even though the latest review mentioned it arrived defective.  </li>
            <li> Now all I need to get myself is a cute little way to carry my 3 or 4 favorite colors. :)</li>
            <li> the colors were very pretty</li>
            <li> Very reasonable!</li>
            <li> 12 colors makes it easy to choose to match with certain looks.</li>
            <li> Colors are true to the sticker on the bottom and great colors, even if some were too dark for me!</li>
            <li> If you want something better you can look for something is sephora or mac but for a new price level.</li>
            <li> What a lovely new product.  </li>
            <li> With 12 colors to choose from, you get a little bit of everything and some great dupes of your favorite high end products.</li>
            <li> The color is long lasting and looks great!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of the price is so cheap and positive review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try and find red lipstick from this company, because it was some seriously outstanding quality!</li>
            <li> AND THEY ARE VERY PIGMENTED!!</li>
            <li> Thank you Shany, I will be back to order more when needed!</li>
            <li> the cap tend come off easily but overall it was an ok product.</li>
            <li> Each color has good pigmentation for everyday, easy wear.</li>
            <li> Product was very good but instead of 12 lipsticks there were only ten in the package.</li>
            <li> I like this lipstick great color choices and it feels silky smooth and last for several hours.</li>
            <li> They came fast the color lasts gose on smooth and</li>
            <li> The colors are very different from the picture, but all of the colors are more accurately described in the description.</li>
            <li> the deep violet color looks amazing.</li>
            <li> Not the same colors as shown but some colors are nice..</li>
            <li> Ive been able to pull up a smokey eye, soft evening, and</li>
            <li> Is it worth the money?</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I bought the set for $12 and it is worth keeping for that price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the pros are worth it.</li>
            <li> I rarely if ever wear corral colors.  </li>
            <li> I still think it was worth the price.</li>
            <li> They are really pigmented and last a fair amount of time which is something I expect for the price.</li>
            <li> Worth the price, fun to play with.</li>
            <li> I loved the reds and pink they are showing.</li>
            <li> My skin tone is a golden brown.</li>
            <li> These lipsticks are so fun to experiment with.</li>
            <li> -- it must depend on shipping and handling, and hopefully this is a rare issue.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the deal, but 4 lipsticks were stuck in top lid, completely damaged, and 3 others</li>
            <li> Get your moneys worth elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Overall Ä± liked them..</li>
            <li> and I use them for fun.</li>
            <li> Set of 12 lipstics for 20$s is totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> This product is just as described, and definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> The ingredients and color of these lipsticks are worth what you pay.</li>
            <li> guess i read the reviews and decided to give it a try,but it wasnt worth</li>
            <li> The lipsticks are vibrant and wild colors i love it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as a gift for my mom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially decided to purchase this brand due to the pricing, but I found out afterwards that it is a wonderful product.  </li>
            <li> other then that the colors are nice n smooth.</li>
            <li> I know right</li>
            <li> The price was right.</li>
            <li> They just fall right out of the tubes.</li>
            <li> , however there are about 5 that I can never use and will probably give to someone with the right coloring to use.  </li>
            <li> I think they give the right amount of color for me</li>
            <li> And most of these colours are better for lighter skin tones than dark.</li>
            <li> The lipsticks are very creamy,the colors are beautiful, it goes on smooth, it&#x27;s long lasting and it goes with</li>
            <li> If you want a moderately to highly pigmented lipstick that goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I truly expected a wider range in the difference of color most of them are similar and not as bright as they appear online.</li>
            <li> I had absolutely no problems with this product, and I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Beautiful long lasting color.</li>
            <li> Overall I really like the lipstick set and all the colors are really nice</li>
            <li> This lipstick set is great value for money and would have gotten a fourth star if the colors were not so similar.</li>
            <li> These are the easy to wear, apply without a mirror, natural lipsticks.</li>
            <li> I got it on black Friday for a pretty good price.  </li>
            <li> beautiful shades but half of the bullets were broke in the tubes and fell out as soon as I opened them, may have just been an old set.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast though.</li>
            <li> The colors are totally different than what is labeled and don&#x27;t feel very smooth when applied.</li>
            <li> It came as a normal clean box ..</li>
            <li> This is obviously not a super high quality brand, however the quality is still very nice.  </li>
            <li> After the second time theyre really nice and vibrant.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t rub off the first time you take a bite of a sandwhich</li>
            <li> I love the different colors and the packaging.</li>
            <li> These colors are pretty.</li>
            <li> Then there was only one that was stuck to the top</li>
            <li> Maybe it was because of the shipping they were placed in hot conditions</li>
            <li> and my husband loves when I do my make up and add the red lip stick on :}</li>
            <li> Very creamy!</li>
            <li> I will buy again, but I will contact the seller first to see what colors come with it.</li>
            <li> this is her first set of lipstick I&#x27;am glade that I was there to share in that moment ,</li>
            <li> but the colors were pretty</li>
            <li> I only gave this product one star because all the lipsticks were stuck in the top of the tubes.</li>
            <li> quality, these cosmetics do not work the first day of use and some do not paint descoronaron me</li>
            <li> Make sure when you open lipstick cover, its on up side direction orelse lipstick will come out.</li>
            <li> But overall it is okay.</li>
            <li> Most of the colors are the same.</li>
            <li> it looked nice in the picture but not really in person.</li>
            <li> The colors are so pretty</li>
            <li> $19 for 12 different color lipstick is cheap !</li>
            <li> The only issue is the closing of the stick that lays over the top of the case.  </li>
            <li> That soft, barely touching it glide left a smooth line of the color.</li>
            <li> but you can&#x27;t really tell !</li>
            <li> was very disjointed!</li>
            <li> Colors are great and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used this brand</li>
            <li> I love all the colors -- there&#x27;s only 1 out of 12 that doesn&#x27;t seem like it would work with my skin tone</li>
            <li> Pretty colors.</li>
            <li> Overall, they are okay.</li>
            <li> The temperature is most likely the cause for the sticks to fall out when arrived.</li>
            <li> I would really like a refund!</li>
            <li> The colors are really pretty..</li>
            <li> The first tube I opened the lip stick came flying out and landed on the floor.</li>
            <li> Also, all the colors matched almost exactly as the shades on the bottom stickers indicated.</li>
            <li> the actual lipstick part was stuck in the top</li>
            <li> .. they need to come up with a light skin and dark skin collection because now I&#x27;m stuck with seven lipsticks that I won&#x27;t be able to</li>
            <li> ae really pretty and the price was reasoable.</li>
            <li> Love the colors all of them last forever while on the lips</li>
            <li> Like most lipsticks, the color tab doesn&#x27;t match exactly with the actual lipstick color</li>
            <li> I borrowed one from her one day and she had to ask me more than once to get it back.</li>
            <li> I had higher hopes for this</li>
            <li> The only downside is that most of the colours didn&#x27;t match my skin tone.</li>
            <li> However, that lipstick also kind of fell onto its cap and got crushed.</li>
            <li> Worked for exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> You get 12 GREAT lipsticks for 25.00 that mean you&#x27;re paying 2.03 per lipstick.</li>
            <li> pretty positive you&#x27;ll become a returning SHANY customer.</li>
            <li> I would say overall the low price makes these a pretty good buy.</li>
            <li> The box is full of dust and dark stains, there was lipstick smudged on the lipsticks to top it off.</li>
            <li> Took a while to receive, and I&#x27;m actually quite displease with the fact that in the pictures posted, it shows a good array of red colors.</li>
            <li> they pretty much just take up room in my makeup box at this point.</li>
            <li> Most of mine came broke and don&#x27;t stay on long they also smudge.</li>
            <li> When I first ordered these I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li> hot sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are varied and not as intense as the image.</li>
            <li> The colors are all very bright and vibrant, and only a few would have went with my olive skin/ brunette tones.  </li>
            <li> - And some of them arrived with the lipstick popped out of the bullet, but that&#x27;s easy enough to fix.</li>
            <li> The black lipstick cases are nice also.</li>
            <li> The color swatches don&#x27;t match the actual color of lipstick, they come off easy</li>
            <li> If you tap strongly on the tops the stick will unstick and go back in place.</li>
            <li> Every single tube of lipstick was smashed in the top lid and the stick had fallen out.</li>
            <li> The were all very pale shades that I can&#x27;t imagine they would look good on anyone except a ghost.  </li>
            <li> Most of the colors of the lipsticks are great but half of them were either broken or literally fell right out of the tube when I first tried to use them...</li>
            <li> However, I was super shocked by the incredible colors that did come!</li>
            <li> I was able to release it and press it down to stick in the right place.  </li>
            <li> Not a single one was in good shape one of them was broken and the rest of them will all smashed on the top.  </li>
            <li> When I first ordered this set, I was excited because I thought that I would be getting some red lipstick!</li>
            <li> To my relief, as stated earlier, they were fine.</li>
            <li> The color lasts and is so vibrant!</li>
            <li> The main reason why I purchased this set was because I thought there would be a lot of pretty reds, but there is none.</li>
            <li> None of the Lipsticks were broken or smashed,Giving as gift so very pleased!</li>
            <li> The colors that come in this pack are so vibrant, and sexy, and it lasts a long while  .</li>
            <li> I love EVERY SINGLE color!</li>
            <li> I love every single color from this lipstick set!</li>
            <li> color sticker on the bottom of the lipstick bullet doesn&#x27;t really match what&#x27;s in the tube</li>
            <li> most of us have lines above our upper lip that regular lipstick runs up the Crack unless it&#x27;s matte love the colors</li>
            <li> i really didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> So far it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> There very oily</li>
            <li> set arrived with no broken or damaged sticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Also, very creamy and non-drying.</li>
            <li> The tubes are cheap and the end pops off when you try to open the lipsticks.</li>
            <li> You do need to reapply these a bit throughout the day, but I don&#x27;t see that as too much of a problem.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> All very shiny - none are matte.</li>
            <li> say, they got here fast</li>
            <li> The lipstick blends well and lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Very soothing on my lips.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product really fast about 4 days time.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend getting these!</li>
            <li> The color is very pigmented.</li>
            <li> This product is really more than what I expected.  </li>
            <li> They go on smooth and seem to last well.</li>
            <li> 100 % honesty is always appreciated in business.</li>
            <li> The colors are much more pigmented than I expected.</li>
            <li> Not whaf i expected... could be better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m light brown skin and only two</li>
            <li> REALLY WELL</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing</li>
            <li> This Lipstick was very moisturizing to my lips.</li>
            <li> and yes the tip of them came as crashed but isn&#x27;t much of a problem..</li>
            <li> The colors also don&#x27;t really match the stickers on the bottom.</li>
            <li> Haha.</li>
            <li> Was rather dissatisfied with whole order.</li>
            <li> The colors of lipstick in the collection don&#x27;t really make much sense.</li>
            <li> the color stay on the whole time and</li>
            <li> As an extra bonus, they even moisturize your lips keeping them smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> The lipsticks however aren&#x27;t secure in the tube several of them fell out when opened.</li>
            <li> They were damaged the whole lipstick just fell out.</li>
            <li> i really dont know y</li>
            <li> dont even show ,and u have to keep applying before u see the real thing.well</li>
            <li> In brand stores, one lipstick can cost as much as $30</li>
            <li> so I am very upset with these product..</li>
            <li> I love the wide range of colors, the creaminess, and the box for storing the lipsticks.</li>
            <li> So much better than expected.</li>
            <li> I really like them and would recommend at this price for quality.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> it goes on very well  </li>
            <li> lipsticks were a very creamy and moist combination.</li>
            <li> Colors are nice too for everyday use.</li>
            <li> The only downfall was that 10 tubes of lipsticks were touching the top of the lids so every color was very slightly dented in.</li>
            <li> I thought that the lipsticks would be sheer but they are very colorful.</li>
            <li> the colors all go on smooth, and they seem to last decently well.  </li>
            <li> and I love the fact that I can read other customers reviews because it has impacted my purchasing.  </li>
            <li> There were about two other lipsticks that were smudged against the top of the lid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say they&#x27;re slightly better than Revlon or other drugstore lipsticks.</li>
            <li> As far as shipping time, the package arrived in a decent time frame.&lt;br /&gt;Going through each color, I noticed it took a little more effort to get the full color on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure why these have such great reviews...</li>
            <li> but I honestly didn&#x27;t care, the lipstick last long and looks good on me and for 12 different colors for less that 20$</li>
            <li> My lips usually dry, but these lipsticks are nice on my lips and they are low maintenance  </li>
            <li> The colors are amazing, highly pigmented, It last long</li>
            <li> The bright pink kind of looks weird on me but</li>
            <li> The lipsticks are full size and are complementary to different skin tones.</li>
            <li> the colors are beautiful unfortunately the lipstick was falling apart when opening it the color would fall off and stay in the cap....</li>
            <li> When i got the lipsticks they seem cool until you open it.</li>
            <li> The packaging is good the only thing was the tips on some were a little smudged</li>
            <li> I received this half lipsticks were stuck in the top of the lids.</li>
            <li> Most of the lipsticks in both of our orders arrived cracked in half.</li>
            <li> The products were smaller than I expected but the lipsticks were nice colors.</li>
            <li> I have lipsticks older than these and never have mold on it.</li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant and as they appear in the photograph.</li>
            <li> If you are fortunate enough to get a complete set undamaged, you&lt;br /&gt;will</li>
            <li> The colores are vibrant and the lipstick stays on well.</li>
            <li> I do love several of these colors, but especially color</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall they&#x27;re decent for the price you get for 12 assorted lipsticks.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I am an African American woman and love the options.</li>
            <li> THERE ARE NO RED LIPSTICKS IN THIS SET which I was a tad upset about that seeing as the picture makes them look more red, but this set does come with nudes, oranges, pinks, and plums.</li>
            <li> I did not let them sit outside either I made sure to get them inside as soon as they arived because I thought that might happen after reading all theses coments with the same story as me.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive lips and wearing lipstick too much always drys my lips out</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for these considering the decent reviews.</li>
            <li> this are rich and creamy.last long</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li> When I bought it I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The quality of the lipsticks is high end.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find them to be highly pigmented as others have said</li>
            <li> I was expecting the colors to be a little richer, but they are more on the translucent side.</li>
            <li> do not waste your money!!</li>
            <li> There was little to no color pigment with most colors.</li>
            <li> WoW!!</li>
            <li> I would prefer a more textured lipstick that would stay on your lips a little longer.</li>
            <li> They are really moist and shinny without being sparkly or shimmer, can be worn by themselves or add some gloss on top for a more dramatic, voluminous effect, no fragrance at all , and there is not enough I can say about this set.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t turn them upside down! :)</li>
            <li> but they are absolutely beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;Second, when I opened the Amazon box, the box of lipstick was completely ripped apart where it&#x27;s supposed to be together.</li>
            <li> but I expected them to have a deeper pigmentation, as they apply on quite lightly.</li>
            <li> I bought two as gifts, after opening it I kept one for myself, absolutely adorable colors and long lasting.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money I&#x27;m gonna make sure Shany cosmetics know about this.</li>
            <li> Pretty disapointed I was really looking foward to giving them as a present for christmas.</li>
            <li> I love the colors of these lipsticks but the wearing does not last long.</li>
            <li> Also, not a huge fan of most of the colors in the set</li>
            <li> I opened the box to make sure all of the lipsticks were there and were in acceptable condition, and half of the lipsticks had come out of the container and had smushed against the lid before I even opened them!</li>
            <li> Ranges from very light pink to coral to deep plum.</li>
            <li> I tried out the brightest shade and the color stayed vibrant and pretty for several hours even through eating and</li>
            <li> colors are very pretty, creamy, and long wearing</li>
            <li> I am fairly new to wearing lipsticks</li>
            <li> I can mix my lipsticks to make new colors.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> Colour only a few looks nice to me.</li>
            <li> Though a couple were melted and damaged during shipping:( I must say beautiful colors, wears so soft and very pigmented.its outcome from what I expected for the price was beyond expectations:)</li>
            <li> Glad to have such a wide selection of colors</li>
            <li> I was very surprised.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife &amp; she tells me she likes the different colors very much.</li>
            <li> The one that had a hot pink sticker was more of a purple/fuchsia and the one that looked plum on the outside was actually red.</li>
            <li> Also be careful, the lip color will fall right out of the tube!</li>
            <li> Some of the colors are very similar but they&#x27;re all unique in their different ways.</li>
            <li> And I got like four or five of them that look exactly the same color...  </li>
            <li> When they came I had to manually put the lipsticks back in their containers but that was probably because of the shipping process, it&#x27;s kinda hot here in Florida also.</li>
            <li> THEY CAME COMPLETELY MELTED!</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty (most, the orange is pretty orange and nude is weird) and stay on well after food and stuff.</li>
            <li> i do wish that i didnt have the same problem as other people, which was that the lipstick is broken..or stuck at the top.</li>
            <li> It came with two plum colors, two mauve colors, two nude colors, four bright pink and four light pink, Three of them i had to press back down in the case.</li>
            <li> They went on so smooth and last all day long.</li>
            <li> the lipsticks are smooth, not gooey and long lasting.</li>
            <li> The lipsticks are smooth to apply &amp; surprisingly long lasting.</li>
            <li> and I had to push them back down by touching the sides, but i didn&#x27;t leave dents.</li>
            <li> The only problem I had with them is that they should of put the labels of color on the top instead of the bottom because I turned them upside down</li>
            <li> The price is worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend getting this set because you will be wasting money purchasing a single tube of lipstick from the store.</li>
            <li> huge mess...</li>
            <li> I like the product, however, the lipstick remained stuck at the opposite end of the tube, causing many of them to crack in half.  </li>
            <li> Has a slight shine and is very pigmented and definitely worth $20 ð</li>
            <li> last longer than others.&lt;br /&gt;They are really smooth and don&#x27;t dry out my lips.</li>
            <li> and I believe Japonesque has a few, but there are some lower ended ones that are just fine as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> its color is not good at all, most of them look like for older people.&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
            <li> I bought these lipsticks due to the large selection for the price and all of the positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A must have for those who love to play as hard as they work.....</li>
            <li> The case top sort of makes it hard to close at times.</li>
            <li> unlike many other lipsticks out there, these feel so moist and don&#x27;t dry out your lips after wearing it all day.</li>
            <li> Was supposed to be a gift, but that clearly isn&#x27;t going to happen.</li>
            <li> Packaging is a flexible, mostly clear plastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pigmented and there&#x27;s several colors to choose from.</li>
            <li> I have been busy and forgot about them</li>
            <li> where near the color sticker on the bottom of the tube.&lt;br /&gt;None</li>
            <li> once opened, nearly all the lipsticks had come out of their socked.</li>
            <li> but I had to share my input because I&#x27;ve become a frequent Amazon shopper now</li>
            <li> If I see too many negative reviews I avoid the product.</li>
            <li> so I decided to purchase this VERY affordable set just to play around with the variety of different shades.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast but it really only has 4 colors</li>
            <li> do not waste your time or money  </li>
            <li> , please do not waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> The colors are a bit matte but that is easily fixed by adding a clear gloss over the lipstick.  </li>
            <li> Each lipstick completely fell out of the tube when I went to look at them.  </li>
            <li> old fashioned scented&lt;br /&gt;Feels</li>
            <li> I really wanted to returm it actually.</li>
            <li> idk, maybe some of the reviews are really young.</li>
            <li> Something for everyone and ever outfit, I kept the packaging for storage, it makes it much easier to find them, and experiment with a different color</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint with these lipsticks is the fact that wen I opened most of them the lipstick stuck to the cap.</li>
            <li> the lipsticks are very greasy and need to be applied numerous times.</li>
            <li> Everyday her lips are a different color which is pretty cool</li>
            <li> Although they last lomger than most afforadble lipsticks tou may have to reapply after a  few hours.</li>
            <li> I got them on a gold box special for less than $1</li>
            <li> They last a long time, and are super moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> (super creamy) and lasts long enough!</li>
            <li> Also if you&#x27;re a fan of pink, purple, and beige lipsticks, this is the right thing for you.</li>
            <li> Over all very pretty colors and long lasting!</li>
            <li> Also fair warning, if the box (Or actual tube) is ever left upside down, the next time you open it</li>
            <li> Out of all 12, only 2 didn&#x27;t suit me but the major complaint was after applying, the lipstick would seem to clump on lips, kind of grainy.</li>
            <li> First of all, the box the lipsticks came in was entirely busted open.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way! :)</li>
            <li> So careful upon opening and make sure you push the lip color down into the tube.  </li>
            <li> The other colors wasnt right.</li>
            <li> It was an easy enough fix to push the lipstick firmly against the grips at the bottom.  </li>
            <li> This was a gift for my granddaughter who was very pleased she sad</li>
            <li> First, they&#x27;re not very close to the lipsticks in the picture.</li>
            <li> When I received them I had low expectations, but was shocked when I saw the first few lipsticks were in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> I do not know why they were sent that way, but of course as I paying customer I am very disappointed and would not recommend this purchase unless you happen to get more lucky than me and the lip sticks come fine....</li>
            <li> The colors and very light and doesn&#x27;t should up, just a little shine, that doesn&#x27;t last long!</li>
            <li> The lipsticks are very creamy, they don&#x27;t leave your lips dry</li>
            <li> Some came broken but overall a nice collection.</li>
            <li> Keep a few for yourself and give a few away, they make a nice gift to a friend.</li>
            <li> The colors were different than the picture, and several of the colors looked the exact same to me.</li>
            <li> The lipsticks are NOT crushed, it is possible to GENTLY remove them from inside of the lid and place them back in the tube casing.</li>
            <li> colors were really pretty but other than that i am never ordering from them</li>
            <li> My main concern is the fact that many of the lipsticks were damaged as if someone had twisted the lipsticks up while the caps were still on.</li>
            <li> Two or three of them completely fell out of their casing when I opened them to look at the colors, and there are a couple that look like the only thing keeping them in the casing</li>
            <li> The picture showed red colors and there was only one red in the whole box.</li>
            <li> your natural lips just happen to be red.</li>
            <li> Its not an expensive quality so you&#x27;ll have to apply it more often then normal but can&#x27;t beat</li>
            <li> Most of them were broken....</li>
            <li> Most of the lipsticks were broken when I opened the tubes upon receiving the delivery.  </li>
            <li> One broken and the rest smudge on the top.</li>
            <li> Every lipstick came broken all the lip stick stuck in the top of the lid...</li>
            <li> All lipstick was broken and stuck to top of lid</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t get all the colors in the picuture and most of the ones i received were broken.</li>
            <li> most of them is broken.</li>
            <li> not one was melted or broken like most reviews</li>
            <li> Even the ones that didn&#x27;t come broken started falling out and got stuck at the top of the cap.</li>
            <li> Colors came broken, and stuck inside of the top cap.</li>
            <li> I gave away the other half to friends who liked the other colors.</li>
            <li> I love lipsticks and trying new colors but sadly, this purchase was a bust.  </li>
            <li> The lipsticks no longer look new and I&#x27;m debating whether or not I should actually give this as a present anymore.</li>
            <li> The swatch colors on the bottom of each lip stick aren&#x27;t accurate at all to the color of the lipstick and half of the colors aren&#x27;t close to pink or red.</li>
            <li> And then open the tube gingerly and softly push the stick back in place and its like it never happened.</li>
            <li> : Most of the lipsticks have now broken within three weeks, even after only using them once or twice</li>
            <li> That said, the price is right even if you only end up using half of them!</li>
            <li> Messy, not long lasting, doesn&#x27;t have the real colors as marked</li>
            <li> waste of money  3 of the lipsticks have already fallen out of the tube upon first use.  </li>
            <li> The colours are less red than they seem in the picture (with all 12 lipsticks beside each other) - they&#x27;re more neutral or pink with a couple of almost purples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are soft to the lips and don&#x27;t dry them out.  </li>
            <li> I like this product, not so much for the coverage, because it is not a true lipstick, I would consider it as a lip gloss.</li>
            <li> Not long lasting at all.</li>
            <li> Lipstick is a very creamy consistency and goes on looking very natural, not junky &amp; thick at all.</li>
            <li> I have a really hard time with lipstick - between the multiple cups of coffee I inhale during the morning or the chapped lips I have during the winter, I rarely even bother.  </li>
            <li> It shipped quicker than told and was nicely packaged with nothing broken or missing.</li>
            <li> This product was good.the down fall was that half of the lipsicks were melted to the top of the cap,not sure if is from bad shipment or just the product it self.  </li>
            <li> After seeing other reviews..... I was very sceptical about purchasing this product but, I closed my eyes and did so anyways.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased other Shany products that I love but this set seemed to be poorly made.</li>
            <li> because it&#x27;s cold outside so they were sort of frozen, but who in their right mind would order lipstick through the mail when it&#x27;s hot outside?</li>
            <li> more than half of the lipsticks were broken.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The colors are long lasting without drying out my lips.</li>
            <li> These lipsticks tend to bleed and do not last long.</li>
            <li> and they last a long time.</li>
            <li> It last long</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t seem to be that long lasting and</li>
            <li> It also makes for long lasting wear!</li>
            <li> I know this will last me a long time and all of the lipsticks set well with my brown skin complexion.</li>
            <li> They last a long time since they moisturize and don&#x27;t rub off when smooching your man.</li>
            <li> If you live in a hot climate, the inside of delivery vehicles are going to be even hotter than the temperature outside, which of course will melt make up-- Either that or your handlers are careless.</li>
            <li> my hot office look (if you knw what I mean ;&gt; )using this selection  </li>
            <li> VERY LONG LASTING AND MOISTURIZING!!</li>
            <li> Lackluster colors, dry, and have to apply several times.</li>
            <li> You are bound to find a shade of pink or red to definitely match with your complexion!</li>
            <li> Got them, some were broken had to scrap them out of the cover (top lid) was messy doing that process.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and not a stick broken, nothing smudged or chipped  </li>
            <li> and that single one was  red...  </li>
            <li> its pretty oily and doesnt look very smoother when it is on but from far away doesnt look so bad.</li>
            <li> But unfortunately I was only able to test a few out because when I received them more than half of the lipsticks were broken off and stuck in the cap</li>
            <li> I gave it a four star, because as some mentioned I found several that were loose in the tube.  </li>
            <li> Also, the boxes were left outside by my front door and it was pouring rain, the box was wet and somewhat crushed.  </li>
            <li> There is a wide variety of colors but only for the price of 25 dolllars.  </li>
            <li> The tips are smashed into the stop of the cap because the lipstick is to long for the tube its in.</li>
            <li> but Shany&#x27;s lipstick is long wearing, moisturizing and valuable with the price.  </li>
            <li> He asks me when I wear it how I get it to stay on for so long</li>
            <li> I especially like the pink lipsticks and the orange-y shade too.</li>
            <li> It seems from other reviews that this is a pretty common experience.  </li>
            <li> The fuchsia one went on decently well, but worse than my wet n wild lipstick I bought from the drugstore.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lipstick will still twist up and down when you do this, BUT turning them upside down would most likely make them fall out or stick to the inside of the lid again and that of course makes it rather difficult to carry in your purse, these are the reasons that I could not give this product 5</li>
            <li> I purchased this item through the actual Shany website due to the reviews about them being shipped improperly.</li>
            <li> Earlier than expected too !</li>
            <li> Since several other reviewers said their set arrived damaged</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is that the colors are pastel reds thought that would come because so requests, they are most of all glitter</li>
            <li> Some of the lipsticks were dry.</li>
            <li> Is make my lip dry out and smell.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my lips out</li>
            <li> A few months later, I left one of the tubes in my purse.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a highly pigmented and thick lipstick, these are not for you.</li>
            <li> every single one of the colors fell of the tubes when you opened them.</li>
            <li> single.</li>
            <li> i opened every single one, and 10 out of 12 were stuck..</li>
            <li> However, when I opened the first lipstick it was broken.  </li>
            <li> I was able to hit them all back into the base though from the outside.</li>
            <li> So technically, its not 12 that you&#x27;re getting if 7 are melted down before you even get it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be discouraged if during your first application the color comes on roughly and poorly..</li>
            <li> The only thing I can ask for, is even longer lasting, but then that changes the texture usually...</li>
            <li> It balled up and turned into an even bigger mess.  </li>
            <li> they are not true to the actual color.</li>
            <li> Not true red at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only negative was that they came all smooshed on the tops, but luckily none was broken.</li>
            <li> it look good in the picture but in personal i am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I got the same colors repeated plus they come off the little lipstick thingy</li>
            <li> You get 12 lipsticks for one low price which makes it a little one one dollar a piece that is a steal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only negative thing is that the shade colors on the end of the tube isn&#x27;t close to what the real colors are, so is hard to find the color you want to wear.</li>
            <li> Different shades of pink and red - hardly any browns or plums.</li>
            <li> well it ok ,, nt that bad,,,</li>
            <li> I knew that there were so many bad reviews about this, but I bought it anyway.</li>
            <li> Glad I purchased despite some bad reviews.</li>
            <li> and I had to go over a few times to get total coverage.</li>
            <li> A few of them were smashed when they arrived, so I ended up sending it back.</li>
            <li> I received the package and opened some of the lipsticks to use them and they were just empty tubes.</li>
            <li> Matte., wasn&#x27;t what I expected and got my finds returned after I returned the product.</li>
            <li> expected some dysfunction given the price of the set itself.</li>
            <li> I would recommend buying an empty palette to place the lipsticks instead of opening the tube and having it fall out.</li>
            <li> so I never really like using lipstick</li>
            <li> Lipsticks smelled and were colors that absolutely no one would wear.</li>
            <li> but I managed to firmly put it back in place.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lighter than expected</li>
            <li> Everything I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> I can pull off a pink lip or a nude lip.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much variety in the colors.</li>
            <li> The labels are mixed and some missing.</li>
            <li> wasnt broken or anything like that got here fast</li>
            <li> I have to open them one by one and kinda push down the wax sticks to stay in the little tube.</li>
            <li> and i wouldnt be embarrased was just to push them back into their position and push down a little so they would stick to the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I expected a lot of reds, but the colors I received are very pink and nude-</li>
            <li> I opened them at work in front of some other employees and they will not be buying these either.</li>
            <li> In comparison to other brands I can find on my city, I prefer Shany&#x27;s!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Such a waste!</li>
            <li> I usually use drugstore brands, occasionally ULTA brands or Avon, but I&#x27;m not picky.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other reviews though, my lipsticks came intact.  </li>
            <li> As other reviewers have stated, colors so not match the picture.  </li>
            <li> The packaging of these lipsticks is quite like the other reviewers had mentioned.</li>
            <li> My product came in a package with three other items I ordered and came</li>
            <li> I saw the other reviews about lipstick being everywhere and stuff..</li>
            <li> I purchase this and some other things , because i want to sell this products at my boutique  </li>
            <li> The colors are not exact to the stickers on bottom but they are close.</li>
            <li> I am now going to search for other Shany products</li>
            <li> There were not a ton of other items in the purse and the weather was not hot.</li>
            <li> and they had a strange smell about them, we ended up throwing them out, but since this could have happened in delivery time I rated half and half don&#x27;t want to put all the blame on the company</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not familiar with SHANY i would recommend you purchase a single tube of lipstick to start and try them out</li>
            <li> Shade colors on the end of the tube isn&#x27;t close to what the real colors are and a few were broken</li>
            <li> Almost half the lipsticks where squashed and stuck to the lids, and so I had to really carefully try to detach them with out damaging the lipstick.</li>
            <li> Some sticks were broken at the base but great selection of colors.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s very disappointing that I can&#x27;t use most of them because they were damaged.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The colors are bland, boring, like an old Crayola box&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would return, but it costs more to return....</li>
            <li> The product is nice, problem is - like other reviewers have said - several of the lipsticks arrived damaged/broken with the lipsticks broken from the base and stuck up inside the tube cover.</li>
            <li> The one that turned out to be red is like a hard plastic stick.</li>
            <li> absolutely nothing was wrong with it.</li>
            <li> AND SHE IS DARK SKIN</li>
            <li> It has no useful pigmentation.</li>
            <li> It was messy and the colors not according to what I had expected.</li>
            <li> A lot of the lipsticks were also falling out of the tubes, I&#x27;m surprised they weren&#x27;t broken, I would not buy this again</li>
            <li> They range from pale pink to coral.</li>
            <li> The box is worn down and the lipsticks themselves are detached from the container.</li>
            <li> The tops were smushed down</li>
            <li> but I think because they ship them upside down they fall out.</li>
            <li> but if you squeeze them down with your fingers there won&#x27;t be a problem</li>
            <li> I kept it upside down</li>
            <li> and I trust it to stay when I twist all the way down.</li>
            <li> but well, they came all the way to Mexico, and it&#x27;s not a big deal, I mean..</li>
            <li> I look forward to trying other Shany products!</li>
            <li> The only downfall is that I am not sure where to start!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter at Christmas  and every single lipstick was broken and they wouldn&#x27;t take it back...</li>
            <li> They are so firm, yet wet, it makes me want to wear it all the time!</li>
            <li> They arrived as per the scheduled delivery date, but I was not pleased with the shipment packaging because it was set loosely and 4 out of the 12 lipsticks were dislodged when I opened them.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be alarmed when you have some lipstick that&#x27;s slightly melted</li>
            <li> Thought that reading previous reviews would have changed my mind about purchasing this lipstick set,  should have listened.</li>
            <li> Half of the lipsticks tip smudge into the cover.</li>
            <li> as previous reviewers discussed...</li>
            <li> Overall, not a great buy, try other Shany products instead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving these four stars as though they arrived tightly packed in a box--</li>
            <li> Half a tank of gas down the gutter!</li>
            <li> It is still usable, but given that I was pretty careful with it, and that it had not been exposed to extreme conditions or heat, I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> lipsticks come out of their tube containers all the time making it messy and not worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> The colors were not rich and creamy.</li>
            <li> I remember my grandmother kissing me when I was little</li>
            <li> This product was a big waste of time and money,it has weird smell in it and it feels dry on your lips,I didn&#x27;t wanna spend time to return them in,thinking to just throw  them away maybe.</li>
            <li> waste of money.</li>
            <li> I just wasted my money, i would have returned them, but i had to leave  before i could.</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> Received the set and one third of the lipsticks were broken off in the lid.  </li>
            <li> There are a few I might keep because I  like the color of the lipstick but from now on I  buying my lipstick in person.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money to buy this product.</li>
            <li> My friends have even stolen a few from me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly light and some colors don&#x27;t go well with darker skinned people, but with this brand it goes well with my skin tones.</li>
            <li> Shany sent me their lipstick collection a few weeks ago, and I must say they are to die for.</li>
            <li> heavy / thick&lt;br /&gt;It smells,</li>
            <li> What a waste of my time, money and excitement.</li>
            <li> I bought this set as a Christmas present for a secret santa gift, and I have to say I&#x27;m displeased.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re buying this for yourself, I&#x27;d just be prepared that they are not securely packaged in the containers, so a lot of them will be smuged before you receive them.</li>
            <li> All of the tubes broken internally.</li>
            <li> Waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I bought this set a few years ago.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t feel like going through all the trouble to return it..</li>
            <li> i wasted my monney on this.i</li>
            <li> For everyday use, prefer over my Dior, YSL and Nars lipsticks.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind manually setting in a few of the lipsticks if they arrive dislodged, and the not-so-deep</li>
            <li> I could see that being annoying, luckily I&#x27;m pretty chill and as long as they&#x27;re usable</li>
            <li> so why not buy all these for a lot less per tube!  </li>
            <li> I had similar issues as reported by other shoppers with the lipsticks arriving damaged and falling out of the tube randomly.</li>
            <li> The colors are pale and look waxy like crayons.</li>
            <li> With that being said, serious damage was minimal.</li>
            <li> , it is hard to find anything critical or negative about it!</li>
            <li> Past this, they go on easily, I&#x27;ve never had any trouble with the cap coming off in my purse</li>
            <li> but every single one of the lipstick was broken and one out of the 12 was missing.  </li>
            <li> The lipstick doesn&#x27;t stay on lips long plus some were broken .</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s long wearing I will still with MAC to anyone who received this product without broken lipsticks luuuuucky you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cold this time of year where I live though, so that might contribute a lot to it.</li>
            <li> I think the bad reviews are being written by compeating more expensive makeup brands trying to throw salt.</li>
            <li> Most of the lipsticks arrived damaged/broken with the lipsticks broken from the base and stuck up inside the tube cover.</li>
            <li> Somedays when I feel like I just want a little oomph!</li>
            <li> The variety is a little strange, a few of the colors are weird so they would probably have to be layered</li>
            <li> I received the item and they were all every single one of them either broken or melted.  </li>
            <li> When I got them, every single lipstick was broken.  </li>
            <li> When I opened the box every single one of the lipsticks was broken or stuck in the tubes.</li>
            <li> I opened them EVERY single one was completely broken and melted to the lid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if its their product or the delivery process</li>
            <li> I am a pretty pick person and still decided not to return this, so that should say quiet a bit about the over all quality of the lipsticks!&lt;br /&gt;GREAT product with AWFUL packaging!</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> amazon is unbelievable  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, when I did get the package in the mail, there was no red.</li>
            <li> The only think about them is that it is difficult to truly see what color you have.  </li>
            <li> Checked the others, carefully opening, just a poor product all the way around.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not pleased with these...</li>
            <li> I just received this Slick &amp; Shine Lipstick set today.</li>
            <li> Not sure why some people have had issues.</li>
            <li> B005UL3LVY SHANY Slick &amp; Shine Lipstick</li>
            <li> Well Ill just keep this simple.</li>
            <li> so when I opened them they were all in the lids and to put them back into the base made a massive mess and wrecked the lipstick!</li>
            <li> Very bad, also it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li> Very disappointed as the colors were nice but they were not useable since they were 90% broken.</li>
            <li> I wonder if the other Shany products have poor quality.</li>
            <li> &gt; just tht some of the tips were broken and the stickers behind might confuse u until u open to see the colors.</li>
            <li> Cheap crap that was both broken and stuck to the lid.</li>
            <li> was a bit disappointed that I didn&#x27;t receive certain colors that were shown in the images for this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, not to mention it rubs off easy.</li>
            <li> When I got my lip stick half of them were broken</li>
            <li> I received it melted and half of them where broken.</li>
            <li> Came with horrible colors mostly pinks and weird reds too glossy not really worth the money</li>
            <li> It is hard to apply as it goes on opaque</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t like those 14 hours lipsticks, which give a lot of color stain, but are hard to put on.  </li>
            <li> But all product was stuck to each lid of the lipsticks had to tap the lids hard to knock the product out</li>
            <li> Not worth 20 bucks!!!</li>
            <li> Then it turned into a runny sloppy mess.  </li>
            <li> The least they could do was replace them.</li>
            <li> What I&#x27;m saying is, have common sense.</li>
            <li> This complaint as often as I&#x27;ve seen it can&#x27;t be coincidence.</li>
            <li> I have nothing negative to say about these lipsticks.  </li>
            <li> Even if you are afraid to try colored lipsticks these colors are \\&quot;subtle\\&quot; enough for you to wear.</li>
            <li> I opened at least four of the lipsticks,</li>
            <li> but there wasn&#x27;t the picture shows reds that was my only disappointment.</li>
            <li> And they dont even put the name of the color on the lipstick either they just numbered them...which also sucks.</li>
            <li> a few of them I got were broken.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item as a gift and when the box arrived the seal was broken and two lipsticks were missing</li>
            <li> Very poor quality, several of the lipsticks were broken</li>
            <li> I mean, for the price</li>
            <li> I mean it was delivered through mail.</li>
            <li> I mean they were still usable</li>
            <li> These are also unfortunately drying compared to other brands I use.</li>
            <li> They smell weird and are simply not pretty.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the other comments I was skeptical, but I decided I would take a chance.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my &#x27;number 7&#x27; is broken at the base, and &#x27;number 2&#x27; (which is not so unfortunate since I liked this colour least) won&#x27;t twist up whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Shany Cosmetics  shouldn&#x27;t keep selling this product because of  the bad reviews and their lipstick is apparently always chipped.  </li>
            <li> they were small, broken and not pigmented.</li>
            <li> As for everyone who keeps saying their lipsticks came in broken, well I&#x27;m not sure what to tell you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad, my skin tone will not go with nudes, browns and dark purple.</li>
            <li> I am very sad because it was gift for my friends because I am visiting outside USA in 24th november  </li>
            <li> I am not recommond to buy it, received with broken, all lipsticks were stick on the lids, bad quality and lip sticks were too old.  </li>
            <li> These lipsticks smell, they have a horrible consistency and the color wears off too quickly.</li>
            <li> None of mine were broken as others have complained about.</li>
            <li> Maybe I can donate them to a funeral home as no one alive would wear this crap.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed after reading the reviews and was convinced that after trying it, there was no way we could have all used the same products.</li>
            <li> She said the lipstick itself was very hard to put on.</li>
            <li> I encountered similar problem where the product arrived with broken lipsticks &#x3D;(.    </li>
            <li> What a waste of my money!!!</li>
            <li> The box this came in was rattling around the package, and I was a little afraid they would break.</li>
            <li> They all arrived broken</li>
            <li> They were broken and in the lids.</li>
            <li> lipsticks arrived broken.</li>
            <li> The tips were smashed and lipsticks broken when they arrived.  </li>
            <li> And the lipstick got on my teeth, not happy at all</li>
            <li> and they came all the way pushed up therefore the tip of the lipsticks were broken.</li>
            <li> Like worse than the dress-up make-up I used as a child.  </li>
            <li> They go on really thin like a gloss, the color seems to stick</li>
            <li> In fact I actually shook the package violently just to see if they would break.</li>
            <li> Not happy with the product.</li>
            <li> The lipsticks arrived all broken and smudged inside.</li>
            <li> When I got them I had to spend about 10 mins reattaching them because they were broken.</li>
            <li> Now although this was a bit annoying, it didn&#x27;t cause enough harm to make the lipsticks unusable.</li>
            <li> I received the product intacted, not melted nor broken.</li>
            <li> Very waxy and color pigmintation is awful.</li>
            <li> BUT every tube was broken and the lipstick was stuck in the tops.</li>
            <li> The inner lipstick hasn&#x27;t been attached well in the base, so it drops out any time you try to roll it up.</li>
            <li> Not one was broken.</li>
            <li> so I have that to her, however 4 of the lipsticks when I opened the package came broken.</li>
            <li> All but 3 were broken and in the cap still..</li>
            <li> One of the 3 that wasn&#x27;t broken looked like it had been used..</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> Some of my lipsticks came broken ...</li>
            <li> poor quality, already seperate from substrate when i received them</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t have the issues that some people seem to have had with the lipsticks being broken or misshapen</li>
            <li> When I opened thew package to swatch them two of the lipsticks were broken inside the tube.</li>
            <li> and they all arrived broken</li>
            <li> But I tried them all and some were broken.</li>
            <li> Lipsticks were broken and unusable.</li>
            <li> All of my lipsticks were broken.</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> One of the lipsticks was broken and hence 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Product arrived broken package not damaged and the product wasn&#x27;t melted into lids</li>
            <li> None of them were broken and the were all in place.</li>
            <li> and I got the lipstick broken</li>
            <li> None of the sticks were broken or melted.</li>
            <li> this seems to be a common defect and not just a random problem with this product.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m taking very serious to sell this product ...</li>
            <li> Not a good buy!</li>
            <li> I feel a little bad giving this company</li>
            <li> Over half of the lipsticks were either broken or melted, very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I feel bad that I wasted my money on this</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and took a chance - unfortunately, ours were broken.</li>
            <li> so disappointed half of the package was already damage.</li>
            <li> I bought these lipsticks and EVERY single one was broken out of the lipstick base and stuck to the tops of the lids!</li>
            <li> Not only were the colors nasty</li>
            <li> So sad because I like the quality of the product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad none of these colors in the picture were in the box.</li>
            <li> Personally, i feel terrible about its quality.</li>
            <li> I thought that I could apply the lipstick with a lipstick brush, wrong again.</li>
            <li> broken!</li>
            <li> I bought this for a gift but its really useless.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> As she opened the lipsticks, each one came out broken!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this is not for me, but a birthday gift for a dear friend of mine.</li>
            <li> this is not what I expected I&#x27;m truely disappointed!</li>
            <li> Obviously very poor quality control.</li>
            <li> the least i could do so that my mom wouldnt be disappointed</li>
            <li> Colors horrible, texture horrible and cheaply packaged/ made.  </li>
            <li> Lipsticks arrived all broken :(</li>

            <li> I am very angry</li>
            <li> Was disappointed as when I got the box, it was quite damaged and was dirty on the inside.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, it is too bad.</li>
            <li> Boy did I make a bad choice.</li>
            <li> and she smelled REALLY bad, all talc and pancake makeup</li>
            <li> The colors were atrocious.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just so ugly.  </li>
            <li> I was so disappointed in this purchase.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed, but the product still deserves 4 stars for the quality.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t have time to return and re order so disappointing!</li>
            <li> and I am SO disappointed.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed in this purchase.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I was terribly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Just know that if you do get them they will probably be damaged :(</li>
            <li> Inside of the lids is very dirty, the lipstick is melted.</li>

            <li> All were broken and falling out of tubes!!!</li>
            <li> but once I got these we were opening them to see what colors we had gotten and all of them had detached from base and were melted to lid</li>
            <li> the lipstick came today and they all were stuck to the lid, it appears that some how the color was not secured to the base correctly.</li>
            <li> an yeah lipsticks do fall of because they are not connectd to the base</li>
            <li> Then, the lipstick along with the plastic base that&#x27;s supposed to be inside the bottom part of the lipstick, was also stuck in the top.&lt;br /&gt;  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Most of them were broken.... I would not order this again!!!</li>
            <li> Would have loved them had they not been melted to the cap</li>
            <li> These lipsticks are absolutely awful! They all arrived broken so when I opened them they were all in the lids and to put them back into the base made a massive mess and wrecked the lipstick! They are also nothing like the colours on the bottom of the tube. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> The colors were o.k.; nothing exceptional but when I opened the lipstick tube everyone of the lipsticks fell out. I was very surprised.  I will not buy this product again.  I opened them at work in front of some other employees and they will not be buying these either.</li>
            <li> I like this lipstick great color choices and it feels silky smooth and last for several hours.</li>
            <li> Was smaller than i thought. But still very good!</li>
            <li> I received this half lipsticks were stuck in the top of the lids. They are nice colors some are similar. Just wish they wouldn&#x27;t come apart like they did.</li>
            <li> So i read the reviews after i already purchased this as a gift to myself. I was hella nervous  Lol. absolutely nothing was wrong with it. All my lipsticks were in the box and none broke,melted,or fell out the tube.  The lipstick is very creamy not that pigmented but lovely spring lipstick  Very happy</li>
            <li> the product came damaged. how you can help me?</li>
            <li> I Love the way the lipstick goes on and the color lasted for hours! But unfortunately I was only able to test a few out because when I received them more than half of the lipsticks were broken off and stuck in the cap ð</li>
            <li> Very good lip product - I didn&#x27;t know what to expect when getting these because it&#x27;s such a good price for that amount of lipstick. I&#x27;ve had them for several months now and I absolutely love them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color payoff is very good. It&#x27;s very pigmented and there&#x27;s several colors to choose from. Some of the colors are very similar but they&#x27;re all unique in their different ways. Most of them have a glossy finish - So if you&#x27;re looking Matte lipstick these are not the lippies for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color sticker on the bottom of the lipstick bullet doesn&#x27;t really match what&#x27;s in the tube - And some of them arrived with the lipstick popped out of the bullet, but that&#x27;s easy enough to fix. They could have been tossed around in shipping for all I know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for good lipstick for cheap just to have a variety to choose from, this is definitely for you.</li>
            <li> worst lipsticks ever!!</li>
            <li> waste of money. Don&#x27;t buy it. more than half of the lipsticks were broken. the stickers on the lipsticks are misleading. I just wasted my money, i would have returned them, but i had to leave  before i could.</li>
            <li> I feel a little bad giving this company a low rating cause I&#x27;m not sure if its their product or the delivery process but once I got these we were opening them to see what colors we had gotten and all of them had detached from base and were melted to lid so it was a bit of a pain to get them usable, wasn&#x27;t the best selection of color for my daughter either and they had a strange smell about them, we ended up throwing them out, but since this could have happened in delivery time I rated half and half don&#x27;t want to put all the blame on the company</li>
            <li> At first, I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with my colors. But once you try them on, they actually look good. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them being used by professionals, only personal use. But all in all, I was satisfied</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and she really loved it, so yes i am happy with with the overall experience.</li>
            <li> The colors are amazing, highly pigmented, It last long and it is also moisturizing.  Definitely a lipstick that I would recommend to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;The only negative thing is that the shade colors on the end of the tube isn&#x27;t close to what the real colors are, so is hard to find the color you want to wear.</li>
            <li> Over half of the lipsticks were either broken or melted, very disappointing.Not going to bother with trying to return as I gave out the good ones for Christmas.</li>
            <li> These were awful. Not only were the colors nasty every single one of the colors fell of the tubes when you opened them. Cheap! Returning these!</li>
            <li> Quality of the lipsticks are very cheap. The colors were not rich and creamy. Waste of money</li>
            <li> great variety, good product</li>
            <li> Awesome lipstick one bit of advice to shanycosmetics get a matte line most of us have lines above our upper lip that regular lipstick runs up the Crack unless it&#x27;s matte love the colors and it lasts on lips doesn&#x27;t rub off the first time you take a bite of a sandwhich</li>
            <li> The lipsticks did not even come out of the tube.  They were broken and in the lids.</li>
            <li> My lipstick came on time, but the lipstick was all flipped over causing it to stick to the lid. ð</li>
            <li> very good assortment of colors</li>
            <li> The products were smaller than I expected but the lipsticks were nice colors. My main concern is the fact that many of the lipsticks were damaged as if someone had twisted the lipsticks up while the caps were still on. Two or three of them completely fell out of their casing when I opened them to look at the colors, and there are a couple that look like the only thing keeping them in the casing is luck. I think the problem might be with the formula which, while making the lipstick feel smooth, makes the lipstick easier to damage with almost no effort.</li>
            <li> I love all of them. They&#x27;re smooth and pretty, the colors are great. I would definately buy them again, for a gift or for me. In comparison to other brands I can find on my city, I prefer Shany&#x27;s!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only one of them had the lipstick in the lid.. but well, they came all the way to Mexico, and it&#x27;s not a big deal, I mean.. I only had to put it back.. and presto!. I donÂ´t know why people spect them to arrive in perfect conditions after all the hours of traveling. Better buy them in a store..</li>
            <li> When it arrived looked like it was just thrown in the box. Some of the lipsticks were dry.</li>
            <li> I received the item and they were all every single one of them either broken or melted.  I have been busy and forgot about them and now they will not take them back even though they have not been used in any way.  I would not buy anything from them in the future.  The least they could do was replace them.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product.  Most of the lipsticks were broken when I opened the tubes upon receiving the delivery.  It seems from other reviews that this is a pretty common experience.  Would not take the chance in buying these.</li>
            <li> lipsticks arrived broken. i tried swatching it to see the quality, it feels almost like crayon and does not adhere to well. i ended up sending this back. they were small, broken and not pigmented. i&#x27;m surprise all the good reviews cause i really didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife &amp; she tells me she likes the different colors very much. At this price point she thinks it&#x27;s a no brainer &amp; I am sure she will purchase more when needed.</li>
            <li> wonderful thank you all so very much.</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE product.  There ids not one good thing I can say about these.  The tips were smashed and lipsticks broken when they arrived.  The colors are all very bright and vibrant, and only a few would have went with my olive skin/ brunette tones.  It is hard to apply as it goes on opaque and I had to go over a few times to get total coverage. Then it turned into a runny sloppy mess.  I used Lip Chic over it and this sealant always works for me...but not with this lipstick?  It balled up and turned into an even bigger mess.  Colors horrible, texture horrible and cheaply packaged/ made.  I&#x27;ll stick with my NYX and Rimmel from on now!</li>
            <li> the lipstick came today and they all were stuck to the lid, it appears that some how the color was not secured to the base correctly. I will be returning them. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It Came In So Fast , And The Colors Are So Beautiful , Plus They Are Wonderful When Put Upon Lips</li>
            <li> When I got them, every single lipstick was broken.  They were all stuck inside the tops.  Ended up just throwing them out</li>
            <li> Not the same colors as shown but some colors are nice..</li>
            <li> Gave this for my wife on Valentine&#x27;s, and she loves it and that makes me one satisfied customer! Everyday her lips are a different color which is pretty cool</li>
            <li> I like the product.  Some were stuck in the top of the cap.  I was able to release it and press it down to stick in the right place.  I ordered during winter so they would not melt.  So far it is worth it.  Don&#x27;t think I will buy designer lipsticks again.</li>
            <li> One broken and the rest smudge on the top. TheyÂ´re bigger than the case. So sad because I like the quality of the product the lipstick has a nice texture and for the Price could have been perfect.</li>
            <li> The colors were different than the picture, and several of the colors looked the exact same to me. A few of them were smashed when they arrived, so I ended up sending it back.</li>
            <li> i didnt like how my order got to me. the lipstick was smash from the inside and it was out of place</li>
            <li> I got the same colors repeated plus they come off the little lipstick thingy this is seriously a sucky product!!!! Not worth 20 bucks!!!</li>
            <li> Great price Great Colours !!!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too happy with the quality of these lipsticks. There very oily so they tend to bleed. I tried putting a lipstick primer and after a while of wearing it, it just stained my lips. And the lipstick got on my teeth, not happy at all and they came all the way pushed up therefore the tip of the lipsticks were broken.</li>
            <li> I received the package and opened some of the lipsticks to use them and they were just empty tubes. Such a waste!</li>
            <li> I do agree that the packaging is not the best (two of the lipsticks fell out) but despite that, I think this is a great lipstick set! I mean, for the price, what more can you expect?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are absolutely beautiful, just don&#x27;t rely on the colored stickers on the bottom... they are not true to the actual color. Try all the colors on to see how they look! I highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li> I was drawn to these for the price.  I love lipsticks and trying new colors but sadly, this purchase was a bust.  I didn&#x27;t think I was picky with my lipstick.  I usually use drugstore brands, occasionally ULTA brands or Avon, but I&#x27;m not picky.  These were the worst things I&#x27;ve EVER used.  Like worse than the dress-up make-up I used as a child.  The colors were atrocious.  There was one color in the whole box that looked okay on.  I don&#x27;t even think they&#x27;d look good as costume make-up.  They go on really thin like a gloss, the color seems to stick but it&#x27;s just so ugly.  I was so disappointed in this purchase.  Unlike other reviews though, my lipsticks came intact.  No melting or messes, thus the 2 stars.</li>
            <li> Came with horrible colors mostly pinks and weird reds too glossy not really worth the money</li>
            <li> 12 colors that I can choose for my day, night  Ive been able to pull up a smokey eye, soft evening, and my hot office look (if you knw what I mean ;&gt; )using this selection  My lips usually dry, but these lipsticks are nice on my lips and they are low maintenance  they give my lips a nice smooth texture   I recommend this product</li>
            <li> The swatch colors on the bottom of each lip stick aren&#x27;t accurate at all to the color of the lipstick and half of the colors aren&#x27;t close to pink or red. That said, the price is right even if you only end up using half of them! I gave away the other half to friends who liked the other colors.</li>
            <li> Really nice lipstick in very nice colors. The price is awesome.</li>
            <li> I love the different colors and the packaging.</li>
            <li> Beautiful long lasting color. Used this set as part of goodie bags for my senior models at jacieleighphotography.com. Loved the variety in colors. Will definitely include in next years goodie bag!</li>
            <li> Every lipstick came broken all the lip stick stuck in the top of the lid...huge mess...</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for the reds that are in the picture, then I wouldn&#x27;t get this product. However, the pinks, purples, and variations of &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34; are very nice. The lipstick goes on smooth and has just the slightest shimmer in the lighter colors. Of course not all of them work with me personally, but they&#x27;re all beautiful. I just wish there were reds like in the picture. I was a bit disappointed, but the product still deserves 4 stars for the quality. As for everyone who keeps saying their lipsticks came in broken, well I&#x27;m not sure what to tell you. Either your mailman just threw it on the street and ran over it, or you broke it. The box this came in was rattling around the package, and I was a little afraid they would break. In fact I actually shook the package violently just to see if they would break. I wasn&#x27;t too worried since repairing lipstick is pretty easy. Yeah, nothing broke...at all. Maybe its because it&#x27;s cold outside so they were sort of frozen, but who in their right mind would order lipstick through the mail when it&#x27;s hot outside? What I&#x27;m saying is, have common sense. Also if you&#x27;re a fan of pink, purple, and beige lipsticks, this is the right thing for you. I&#x27;m going to try and find red lipstick from this company, because it was some seriously outstanding quality!</li>
            <li> Received the set and one third of the lipsticks were broken off in the lid.  Received a replacement set with same result.  As other reviewers have stated, colors so not match the picture.  You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I got the lipsticks and truly loved em.  They go on quite nicely.  I love the price and the product.  The package also came quickly.  Great job.</li>
            <li> Not happy with the product. Most of the lipsticks were stuck to the lid. It was messy and the colors not according to what I had expected.</li>
            <li> it was ok like this product as dicribed  but i got it for my wife n mom but they were nt happy with the quality,, well it ok ,, nt that bad,,,</li>
            <li> So I woke up and went and checked and my package was there. I knew that there were so many bad reviews about this, but I bought it anyway. Biggest mistake ever. Most of them are chipped.  When I opened one, the lipstick itself  fell into my lap. And the stickers that are on the tubes of lipstick do not match the color of the lipstick.  There are a few I might keep because I  like the color of the lipstick but from now on I  buying my lipstick in person.  I&#x27;m not even  blaming Amazon for this.  Shany Cosmetics  shouldn&#x27;t keep selling this product because of  the bad reviews and their lipstick is apparently always chipped.  Is it worth the money? Nope.</li>
            <li> it look good in the picture but in personal i am very disappointed. $20 for this! just wasting money. it won&#x27;t hold into your lips .dont buy this product!</li>
            <li> The colors are everyday use ,nice on lips beautiful look although my first time using the product it&#x27;s good and stays on lips</li>
            <li> This is a MUST HAVE!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in love with this set, everything about it just gets me going!&lt;br /&gt;I own almost all of Shany&#x27;s products they are amazing!</li>
            <li> Some came broken but overall a nice collection. Its not an expensive quality so you&#x27;ll have to apply it more often then normal but can&#x27;t beat but you get for the price!</li>
            <li> All lipstick was broken and stuck to top of lid didn&#x27;t have time to return and re order so disappointing!</li>
            <li> Colors were nice but arrived damaged twice. This complaint as often as I&#x27;ve seen it can&#x27;t be coincidence.</li>
            <li> The colors and very light and doesn&#x27;t should up, just a little shine, that doesn&#x27;t last long!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re amazing!!! ðððð</li>
            <li> The lipsticks were all damaged. They were either smashed against the top of the tube like someone purposely twisted it all the way up with the lid on, or the color portion just fell out and rolled away. Was supposed to be a gift, but that clearly isn&#x27;t going to happen. I feel bad that I wasted my money on this and I hope no one else does.</li>
            <li> While the pros do outweigh the cons, There are some issues with these lipsticks.&lt;br /&gt;Pro-&lt;br /&gt;Colors are vibrant.&lt;br /&gt;Application is smooth and velvety&lt;br /&gt;The colors are long lasting without drying out my lips. I tried out the brightest shade and the color stayed vibrant and pretty for several hours even through eating and drinking.&lt;br /&gt;The set arrived with no broken or damaged sticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con-&lt;br /&gt;The actual colors of the lipsticks are no where near the color sticker on the bottom of the tube.&lt;br /&gt;None of the colors are &amp;#34;true red&amp;#34; like the description said. The one that is supposed to be &amp;#34;true red&amp;#34; is more of a purple-pink. Not true red at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I bought the set for $12 and it is worth keeping for that price. I have included a picture of what the different shade look like on a white sheet of paper. I hope that helps. The lipsticks are numbered 1-12 in the set and they are in order on the test paper.</li>
            <li> AWFUL! I had high hopes for these considering the decent reviews. How when I received them they were damaged and look used. While I like a couple of the colors I can&#x27;t use them since I don&#x27;t know if they were used it not.</li>
            <li> This is so beautiful I bought two as gifts, after opening it I kept one for myself, absolutely adorable colors and long lasting. Just fantastic.</li>
            <li> The lipstick doesn&#x27;t stay on lips long plus some were broken .</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this product. Not a single one was in good shape one of them was broken and the rest of them will all smashed on the top.  And I got like four or five of them that look exactly the same color...  and that single one was  red...  I wish I can get my money back.</li>
            <li> Thanks. I bought this as gifts for my aunts, and theh loved it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving these four stars as though they arrived tightly packed in a box--once opened, nearly all the lipsticks had come out of their socked. But, it wasn&#x27;t the end of the world. Once I put them back together and gave them a try, they were excellent!! Refitting them was a bit of a nuisance, but their quality and overall value outweighed this con. Also, very creamy and non-drying. Good variety of color/, only tossed one--kept the remaining eleven! Great deal!</li>
            <li> I purchased this set of lipsticks and it arrived before the projected delivery date.  I was excited and opend the box up to check out my new lipsticks and was extremely satisfied with the quality of the product just looking at it.  Obviously I had to test each color out on my hand and I was beyond satisfied with the quality again. Most lipsticks look nothing like the color when you try them or put them on, these looked exactly like the color AND they were of such great quality.  They were bold! They weren&#x27;t transparent or cheap. They went on smoothly and were rich and creamy and the colors were exactly like the color of the lipstick or what the label shows.  I&#x27;ve never written a review for any cosmetic product before including lipstick but I had to share my input because I&#x27;ve become a frequent Amazon shopper now and I love the fact that I can read other customers reviews because it has impacted my purchasing.  If I see too many negative reviews I avoid the product. I have nothing negative to say about these lipsticks.  If you purchase a SHANY lipstick you will be glad you did.  Exceptional quality and affordable too. If you&#x27;re not familiar with SHANY i would recommend you purchase a single tube of lipstick to start and try them out but I already know you will like it and purchase more.  find a SHANY lipstick that the color is what you use in a different brand and try it and compare it to your existing brand.  Im pretty positive you&#x27;ll become a returning SHANY customer.</li>
            <li> one cap was already off when it was shipped and the colors were not the same but its good lipstick</li>
            <li> The lipstick set is really nice once you get it. Don&#x27;t be alarmed when you have some lipstick that&#x27;s slightly melted I mean it was delivered through mail. Simply place them or the melted one in the fridge for about an hour and your good to go. Overall I really like the lipstick set and all the colors are really nice</li>
            <li> I was so excited about this product and I am SO disappointed. The lipsticks arrived all broken and smudged inside. The colors are nothing like the picture. It was a great product in theory but really missed the mark.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not to happy with this product. Is make my lip dry out and smell. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the pros are worth it. DO NOT BUY THIS. Although the color is beautiful I would never buy them again. I got this just a couple months ago. When I got them I had to spend about 10 mins reattaching them because they were broken. I haven&#x27;t used them for awhile and when I went to open them to use them today each and everyone had MOLD on it. Both the ones I used and didn&#x27;t used. I have lipsticks older than these and never have mold on it. How gross!!!!!!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t get all the colors in the picuture and most of the ones i received were broken.</li>
            <li> I gave it a four star, because as some mentioned I found several that were loose in the tube.  It was an easy enough fix to push the lipstick firmly against the grips at the bottom.  There are many wonderful color choices, though some won&#x27;t work for me, because of the  color of my skin... example: I rarely if ever wear corral colors.  But, there are many others to choose from.  I love 12 and 07, and use others also. This lipstick slides on smoothly.  It isn&#x27;t like those 14 hours lipsticks, which give a lot of color stain, but are hard to put on.  I use these over that one.  I am very happy with this lipstick.  I got it on black Friday for a pretty good price.  But, honestly, if you love lipstick options, then this is a great way to go.  Lipsticks in the store are upwards of 7 dollars.. so why not buy all these for a lot less per tube!  Now all I need to get myself is a cute little way to carry my 3 or 4 favorite colors. :)</li>
            <li> I love these lipsticks!!!! Great quality for such a great price. It applies smoothly and the colors lasts throughout the day. The shades are beyond great! I personally refer to them as 50 shades of red! My friends have even stolen a few from me so they love them as well.</li>
            <li> I am fairly new to wearing lipsticks so I decided to purchase this VERY affordable set just to play around with the variety of different shades. This set has a great color selection varying from a couple of nudes, to an orange, to a bunch of pinks, couple of mauves,  and 2 maroon/purplish tones. The only downfall was that 10 tubes of lipsticks were touching the top of the lids so every color was very slightly dented in. Two of the lipsticks were pushed against the tops of the lids causing them to come apart from the dispenser part(bottom portion) of the tube and stuck on the lid. Now although this was a bit annoying, it didn&#x27;t cause enough harm to make the lipsticks unusable. I just used the dispenser portion of the tube to wiggle out the lipstick from the lid and I stuck it back onto the dispenser.. I still think it was worth the price. Don&#x27;t be discouraged if during your first application the color comes on roughly and poorly.. after a couple of applications it applies a bit more smoothly.</li>
            <li> I had similar issues as reported by other shoppers with the lipsticks arriving damaged and falling out of the tube randomly. I&#x27;ve purchased other Shany products that I love but this set seemed to be poorly made. Also, not a huge fan of most of the colors in the set once I tried them on. Overall, not a great buy, try other Shany products instead.</li>
            <li> I love these lipsticks. They came in great time. The only negative was that they came all smooshed on the tops, but luckily none was broken. Overall they were quite beautiful. Happily grateful!</li>
            <li> lipsticks feel nice on the lips and dont clump</li>
            <li> These lipsticks come in great colors and the color goes on evenly. I love the variety in colors. The lipsticks are full size and are complementary to different skin tones.</li>
            <li> Inside of the lids is very dirty, the lipstick is melted. Some of the lipstick is fracture. The color is not as same as the picture shows.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it is too bad. I will never buy this again, never ever.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast but it really only has 4 colors but and each color has 3 of each</li>
            <li> All but 4 of these lipsticks were smashed into the lids and some of the cheap tubes were broken.  I returned them immediately.</li>
            <li> Ok first of all.. ORDER FROM SHANYCOSMETICS.COM they are cheaper and with free shipping and samples with orders over $50.&lt;br /&gt;I bought them directly from them and came in perfect condition. They are really pigmented and last a fair amount of time which is something I expect for the price. I feel most of the other reviews are people expecting something too good for the price they are paying but this is just perfect for what it is. If you want something better you can look for something is sephora or mac but for a new price level. These are simply amazing! I LOVE THEM!</li>
            <li> Love love this are rich and creamy.last long</li>
            <li> This product was a big waste of time and money,it has weird smell in it and it feels dry on your lips,I didn&#x27;t wanna spend time to return them in,thinking to just throw  them away maybe.</li>
            <li> I liked the colors and the diversity. Pigmentation is ok, could be better though. I received the product intacted, not melted nor broken. But I would rather if colors were more strong, more pigmented.</li>
            <li> The colors are great. Huge hit with my lipstick loving teenager. Wish the color would stay in the holder. It wasn&#x27;t glued in or whatever they do to keep it inside the thingy. But over all a great choice for a gift. I would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> I received these as a gift from someone and I couldn&#x27;t get the information to return them. When I opened the box every single one of the lipsticks was broken or stuck in the tubes. The tubes are cheap and the end pops off when you try to open the lipsticks. The colors are nice but I&#x27;d rather pay more for a better quality product. One that I don&#x27;t have to fix immediately after opening.</li>
            <li> These lipsticks are Amazing!!....My lips hold moisture much better and the color stays on. I&#x27;m a Huge fan of Shany Cosmetics!!!</li>
            <li> I was expecting the colors to be a little richer, but they are more on the translucent side. Also be careful, the lip color will fall right out of the tube! So careful upon opening and make sure you push the lip color down into the tube.  I like the fact that there are 12 color choices and the Pati Dubroff lip tints helps me get a really perfect color with these lip sticks.</li>
            <li> Matte., wasn&#x27;t what I expected and got my finds returned after I returned the product.</li>
            <li> THESE LIPSTICKS ARE A LIPSTICK LOVERS&#x27; DREAM, LIKE MYSELF!! YOU HAVE A VARIETY OF SHADES FOR ALL SKIN TONES!! VERY LONG LASTING AND MOISTURIZING!! IT COMES WITH 12 SHADES AND THEY ARE VERY PIGMENTED!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely awful. Very waxy and color pigmintation is awful. DO NOT BUY. I wish I can get a refund for my purchase</li>
            <li> Really, really good mix and range of colors.  Lipstick goes on smoothly, stays on well (not extended wear).  Seems to be an average-to-nice quality of lipstick. Packaging is a flexible, mostly clear plastic.</li>
            <li> its color is not good at all, most of them look like for older people.&lt;br /&gt;its smell is awful.&lt;br /&gt;and most of them is broken.</li>
            <li> Excellent all the primary colors are there.&lt;br /&gt;Creamy and long last lipsticks.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as a gift for my mom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially decided to purchase this brand due to the pricing, but I found out afterwards that it is a wonderful product.  This is obviously not a super high quality brand, however the quality is still very nice.  The set comes with some wonderful colors, I wide array of reds &amp; pinks.  They look beautiful on, which is what one would want.  You do need to reapply these a bit throughout the day, but I don&#x27;t see that as too much of a problem.  They&#x27;re not a drying lipstick, it doesn&#x27;t feel like all the moisture have been sucked out of your lips after wearing.  Overall, for the price I think the product is excellent.</li>
            <li> Out of the 12pcs that I&#x27;ve received, 9 pcs were spoil. The tip were damaged and most of it looks melting. Colour only a few looks nice to me.</li>
            <li> These colors are pretty. However, you might need to invest in a lip primer. These lipsticks tend to bleed and do not last long. After using these lipsticks with a primer, I enjoyed them even more. Worth the price, fun to play with.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product! it&#x27;s a great price for 12 lipsticks versus paying $5-10 for just ONE lipstick. The lipsticks are very creamy, they don&#x27;t leave your lips dry, lipsticks stay on throughout the day, and colors are very beautiful. It shipped quicker than told and was nicely packaged with nothing broken or missing. This was a great purchase!</li>
            <li> When I got my lip stick half of them were broken this is not what I expected I&#x27;m truely disappointed!</li>
            <li> When I bought it I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for it. I read most of the reviews and everyone kept complaining about how they were smushed at the top. When I received them I had low expectations, but was shocked when I saw the first few lipsticks were in perfect condition. About two of them were out of place and I had to push them back down by touching the sides, but i didn&#x27;t leave dents. Then there was only one that was stuck to the top but it came off and i simply put it back in place as well. The quality is nice, The colors the first time you put them on isnt the best. After the second time theyre really nice and vibrant. I love them, They exceeded my expectations :)</li>
            <li> Then I tried these, and at the price, how could I not? They went on so smooth and last all day long. Somedays when I feel like I just want a little oomph! I put my shaney lipstick on. Love it!</li>
            <li> I ordered these lipsticks a week ago and received them the following week. I was really excited to try these after reading some of the reviews I decided to purchase them. There are so many colors and they are very pigmented. I loved them. Theres colors for every skin tone and they last a long time. The only reason Im not giving it 5 stars is because when I opened one of the lipsticks the lipstick flew off the tube and I had to put it back in the tube. There were about two other lipsticks that were smudged against the top of the lid. Maybe it was because of the shipping they were placed in hot conditions but I was rather disappointed some of the lipsticks were smudged. But after leaving them in room temperature for a while they have been working great. But for the price they were a good buy. I bought these for $20 and theres no where else Im going to find such pigmented lipsticks for that price. If you order just lookout for 1 or 2 smudged lipsticks.</li>
            <li> Lots of lipstick for the money and it goes on very smooth.  I like the product, however, the lipstick remained stuck at the opposite end of the tube, causing many of them to crack in half.  It&#x27;s still manageable, but a bit of hassle/disappointment.</li>
            <li> Love the colors the quality of the product isn&#x27;t so great but their good shape.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter at Christmas  and every single lipstick was broken and they wouldn&#x27;t take it back...</li>
            <li> The packaging of these lipsticks is quite like the other reviewers had mentioned. The box is worn down and the lipsticks themselves are detached from the container. So, you will find that when you open a tube of lipstick, it simply falls out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expected some dysfunction given the price of the set itself. The bottom of the lipstick is color coded, however, it doesn&#x27;t match up to the actual color inside the tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lipsticks themselves are very pretty in addition to transfers to the lips very smoothly. The colors are vibrant and as they appear in the photograph. I would recommend buying an empty palette to place the lipsticks instead of opening the tube and having it fall out. There are some sold on Amazon and I believe Japonesque has a few, but there are some lower ended ones that are just fine as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, 3 stars simply for the fact of how its packaged...but the colors are pretty and transfer quite nice.</li>
            <li> I picked this lip gross because of the colors. When I received it I mas more than happy with the colors. Colors are not as  true asthe picture, but l still love them.</li>
            <li> I received this yesterday and I must say, I&#x27;m thrilled. Colors are great and they feel wonderful on as well.</li>
            <li> First of all, the box the lipsticks came in was entirely busted open. Lipsticks EVERYWHERE. Every single tube of lipstick was smashed in the top lid and the stick had fallen out. The box was dirty. It was disgusting. My fiancÃ© who even HATES my makeup obsessions was upset for me and said it was a rip off .. I want to request a refund but idk how since this is all sold out from the seller. I&#x27;m so disappointed in this purchase. I wonder if the other Shany products have poor quality. Oh well. Half a tank of gas down the gutter! WOULD NOOOTTTTTTTTT BUY AGAIN!!</li>
            <li> I received it melted and half of them where broken.</li>
            <li> i think i liked it value for money n i tested to see for grain, there were none.&lt;br /&gt; just tht some of the tips were broken and the stickers behind might confuse u until u open to see the colors.</li>
            <li> I love the colors. the lipsticks are smooth, not gooey and long lasting. This is a nice price for good product.</li>
            <li> was the worst buy ever for me on AMAZON. I received the product and gave to my girlfriend once she opened it she found that the lipsticks were stuck inside the cap, the lipsticks themselves were melted and or missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just the worst</li>
            <li> I WISH I COULD GET MY MONEY BACK!!!! These lipsticks fall out of the tube the second you open them...literally...the lipstick falls out of the holder. The quality is soooooo terrible. What a waste of my money!!! I am very angry that crap like this is being sold!!!!! cheapest, worst made lipstick of all time!! do not waste your money!!</li>
            <li> You have to have this collection. The quality is amazing and it is a great price. I loved the Shany Eyeshadows and I bought this to complement those. A must have for those who love to play as hard as they work.....Shout outs to ColouredBeautiful for the recommendation. Wear this with a pair of hot heels and a nice bag from ShoeDazzle or Just Fab.</li>
            <li> I love the different colors they are great for traveling and my husband loves when I do my make up and add the red lip stick on :}</li>
            <li> Great selection of colors! Ranges from very light pink to coral to deep plum. All very shiny - none are matte. They do look great and will stay on! Very creamy!</li>
            <li> There was some that I can not use, so I gave them away, but I kept some. I will buy again, but I will contact the seller first to see what colors come with it.</li>
            <li> I was extremly happy when i recieved my SHANY Slick &amp; Shine Lipstick Set, GREAT shipping &amp; handling. when i opened the box they were all perfect . not one was melted or broken like most reviews say, they got here fast &amp; i love how they wear. i have used 3 of them already and i am extremly happy !!! thinking of getting my sister in law one for her Birthday !! LOVE ! LOVE ! LOVE THEM !!</li>
            <li> A wonderful product and my wife loved him .. also a good price</li>
            <li> I  love the lipstick I am a darker color women so I never really like using lipstick but I love the way it shine the pigments of color....i just wish they had more colors to buy.....</li>
            <li> i received some damaged items, 3 out of 12&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the quality is very good. i like it but i&#x27;m very disappointed of the item condition.</li>
            <li> I received the set of 12 lipsticks this afternoon, and 3 of the lipsticks are damaged.  The tips are squared /tipped off which gives the appearance of being used.  Also, the boxes were left outside by my front door and it was pouring rain, the box was wet and somewhat crushed.  It seems as though there was some type of mishandling either during transit or throughout delivery period.</li>
            <li> DO NOT buy this product , it chaffed my lips , the colors are all wrong , terrible terrible product I threw them away!</li>
            <li> Great deal and great product and fast ship!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Colors were good. Price was good. BUT every tube was broken and the lipstick was stuck in the tops.</li>
            <li> I bought these lipsticks and EVERY single one was broken out of the lipstick base and stuck to the tops of the lids! With that being said, serious damage was minimal. The lipsticks are NOT crushed, it is possible to GENTLY remove them from inside of the lid and place them back in the tube casing. The lipstick will still twist up and down when you do this, BUT turning them upside down would most likely make them fall out or stick to the inside of the lid again and that of course makes it rather difficult to carry in your purse, these are the reasons that I could not give this product 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;The colors are very pretty, creamy, and long wearing so I decided to keep them and just handle them with care! After 1-2 uses you can no longer tell that the lipstick was ever stuck to the inner lid. I am a pretty pick person and still decided not to return this, so that should say quiet a bit about the over all quality of the lipsticks!&lt;br /&gt;GREAT product with AWFUL packaging! Buy these if you want quality and value, but not if you are wanting \\&quot;perfect packaging\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> Some of the sticks broke easily, some sticks were chalky, but some were very good.</li>
            <li> My wife loved them. Only one thing, some of the lipstcks where out of place.</li>
            <li> The picture is deceiving as I can only wear reds and cooler shades.  There were around 4 that were too warm/peach toned and some that were too light.  Still, I got six I love and gave the others as a gift!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my granddaughter who was very pleased she sad the colors were very pretty this is her first set of lipstick I&#x27;am glade that I was there to share in that moment ,OH and so was Amazon.....</li>
            <li> The colors in the picture above are not what I received.  I loved the reds and pink they are showing. What I received was nudes, browns and closest thing to red was a very deep deep purple. I&#x27;m sad none of these colors in the picture were in the box. NOW interesting thing is, the tag on bottom of each lipstick showing what color they should be match the colors in this picture just not whats in the tube. I&#x27;m sad, my skin tone will not go with nudes, browns and dark purple. Very disappointed, not to mention it rubs off easy. Not long lasting at all. :/</li>
            <li> i  totally liked item and for the price  up my ally!!!!  amazon is unbelievable  will recommend it to my friends</li>
            <li> The inner lipstick hasn&#x27;t been attached well in the base, so it drops out any time you try to roll it up. Personally, i feel terrible about its quality.</li>
            <li> I have had these for a while and found that there are only about 4 colors I use. The lipstick isn&#x27;t as smooth and easy to apply as I would like.</li>
            <li> Absolutely TERRIBLE . I was so excited to receive them the minute i opened the package and opened one of the lipstick tubes . To my surprise there was no lipstick there ? I know right ..well it was STUCK to the top of the lid . I went on the check the rest &amp; most of them were stuck to the top as well. All in all i returned &amp; got a refund and never again will i purchase shany cosmetics im only giving it one star because its required btw</li>
            <li> True to their words &amp;#34;Slick &amp; Shine&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> As others have said, the stickers on the bottom of the tubes don&#x27;t match the colors of the lipstick. They seem fairly cheaply made and most of them had fallen out of the bottom of the tube when I received them. I feel like I should find these at a dollar store. However, they feel fairly smooth and moisturizing, not tacky. So that&#x27;s a plus. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy them again.</li>
            <li> Thought that reading previous reviews would have changed my mind about purchasing this lipstick set,  should have listened. Cheap crap that was both broken and stuck to the lid. I thought that I could apply the lipstick with a lipstick brush, wrong again. Lipsticks smelled and were colors that absolutely no one would wear. Maybe I can donate them to a funeral home as no one alive would wear this crap.</li>
            <li> It was possible good shopping you used to gift</li>
            <li> waste of money  3 of the lipsticks have already fallen out of the tube upon first use.  Feels like Parafin not shiny  do not waste your time or money  buy one really good lipstick</li>
            <li> Shade colors on the end of the tube isn&#x27;t close to what the real colors are and a few were broken but the colors were pretty</li>
            <li> I love this brand because it goes with my skin tone. I&#x27;m not exactly light and some colors don&#x27;t go well with darker skinned people, but with this brand it goes well with my skin tones. Lol even the purple goes well with me. The lipstick blends well and lasts the whole day. I really like it. I&#x27;m actually buying another set for a friend. She loves I love it, it&#x27;s loveable lol</li>
            <li> Was disappointed as when I got the box, it was quite damaged and was dirty on the inside. Almost half the lipsticks where squashed and stuck to the lids, and so I had to really carefully try to detach them with out damaging the lipstick. The colours are great though.</li>
            <li> I only gave this product one star because all the lipsticks were stuck in the top of the tubes.I also thought I would be receiving some red in the colors not one shade of red. It was supposed to be a Christmas gift .</li>
            <li> Very good product and delivered on time, recommend this seller and this article.</li>
            <li> Had enough to share with friends...great for the money.</li>
            <li> Loved every color. Not one was broken. Came in great condition.</li>
            <li> arrived on time and in tact  great colors pigmented and very slick great buy</li>
            <li> Opened the lipstick and they just broke. JUNK!</li>
            <li> pÃ©sima calidad, estos cosmÃ©ticos no funcionan los use el primer dÃ­a y se me descoronaron algunos ni pintan, por favor no malgasten su dinero en esto.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;poor quality, these cosmetics do not work the first day of use and some do not paint descoronaron me, please do not waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> This product came damages. the colors were great but upon opening all of the lipsticks were smashed into the lids. I chose to return the product and not order again.</li>
            <li> Look cheap &amp; flimsy. Half of the lipsticks tip smudge into the cover. Though the shades was nice, I should have known better, 12 lipsticks for $19.90 that&#x27;s too cheap to get good quality lipstick.</li>
            <li> Very nice one...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All colors are cool. Make sure when you open lipstick cover, its on up side direction orelse lipstick will come out. (draw back)</li>
            <li> This lipstick set is great value for money and would have gotten a fourth star if the colors were not so similar. I truly expected a wider range in the difference of color most of them are similar and not as bright as they appear online. But overall it is okay. I give them a thumbs up.</li>
            <li> Returning. Most of the colors are the same. They range from pale pink to coral. No reds or burgundys as I was expecting. They are cheap too. Multiple layers would have to be applied to show up. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love all the colors!! Moisturizer built in the lipstick. Very soothing on my lips. The price was right. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I got my lipsticks and the two I wanted for my mom were great so I have that to her, however 4 of the lipsticks when I opened the package came broken. The tops were smushed down I do not know why they were sent that way, but of course as I paying customer I am very disappointed and would not recommend this purchase unless you happen to get more lucky than me and the lip sticks come fine....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li> i thought these were pigmented but it wasnt. it looked nice in the picture but not really in person. the cap tend come off easily but overall it was an ok product.</li>
            <li> All but 3 were broken and in the cap still.. I did get them out and managed to stick it back in the casing however it was horrible... Very disappointed... One of the 3 that wasn&#x27;t broken looked like it had been used..</li>
            <li> When I first ordered this set, I was excited because I thought that I would be getting some red lipstick! Unfortunately, when I did get the package in the mail, there was no red. However, I was super shocked by the incredible colors that did come! I am super excited to use these lipsticks more! :)</li>
            <li> Lackluster colors, dry, and have to apply several times. There are maybe 2 that I like. I was disappointed after reading the reviews and was convinced that after trying it, there was no way we could have all used the same products. Will never buy the lipsticks individually again. Also please note that most colors are peach/brown not these vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> I really liked the colours, there are only 2 that I wouldn&#x27;t wear with my fair skin. I would have given more stars if I had had fewer break with one use. The lipsticks when applied just broke off at the bottom.    Edit: Most of the lipsticks have now broken within three weeks, even after only using them once or twice (some I didn&#x27;t even use and they broke from twisting the product up), I would NOT recommend this.</li>
            <li> Thank u love it so much</li>
            <li> Not happy. These arrived with 6 of the colors stuck to the cap !!  Not a good buy!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my mom and she likes the variety of colors and the look.</li>
            <li> I love the selection of colors and the quality of the lipsticks.  You cannot beat this price for so many colors.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to order this.  I will buy more for gifts.  I am a makeup junkie and I LOVE THIS PRODUCT..</li>
            <li> Some sticks were broken at the base but great selection of colors.</li>
            <li> Some of them was broke</li>
            <li> I have got what I needed. I am very happy with my purchase. Colors are great and I like them all. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I recieved this product really fast about 4 days time.  The colors are a bit matte but that is easily fixed by adding a clear gloss over the lipstick.  The lighter colors I found I had to reapply in 2hours time the darker colors last 8hrs with hardley any fading an that includes drinking from a wine glass.  This is a great buy and would buy again.</li>
            <li> I really love Shany lipstick sets!&lt;br /&gt;They come with amazing colors and have great pigment, just like Shanys eye shadows!</li>
            <li> Shany sent me their lipstick collection a few weeks ago, and I must say they are to die for. The colors are so pretty and they go on so smooth. Definitely a lipstick that I would recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> Shany Lipsticks are amazing! they are sooo freakin pigmented! I love them and they are really really moisturizing! I highly recommend getting these!</li>
            <li> I love the colors included in the SHANY 12 color Lipstick Set. They are great for fall, and match all skin tones. I would highly recommend this product. Even the colors that I thought wouldn&#x27;t look good on me far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> This lipstick is so beautiful and goes on so smooth. I have very sensitive lips and wearing lipstick too much always drys my lips out but this doesn&#x27;t if anything it makes them softer. The color lasts and is so vibrant! So glad I discovered Shany Cosmetics!!!</li>
            <li> These lipsticks are great.  They last a long time, and are super moisturizing.  I bought these lipsticks a year ago, and am still using up the last of the lipstick.  Most of these accentuated my face color, and I got a lot of compliments about my looks when I wore these lipsticks. :)  This is a smile for happiness about the product.  I love this product, and would buy lipstick from Shany again!</li>
            <li> You get 12 lipsticks for one low price which makes it a little one one dollar a piece that is a steal. You can find that anywhere else. I love the colors are well.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these lipsticks! They are super pigmented and have a nice scent. There are also alot of dupes for Mac lipsticks</li>
            <li> $19 for 12 different color lipstick is cheap ! The color is very pigmented. It is also very beautiful. It last long and it is also moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I have a really hard time with lipstick - between the multiple cups of coffee I inhale during the morning or the chapped lips I have during the winter, I rarely even bother.  Shany&#x27;s lipstick is perfect - long wearing, moisturizing and GREAT color payoff!!</li>
            <li> I love to try different lipsticks, these are just great!With 12 Beautiful colors, you have many to choose from, and they have great pigmentation and are very moisturizing! Def worth it!</li>
            <li> Love these!! There are so many colors to pick from and they are all so opaque. They go on really smooth and are very creamy :)</li>
            <li> This product is great for many reasons but I will keep it at five for time sake.&lt;br /&gt;1. The lipstick was neatly package. The box came and it wasn&#x27;t dent or torn and the lipstick hadn&#x27;t melted.&lt;br /&gt;2. The quality of the lipsticks is high end. The lipsticks are very creamy,the colors are beautiful, it goes on smooth, it&#x27;s long lasting and it goes with anyone&#x27;s skintone.&lt;br /&gt;3. I can mix my lipsticks to make new colors.&lt;br /&gt;4. This will make an excellent gift for someone who really like makeup or someone who is trying to find their signature color.&lt;br /&gt;5. The price is worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend getting this set because you will be wasting money purchasing a single tube of lipstick from the store.</li>
            <li> My skin tone is a golden brown. All the colors except one complimented my skin tone. The lipsticks are smooth to apply &amp; surprisingly long lasting. Now don&#x27;t be fooled by the reviews that these lipsticks are on MAC quality level. I&#x27;d say they&#x27;re slightly better than Revlon or other drugstore lipsticks. Good value.</li>
            <li> This product is really more than what I expected.  There is a wide variety of colors but only for the price of 25 dolllars.  The box is a great packaging which is a great present for someone that you do not know who to shop for.  The only issue is the closing of the stick that lays over the top of the case.  The case top sort of makes it hard to close at times.</li>
            <li> **Please let me start by saying that this arrived in perfect condition. There is no melting, smudging, sticking to the lid, or falling out whatsoever. It&#x27;s cold this time of year where I live though, so that might contribute a lot to it. It&#x27;s not the seller or manufactorer&#x27;s fault if it&#x27;s damaged. If you live in a hot climate, the inside of delivery vehicles are going to be even hotter than the temperature outside, which of course will melt make up-- Either that or your handlers are careless. My product came in a package with three other items I ordered and came perfectly.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item came in a timely fashion, was in great packaging, and arrived in perfect condition. I bought these for my boyfriends grandmother for Christmas, because she LOVES lipstick. Reading over the reviews, I became nervous because of all of the \\&quot;smudging\\&quot; and \\&quot;melting\\&quot; comments, so I opened the box to check my product. To my relief, as stated earlier, they were fine. Perfect in fact. I opened each one individually, and they are beautifully colored and look nice and smooth. I briefly slid my finger along the back side of the red one, because someone had said it feels like plastic... It doesn&#x27;t-- AND it&#x27;ll apply amazingly. That soft, barely touching it glide left a smooth line of the color. The only problem I have with this product is that the sticker color and the product color is a lighter shade than the actual colors. Over all though, I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and would definately recommend it.</li>
            <li> Some of my lipsticks came broken ... More I loved the colors&lt;br /&gt;Are intense&lt;br /&gt;Hydrates the lips&lt;br /&gt;I like&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li> I love the lipsticks.  They are soft to the lips and don&#x27;t dry them out.  The only think about them is that it is difficult to truly see what color you have.  The labels at bottom of lipstick don&#x27;t match the lipstick...</li>
            <li> Colors don&#x27;t last. Some if the lipsticks fell apart</li>
            <li> WIFE LOVES THEM..ITS A FIVE FOR ME</li>
            <li> Got these lips sticks In two days within ordering them. I absolutely love them. You can&#x27;t beat the price!! Mine were in perfect condition when they came, they are very pigmented and great for everyday use. Although they last lomger than most afforadble lipsticks tou may have to reapply after a  few hours. However, I&#x27;m 100% satisfied!! Also the box they came in are perfect for storing the lipsticks. I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Each lipstick completely fell out of the tube when I went to look at them.  The color label on each tube really isn&#x27;t accurate to the color of lipstick.  I definitely won&#x27;t order from the product line again.</li>
            <li> poor quality, already seperate from substrate when i received them</li>
            <li> Its jus perfect... No damage nthing.. Great colourz as shown... M lovin it..</li>
            <li> I thought these lipsticks were going to be cheap but actually for the price there awesome ! The packaging is good the only thing was the tips on some were a little smudged but you can&#x27;t really tell ! Overall great product and very moisturizing (:!</li>
            <li> I love the colors, I would give it 5 but they don&#x27;t seem to be that long lasting and a few of them I got were broken. I mean they were still usable but I think because they ship them upside down they fall out. I could see that being annoying, luckily I&#x27;m pretty chill and as long as they&#x27;re usable I&#x27;m happy so thanks</li>
            <li> Messy, not long lasting, doesn&#x27;t have the real colors as marked</li>
            <li> Great lipsticks for the price. They go on smooth and seem to last well. They feel nice on my lips and have no noticeable smell or taste. The colours are less red than they seem in the picture (with all 12 lipsticks beside each other) - they&#x27;re more neutral or pink with a couple of almost purples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The lipstick isn&#x27;t securely attached to the applicator so most of mine were stuck to the lid.&lt;br /&gt;- The colours don&#x27;t match the sticker on the outside making it more difficult to pick out the colour you&#x27;re after&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still a good buy if you looking to expand your lipstick collection</li>
            <li> I love the lipsticks!!&lt;br /&gt;I had gotten them a gift for my grandmother, but they break so easy!&lt;br /&gt;I was very disjointed!</li>
            <li> Each &amp; every one of the lipsticks were melted onto the inside of the top. Some of them were salvageable &amp; others weren&#x27;t. So technically, its not 12 that you&#x27;re getting if 7 are melted down before you even get it. Shipping was very fast though.</li>
            <li> These colors are so nice and do much useful ! I really love this product. And toucan try the color that you&#x27;ve never tried before.</li>
            <li> This is my grandmother&#x27;s lipstick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a lipstick that would stay for an extended period of time.  Based on the description I thought this would be a great product BUT...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s heavy / thick&lt;br /&gt;It smells, old fashioned scented&lt;br /&gt;Feels Waxy&lt;br /&gt;The colors are bland, boring, like an old Crayola box&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would return, but it costs more to return....</li>
            <li> This set contains all the pinks and reds that are in! Great deal! Very reasonable! You are bound to find a shade of pink or red to definitely match with your complexion!</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift and she loved this product!!!! The lipstick seems to be a good quality of lipstick and it stays on</li>
            <li> If i could give 0 stars i would. I was very excited to receive this because ive been looking for a set of pinks and reds in lipsticks. i received it... every. single. lipstick. broken! I cant believe it!! The tips are smashed into the stop of the cap because the lipstick is to long for the tube its in. Not only that but the sticks arent attached to anything! They just fall right out of the tubes. I am so disappointed. I will never buy anything for this company again. What a waste of my time, money and excitement.</li>
            <li> If you are hesitating to buy this set because most lipstick sets come with some tacky colors that you would never wear....dont worry about that with this one!! All the colors are super wearable and of the best quality! I would def recommend to ANY lipstick user!!</li>
            <li> The colors that come in this pack are so vibrant, and sexy, and it lasts a long while  . I love every color. They are so firm, yet wet, it makes me want to wear it all the time! and there is so many to choose from. totally recomend it!!</li>
            <li> These are wonderful lipsticks that stays on all day they are great for summer,winter,spring and fall.These is great for birthday gifts and etc.</li>
            <li> I love EVERY SINGLE color! They&#x27;re beautiful... They got a bit of a shimmer to them nothing TOO shimmery. I think they&#x27;re great for the price.</li>
            <li> These lipsticks are so fun to experiment with. The red color helps me pull of a vintage look and makes me have a lot of confidence because it ties off the look I&#x27;m trying to accomplish! 12 colors makes it easy to choose to match with certain looks. Very good quality, and it lasts a while!</li>
            <li> These are very smooth lipsticks, with beautiful pigmentation and last a good amount of time on your lips. The only thing I can ask for, is even longer lasting, but then that changes the texture usually... so I&#x27;ll stick with re-applying.</li>
            <li> Normally I love shany products- I use their brush set every day and love their neutral eyeshadow pallette. This lipstick however- not a fan.. The colors are totally different than what is labeled and don&#x27;t feel very smooth when applied. I would not buy this again- they pretty much just take up room in my makeup box at this point.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when the package arrived.  However, when I opened the first lipstick it was broken.  I thought it was just a fluke but every single one of the lipstick was broken and one out of the 12 was missing.  I cannot believe that there was no quality control done on this package.  It is being returned today.</li>
            <li> They are wonderful lipstick!!!!</li>
            <li> Most of the colors of the lipsticks are great but half of them were either broken or literally fell right out of the tube when I first tried to use them... Like I said, I like the colors a lot so it&#x27;s very disappointing that I can&#x27;t use most of them because they were damaged.</li>
            <li> lipsticks come out of their tube containers all the time making it messy and not worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> Most of mine came broke and don&#x27;t stay on long they also smudge. For a lipstick that&#x27;s long wearing I will still with MAC to anyone who received this product without broken lipsticks luuuuucky you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, just wanted better colors</li>
            <li> beautiful shades but half of the bullets were broke in the tubes and fell out as soon as I opened them, may have just been an old set. These are also unfortunately drying compared to other brands I use. The slimtubed shany lipstick I have are much better would recommend those instead.</li>
            <li> The lipsticks were in great condition, no broken or smushed tips.  Colors are great and long lasting.  This is the first time I have used this brand and I a very happy with the product; great value!</li>
            <li> I wore this lipstick last night for my birthday and this lipstick is absolutely amazing! The color is so vibrant and sexy! When they came I had to manually put the lipsticks back in their containers but that was probably because of the shipping process, it&#x27;s kinda hot here in Florida also. It also makes for long lasting wear! I LOVE SHANY!</li>
            <li> Product was very good but instead of 12 lipsticks there were only ten in the package. I want to return it but I am short of time because I am flying out of country on friday morning. 100 % honesty is always appreciated in business.</li>
            <li> I love all the colors -- there&#x27;s only 1 out of 12 that doesn&#x27;t seem like it would work with my skin tone and I&#x27;m sure it work great for someone else.  Great bargain, the colors all go on smooth, and they seem to last decently well.  I keep going to reapply throughout the day and then realizing I don&#x27;t actually need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have the issues that some people seem to have had with the lipsticks being broken or misshapen -- it must depend on shipping and handling, and hopefully this is a rare issue.  One lipstick did seem in danger of falling out of its tube but I managed to firmly put it back in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I would say these are a wonderful deal for the price and I would definitely recommend them to a friend.</li>
            <li> Though a couple were melted and damaged during shipping:( I must say beautiful colors, wears so soft and very pigmented.its outcome from what I expected for the price was beyond expectations:)</li>
            <li> I just received this items after 2 weeks of waiting but when I open the package Im so disappointed half of the package was already damage. I really wanted to returm it actually. I bought this for a gift but its really useless. i</li>
            <li> This set has a great collection of colours, and the lipsticks are creamy. You do not need to add more colors to your make up bag.</li>
            <li> Lighter than expected</li>
            <li> I recently bought this set at a makeup show. The colors are much more pigmented than I expected. I thought that the lipsticks would be sheer but they are very colorful. The array of colors is great. There are colors for everyone. Even if you are afraid to try colored lipsticks these colors are \\&quot;subtle\\&quot; enough for you to wear. They have somewhat of a glossy finish to them as well. My mom also bought a set and we both love them. I am definitely a shany-holic lol. I have bought lots of their items and have never been dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> Not whaf i expected... could be better</li>
            <li> Once again....as previous reviewers discussed...the lipsticks came damaged.  If it weren&#x27;t for that...I would&lt;br /&gt;LOVE this set.  Can&#x27;t beat the deal, but 4 lipsticks were stuck in top lid, completely damaged, and 3 others&lt;br /&gt;had tops of actual lipsticks smeared off.  If you are fortunate enough to get a complete set undamaged, you&lt;br /&gt;will be very happy.</li>
            <li> I got these lipsticks in the mail yesterday. I was not impressed at all. When I opened thew package to swatch them two of the lipsticks were broken inside the tube. There was little to no color pigment with most colors. These lipsticks reminded me of the diy cryon lipsticks a made once. I will not be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> I bought these lipsticks for a family member as a gift. As she opened the lipsticks, each one came out broken! It was so embarrassing and I was terribly disappointed. Do not buy this product!!!</li>
            <li> This product is okay.. its pretty oily and doesnt look very smoother when it is on but from far away doesnt look so bad. I like the colors. The light pink one works best for me. This is a good product if you need lots of colors quick and cant afford to buy each individually at wal-greens or what not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so bummed this product has 4 stars. I just received the set and decided to open it to check them before giving it away as a gift. WoW!! The box is full of dust and dark stains, there was lipstick smudged on the lipsticks to top it off. Also the lipsticks are broken off!!! What a disappointment. I have no time for a return. What a waste of money I&#x27;m gonna make sure Shany cosmetics know about this. I&#x27;m sure they get tons of complains. It shows how unprofessional they are. The colors are ok. Pigmentation? NYX is wayyyy better. Save your money. If you are on a budget go to your local target and buy elf products. Get your moneys worth elsewhere. You have been Warned! Smh</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I tried them on. I&#x27;m light brown skin and only two I don&#x27;t care for. Over all very pretty colors and long lasting! If you love lipstick like I do this is a must have.</li>
            <li> First, they&#x27;re not very close to the lipsticks in the picture. I expected a lot of reds, but the colors I received are very pink and nude- but they are absolutely beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;Second, when I opened the Amazon box, the box of lipstick was completely ripped apart where it&#x27;s supposed to be together. No big deal, I taped it and it looks fine.&lt;br /&gt;Third, I opened all of the lipsticks to swatch them, and about four of them fell out into my lap. I had to push them back into the tubes. After that, no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this four stars because the colors are not the same as shown here. (Although in my opinion, the colors are more beautiful in real life.)</li>
            <li> The colores are vibrant and the lipstick stays on well. The black lipstick cases are nice also. I shared my lipsticks with my daughter and she loves them</li>
            <li> I have yet to apply the lipsticks on myself but I swatched them all. Pretty colors. However, you have to apply more than one coat to get the full color. Overall, they are okay.</li>
            <li> Cheap and they all arrived broken</li>
            <li> Almost met my specifications</li>
            <li> I ordered this item as a gift and when the box arrived the seal was broken and two lipsticks were missing another one was a totally different brand! A lot of the lipsticks were also falling out of the tubes, I&#x27;m surprised they weren&#x27;t broken, I would not buy this again</li>
            <li> 1star...Probably because there was high expectation from this product even though the latest review mentioned it arrived defective.  I encountered similar problem where the product arrived with broken lipsticks &#x3D;(.    3 stars..We&#x27;ve kept the lipsticks because the durability seems to be very good.  The temperature is most likely the cause for the sticks to fall out when arrived.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these colors! The lipstick is amazing and it goes on so smoothly. Thank you Shany for such wonderful lipstick! I look forward to trying other Shany products!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE LIPSTICKS order for my moms bIRTHDAY:) SHE LOVE THEM AND SHE IS DARK SKIN SO IT GOES WITH HER COMPLEXION REALLY WELL</li>
            <li> Thank you for a great transaction!~ These lipsticks seem to be good but I haven&#x27;t used them on me just my clients.  One thing that threw me off was that the color on the bottom of the lipstick is a totally different color than what&#x27;s inside the tube.  So I have to open them all up to find what color i&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> Shany lipsticks are smooth going on. Lasts a long time and the color stays true and the shine is great. Very moisturizing and I love the fact that it&#x27;s not animal tested. I love the case design as well! High-class stuff!</li>
            <li> This Lipstick was very moisturizing to my lips.It also has a great color pay-off.With the 12 color options,you have a lip color for every mood.</li>
            <li> The lipsticks are vibrant and wild colors i love it! i hope to try out more of the SHANY cosmetics soon(:</li>
            <li> I absolutely love all of these! It comes with a great assortment of colors, an they all feel and look great. Looking forward to getting more products from here!</li>
            <li> There are a plethora of colors for every mood and outfit and they leave your lips feeling smooth and hydrated!</li>
            <li> I bought this set as a Christmas present for a secret santa gift, and I have to say I&#x27;m displeased. I opened the box to make sure all of the lipsticks were there and were in acceptable condition, and half of the lipsticks had come out of the container and had smushed against the lid before I even opened them! The lipsticks no longer look new and I&#x27;m debating whether or not I should actually give this as a present anymore. I would really like a refund! If you&#x27;re buying this for yourself, I&#x27;d just be prepared that they are not securely packaged in the containers, so a lot of them will be smuged before you receive them. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying them as a gift!!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t include a bright red as I was hoping for. Still a great deal though!</li>
            <li> I saw the other reviews about lipstick being everywhere and stuff.. Still Ä± wanted to give it a try.. It came as a normal clean box .. I opened it an yeah lipsticks do fall of because they are not connectd to the base but if you squeeze them down with your fingers there won&#x27;t be a problem and yes the tip of them came as crashed but isn&#x27;t much of a problem.. The colors are really pretty.. Overall Ä± liked them..</li>
            <li> Came in perfect condition! None of the Lipsticks were broken or smashed,Giving as gift so very pleased!</li>
            <li> I love every color.I think the bad reviews are being written by compeating more expensive makeup brands trying to throw salt. They came fast the color lasts gose on smooth and the packaging s beautiful.</li>
            <li> Ok they were alright I guess. I bought them to give as a gift but since they were all damaged I had to keep them. Pretty disapointed I was really looking foward to giving them as a present for christmas. Just know that if you do get them they will probably be damaged :(</li>
            <li> My bf bought me this lipsticks and I absolutely love them . I can wear any color that I want for the day and they all look so great :D they are everything I was looking for ^.^</li>
            <li> it was a Christmas present and when it came, all the lipsticks fell out of the tubes. not what I wanted to give away as a present. very disappointed and will not be buying again.</li>
            <li> All but one of the lipsticks were damaged and stuck to the tops of the caps. The picture showed red colors and there was only one red in the whole box.</li>
            <li> I love every single color from this lipstick set! all of the lipsticks go on smoothly. I know this will last me a long time and all of the lipsticks set well with my brown skin complexion. The only downfall is that I am not sure where to start!</li>
            <li> My wife loves the gift I bought her</li>
            <li> I am not recommond to buy it, received with broken, all lipsticks were stick on the lids, bad quality and lip sticks were too old.  Most of the lipsticks arrived damaged/broken with the lipsticks broken from the base and stuck up inside the tube cover.</li>
            <li> Not the color shades I was hoping for. Also fair warning, if the box (Or actual tube) is ever left upside down, the next time you open it the stick will fall out of the tube. I kept it upside down so I could see which color I was selecting (Color sticker under the tube) but when I picked them up most of them fell out and I have to reattach them.</li>
            <li> Do not recommend! Lipsticks arrived all broken :(</li>
            <li> Product more wonderful&lt;br /&gt;Product beyond description&lt;br /&gt;I advise everyone Bsthaddamh Genuine First, because he was sure of it personally&lt;br /&gt;I am very wonderful wonderful performance&lt;br /&gt;I loved this product.</li>
            <li> Bulk buying is a great way to save money and this is an awesome brand and product. I  will definitly buy again for our school!</li>
            <li> Great lipstick very pigmented, creamy, and easy to apply I am highly satisfied with this purchase and do recommend to any lipstick lover</li>
            <li> I could only use a handful of these lipsticks.  The other colors wasnt right.</li>
            <li> these were fine. i wish they had lasted a bit longer . but great for the cost.</li>
            <li> Terrible product!  All of the tubes broken internally. The first tube I opened the lip stick came flying out and landed on the floor. Checked the others, carefully opening, just a poor product all the way around.</li>
            <li> The colors are pale and look waxy like crayons. They smell weird and are simply not pretty. I was very disappointed!</li>
            <li> fast delivery ---nice product ---would buy again</li>
            <li> I was in love with the lipstick! The colors are great and it goes on smooth. But I tried them all and some were broken. Even the ones that didn&#x27;t come broken started falling out and got stuck at the top of the cap. Going to return these.</li>
            <li> Ordered these for my wife for Christmas. The lipstick fell out of the container each time she opened one. She said she had never seen anything like it. Obviously very poor quality control. She said the lipstick itself was very hard to put on.</li>
            <li> Got them, some were broken had to scrap them out of the cover (top lid) was messy doing that process. The color swatches don&#x27;t match the actual color of lipstick, they come off easy and I got many duplicates. I suppose this is what I get for buying cheap lipsticks in bulk, but they serve their purpose and I use them for fun.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and just wanted to try the lipstick myself. Boy did I make a bad choice. The lipstick was melted and the lipstick fell out.</li>
            <li> I received this set as a gift and I have to say, it is hard to find anything critical or negative about it! Out of twelve different shades, there is definitely going to be one you will like! The lipsticks are so smooth and glide on effortlessly. I&#x27;ve even layered them to create a custom shade I really love :) unlike many other lipsticks out there, these feel so moist and don&#x27;t dry out your lips after wearing it all day. Definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> I saw this on a lightning deal and my mother and i both ordered. Most of the lipsticks in both of our orders arrived cracked in half. I read the reviews and took a chance - unfortunately, ours were broken. Colors seemed to go on smooth on my finger, but these were meant to be a gift and it would have been embarrassing. Returned both. Waste of time and money. Disappointment.</li>
            <li> i couldn&#x27;t be happier! Received this as a Christmas gift and they came in perfect condition, my husband did a great blind buy, and they colors are absolutely beautiful! I must confess they are not the most pigmented I have owned, but for the price I am happy to aplply in a 3-4 sequence way. They are really moist and shinny without being sparkly or shimmer, can be worn by themselves or add some gloss on top for a more dramatic, voluminous effect, no fragrance at all , and there is not enough I can say about this set. My fav is the Orange No 01, and always thought orange was an absolute no for me, I am extremly satisfied</li>
            <li> Caused allergies when applied. Some of the lipsticks melted as well (San Francisco temperatures)</li>
            <li> Lipsticks were broken and unusable. Sent back. Very disappointed as the colors were nice but they were not useable since they were 90% broken.</li>
            <li> The quality is very good for the price, but I do have A couple of problems. I didn&#x27;t get the reds and pinks in the photo, the colours I got were more orange, pinks, and creams than anything. And most of these colours are better for lighter skin tones than dark.</li>
            <li> I bought this set a few years ago. The colors are very different from the picture, but all of the colors are more accurately described in the description. The colors also don&#x27;t really match the stickers on the bottom. I do love several of these colors, but especially color #3 - it matches my natural lip color PERFECTLY, but maybe just a little better. I&#x27;m almost out of that lipstick. I&#x27;m yet to find another lipstick that&#x27;s close in color. I wonder if Shany would sell me a set of 12 lipsticks in color #3? Haha. Either way, I recommend because they&#x27;re beautiful colors, and it&#x27;s a lot of variety.</li>
            <li> Lipsticks are NOT matte ! Glossy glossy glossy. Colors are not that pigmented. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend. Colors came broken, and stuck inside of the top cap.</li>
            <li> nothing special.. save your money and spend more on quality not quantity. majority of thee colors look the same and you have to apply multiple times in one sitting just to see color</li>
            <li> None of mine were broken as others have complained about. Also, all the colors matched almost exactly as the shades on the bottom stickers indicated. No off odor, just lipstick smell. idk, maybe some of the reviews are really young. I remember my grandmother kissing me when I was little and she smelled REALLY bad, all talc and pancake makeup so.... The variety is a little strange, a few of the colors are weird so they would probably have to be layered but because there are so many it is not a problem. I got them on a gold box special for less than $1 each so I would say the quality is better than drugstore brand that is comparable price.</li>
            <li> All of my lipsticks were broken. Not happy.</li>
            <li> I love these they didnt give me any problem they are awesome the colors are perfect they goes well with my collection</li>
            <li> This looks like a really great set, awesome color selection. This looks like something I would buy for myself, a relative, or a friend! Something anyone would love :)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come with a red. Was rather dissatisfied with whole order.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure why these have such great reviews...&lt;br /&gt;When I opened at least four of the lipsticks, the actual lipstick part was stuck in the top and I had to hit it against something to make it come out.  Then, the lipstick along with the plastic base that&#x27;s supposed to be inside the bottom part of the lipstick, was also stuck in the top.&lt;br /&gt;  The colors of lipstick in the collection don&#x27;t really make much sense. .. they need to come up with a light skin and dark skin collection because now I&#x27;m stuck with seven lipsticks that I won&#x27;t be able to use.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;m just not pleased with these...</li>
            <li> This product is alright depends on what your looking for ,value or quality</li>
            <li> Something for everyone and ever outfit, I kept the packaging for storage, it makes it much easier to find them, and experiment with a different color</li>
            <li> Set of 12 lipstics for 20$s is totally worth the money. Colors are nice too for everyday use. One of the lipsticks was broken and hence 4 stars.</li>
            <li> This product was good.the down fall was that half of the lipsicks were melted to the top of the cap,not sure if is from bad shipment or just the product it self.  also when i atemped o apply the lipsticks hey were falling apart. he colors ae really pretty and the price was reasoable.</li>
            <li> These lipsticks smell, they have a horrible consistency and the color wears off too quickly. I used one about three times and gave them all away after that.</li>
            <li> The only problem I had was there were no names of the lipsticks only numbers...That is the only reason I have given it 4 stars instead of 5    check out my review on youtube.    [...]</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint with these lipsticks is the fact that wen I opened most of them the lipstick stuck to the cap. I think the lipsticks are pretty decent still and good for what I wanted which was to try out a variety of colors. I would say overall the low price makes these a pretty good buy.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected for the price. It arrived quickly and not a stick broken, nothing smudged or chipped  my item was great. The only thing that threw me off was the pigment colors they DO NOT match the actual colors of the stickers at the bottom of tube (the lipstick is darker, the stickers are lighter) but I honestly didn&#x27;t care, the lipstick last long and looks good on me and for 12 different colors for less that 20$ I can&#x27;t complain!</li>
            <li> I bought these lipsticks due to the large selection for the price and all of the positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I work as a makeup artist, so bought these to be used on clients for 1-4hr shoots.&lt;br /&gt;When I opened them EVERY single one was completely broken and melted to the lid. I was able to hit them all back into the base though from the outside. The color of the pigment does NOT closely match the sticker on any of my lipsticks. The one that had a hot pink sticker was more of a purple/fuchsia and the one that looked plum on the outside was actually red. The pigmentation was hit or miss. The one that turned out to be red is like a hard plastic stick. It has no useful pigmentation. The fuchsia one went on decently well, but worse than my wet n wild lipstick I bought from the drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: If you want a moderately to highly pigmented lipstick that goes on smoothly. These are NOT for you.</li>
            <li> It Was a gift and my family just love them!! They Was so excited!!</li>
            <li> got them for christmas and i love the colors! id recomend them to my friends!!</li>
            <li> I really love this lipstick set, you get a bargain for the price and variety of colors to chose from! Would let anyone know about this set that is looking for long-lasting lips!</li>
            <li> The lipsticks have different variety of shades! They go on smooth and easy! It doesn&#x27;t smear! A little goes a long way! :)</li>
            <li> These are great - you get a huge variety and they are all super creamy and pigmented! The packaging is super sleek too!</li>
            <li> great selection of color.  the lipsticks tend to fall out of tube when opening.</li>
            <li> I am a makeup artist and I use Shany products all the time! They have a great product that lasts and at a great price.</li>
            <li> I purchase this and some other things , because i want to sell this products at my boutique  and i have to tell you the colors are very nice and stays on after you eat , my Mother was my model so we try her chanel lipstick and she ate and the color was gone, then we try the shany lisptick and incredible results ... the color stay on the whole time and well my mother very happy she says , she will change her chanel make up for shany. another thing the package looks very nice elegant not cheap and it was awesome buy ..................... i&#x27;m taking very serious to sell this product ... thank you</li>
            <li> I receive these in the mail yesterday....the colors are beautiful unfortunately the lipstick was falling apart when opening it the color would fall off and stay in the cap.... colors were really pretty but other than that i am never ordering from them agaim</li>
            <li> not all in good shape</li>
            <li> As far as shipping time, the package arrived in a decent time frame.&lt;br /&gt;Going through each color, I noticed it took a little more effort to get the full color on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit disappointed that I didn&#x27;t receive certain colors that were shown in the images for this product.&lt;br /&gt;Overall they&#x27;re decent for the price you get for 12 assorted lipsticks.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get your hopes up, you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is that the colors are pastel reds thought that would come because so requests, they are most of all glitter</li>
            <li> I just got my package and I am in love ðwith the product shany I&#x27;ll buy lots of stuff from u I love all the make up u have and I love that is in good prizes I would give u 10 stars if I could thanks a lot for making us look beautiful with ure product âºâº</li>
            <li> NEVER BUYING THIS PRODUCT AGAIN! All my lipsticks are broken!!!! I JUST RECEIVED THEM ON THE MAIL RIGHT NOW!!! Never again!!!!!!</li>
            <li> THEY CAME COMPLETELY MELTED!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of the price is so cheap and positive review. I didn&#x27;t expect anything mush as it cheap but Shany&#x27;s lipstick is long wearing, moisturizing and valuable with the price.  I gave 4 star instead of 5 because they was a bit damaged on the tip.</li>
            <li> When I first ordered these I wasn&#x27;t expecting much. But once I got the lipsticks I was really impressed. They all had good pigmentation and lasted a good amount of time. I would say if you don&#x27;t have that many lipsticks you should buy this! It&#x27;s totally worth it. :)</li>
            <li> Expedient shipping and excellent sellers! I had absolutely no problems with this product, and I am very satisfied with my purchase. This product is just as described, and definitely worth the money. All of the lipsticks are so smooth and shiny. As an extra bonus, they even moisturize your lips keeping them smooth and silky. Amazing product and amazing sellers!</li>
            <li> Love the colors all of them last forever while on the lips and they all for the exception of one go with my skin tone absolutely  love this line</li>
            <li> Liked the variety of colors. Out of all 12, only 2 didn&#x27;t suit me but the major complaint was after applying, the lipstick would seem to clump on lips, kind of grainy. wouldnt recommend.</li>
            <li> Loved them all! Great gifts for my friends and really good on price!</li>
            <li> Really liked all the colors. and I order 24 pieces and out of that only 2 were not in good shape. But i brought them in good shape.</li>
            <li> Was sent the wrong colors!!! Wouldve loved to get these colors!</li>
            <li> Very poor quality, several of the lipsticks were broken</li>
            <li> Took a while to receive, and I&#x27;m actually quite displease with the fact that in the pictures posted, it shows a good array of red colors. But as I opened the container and inspected the individual colors, there are no reds whatsoever! The main reason why I purchased this set was because I thought there would be a lot of pretty reds, but there is none. Unfortunately, this is not for me, but a birthday gift for a dear friend of mine. I hope she&#x27;s happy with the colors, because I sure am not.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the other comments I was skeptical, but I decided I would take a chance. I&#x27;m glad I did!  The box was packaged appropriately and nothing inside was damaged.  All of the lipstick colors matched the color dot on the bottom of the tube. I&#x27;m very happy with my decision to buy and would buy again.  There is a very nice variety of colors from which to choose.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Product arrived broken package not damaged and the product wasn&#x27;t melted into lids an was still in the lipstick shape. But all product was stuck to each lid of the lipsticks had to tap the lids hard to knock the product out some of them broke coming out after tapping them others did not but all of them stuck to the lids again once I reassembled them/replace the caps.</li>
            <li> I love the colors of these lipsticks but the wearing does not last long. the lipsticks are very greasy and need to be applied numerous times.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item through the actual Shany website due to the reviews about them being shipped improperly. I will say that I love all the colors. I am an African American woman and love the options. I can pull off a pink lip or a nude lip. The lipsticks however aren&#x27;t secure in the tube several of them fell out when opened. They were damaged the whole lipstick just fell out. However, Im ok with that I just don&#x27;t turn them upside down! :)</li>
            <li> When i recieved these items, i was truely in love with them! The color is long lasting and looks great! i recomended then to alot of my makeup loving friends! (:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/SHANY-Slick-Shine-Lipstick-Set/dp/B005UL3LVY/ref&#x3D;cm_cmu_pg_i</li>
            <li> I just received this Slick &amp; Shine Lipstick set today. After looking it over and trying on several of the lipsticks, I&lt;br /&gt;think it is a bargain. You get 12 shades of mostly cool colors. The lipstick has alot of wax in it but once it is on it is&lt;br /&gt;smooth and creamy. Like most lipsticks, the color tab doesn&#x27;t match exactly with the actual lipstick color but it isn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;a problem. You get 12 great lipsticks for a great price. Just don&#x27;t expect $30 lipstick quality with each one.</li>
            <li> I chose this because this was on my daughter christmas list.  She love fixing herself up.  And if you ask you too.</li>
            <li> I received these very fast and when I looked at all the beautiful colors, I was very impressed with the vast selection for the price I paid for these lipsticks.  They feel great on your lips and look great.  Keep a few for yourself and give a few away, they make a nice gift to a friend.</li>
            <li> My sister bought this set of lipstick a while ago. I borrowed one from her one day and she had to ask me more than once to get it back. She ended up giving me most of them because she doesn&#x27;t wear lipstick very often. They are superb. The color you see in the tube is the color that will be on your lips; and for a while! They last a long time since they moisturize and don&#x27;t rub off when smooching your man. My boyfriend used to hate kissing me while I had lipstick on but with this he knows it doesn&#x27;t get on him so he lets me smooch away. He asks me when I wear it how I get it to stay on for so long, I smile and tell him it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li> You get 12 GREAT lipsticks for 25.00 that mean you&#x27;re paying 2.03 per lipstick. Drugstore make up doesn&#x27;t even come that cheap! And they look great better than a lot of other lipsticks I&#x27;ve tried. Doesn&#x27;t dry my lips out but i always put an lip balm on over it just in case.</li>
            <li> I love, love, LOVE these lipsticks!  With 12 colors to choose from, you get a little bit of everything and some great dupes of your favorite high end products. The colors last all day and have a beautiful finish! Shany Cosmetics also ships super fast and has great  customer service! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much variety in the colors. Different shades of pink and red - hardly any browns or plums.</li>
            <li> The lipsticks fall apart when you take the top off.</li>
            <li> the  colors are great ( 2 were damaged)</li>
            <li> What a lovely new product.  I had never heard of this brand, but took a chance when the reviews were so good, and I am very glad I did.  It goes on so smoothly and my lips feel so good, almost like lip balm with color.  And the color lasts.  Glad to have such a wide selection of colors, however there are about 5 that I can never use and will probably give to someone with the right coloring to use.  Thank you Shany, I will be back to order more when needed!</li>
            <li> THERE ARE NO RED LIPSTICKS IN THIS SET which I was a tad upset about that seeing as the picture makes them look more red, but this set does come with nudes, oranges, pinks, and plums. The quality is great, really creamy and doesn&#x27;t dry out your lips the way that most lipsticks do. It stays on for a while and doesn&#x27;t wipe right off (which is nice). Has a slight shine and is very pigmented and definitely worth $20 ð</li>
            <li> Beautiful package and lovely colors, so smooth and the colors look beautiful. I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I received my lipsticks on yesterday.  I am so pleased with my purchase.  You cannot beat the price for 12 quality lipsticks.  Some, of course, I love better than others because of the color payoff.  I have a youtube review of the lipsticks on my channel.  I will recommend these lipsticks to others.  Check out my video:  http://youtu.be/wDlPsd0f4O4</li>
            <li> Colours don&#x27;t match the samples or the pictures one bit. The quality isn&#x27;t that good, and almost all of them were stuck when I opened</li>
            <li> I love these lipsticks! They go on smooth and have a variety of beautiful colors for all skin tones. The ingredients and color of these lipsticks are worth what you pay. The only problem I had with them is that they should of put the labels of color on the top instead of the bottom because I turned them upside down so I could see the colors and know which one I wanted and one of the lipsticks fell into the cap because their upside-down if you have the label right-side up.</li>
            <li> All the different colors are beautiful</li>
            <li> Terrible! All were broken and falling out of tubes!!! Should have returned!</li>
            <li> Worst lipstick I&#x27;ve ever used in my life.</li>
            <li> Junk they fell apart my wife thru them all out!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t got a chance to use my lipstick yet because it arrived with all the sticks either melted it broke off and stuck inside the tops. I had higher hopes for this but I don&#x27;t feel like going through all the trouble to return it.. I can say it arrived quick in two days ððð²ðð</li>
            <li> This is nice to send as a gift to your family member or your friend. It contains good quality lipsticks</li>
            <li> beautifull colors, no irritaton</li>
            <li> i really dont know y i wasted my monney on this.i guess i read the reviews and decided to give it a try,but it wasnt worth it.it felt like i had some cheap groundnutoil or baby oil on my lips.if uve used good lipsticks u would never want substance like these on your lips.some of the color dont even show ,and u have to keep applying before u see the real thing.well the 1 star i guess would be for the variety .they are such beautiful shades only if they got it right ,it would av been perfect.</li>
            <li> Lipsticks came in today ! Earlier than expected too ! Very happy, they arent damaged or anything like that ! deffiently recomend!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  The lipsticks got here in perfect state, the colors are beautiful and very pigmented.  I am in love with the whole set!</li>
            <li> these were a good price, but sometimes you get what you pay for as when these lipsticks showed up they had all detached from their posts, causing all the lipsticks to be damaged. Again, you always get what you pay for and this was yet another example of this saying. Oh well.</li>
            <li> I got this product as a Christmas gift (it was on my wishlist)&lt;br /&gt;I give this five stars because it&#x27;s a great offer for so many lipsticks. In brand stores, one lipstick can cost as much as $30 but here you have 12 great colors for the given price. I tried one color and it looks great.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this as a gift to someone, or yourself:)</li>
            <li> The colors were extremely beautiful but after applying it, the lipstick would just kinda clump up on the outline of my lips. So it made it look like I was wearing lip liner.</li>
            <li> I bought this a Christmas present for my daughter. She has had no complaints.</li>
            <li> These lipsticks are nice and smooth. They feel nice on the lips. I wanted more reds when I ordered this and I did get some good colors out of it, but there are pinks in here that I don&#x27;t use and also some darker/bland colors.</li>
            <li> After seeing other reviews..... I was very sceptical about purchasing this product but, I closed my eyes and did so anyways. When they arrived, they were wonderful. None of them were broken and the were all in place. The only downside is that most of the colours didn&#x27;t match my skin tone.</li>
            <li> You get what u paid for. The labels are mixed and some missing. I just use it couple of times and throw it away.</li>
            <li> I like this product, not so much for the coverage, because it is not a true lipstick, I would consider it as a lip gloss. The colors are great and the variety of colors are really great! I would prefer a more textured lipstick that would stay on your lips a little longer. If you prefer light and shine this is just the item you are looking for!</li>
            <li> Colors are true to the sticker on the bottom and great colors, even if some were too dark for me!</li>
            <li> I tried on each lipstick and they aren&#x27;t as pigmented as I&#x27;d hoped, they seem cheaply made and I have to continuously rub the lipstick on my lips for it to show up good. These lipsticks go on more like a lip gloss. I def won&#x27;t be purchasing any more lipsticks from this company. Super Dissapointed! Lesson Learned is- Too Cheap of a price means Cheap Product.</li>
            <li> Not sure why some people have had issues. Product arrived in perfect condition. Lipstick has no scent or taste (good thing). The colors are not exact to the stickers on bottom but they are close. Colors are versatile and could be worn by many. Glad I purchased despite some bad reviews.</li>
            <li> Great Product, the item was way better that expected specially the quality.</li>
            <li> I am very sad because it was gift for my friends because I am visiting outside USA in 24th november  and I got the lipstick broken n others some were out I insert inside...so I am very upset with these product.. I have no time to return it n get back.. I will never buy these product again</li>
            <li> I love this product. The color is so rich and it is really worth the price. Of course not ever color is going to look great on everyone. The bright pink kind of looks weird on me but the deep violet color looks amazing. I am so happy I purchased these lipsticks.</li>
            <li> These lipsticks are a great value particularly when compared with luxury brands of make up. The colors are lovely and the lipstick is creamy.  I am a new and very satisfied customer. I am now going to search for other Shany products</li>
            <li> I love the wide range of colors, the creaminess, and the box for storing the lipsticks. I didn&#x27;t find them to be highly pigmented as others have said and I agree with the person who said the color of the sticker doesn&#x27;t match what&#x27;s in the tube. Neither of these things are an issue to me. I think they give the right amount of color for me and I always open a tube to check the color anyway, I don&#x27;t rely on the sticker. This is a great product for the price!</li>
            <li> I thought the colors would look like the ones in the photos.  Well they&#x27;re not even close.  The were all very pale shades that I can&#x27;t imagine they would look good on anyone except a ghost.  If this is what you&#x27;re after, you&#x27;ll like this deal.  I gave it 2 stars because I thought it was nicely packaged.  I am sending these back.</li>
            <li> So much better than expected. Purchased to have more color options outside the bright reds and nudes I normally purchase. Packaged arrived quickly and in perfect condition. None of the sticks were broken or melted. Being lipstick, I would plan to have them delivered when you are available to pick up or to your office to avoid melting in the hot sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are varied and not as intense as the image. Lipstick is a very creamy consistency and goes on looking very natural, not junky &amp; thick at all. Reminds me of wearing a lip stain. Each color has good pigmentation for everyday, easy wear. If you are looking for a highly pigmented and thick lipstick, these are not for you. These are the easy to wear, apply without a mirror, natural lipsticks. Even the red comes out red, but makes it look like your natural lips just happen to be red. For everyday use, prefer over my Dior, YSL and Nars lipsticks. Adding a lip primer or lip liner gave me that thicker look. Lip colors don&#x27;t bleed on the skin even without lipliner. Lipstick doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance or taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: stickers on individual sticks are lighter than the lipstick but that doesn&#x27;t bother me. Bottom line is that these are wonderful lipsticks, most especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Like everyone says when shipping the lipstick will smoosh against the top of the cap of the lipstick tube. If you tap strongly on the tops the stick will unstick and go back in place. And then open the tube gingerly and softly push the stick back in place and its like it never happened. Except theres a dent on the top of the lipstick which with use will go away. The colors are pretty (most, the orange is pretty orange and nude is weird) and stay on well after food and stuff. Its okay for yourself but not a gift for others just because of that shipping problem.</li>
            <li> I received these as a gift, and the formula is really wonderful. Unfortunately, my &#x27;number 7&#x27; is broken at the base, and &#x27;number 2&#x27; (which is not so unfortunate since I liked this colour least) won&#x27;t twist up whatsoever. Past this, they go on easily, I&#x27;ve never had any trouble with the cap coming off in my purse and I trust it to stay when I twist all the way down. These are very smooth, satiny/shining finish to them, and come in a good variety (pure orange, classic red, purple tones and even a perfect nude for my skin tone!) I really like them and would recommend at this price for quality. Some depot-ing may be required, but that didn&#x27;t bug me one bit.</li>
            <li> not the variety of colors I had wanted, but a good bang for the buck</li>
            <li> Do not waist your time all 12 lipsticks were melted to the top of the lids I did not let them sit outside either I made sure to get them inside as soon as they arived because I thought that might happen after reading all theses coments with the same story as me. I made sure to get a full refund</li>
            <li> Only 3 of the lipsticks came intact.  2 were smudged at the top of the lipstick, and  MOST were in the cap. Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> The product is nice, problem is - like other reviewers have said - several of the lipsticks arrived damaged/broken with the lipsticks broken from the base and stuck up inside the tube cover. Out of set 5 were damaged and 7 were not, so we&#x27;re returning them. It&#x27;s unfortunate that so many were damaged - these were a gift. The colors are pretty, a good variety, and the lipsticks ARE nice. Since several other reviewers said their set arrived damaged this seems to be a common defect and not just a random problem with this product. Because of the quality issue I would not recommend this box set for purchase.</li>
            <li> for the price they are a great bargain, but the quality of the lipstick is only ok. had no problems with the packaging, the lipsticks all came in good shape, none were damaged or falling out.</li>
            <li> These are okay- but I expected them to have a deeper pigmentation, as they apply on quite lightly. They arrived as per the scheduled delivery date, but I was not pleased with the shipment packaging because it was set loosely and 4 out of the 12 lipsticks were dislodged when I opened them. I love Shany Cosmetics because of their level of quality and affordability, but I was not too thrilled about this product. If you don&#x27;t mind manually setting in a few of the lipsticks if they arrive dislodged, and the not-so-deep pigmentation- then, this is a good buy, especially since it applies on smoothly and feels nice on the lips.</li>
            <li> Very bad, also it&#x27;s cheap I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone to bus this the all the lipsticks broke before I even used them.. The colors were just not soo good.</li>
            <li> Having many colors to chose from or blend to make my own is always very nice. It feels get on and stays on nicely.Packaging was also.  I thought there would be red in this set but there wasn&#x27;t the picture shows reds that was my only disappointment. It came with two plum colors, two mauve colors, two nude colors, four bright pink and four light pink, Three of them i had to press back down in the case. Over all its a nice set.</li>
            <li> Pros - these are some beautiful colors. I especially like the pink lipsticks and the orange-y shade too. Also, the lipstick goes on smoothly and for the price, this is a good set. I am glad I purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - when the lipsticks arrived, two sticks were dented from having come into contact with the tops of their caps / lids. They were still usable, so I didn&#x27;t return the set. I figured perhaps the box could have been more cushioned, or that they were exposed to heat somehow during transit. But if you like your lipsticks looking perfect in the tube (and not like you&#x27;ve dropped them or a kid has used them), then you may want to avoid this set. A few months later, I left one of the tubes in my purse. There were not a ton of other items in the purse and the weather was not hot. However, that lipstick also kind of fell onto its cap and got crushed. It is still usable, but given that I was pretty careful with it, and that it had not been exposed to extreme conditions or heat, I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> These lipsticks are just what they say...moisturizing! And how can you beat twelve lipsticks at this price? You just can&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> This is Shany glowing with perfection!! You get 12 very beautiful day to night looks, the best part you can make them as demure or as BOLD as you want to go. The quality is outstanding a very good line to add to your collection!![[ASIN:B005UL3LVY SHANY Slick &amp; Shine Lipstick Set - Set of 12 Famouse Colors]]</li>
            <li> I think SHANY Cosmetics makes excellent makeup and even better prices. You don&#x27;t need to spend hundreds of dollars to achieve your look! I would definitely recommend this package. I will be a repeat customer! :)</li>
            <li> This lipstick set is great, so many colours !  Have&#x27;nt tried all of them yet, but I have lots of time to. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I love all the colors.&lt;br /&gt;Some last longer than others.&lt;br /&gt;They are really smooth and don&#x27;t dry out my lips.</li>
            <li> These came apart into the lid not at all happy</li>
            <li> Well Ill just keep this simple. When i got the lipsticks they seem cool until you open it. All the lipsticks were not attached to the bottom handle. I have to open them one by one and kinda push down the wax sticks to stay in the little tube. And they dont even put the name of the color on the lipstick either they just numbered them...which also sucks. other then that the colors are nice n smooth.</li>
            <li> i bought this set of lipstick for my mom as a christmas gift.. i kind of knew what i was getting myself into because of the reviews.. i do wish that i didnt have the same problem as other people, which was that the lipstick is broken..or stuck at the top. i opened every single one, and 10 out of 12 were stuck.. the least i could do so that my mom wouldnt be disappointed and i wouldnt be embarrased was just to push them back into their position and push down a little so they would stick to the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall, my mom was very satisfied with the richness in color and the smoothness of the stick. it goes on very well  (super creamy) and lasts long enough!</li>
            <li> wasnt broken or anything like that got here fast, just wish it didnt rub of so easily</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and lasts. Worked for exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> The product came very quickly and was in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;The lipsticks were a very creamy and moist combination. The colors are a large variety and very bright.</li>
            <li> shared it with my family and there was a color for everyone..</li>
            <li> The products is good but the envelop to send  no</li>
