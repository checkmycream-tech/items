            <li>Lathers up to a delicious smell, rinses out easily, doesn&#x27;t dehydrate your hair.</li>
            <li>My sister has been using the Bumble and Bumble shampoos for years (Seaweed), and I&#x27;d tried them at her house, but never seen the attraction (her hair is gorgeous, though).  </li>
            <li>This smells good too.</li>
            <li>Shining I don&#x27; know if this combo would be good for people with oily hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think the shampoo would be good for anyone.</li>
            <li>The coconut smell is great but the shampoo and conditioner are just ok.  </li>
            <li>I was happy to see that it was so much more inexpensive to purchase it online.  </li>
            <li>This is a really great shampoo, it smells good, it doesn&#x27;t foam up a ton, and it washes out really easily.</li>
            <li>But, oh, the lovely non-greasy moisture!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I so love this shampoo!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be pleased!</li>
            <li>My daughter and I have been using this shampoo for a couple months &amp; both love it!  </li>
            <li>I love B&amp;B products so when this came out I grabbed it!</li>
            <li>Enjoy!!</li>
            <li>I needed more shampoo so decided to buy it on line-big mistake !  </li>
            <li>Love B &amp; B!  </li>
            <li>Great product and Quick delivery!  </li>
            <li>Bumble and Bumble makes amazing hair products.</li>
            <li>It is nice not to have to bother with a conditioner too.  </li>
            <li>It just didn&#x27;t seem to do anything spectacular to my hair to justify the price.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your hair looking healthy and gorgeous.</li>
            <li>So, in honor of CoCo Creme, I purchased this shampoo for my sister who was familiar with its great performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Smells great and leaves my hair clean.  </li>
            <li>&amp; Amazon&#x27;s price is the best I&#x27;ve found so far.  </li>
            <li>Love it, love it, love it!  </li>
            <li>The mild, pleasant coconut scent reminds me of the beach.</li>
            <li>; very smooth transaction.</li>
            <li>It is one of the better shampoos that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Just wish it performed better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with my hair...</li>
            <li>I was expecting more for the price.</li>
            <li>The more I use this moisturizing shampoo, the silkier my hair becomes.  </li>
            <li>I am most impressed, as I have never found a shampoo that works so well to bring my hair back to life.  </li>
            <li>I have curly hair and received a free sample of this shampoo and liked it after trying the sample.  </li>
            <li>So fresh smelling and good for your hair</li>
            <li>This has to be one of the most overpriced junk i ever bought.</li>
            <li>I have used this for many years.  </li>
            <li>I able to comb through my hair after using.</li>
            <li>The Creme de Coco Shampoo is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I have been using Bumble and Bumble shampoo for years and have always been pleased with it, however this latest bottle seems to be diluted.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure Bumble and Bumble would not want their product marketed this way.  </li>
            <li>Just ok.  </li>
            <li>It arrived promptly, reasonably priced and the product is great</li>
            <li>I love this enough to re-purchase again, though. :D</li>
            <li>i was very excited to save up my swagbucks and buy this with amazon cards</li>
            <li>Very rich and luxurious</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful product and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>A huge plus is that I&#x27;m not allergic to it and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out like most shampoos.</li>
            <li>(it was more like the effect of using a cheap hotel hair product).  </li>
            <li>Good gentle shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I thought that it would make my hair smooth and give it more shine, but my hair feels like I am using a cheap supermarket brand shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because I&#x27;d always heard the brand was so good, but I haven&#x27;t really noticed anything special about it.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely fine hair, but a TON of it.</li>
            <li>I love the mild coconut scent, and also the way that this shampoo lathers.</li>
            <li>There was nothing fantastic about it, expect for the smell.</li>
            <li>Another fabulous product to try by B&amp;B if you have hair like mine is their Thickening Spray.</li>
            <li>Light smell.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a fabulous product.</li>
            <li>and I love the gentle line I was hoping this would be even more moisturizing but not the case.</li>
            <li>This product pulls out the natural highlights in my hair and creates a very healthy shine.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair shiny &amp; clean, and weightless.</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair feeling silky and soft - love it!</li>
            <li>I use it along with the super rich conditioner.</li>
            <li>Though expensive, it lasts much longer than most shampoos, has a great lather, smells good, and makes my hair shiny.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, wavy hair, and i bought this shampoo because i have read other good reviews about it.</li>
            <li>Yes they can be pricey, but the quality is very consistent.</li>
            <li>It takes much more than normal to get a lather.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo is nothing special other than the pleasant coconut smell.</li>
            <li>Spend the extra money at a reputable salon!  </li>
            <li>First of all, shampoo were created with one purpose and that is to clean dirt and oil of your head.</li>
            <li>THANKS FOR THE FREE PRIORITY SHIPPING AMAZON</li>
            <li>This stuff is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>smells nice, but i could have used suave and got the same results.</li>
            <li>THAT IS WELL WORTH</li>
            <li>For me, the price has proven to be well worth it</li>
            <li>I was not expecting this to be worth the money, but it is.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s nice to know that this bottle will last me awhile.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money, but no need to overuse.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a decent volumizing shampoo and smell nice</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be OK with that, but when I contacted them about fixing *their* error, they wanted me to ship the product back to them at *</li>
            <li>/&gt;it&#x27;s definitely of a higher viscosity (more fluid) perhaps to cheat customers</li>
            <li>thanks for nothing!</li>
            <li>Like most other B&amp;B shampoos, a little goes a long way &amp; the lather is incredible!  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft, bouncy, and full of body.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and I as I said I am not one to pay more than $5.00 for shampoo prior to this.</li>
            <li>You need very little and it has a lovely light coconut fragrance.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner will end up leaving your hair super soft.</li>
            <li>i have used real bumble &amp; bumble purchased at a salon before and it made my hair and scalp feel amazing, but this product was very watered down and my scalp is very itchy.</li>
            <li>I know I sound like a commercial, but I really have noticed a difference in the quality of my hair.  </li>
            <li>this isnt the real thing&lt;</li>
            <li>~ IT IS TRULY APPRECIATED.</li>
            <li>I order so much through my prime account</li>
            <li>so it isn&#x27;t much of a bargain.</li>
            <li>, don&#x27;t need to use much at all, and it smells heavenly.  </li>
            <li>This product is NOT the real Bumble and Bumble creme de coco product.</li>
            <li>Spend the money and get the real deal from the store or official website.</li>
            <li>Very concentrated.  </li>
            <li>should, this product should be very concentrated</li>
            <li>The shampoo is concentrated so you don&#x27;t need a lot, which was good because my hair is thick.  </li>
            <li>B&amp;B&#x27;s Creme de Coco shampoo adds umph to my super fine &amp; color-treated hair, which is definitely less frizzy &amp; softer after blow drying.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it for fine, dry hair.</li>
            <li>The lathering is decent.</li>
            <li>Although I purchased this shampoo in June, I just started using this particular bottle.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately the conditioner that goes along with it is not as great.</li>
            <li>makes my hair really straight and soft</li>
            <li>It seemed just like a normal shampoo.</li>
            <li>I saw the price went up at Target (where I normally buy this shampoo).  </li>
            <li>my hair straight or let it dry curly and this shampoo makes my hair look better than with other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I have hair down to the middle of my back, but I don&#x27;t need more than a dime size to lather up my whole head!  </li>
            <li>I took a chance as I also saw some positive reviews and hoped that I would be one of the latter.</li>
            <li>- I certainly noticed a BIG difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really sensitive to over-scented products (I&#x27;m the one in the shampoo aisle taking the caps off every bottle).  </li>
            <li>WOW.      </li>
            <li>Wow I wish I read the reviews before ordering this.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner did not have a seal, the products didn&#x27;t smell the same as the real shampoo and conditioner I purchased from Sephora, and the consistency was not as concentrated.</li>
            <li>And, it leaves my hair shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>My hair is EXTREMELY soft after using this.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair which is prone to dryness.</li>
            <li>Instead of being luscious and soft, my hair is drier than ever</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I noticed no difference, but then the second time it left my hair soft and lush.</li>
            <li>ok, not real impressed</li>
            <li>This seemed almost a different texture than what it normally is????</li>
            <li>so when I dry it straight, I often get \\&quot;pouf\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I have really curly, course dry hair</li>
            <li>once I inspected it further, like an old bottle that had been refilled.</li>
            <li>Anything other than that is just pure marketing.</li>
            <li>The other reviewers made it sound like it was more of a moisturizing shampoo, which is what I was looking for, and much to my disappointment, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be.</li>
            <li>I normally have very dry skin with no blemishes.  </li>
            <li>You really only need a small amount compared to many other shampoos.</li>
            <li>When I received the product, I used it right away, but everyday I keep thinking about how it isn&#x27;t the same product I&#x27;ve been using for years.  </li>
            <li>Have used bumble and bumble products in the past, this one is a bit more drying than their others but nothing that a little leave in conditioner once a week won&#x27;t fix.</li>

            <li> I bought this because I&#x27;d always heard the brand was so good, but I haven&#x27;t really noticed anything special about it.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely fine hair, but a TON of it.</li>
            <li> I love the mild coconut scent, and also the way that this shampoo lathers.</li>
            <li> There was nothing fantastic about it, expect for the smell.</li>
            <li> Another fabulous product to try by B&amp;B if you have hair like mine is their Thickening Spray.</li>
            <li> Light smell.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a fabulous product.</li>
            <li> and I love the gentle line I was hoping this would be even more moisturizing but not the case.</li>
            <li> This product pulls out the natural highlights in my hair and creates a very healthy shine.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair shiny &amp; clean, and weightless.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair feeling silky and soft - love it!</li>
            <li> I use it along with the super rich conditioner.</li>
            <li> Though expensive, it lasts much longer than most shampoos, has a great lather, smells good, and makes my hair shiny.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, wavy hair, and i bought this shampoo because i have read other good reviews about it.</li>
            <li> Yes they can be pricey, but the quality is very consistent.</li>
            <li> It takes much more than normal to get a lather.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo is nothing special other than the pleasant coconut smell.</li>
            <li> Spend the extra money at a reputable salon!  </li>
            <li> First of all, shampoo were created with one purpose and that is to clean dirt and oil of your head.</li>
            <li> THANKS FOR THE FREE PRIORITY SHIPPING AMAZON</li>
            <li> This stuff is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> smells nice, but i could have used suave and got the same results.</li>
            <li> THAT IS WELL WORTH</li>
            <li> For me, the price has proven to be well worth it</li>
            <li> I was not expecting this to be worth the money, but it is.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s nice to know that this bottle will last me awhile.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money, but no need to overuse.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a decent volumizing shampoo and smell nice</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be OK with that, but when I contacted them about fixing *their* error, they wanted me to ship the product back to them at *</li>
            <li> /&gt;it&#x27;s definitely of a higher viscosity (more fluid) perhaps to cheat customers</li>
            <li> thanks for nothing!</li>
            <li> Like most other B&amp;B shampoos, a little goes a long way &amp; the lather is incredible!  </li>
            <li> My hair is soft, bouncy, and full of body.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and I as I said I am not one to pay more than $5.00 for shampoo prior to this.</li>
            <li> You need very little and it has a lovely light coconut fragrance.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner will end up leaving your hair super soft.</li>
            <li> i have used real bumble &amp; bumble purchased at a salon before and it made my hair and scalp feel amazing, but this product was very watered down and my scalp is very itchy.</li>
            <li> I know I sound like a commercial, but I really have noticed a difference in the quality of my hair.  </li>
            <li> this isnt the real thing&lt;</li>
            <li> ~ IT IS TRULY APPRECIATED.</li>
            <li> I order so much through my prime account</li>
            <li> so it isn&#x27;t much of a bargain.</li>
            <li> , don&#x27;t need to use much at all, and it smells heavenly.  </li>
            <li> This product is NOT the real Bumble and Bumble creme de coco product.</li>
            <li> Spend the money and get the real deal from the store or official website.</li>
            <li> Very concentrated.  </li>
            <li> should, this product should be very concentrated</li>
            <li> The shampoo is concentrated so you don&#x27;t need a lot, which was good because my hair is thick.  </li>
            <li> B&amp;B&#x27;s Creme de Coco shampoo adds umph to my super fine &amp; color-treated hair, which is definitely less frizzy &amp; softer after blow drying.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it for fine, dry hair.</li>
            <li> The lathering is decent.</li>
            <li> Although I purchased this shampoo in June, I just started using this particular bottle.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the conditioner that goes along with it is not as great.</li>
            <li> makes my hair really straight and soft</li>
            <li> It seemed just like a normal shampoo.</li>
            <li> I saw the price went up at Target (where I normally buy this shampoo).  </li>
            <li> my hair straight or let it dry curly and this shampoo makes my hair look better than with other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have hair down to the middle of my back, but I don&#x27;t need more than a dime size to lather up my whole head!  </li>
            <li> I took a chance as I also saw some positive reviews and hoped that I would be one of the latter.</li>
            <li> - I certainly noticed a BIG difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really sensitive to over-scented products (I&#x27;m the one in the shampoo aisle taking the caps off every bottle).  </li>
            <li> WOW.      </li>
            <li> Wow I wish I read the reviews before ordering this.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner did not have a seal, the products didn&#x27;t smell the same as the real shampoo and conditioner I purchased from Sephora, and the consistency was not as concentrated.</li>
            <li> And, it leaves my hair shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> My hair is EXTREMELY soft after using this.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair which is prone to dryness.</li>
            <li> Instead of being luscious and soft, my hair is drier than ever</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I noticed no difference, but then the second time it left my hair soft and lush.</li>
            <li> ok, not real impressed</li>
            <li> This seemed almost a different texture than what it normally is????</li>
            <li> so when I dry it straight, I often get \\&quot;pouf\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I have really curly, course dry hair</li>
            <li> once I inspected it further, like an old bottle that had been refilled.</li>
            <li> Anything other than that is just pure marketing.</li>
            <li> The other reviewers made it sound like it was more of a moisturizing shampoo, which is what I was looking for, and much to my disappointment, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be.</li>
            <li> I normally have very dry skin with no blemishes.  </li>
            <li> You really only need a small amount compared to many other shampoos.</li>
            <li> When I received the product, I used it right away, but everyday I keep thinking about how it isn&#x27;t the same product I&#x27;ve been using for years.  </li>
            <li> Have used bumble and bumble products in the past, this one is a bit more drying than their others but nothing that a little leave in conditioner once a week won&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> The viscosity and texture of the product is inconsistent with Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s typical high quality shampoos/conditioners.  </li>
            <li> And the price for it is ridiculous, i spent 40 bucks on both the shampoo and conditioner, for those tiny little bottles, that are pretty much travel size.</li>
            <li> Also a plus, a tiny bit goes a very, very long way.</li>
            <li> the next time i went to the salon, my hair lady asked \\&quot; what have you been using in your hair, it feels soo dry?!</li>
            <li> The bottle&#x27;s design was slightly but when compared obviously different and the wording was even in a different language, the smell was different and even the consistency and color.</li>
            <li> I sometimes blow dry and flat iron</li>
            <li> My hair is terribly dry and damaged from the sun here in Hawaii.  </li>
            <li> Despite the price, I decided to try Creme De Cocoa because my hair tends to be dry, and it is wavy</li>
            <li> Then it leaves it dry and stringy.  </li>
            <li> My hair felt somewhat dry and puffy afterward.</li>
            <li> I do have dry and processed hair</li>
            <li> then use one of the tonics after you towel dry your hair.</li>
            <li> My tips are extremely dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> A lot of shampoos don&#x27;t get all the way to the roots, or are too heavy for my hair, or totally not moisturizing.</li>
            <li> For the price of this item, I will NEVER buy from Amazon via a seller (unknown) again.  </li>
            <li> The consistent is quite thick and hard to spread around your head.</li>
            <li> so a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I bought it and use it every other day.  </li>
            <li> I use it around 3 days a week (and use Pantene the other days) and EVERY time I use this product someone comments on whether I colored my hair or I get a compliment on how my hair looks.</li>
            <li> I had seen a couple of reviews where people had stated that the product received was not consistent with what they were used to.</li>
            <li> I read one other review from a buyer who had the same complaint.  </li>
            <li> The price is not worth the quantity that you get for it.</li>
            <li> but i think it&#x27;s not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I had just had a baby (which is why I was buying shampoo online to begin with), so loading a newborn in the car and going down to my post office</li>
            <li> I feel like I need to use a lot of this product to get it to lather even a little bit.</li>
            <li> Also, my forehead seems to be a little on the oily side since I started using these products.  </li>
            <li> This was purchased for my sister who had a little poOdle by the name of CoCo Creme.  </li>
            <li> shampoo has a slight coconut smell - very slight.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cut costs on haircare items these past few months in an effort to try to save money...</li>
            <li> It made my hair straw-like and dull and limp.</li>
            <li> so I could ship the wrong bottle back to them</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not sure what ths product was.</li>
            <li> I have used B&amp;B products in the past with \\&quot;ok\\&quot; results.  </li>
            <li> Usually the product lasts me MONTHS, this time it is almost done within a month.  </li>
            <li> My hair did not respond the way it usually does to B&amp;B</li>
            <li> I have medium thick hair</li>
            <li> When I used it, it was thin and watery, not at all what it usually is.</li>
            <li> But one con about this product is that it leaves the hair as an extremely frizzy mess :(</li>
            <li> Whoever is selling this is thinning out the product and making it impossible to use unless you use half a bottle.  </li>
            <li> I am kinda disappointed because I spent $50 on both the shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Nexxus, L&#x27;Oreal, Goldwell, I&#x27;m sorry, but we must part.</li>
            <li> I even double-checked the order and packing slip - they just shipped wrong item.</li>
            <li> but i guess i will have to save up and buy the expensive ones at  place i can trust.</li>
            <li> Something was wrong with these bottles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bumble and Bumble creme de coco for over a year, and I know this is fake.</li>
            <li> Fake product....</li>
            <li> Although the fragrance seemed 100% spot-on, I still returned the product based on my suspicion that it&#x27;s a fake.</li>
            <li> After one washing with it, I feel like my hair is still dirty.</li>
            <li> It turns your head into a crazy ammount of suds when you use the shampoo.</li>
            <li> FAKE!</li>
            <li> so disappointing :(</li>
            <li> my hair never looked so bad.  </li>
            <li> The seller admitted to getting a bad batch of the product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a really great shampoo, it smells good, it doesn&#x27;t foam up a ton, and it washes out really easily. It is one of the better shampoos that I have ever used. A huge plus is that I&#x27;m not allergic to it and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out like most shampoos. Unfortunately the conditioner that goes along with it is not as great.</li>
            <li> I feel like I need to use a lot of this product to get it to lather even a little bit. After one washing with it, I feel like my hair is still dirty. The other reviewers made it sound like it was more of a moisturizing shampoo, which is what I was looking for, and much to my disappointment, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be. The one plus, it smells very nice. Just wish it performed better.</li>
            <li> My sister has been using the Bumble and Bumble shampoos for years (Seaweed), and I&#x27;d tried them at her house, but never seen the attraction (her hair is gorgeous, though).  On the recommendation of my hair dresser, I tried the Creme de Coco line, and I am hooked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo has a slight coconut smell - very slight.  I&#x27;m really sensitive to over-scented products (I&#x27;m the one in the shampoo aisle taking the caps off every bottle).  The scent doesn&#x27;t seem to linger in my hair either.  But, oh, the lovely non-greasy moisture!  My hair is soft, bouncy, and full of body.  I know I sound like a commercial, but I really have noticed a difference in the quality of my hair.  Nexxus, L&#x27;Oreal, Goldwell, I&#x27;m sorry, but we must part.</li>
            <li> It seemed just like a normal shampoo. There was nothing fantastic about it, expect for the smell. And the price for it is ridiculous, i spent 40 bucks on both the shampoo and conditioner, for those tiny little bottles, that are pretty much travel size. The price is not worth the quantity that you get for it.</li>
            <li> I ordered shampoo, and the merchant shipped conditioner. I even double-checked the order and packing slip - they just shipped wrong item. I&#x27;d be OK with that, but when I contacted them about fixing *their* error, they wanted me to ship the product back to them at *my* cost. I had just had a baby (which is why I was buying shampoo online to begin with), so loading a newborn in the car and going down to my post office so I could ship the wrong bottle back to them just wasn&#x27;t going to happen. I ended up keeping the conditioner, and buying shampoo from a different merchant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cut costs on haircare items these past few months in an effort to try to save money...and I don&#x27;t care what they say - I certainly noticed a BIG difference in my hair.  Manageability, shine, overall look...my hair never looked so bad.  So I decided to treat myself and try Bumble and Bumble.  WOW.      This stuff is worth every penny.  I&#x27;m in love with my hair...all over again.    You get what you pay for, girls.</li>
            <li> I have fine, wavy hair, and i bought this shampoo because i have read other good reviews about it. I was expecting more for the price. I wouldnt buy this product again. it made my hair feel like straw after. the next time i went to the salon, my hair lady asked \\&quot; what have you been using in your hair, it feels soo dry?! smells nice, but i could have used suave and got the same results. think i will try Wen haircare next time.</li>
            <li> this isnt the real thing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s definitely of a higher viscosity (more fluid) perhaps to cheat customers</li>
            <li> Love it! Bumble and bumble is the best! This smells good too.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best shampoo I have ever used. Now if I can just afford it on a regular basis!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I&#x27;d always heard the brand was so good, but I haven&#x27;t really noticed anything special about it.  I would not buy it again, nor would I recommend it.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not sure what ths product was. i have used real bumble &amp; bumble purchased at a salon before and it made my hair and scalp feel amazing, but this product was very watered down and my scalp is very itchy. the conditioner seems close the same but it is definitely not what i was expecting. i was very excited to save up my swagbucks and buy this with amazon cards but i guess i will have to save up and buy the expensive ones at  place i can trust. thanks for nothing! so disappointing :(</li>
            <li> ok, not real impressed</li>
            <li> This is an excellent shampoo.  You need very little and it has a lovely light coconut fragrance.  My hair is terribly dry and damaged from the sun here in Hawaii.  The more I use this moisturizing shampoo, the silkier my hair becomes.  It is nice not to have to bother with a conditioner too.  I am most impressed, as I have never found a shampoo that works so well to bring my hair back to life.  GREAT PRODUCT THAT IS WELL WORTH THE PRICE!!  THANKS FOR THE FREE PRIORITY SHIPPING AMAZON ~ IT IS TRULY APPRECIATED.</li>
            <li> I have used B&amp;B products in the past with \\&quot;ok\\&quot; results.  Despite the price, I decided to try Creme De Cocoa because my hair tends to be dry, and it is wavy so when I dry it straight, I often get \\&quot;pouf\\&quot;.  I do not wash my hair every day, I also have highlights.  The shampoo is concentrated so you don&#x27;t need a lot, which was good because my hair is thick.  It smells great.  It just didn&#x27;t seem to do anything spectacular to my hair to justify the price.  It&#x27;s \\&quot;ok\\&quot;.  I probably won&#x27;t get it again though.</li>
            <li> I so love this shampoo! B&amp;B&#x27;s Creme de Coco shampoo adds umph to my super fine &amp; color-treated hair, which is definitely less frizzy &amp; softer after blow drying.  I sometimes use a shine serum as part of my styling routine but haven&#x27;t needed to since using this shampoo. Like most other B&amp;B shampoos, a little goes a long way &amp; the lather is incredible!  Plus, it smells GREAT! The mild, pleasant coconut scent reminds me of the beach. For me, the price has proven to be well worth it &amp; Amazon&#x27;s price is the best I&#x27;ve found so far.  Another fabulous product to try by B&amp;B if you have hair like mine is their Thickening Spray.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this shampoo and conditioner because my salon is now using Bumble and Bumble products and my stylist was raving about the products.  The coconut smell is great but the shampoo and conditioner are just ok.  I thought that it would make my hair smooth and give it more shine, but my hair feels like I am using a cheap supermarket brand shampoo.  Also, my forehead seems to be a little on the oily side since I started using these products.  I normally have very dry skin with no blemishes.  I am kinda disappointed because I spent $50 on both the shampoo and conditioner.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy these again...</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and received a free sample of this shampoo and liked it after trying the sample.  I bought it and use it every other day.  I sometimes blow dry and flat iron my hair straight or let it dry curly and this shampoo makes my hair look better than with other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Wow I wish I read the reviews before ordering this. I order so much through my prime account, I thought I could trust Amazon with some Bumble and Bumble (which I&#x27;ve used for over 10 years).  This product is not Bumble and Bumble. It turns your head into a crazy ammount of suds when you use the shampoo. Then it leaves it dry and stringy.  NOT Bumble and Bumble.  Bumble should take a lawsuit out on Amazon over this.  Amazon, you should be ashamed!!</li>
            <li> I love the mild coconut scent, and also the way that this shampoo lathers. You really only need a small amount compared to many other shampoos. Makes it great for traveling.</li>
            <li> I was never a believer in more expensive shampoo until I treated myself to this one that my salon uses. I use it around 3 days a week (and use Pantene the other days) and EVERY time I use this product someone comments on whether I colored my hair or I get a compliment on how my hair looks. This product pulls out the natural highlights in my hair and creates a very healthy shine. I highly recommend this product and I as I said I am not one to pay more than $5.00 for shampoo prior to this.</li>
            <li> I saw the price went up at Target (where I normally buy this shampoo).  I&#x27;ve been using the product for years and decided to check Amazon&#x27;s price.  I was happy to see that it was so much more inexpensive to purchase it online.  When I received the product, I used it right away, but everyday I keep thinking about how it isn&#x27;t the same product I&#x27;ve been using for years.  It&#x27;s diluted and watery.  Usually the product lasts me MONTHS, this time it is almost done within a month.  DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER.</li>
            <li> So fresh smelling and good for your hair One of the best selling shampoos on the market. Very rich and luxurious</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves my hair clean.  However, it doesn&#x27;t lather well and it seems to require a lot of soap so it isn&#x27;t much of a bargain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used B &amp; B products for years, including this shampoo.  Though expensive, it lasts much longer than most shampoos, has a great lather, smells good, and makes my hair shiny.  If you haven&#x27;t used any of B &amp; B products, buy this.  You&#x27;ll be pleased!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and these 2 bottles seemed of a different quality. They  did not lather up the same, felt diluted, as if there was water in them. Something was wrong with these bottles. I would never order from here again. Would rather but it in a store.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it!  My daughter and I have been using this shampoo for a couple months &amp; both love it!  Works great, don&#x27;t need to use much at all, and it smells heavenly.  Will continue buying!</li>
            <li> This has to be one of the most overpriced junk i ever bought. The shampoo is nothing special other than the pleasant coconut smell. Any regular  drugstore shampoo could have achieve the same result. But let&#x27;s get into the detail. First of all, shampoo were created with one purpose and that is to clean dirt and oil of your head. Anything other than that is just pure marketing. Well, I think i made an mistake when i bought this shampoo. The consistent is quite thick and hard to spread around your head. The lathering is decent. After shampoo, it&#x27;s take a while to rinse everything off because the shampoo is concentrated. My hair felt somewhat dry and puffy afterward. Overall it&#x27;s a decent volumizing shampoo and smell nice but i think it&#x27;s not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Bumble and Bumble products.  Yes they can be pricey, but the quality is very consistent.</li>
            <li> This product is NOT the real Bumble and Bumble creme de coco product. Same thing for the conditioner offered on Amazon. I&#x27;ve been using Bumble and Bumble creme de coco for over a year, and I know this is fake. The shampoo and conditioner did not have a seal, the products didn&#x27;t smell the same as the real shampoo and conditioner I purchased from Sephora, and the consistency was not as concentrated. I&#x27;m so disappointed. Spend the money and get the real deal from the store or official website.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizing shampoo in the earth.  Awesome fragrance.  Best stuff.  Very concentrated.  Best Buy.  Conditioner is great too.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for my sister who had a little poOdle by the name of CoCo Creme.  My sister would always refer to her as BoO!  So, in honor of CoCo Creme, I purchased this shampoo for my sister who was familiar with its great performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it to her as a &#x27;Birthday&#x27; gift...only I call it CoCo Sham-BoO!  Great product and Quick delivery!  A great gift for anyone even if they don&#x27;t have a PoOdle.  A great dealer to deal with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for some time to find a shampoo that works well on my hair. I have extremely fine hair, but a TON of it. It&#x27;s somewhat wavy and is about shoulder length. A lot of shampoos don&#x27;t get all the way to the roots, or are too heavy for my hair, or totally not moisturizing. This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve come across. It leaves my hair shiny &amp; clean, and weightless. I pair it with the thickening conditioner, or aveda&#x27;s shampure conditioner. I was not expecting this to be worth the money, but it is. I&#x27;d recommend it for fine, dry hair.</li>
            <li> I love B&amp;B products so when this came out I grabbed it! It did not work well w/ my hair for some reason. I do have dry and processed hair and I love the gentle line I was hoping this would be even more moisturizing but not the case. It made my hair straw-like and dull and limp.</li>
            <li> Good gentle shampoo.  Very pleasant coconut scent.  It cleans the hair well without stripping it.</li>
            <li> The scent is amazing!  And, it leaves my hair shiny and soft.  I have hair down to the middle of my back, but I don&#x27;t need more than a dime size to lather up my whole head!  It&#x27;s a wonderful product and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have used this for many years.  I have really curly, course dry hair and it works wonders.  I able to comb through my hair after using. I use it along with the super rich conditioner.WOW. Shining I don&#x27; know if this combo would be good for people with oily hair.&lt;br /&gt;But I think the shampoo would be good for anyone.</li>
            <li> Bumble and Bumble makes amazing hair products. They have an entire line of shampoo, hair tonics, deep conditioners, everything you can imagine. The Creme de Coco Shampoo is my favorite. Lathers up to a delicious smell, rinses out easily, doesn&#x27;t dehydrate your hair. It is most benefical to condition with the Creme de Coco Conditioner to get the best benefits...then use one of the tonics after you towel dry your hair. Leaves your hair looking healthy and gorgeous. Enjoy!!</li>
            <li> Fake product....I wish that I had read he reviews before purchasing....this product was watery, didn&#x27;t have the same scent or texture as the product that I bought in my salon.  Spend the extra money at a reputable salon!  Even the bottle is different!</li>
            <li> Bought this shampoo &amp; conditioner on the basis that it smells like a sunny day at the beach. If you like cocunuts then this product is for you. Have used bumble and bumble products in the past, this one is a bit more drying than their others but nothing that a little leave in conditioner once a week won&#x27;t fix. Also a plus, a tiny bit goes a very, very long way. I have medium thick hair so it&#x27;s nice to know that this bottle will last me awhile.</li>
            <li> Although I purchased this shampoo in June, I just started using this particular bottle.  I have been using Bumble and Bumble shampoo for years and have always been pleased with it, however this latest bottle seems to be diluted.  It takes much more than normal to get a lather.  Either the company has changed the product or the seller has done something to it.  I read one other review from a buyer who had the same complaint.  Has nobody else noticed anything different?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I wrote both Amazon and the seller about this problem.  Amazon is refunding me.  The seller admitted to getting a bad batch of the product.  Why they continued to sell it, I don&#x27;t know.  Contact Amazon if you received this defective product.</li>
            <li> Besides smelling heavenly of coconut, it is another great Bumble and Bumble product.  Great quality and does a very good job of cleaning my hair.</li>
            <li> I have used Bumble and Bumble products for years, purchased from the salon.  I needed more shampoo so decided to buy it on line-big mistake !  Whoever is selling this is thinning out the product and making it impossible to use unless you use half a bottle.  It doesn&#x27;t foam up like it should, this product should be very concentrated so a little goes a long way.  For the price of this item, I will NEVER buy from Amazon via a seller (unknown) again.  I&#x27;m sure Bumble and Bumble would not want their product marketed this way.  Buyer beware!!!!!</li>
            <li> Just ok.  It makes the tub floor slippery so I do not use it often.</li>
            <li> I purchase the Bumble and Bumble creme de coco shampoo and conditioner.  It arrived promptly, reasonably priced and the product is great; very smooth transaction.</li>
            <li> You only need a drop.  My hair dresser used it on me and I was hooked.  It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair feeling silky and soft - love it!</li>
            <li> Beware in purchasing this item.  The viscosity and texture of the product is inconsistent with Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s typical high quality shampoos/conditioners.  My hair did not respond the way it usually does to B&amp;B (it was more like the effect of using a cheap hotel hair product).  Although the fragrance seemed 100% spot-on, I still returned the product based on my suspicion that it&#x27;s a fake.</li>
            <li> I bought this from Sephora in store. Not online. I&#x27;d like to say, this product smells AMAZING! It&#x27;s great! I bought the conditioner along with this. The conditioner will end up leaving your hair super soft. The first time I used it I noticed no difference, but then the second time it left my hair soft and lush. But one con about this product is that it leaves the hair as an extremely frizzy mess :( I love this enough to re-purchase again, though. :D Looking forward to buy the Creme De Coco hair masque as well.</li>
            <li> makes my hair really straight and soft</li>
            <li> I had seen a couple of reviews where people had stated that the product received was not consistent with what they were used to. I took a chance as I also saw some positive reviews and hoped that I would be one of the latter. Upon opening the bottle, the smell was not the same. It seemed to have chemical-y smell to it that I was not used to in a B&amp;B product. When I used it, it was thin and watery, not at all what it usually is.The bottle looked like it had some wear on it once I inspected it further, like an old bottle that had been refilled.I will never buy a product from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I purchased online because I have been unable to find my favorite shampoo in the stores.  This seemed almost a different texture than what it normally is????</li>
            <li> My hair is EXTREMELY soft after using this. My hair is below my shoulder and I only need to use a dime sized dollop. Definitely worth the money, but no need to overuse.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair which is prone to dryness. I bought the shampoo and conditioner both and have used them for the last 2-3 months. I regularly leave the conditioner in for several minutes and concentrate on the tips. Instead of being luscious and soft, my hair is drier than ever and I do not use any heat styling tools. My tips are extremely dry and brittle. Even my hairstylist told me to stop using it immediately. Would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love B &amp; B!  This is a wonderful Product!</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff. Feels great. Light smell. Conditions well. Shiny hair and no flyaways. Will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over four years and it&#x27;s a fabulous product. BUT!! this vendor either is intentionally selling imposter products or doesn&#x27;t realize it. I ordered the shampoo and conditioner and knew immediately something was off. After going back and reading the reviews I realized I wasn&#x27;t the only one who thought this. I got a refund and went to a salon that sold Bumble and Bumble products and purchased the shampoo and conditioner there. When I went home I compared the one that I bought through Amazon&#x27;s vendor and the one from the salon. FAKE! The bottle&#x27;s design was slightly but when compared obviously different and the wording was even in a different language, the smell was different and even the consistency and color. Awhile back my hairdresser warned me about this and advised me to always buy my products from a salon. I learned my lesson and I hope this review prevents you from making the same mistake. Zero stars.</li>
