            <li>Great cleaner to help keep my electric razor clean and in good working order.</li>
            <li>Spreads nicely.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell that this product is an effective cleaner.</li>
            <li>but this product is good than HQ200.Very good price and free delivery via Amazon,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Effectively cleaned head.</li>
            <li>I obviously own a Norelco Philips.  </li>
            <li>Great product to keep shaver useful and lubricated.</li>
            <li>Just spray it and keeps my electric razor working great and good as new.</li>
            <li>Non returnable (a very important piece of information I should have heeded, but did not).</li>
            <li>Ethyl Alcohol is an appropriate cleaner.  </li>
            <li>but this does an ok job....</li>
            <li>Pleased with all aspects</li>
            <li>I like this better than just using oil on my shaver&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I buy stuff from the grocery that is much better and cheaper</li>
            <li>This was much better than the ones I have bought at walmart</li>
            <li>The competition (sold on amazon) is MUCH better.</li>
            <li>Most men use blade and foam systems.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll get more than 3 months out of them if I lube them up.</li>
            <li>And now five more words.</li>
            <li>This spray is more efficient than the \\&quot;home remedies\\</li>
            <li>norelco stuff was more of a cleaner rather than a lubricant .  </li>
            <li>The spray went all over my hand and into the air and on the counter top - every place but where I was aiming it.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Norelco for making a great razer and cleaner.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Absolutely fantastic!</li>
            <li>This cleaner-lubricant spray seems to work well, and I&#x27;m looking forward to better performance and longer life from my shaving heads as a result of using this spray.</li>
            <li>More cleaner than lube</li>
            <li>I used to use the Wahl and now I have changed because this seems to work better and keep my Razor kits nice and clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;--maximum shaving performance, Alcohol based cleaning spray with lubricating components for a clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;--Fresh scent that will remain on your shaving head, so you can enjoy the perfect fresh and clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;--After</li>
            <li>Seems to be doing a great job so far to help extend the life of my razor.</li>
            <li>It cleans without becoming gummy and the aroma is not medicinal or mechanical.  </li>
            <li>Good buy and very helpful.</li>
            <li>This product is very useful for keeping the shaver in top shape and reducing the wear on the blades so that they do not have to be replaced as often.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more convenient that cleaning the heads under the water faucet, although I&#x27;ll still do that occasionally to clean the heads.</li>
            <li>Even alcohol won&#x27;t remove the fragrance easily.  </li>
            <li>Easy here, makes for better shave if heads are clean and lubed</li>
            <li>i use it time per month and my RQ12 Head still shown brighter neither it presents strong scent when using it.</li>
            <li>I have to say I liked the older product more......</li>
            <li>Everything worked just fine.</li>
            <li>It also has a detergent, an antifungal and a fine scent.</li>
            <li>Keeps the razor lubricated and working fine.</li>
            <li>This works just fine.</li>
            <li>The product is fine but watch out for a switch of stores.  </li>
            <li>A can lasts for decades, so it&#x27;s a cheap way to preserve blades and get close</li>
            <li>It keeps the razor working properly and smelling great.</li>
            <li>Used this for only about Five days and Happy</li>
            <li>Item arrived timely, securely packaged.</li>
            <li>Very useful.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my shaver clean &amp; smooth</li>
            <li>Find it very useful to clean &amp; lubricate my electric razors.</li>
            <li>This product is a quick, easy, and thorough way of keeping my Norelco razor heads clean.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had better results washing the shaver under hot water.</li>
            <li>so I use this to clean my electric razor and keep it lubricated.  </li>
            <li>I use it on swabs to clean skin for my insulin injections.  </li>
            <li>your Philips Norelco Cleaning spray HQ110 to clean and lubricate your shaving heads.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>I clean with water power after each shave and lubricate the blades three times per week.</li>
            <li>Helps to clean and lubricate my electric razor.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t clean well.</li>
            <li>I tried to clean shaver and blades, didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>clean solution</li>
            <li>This spray does just what is is supposed to do: Clean razor heads and clipper blades.</li>
            <li>we need product that just lubricates the razor ; we can clean the blades myself w/o this stuff.</li>
            <li>It does have some lubrication though which is the only good thing about it.</li>
            <li>not as good as the last time we tried this stuff.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>And the cost is not bad at all.  </li>
            <li>It evaporates quickly leaving no residue.  </li>
            <li>Decent product, would recommend to anyone seeking something that is worthwhile.</li>
            <li>QUICK SHIPPING</li>
            <li>and I still have to take the blades out and clean them up as before, but between blade cleaning this seems to really help them to stay lubricated and moving smoothly.</li>
            <li>This one seems to have a strong spray which kinda spreads liquid around too much.</li>
            <li>Be aware of what you are buying!</li>
            <li>course, its exactly the right oil for electric shaver heads, and just what you need after a thorough cleaning when the original oil has been washed away.&lt;br /&gt;Runs</li>
            <li>lubricates heads and provides a fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li>Razor runs so much more smoothly and quietly.  </li>
            <li>It really has no pressure to clean</li>
            <li>Ideal for any electric razor brand, long lasting can</li>
            <li>Is exactly as described, if you need this product it is worth getting...</li>
            <li>This has kept my razor sharp with exceptional shaves for a year when I change blades.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but the Braun model (not available anymore) was a bit better.</li>
            <li>After using this product several times, I have to say that it has done a fine job in helping to clean and lubricate my Morelco  </li>
            <li>Very much recommended.</li>
            <li>It does a great job and sometimes it is hard to find in the store.  </li>
            <li>If You want to get the most out of your electric razor, you will definitely need a can of this to keep it well maintenance.</li>
            <li>You are better to purchase a bottle of denatured alcohol for $1 and pouring a small amount of it on the blades to clean them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco is taking buyers to the cleaners.</li>
            <li>With the spray, it&#x27;s much easier to apply on the shaving heads.  </li>
            <li>This really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>It makes my shaves much closer.</li>
            <li>It works very well.  </li>
            <li>really improved the functioning of my Norelco</li>
            <li>but really like what it does for the blades.  </li>
            <li>THANKS.</li>
            <li>this product does lubricate and works very well on my Norelco aquatech razor model 810.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has made the care of the razor much easer.</li>
            <li>and I really didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my shaver&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li>OK as far as I know  Norelco shaver was such a POS, I never had a chance to use it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a can of compressed air that has some aerosol lubricant for a quick general cleaning.</li>
            <li>I will also disassemble the heads occasionally to thoroughly clean all parts.</li>
            <li>smoother, and smells like new (you don&#x27;t need much).</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to help maintain the life of the razor.</li>
            <li>very easy to use and one uses very little to get the job done.  </li>
            <li>This is a foam spray, not the normal cleaner/lubricant spray.  </li>
            <li>Does not work on my Razer, nothing works very well after the Company changed heads, new heads does not work like the old blades.</li>
            <li>Leave your blades like new.</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my husband when I got him a new razor to go with it.  </li>
            <li>cleaning, the shaving heads smell, look  as new.</li>
            <li>The directions say to spray it on and let it dry before use, which I tried, and then I just tried spraying it on and shaving, but either way the blades heated up quickly and the razor grabbed at my face.</li>
            <li>I swirl the mixture for about 40 seconds (reversing direction after 20 seconds), then pour most of the mixture back into the container, leaving only the last bit with the dirt and stubble in the bottom of the class to be disposed of.  </li>
            <li>I have used Norelco shavers for decades (currently have a Spectrum that I&#x27;ve had for about 8 years), and I try to clean the shaving heads regularly, and rinse them when indicated.  </li>
            <li>Only product out in the market that is very important in keeping the cutters lubricated and sharp!</li>
            <li>Helps keep my razor clean and sharp</li>
            <li>I change the blades yearly and clean and lubricate the machine every other use or so.</li>
            <li>I replaced some Norelco spray lubricant (not cleaner/lube) which was years old with this new product.</li>
            <li>I gave the current one the old science class test for oily substances by spraying a brown paper bag and it tested positive, so it has some lubricant.</li>
            <li>Previously I use to clean my shaver Philips Jet</li>
            <li>Frequent through cleaning and lubrication of the electric razor blades facilitates closer shaves and enhances life of the blades.</li>
            <li>What can I say so far as judging this product?</li>
            <li>Also responsible for blades lasting longer.</li>
            <li>I switched from this products competitor for no other reason than to just try something new</li>
            <li>I be more careful what I&#x27;m ordering next time, but that will be a while as long as this is likely to last.</li>
            <li>There must be two versions of the HQ110, an older one that consisted of a butane and alcohol and a current version that contains multiple ingredients.</li>
            <li>Hard to get too excited about this product though.  </li>
            <li>It hard to do this in my bathroom and I&#x27;am not going outside to clean</li>
            <li>I do a thorough cleaning (every time I recharge the razor), after disassembling the blades and rinsing them in hot water, I use an 80/20 mix of 70-percent isopropyl alcohol and Williams Lectric Shave, just covering the face-down blades in a shallow (old fashion) glass.  </li>

            <li> It also has a detergent, an antifungal and a fine scent.</li>
            <li> Keeps the razor lubricated and working fine.</li>
            <li> This works just fine.</li>
            <li> The product is fine but watch out for a switch of stores.  </li>
            <li> A can lasts for decades, so it&#x27;s a cheap way to preserve blades and get close</li>
            <li> It keeps the razor working properly and smelling great.</li>
            <li> Used this for only about Five days and Happy</li>
            <li> Item arrived timely, securely packaged.</li>
            <li> Very useful.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my shaver clean &amp; smooth</li>
            <li> Find it very useful to clean &amp; lubricate my electric razors.</li>
            <li> This product is a quick, easy, and thorough way of keeping my Norelco razor heads clean.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had better results washing the shaver under hot water.</li>
            <li> so I use this to clean my electric razor and keep it lubricated.  </li>
            <li> I use it on swabs to clean skin for my insulin injections.  </li>
            <li> your Philips Norelco Cleaning spray HQ110 to clean and lubricate your shaving heads.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> I clean with water power after each shave and lubricate the blades three times per week.</li>
            <li> Helps to clean and lubricate my electric razor.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clean well.</li>
            <li> I tried to clean shaver and blades, didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> clean solution</li>
            <li> This spray does just what is is supposed to do: Clean razor heads and clipper blades.</li>
            <li> we need product that just lubricates the razor ; we can clean the blades myself w/o this stuff.</li>
            <li> It does have some lubrication though which is the only good thing about it.</li>
            <li> not as good as the last time we tried this stuff.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> And the cost is not bad at all.  </li>
            <li> It evaporates quickly leaving no residue.  </li>
            <li> Decent product, would recommend to anyone seeking something that is worthwhile.</li>
            <li> QUICK SHIPPING</li>
            <li> and I still have to take the blades out and clean them up as before, but between blade cleaning this seems to really help them to stay lubricated and moving smoothly.</li>
            <li> This one seems to have a strong spray which kinda spreads liquid around too much.</li>
            <li> Be aware of what you are buying!</li>
            <li> course, its exactly the right oil for electric shaver heads, and just what you need after a thorough cleaning when the original oil has been washed away.&lt;br /&gt;Runs</li>
            <li> lubricates heads and provides a fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li> Razor runs so much more smoothly and quietly.  </li>
            <li> It really has no pressure to clean</li>
            <li> Ideal for any electric razor brand, long lasting can</li>
            <li> Is exactly as described, if you need this product it is worth getting...</li>
            <li> This has kept my razor sharp with exceptional shaves for a year when I change blades.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but the Braun model (not available anymore) was a bit better.</li>
            <li> After using this product several times, I have to say that it has done a fine job in helping to clean and lubricate my Morelco  </li>
            <li> Very much recommended.</li>
            <li> It does a great job and sometimes it is hard to find in the store.  </li>
            <li> If You want to get the most out of your electric razor, you will definitely need a can of this to keep it well maintenance.</li>
            <li> You are better to purchase a bottle of denatured alcohol for $1 and pouring a small amount of it on the blades to clean them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco is taking buyers to the cleaners.</li>
            <li> With the spray, it&#x27;s much easier to apply on the shaving heads.  </li>
            <li> This really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> It makes my shaves much closer.</li>
            <li> It works very well.  </li>
            <li> really improved the functioning of my Norelco</li>
            <li> but really like what it does for the blades.  </li>
            <li> THANKS.</li>
            <li> this product does lubricate and works very well on my Norelco aquatech razor model 810.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has made the care of the razor much easer.</li>
            <li> and I really didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my shaver&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li> OK as far as I know  Norelco shaver was such a POS, I never had a chance to use it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a can of compressed air that has some aerosol lubricant for a quick general cleaning.</li>
            <li> I will also disassemble the heads occasionally to thoroughly clean all parts.</li>
            <li> smoother, and smells like new (you don&#x27;t need much).</li>
            <li> Highly recommended to help maintain the life of the razor.</li>
            <li> very easy to use and one uses very little to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> This is a foam spray, not the normal cleaner/lubricant spray.  </li>
            <li> Does not work on my Razer, nothing works very well after the Company changed heads, new heads does not work like the old blades.</li>
            <li> Leave your blades like new.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my husband when I got him a new razor to go with it.  </li>
            <li> cleaning, the shaving heads smell, look  as new.</li>
            <li> The directions say to spray it on and let it dry before use, which I tried, and then I just tried spraying it on and shaving, but either way the blades heated up quickly and the razor grabbed at my face.</li>
            <li> I swirl the mixture for about 40 seconds (reversing direction after 20 seconds), then pour most of the mixture back into the container, leaving only the last bit with the dirt and stubble in the bottom of the class to be disposed of.  </li>
            <li> I have used Norelco shavers for decades (currently have a Spectrum that I&#x27;ve had for about 8 years), and I try to clean the shaving heads regularly, and rinse them when indicated.  </li>
            <li> Only product out in the market that is very important in keeping the cutters lubricated and sharp!</li>
            <li> Helps keep my razor clean and sharp</li>
            <li> I change the blades yearly and clean and lubricate the machine every other use or so.</li>
            <li> I replaced some Norelco spray lubricant (not cleaner/lube) which was years old with this new product.</li>
            <li> I gave the current one the old science class test for oily substances by spraying a brown paper bag and it tested positive, so it has some lubricant.</li>
            <li> Previously I use to clean my shaver Philips Jet</li>
            <li> Frequent through cleaning and lubrication of the electric razor blades facilitates closer shaves and enhances life of the blades.</li>
            <li> What can I say so far as judging this product?</li>
            <li> Also responsible for blades lasting longer.</li>
            <li> I switched from this products competitor for no other reason than to just try something new</li>
            <li> I be more careful what I&#x27;m ordering next time, but that will be a while as long as this is likely to last.</li>
            <li> There must be two versions of the HQ110, an older one that consisted of a butane and alcohol and a current version that contains multiple ingredients.</li>
            <li> Hard to get too excited about this product though.  </li>
            <li> It hard to do this in my bathroom and I&#x27;am not going outside to clean</li>
            <li> I do a thorough cleaning (every time I recharge the razor), after disassembling the blades and rinsing them in hot water, I use an 80/20 mix of 70-percent isopropyl alcohol and Williams Lectric Shave, just covering the face-down blades in a shallow (old fashion) glass.  </li>
            <li> This makes the blades last a long time and when I&#x27;m finished rinsing the shaving head I always spray it briefly with this cleaner/lubricant spray (while the shaver is running, and I let it run for about 20 seconds.  </li>
            <li> It should last a long time.</li>
            <li> One can will last a long time, depending on use.</li>
            <li> However, it has a long lasting smell that I do not like.</li>
            <li> Cutting efficiency seems better.</li>
            <li> Sort of strange product.</li>
            <li> I expected a bigger can for the price of it.</li>
            <li> I spray some on and let the machine air dry</li>
            <li> This is not the same product I previously purchased, although both were labeled HQ110.</li>
            <li> so carefully review your purchase before accepting the order.</li>
            <li> It is not what I expected....</li>
            <li> Bought this for my electric razor and it works as expected.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not clear when and how to use this stuff, and it is pretty expensive for such a small can.</li>
            <li> My orignal purchase store would have charged the same amout for cans (actually a little less.)  </li>
            <li> denatured alcohol has chemicals added to it to make it non-drinkable, one of those chemicals is petroleum oil among a variety of other things.  </li>
            <li> just a little spray-run razor for a few seconds let dry</li>
            <li> Electric Shaver Aid was easier to do pinpoint spray onto the cutters with less mess and waste.</li>
            <li> Less messy than tube of oil.  </li>
            <li> arrived in a timely manner - seems to do its job - a little pricy but convenient</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money for me.  </li>
            <li> It only leaves a very small amount of lubricant behind.</li>
            <li> I have a small hand spray bottle that I fill with alcohol for cleaning my glass topped coffee table</li>
            <li> Then spray a small on each head and run it for a seconds.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure about cleaning the heads but it does lubficate them as you can hear the rpm&#x27;s pick up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how well it cleans in the small places</li>
            <li> &quot; that I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> Spray is very messy, stuff gets everywhere.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Sorry it&#x27;s not what I expected its not a lubricant</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a lube since there&#x27;s no moisture that remains on shaver but at least it is steril.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re supposed to leave the razor out to air dry after using it, which makes it inconvenient for every shave use like I do with the oil.  </li>
            <li> It is now in a bathroom drawer somewhere waiting to be thrown out in a few years when I get the itch to throw useless things away..</li>
            <li> have seen other ratings on this that says &amp;#34;no lubricant&amp;#34; They must have got a bad can, because it does have a lubricant in it,</li>
            <li> too expensive for what it does.</li>
            <li> If you expect a lubricant, you are SOL (sorry out of luck).</li>
            <li> Its &amp;#34;effect&amp;#34; on improving shaver performance are difficult to observe.</li>
            <li> The product foamed out of the can, left a tacky residue and worst of all - left a terrible fragrance all over the blades.  </li>
            <li> At $8 plus a can that is outrageously expensive.</li>
            <li> very poor.</li>
            <li> It is too bad the ingredients were not listed.  </li>
            <li> Now fifty-nine, I had horrible acne when a teenager and well into my mid-twenties.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good product when I spray on shaver sounds and seems to work smoother</li>
            <li> lubricates heads and provides a fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li> Excellent spray to keep up your razor i use it time per month and my RQ12 Head still shown brighter neither it presents strong scent when using it. Therefore i recommeded</li>
            <li> Everything worked just fine. No problems with delivery or with the item purchased.</li>
            <li> I use an electric razor every day so I use this to clean my electric razor and keep it lubricated.  It does a great job and sometimes it is hard to find in the store.  Very pleased with the job it does.</li>
            <li> Only product out in the market that is very important in keeping the cutters lubricated and sharp! Use weekly after cleaning the cutters and they will keep on cuttin&#x27;!</li>
            <li> Great product! Keeps my shaver clean &amp; smooth</li>
            <li> Have used this cleaner/lubricant every since I&#x27;ve owed a Norelco 15 to 18 years, works just find.</li>
            <li> Sort of strange product. It really has no pressure to clean and I&#x27;ve had better results washing the shaver under hot water. It does have some lubrication though which is the only good thing about it.</li>
            <li> arrived in a timely manner - seems to do its job - a little pricy but convenient</li>
            <li> Always great to have to razor in good shape.</li>
            <li> This item is valuable for maintaining your razor in the best condition---I would recommend it for everyone!!!</li>
            <li> Keeps my Norelco Philips shaver in great shape.</li>
            <li> Less messy than tube of oil.  With the spray, it&#x27;s much easier to apply on the shaving heads.  Spreads nicely.</li>
            <li> really good stuff. just a little spray-run razor for a few seconds let dry</li>
            <li> too expensive for what it does.</li>
            <li> I bought this product as a \\&quot;lubricant spray\\&quot;.  That is how is was listed.  It is too bad the ingredients were not listed.  In fact there are only two ingredients: isobutane and Ethyl Alcohol(denatured).  Now isobutane is used for providing the aerosol pressure for canned product sprays.  Ethyl Alcohol is an appropriate cleaner.  I use it on swabs to clean skin for my insulin injections.  It evaporates quickly leaving no residue.  So, if you are looking for an aerosol cleaner spray this works.  If you expect a lubricant, you are SOL (sorry out of luck). I have a small hand spray bottle that I fill with alcohol for cleaning my glass topped coffee table it is lots cheaper.</li>
            <li> I replaced some Norelco spray lubricant (not cleaner/lube) which was years old with this new product. I have to say I liked the older product more......but this does an ok job....does not seem to lubricate quite as well.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s end the controversy surrounding this product here and now. There must be two versions of the HQ110, an older one that consisted of a butane and alcohol and a current version that contains multiple ingredients. I gave the current one the old science class test for oily substances by spraying a brown paper bag and it tested positive, so it has some lubricant. It also has a detergent, an antifungal and a fine scent. In short, it covers all bases.</li>
            <li> very easy to use and one uses very little to get the job done.  It should last a long time. Good directions.</li>
            <li> The cleaner works good just like it&#x27;s advertized to do.&lt;br /&gt;I have seen other ratings on this that says &amp;#34;no lubricant&amp;#34; They must have got a bad can, because it does have a lubricant in it,</li>
            <li> Keeps my razor in good shape</li>
            <li> GOOD FOR CLEANING RASER HEADS</li>
            <li> The advertisement copy says &amp;#34;Use your Philips Norelco Cleaning spray HQ110 to clean and lubricate your shaving heads.&amp;#34;  It is only a shaver head cleaner (see the front of the can) not a cleaner and lubricant.  There are no lubricants in the can.  You need to purchase a lubricant separately.  Be aware of what you are buying!</li>
            <li> Have used this for several years, orginally as Rementon product.  Find it very useful to clean &amp; lubricate my electric razors.</li>
            <li> Have used for years in combination with a pre shave. Keeps the razor lubricated and working fine. Is also inert to my skin.</li>
            <li> Pleased with all aspects</li>
            <li> This works just fine. Rinse out the shaver. Wipe with alcohol if you wish.  Then spray a small on each head and run it for a seconds.  That&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> Non returnable (a very important piece of information I should have heeded, but did not). Its &amp;#34;effect&amp;#34; on improving shaver performance are difficult to observe. It is now in a bathroom drawer somewhere waiting to be thrown out in a few years when I get the itch to throw useless things away..</li>
            <li> This works great for cleaning your razor. It was delivered in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Delivered as promised.</li>
            <li> Frequent through cleaning and lubrication of the electric razor blades facilitates closer shaves and enhances life of the blades. I clean with water power after each shave and lubricate the blades three times per week. This has kept my razor sharp with exceptional shaves for a year when I change blades. Good buy and very helpful.</li>
            <li> Phillips is reducing quantity every time, I am buying for my Electric Lazor.&lt;br /&gt;Should increase the quantity atleast twice for the same price.</li>
            <li> The product is fine but watch out for a switch of stores.  I was planning to buy 4 cans from the Online store (may not be the correct title).  Instead I was shifted to amother store that charged me $13.95 for one can.  My orignal purchase store would have charged the same amout for cans (actually a little less.)  so carefully review your purchase before accepting the order.</li>
            <li> This is a foam spray, not the normal cleaner/lubricant spray.  Maybe it should be used only for Norelco shavers?</li>
            <li> Helps keep my razor clean and sharp</li>
            <li> Does not work on my Razer, nothing works very well after the Company changed heads, new heads does not work like the old blades.</li>
            <li> This is the best of the Shaver sprays.</li>
            <li> Works great no issues. Just spray it and keeps my electric razor working great and good as new. Great product</li>
            <li> My guys like it, so....good &#x27;nuff!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a can of compressed air that has some aerosol lubricant for a quick general cleaning. It&#x27;s more convenient that cleaning the heads under the water faucet, although I&#x27;ll still do that occasionally to clean the heads. I will also disassemble the heads occasionally to thoroughly clean all parts.</li>
            <li> Seems to improve the cleaning process and I would say that the length of time that the shaver lasts will be longer.</li>
            <li> Helps to clean and lubricate my electric razor.  Seems to be doing a great job so far to help extend the life of my razor.</li>
            <li> Great product!!! Leave your blades like new.</li>
            <li> This really makes a difference. You can feel it. It makes my shaves much closer. A great product.</li>
            <li> Seems to do the trick.  Just spray on and forget about it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended to help maintain the life of the razor.</li>
            <li> Cleaner and lubricant. What else can I say?</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco shavers for decades (currently have a Spectrum that I&#x27;ve had for about 8 years), and I try to clean the shaving heads regularly, and rinse them when indicated.  This makes the blades last a long time and when I&#x27;m finished rinsing the shaving head I always spray it briefly with this cleaner/lubricant spray (while the shaver is running, and I let it run for about 20 seconds.  A can lasts for decades, so it&#x27;s a cheap way to preserve blades and get close shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I do a thorough cleaning (every time I recharge the razor), after disassembling the blades and rinsing them in hot water, I use an 80/20 mix of 70-percent isopropyl alcohol and Williams Lectric Shave, just covering the face-down blades in a shallow (old fashion) glass.  I swirl the mixture for about 40 seconds (reversing direction after 20 seconds), then pour most of the mixture back into the container, leaving only the last bit with the dirt and stubble in the bottom of the class to be disposed of.  I shake off the excess cleaner and let the shaver head air-dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> This is a must for your electric razor. You&#x27;ll notice the difference immediately. A quieter, smoother running shaver. Also, don&#x27;t forget your pre-electric lotion. It all adds up to a great shave!</li>
            <li> Decent product, would recommend to anyone seeking something that is worthwhile. Purchase this if you want to see for yourself.</li>
            <li> It is not what I expected....Doesn&#x27;t clean well. I tried to clean shaver and blades, didn&#x27;t work. Personally I didn&#x27;t like it. Delivery was perfect though.</li>
            <li> This lubricant keeps my razor in good shape, I use it once a week.I like it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my electric razor and it works as expected. No complaints.</li>
            <li> I like this better than just using oil on my shaver&#x27;s.  The reason why it cleans and oils at the same time.  And the cost is not bad at all.  It works very well.  I used to use the Wahl and now I have changed because this seems to work better and keep my Razor kits nice and clean.</li>
            <li> Spray is very messy, stuff gets everywhere. Electric Shaver Aid was easier to do pinpoint spray onto the cutters with less mess and waste.</li>
            <li> very poor. I buy stuff from the grocery that is much better and cheaper</li>
            <li> Keeps my Norelco in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my husband when I got him a new razor to go with it.  He loved it.</li>
            <li> This was much better than the ones I have bought at walmart</li>
            <li> I switched from this products competitor for no other reason than to just try something new and I wish I hadn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t know how I missed the reviews that said it was not a lubricant, but I can now second that. The directions say to spray it on and let it dry before use, which I tried, and then I just tried spraying it on and shaving, but either way the blades heated up quickly and the razor grabbed at my face. The competition (sold on amazon) is MUCH better.</li>
            <li> I am not sure about cleaning the heads but it does lubficate them as you can hear the rpm&#x27;s pick up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not clear when and how to use this stuff, and it is pretty expensive for such a small can.</li>
            <li> This works well.  I have used it three times and have been happy with the results.  I&#x27;m not sure how well it cleans in the small places and I still have to take the blades out and clean them up as before, but between blade cleaning this seems to really help them to stay lubricated and moving smoothly.</li>
            <li> Most men use blade and foam systems.  I prefer the electric shaver.  Now fifty-nine, I had horrible acne when a teenager and well into my mid-twenties.  Blades were not practical, so I used electric.  This product is very useful for keeping the shaver in top shape and reducing the wear on the blades so that they do not have to be replaced as often.</li>
            <li> I have a Norelco electric razor that has last me for quite some time. I change the blades yearly and clean and lubricate the machine every other use or so. It keeps the razor working properly and smelling great. I spray some on and let the machine air dry and it does the trick. One can will last a long time, depending on use.</li>
            <li> What can I say so far as judging this product? I hope it extends the life of the blades but if it doesn&#x27;t, how would I know?</li>
            <li> Everything was perfect!</li>
            <li> This is what I needed for a smoother shave and this makes your blades last longer. I recommend that you use this product on all your shaver blades to make them last longer.</li>
            <li> Is exactly as described, if you need this product it is worth getting...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell that this product is an effective cleaner. It only leaves a very small amount of lubricant behind.</li>
            <li> Great cleaner to help keep my electric razor clean and in good working order.</li>
            <li> OK as far as I know  Norelco shaver was such a POS, I never had a chance to use it</li>
            <li> really improved the functioning of my Norelco - maybe I should try it on some door hinges - or maybe not</li>
            <li> Works well cleaning and lubricating razor.  Prolongs the razor head life.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT, GREAT PRICE. QUICK SHIPPING</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting spray oil like I&#x27;ve always gotten, but this is like a cleaning foam.  You&#x27;re supposed to leave the razor out to air dry after using it, which makes it inconvenient for every shave use like I do with the oil.  I be more careful what I&#x27;m ordering next time, but that will be a while as long as this is likely to last.</li>
            <li> The product foamed out of the can, left a tacky residue and worst of all - left a terrible fragrance all over the blades.  Even alcohol won&#x27;t remove the fragrance easily.  I threw it away.  It&#x27;s a waste of money for me.  This is not the same product I previously purchased, although both were labeled HQ110.</li>
            <li> Since 2004,I used Norelco Shavers model like SmartTouch XL,Speed XL and now SensoTouch 3D RQ1290CC. Previously I use to clean my shaver Philips Jet clean solution HQ200 but this product is good than HQ200.Very good price and free delivery via Amazon,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Features:&lt;br /&gt;--Very simple to use&lt;br /&gt;--maximum shaving performance, Alcohol based cleaning spray with lubricating components for a clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;--Fresh scent that will remain on your shaving head, so you can enjoy the perfect fresh and clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;--After cleaning, the shaving heads smell, look  as new.</li>
            <li> Good spray for razor. I expected a bigger can for the price of it. I can get a bigger can at WalMart for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> Razor runs so much more smoothly and quietly.  Also responsible for blades lasting longer.</li>
            <li> This spray does just what is is supposed to do: Clean razor heads and clipper blades. Good Item for both.</li>
            <li> Very useful.  Had not used this before but really like what it does for the blades.  Maybe I&#x27;ll get more than 3 months out of them if I lube them up.</li>
            <li> Ideal for any electric razor brand, long lasting can</li>
            <li> This product has helped keep my shaver lubricated and stopped any rusting or effected use. Great product to keep shaver useful and lubricated.</li>
            <li> Appears to be what it is.  Hard to get too excited about this product though.  And now five more words.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but the Braun model (not available anymore) was a bit better. This one seems to have a strong spray which kinda spreads liquid around too much. It does what it says, but should  be cheaper.</li>
            <li> BEST!  I had been looking for a cleaner/lubricant.  Then I found this on Amazon.com.  It&#x60;s the best I&#x60;ve seen.  THANKS.</li>
            <li> great product and seller AAA</li>
            <li> Used this for only about Five days and Happy</li>
            <li> Item arrived timely, securely packaged. I applied spray to my shaver&#x27;s head and allowed it to sit for a while before rinsing. Effectively cleaned head.</li>
            <li> some people are thinking this does not lubricate because it is alcohol,  but it is denatured alcohol.  denatured alcohol has chemicals added to it to make it non-drinkable, one of those chemicals is petroleum oil among a variety of other things.  this product does lubricate and works very well on my Norelco aquatech razor model 810. you can look up denatured alcohol, formulations,  on Wikipedia.great product!</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s to say?&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s oil.&lt;br /&gt;Of course, its exactly the right oil for electric shaver heads, and just what you need after a thorough cleaning when the original oil has been washed away.&lt;br /&gt;Runs smoother, and smells like new (you don&#x27;t need much).</li>
            <li> Seems like a good idea.  I use it once a week after the 7th shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not used to a foam as a lubricant, but seems to work well.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and speedy shipping.</li>
            <li> Another great electric shave product.  Works great on all brands and improves shave performance substantially!</li>
            <li> This product is a quick, easy, and thorough way of keeping my Norelco razor heads clean.  This spray is more efficient than the \\&quot;home remedies\\&quot; that I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> Sorry it&#x27;s not what I expected its not a lubricant</li>
            <li> norelco stuff was more of a cleaner rather than a lubricant .  not as good as the last time we tried this stuff.&lt;br /&gt; we need product that just lubricates the razor ; we can clean the blades myself w/o this stuff.</li>
            <li> After using this product several times, I have to say that it has done a fine job in helping to clean and lubricate my Morelco  razor.&lt;br /&gt;It has made the care of the razor much easer.</li>
            <li> If You want to get the most out of your electric razor, you will definitely need a can of this to keep it well maintenance.</li>
            <li> It cleans without becoming gummy and the aroma is not medicinal or mechanical.  An excellent product for that cleaning routine that is so essential to keeping your razor functioning at its best.</li>
            <li> Cleans my shaver and provides a smoother shave.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.  Very satisfied that it is OEM.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money. The spray went all over my hand and into the air and on the counter top - every place but where I was aiming it. DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> Only tried it once, but will continue to use it for cleaning.</li>
            <li> This Norelco razer lubricant and cleaner all in one does the job. Thanks to Norelco for making a great razer and cleaner.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on clearance and I really didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my shaver&#x27;s performance. I then checked the contents of the can- only two items, \\&quot;Isobutane\\&quot; and \\&quot;denatured ethyl alcohol\\&quot;. The isobutane provides the pressure to spray and the alcohol is a cleaner. This is denatured alcohol in a spray can. At $8 plus a can that is outrageously expensive. You are better to purchase a bottle of denatured alcohol for $1 and pouring a small amount of it on the blades to clean them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco is taking buyers to the cleaners.</li>
            <li> Quite pleasant cleaner for my razors.  I think the lube part helps too.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband&#x27;s electric razor and it works okay but the blades are the issues I keep having with his razor</li>
            <li> I obviously own a Norelco Philips.  I use this cleaner  and lubricant regularly to keep the blades at a high-operative mode.  Just one of those accessories for your Norelco or similar product to use.  Very much recommended.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic!</li>
            <li> great product thank you !!!!</li>
            <li> You have to use it in a well ventilated area. It hard to do this in my bathroom and I&#x27;am not going outside to clean it.&lt;br /&gt; However, it has a long lasting smell that I do not like.</li>
            <li> Razor runs a bit faster after treatment. Cutting efficiency seems better. Shaves a bit smoother.</li>
            <li> This cleaner-lubricant spray seems to work well, and I&#x27;m looking forward to better performance and longer life from my shaving heads as a result of using this spray.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores. Easy here, makes for better shave if heads are clean and lubed</li>
            <li> If it was a couple bucks it would be great.It&#x27;s not a lube since there&#x27;s no moisture that remains on shaver but at least it is steril.I blow it out with compressed air then hit it with spray.</li>
            <li> More cleaner than lube</li>
