            <li> I have purchased several green polishes, but never really liked any of them.  This green is amazing!!  It&#x27;s bright and fun!</li>
            <li> This was my first time using Essie nail polish, and it was great. Aside from that this is one of the most beautiful shades of green in nail polish that I&#x27;ve used. It goes on smoothly, and looks absolutely beautiful. I would recommend for one to purchase this nail polish. Won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

            <li> I love Essie. And I absolutely love this color, awesome green. Good quality polish. Goes on very well, arrived on time.</li>
            <li> It is the same shade as in the picture. I really enjoyed the color for the summer.</li>
            <li> Love this color but when I took the nail polish off, it had stained the nail bed very bad.</li>

            <li> I love this polish. It&#x27;s very thick so you don&#x27;t have to apply a multiple coats. It seems a little more &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; than in the picture. I believe the picture provided has a gloss top coat on it. Very beautiful shade of green!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty on its own or by shading too.&lt;br /&gt;Essie is a good brand but it tends to separate easily in time.&lt;br /&gt;Easy solution is shake them once in a while.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this summer. PERFECT for St. Patty&#x27;s day coming up as well as an eye popping summer color. Product shipped very quickly!</li>
            <li> Exactly what is pictured, and I received it really fast.  Really happy with this choice, and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty color.  I bought it for myself but my daughter felt like she needed to use it 1st.  It&#x27;s very pretty!!!!</li>
            <li> Another great book. Please keep up the great work. Enjoyable recommended her items to friends and family. Great read will read items in future.</li>
            <li> I have a couple Essie products but because of the price and addicting shades, try to stay away from it as much as possible. However, when I tried this shade on at Target, I knew I was a goner. It is *perfect*. I can&#x27;t really describe it except it reminds me of summer, mermaids, and is a color not usually found in nail polish. The thickness was also perfect, unlike some other essie products I have.</li>
            <li> The prefect summer green!  Very pigmented just 2 light coats and your set to go. Very nice color. Not to green not to light.</li>
            <li> Great color, arrived on time and as pictured</li>
            <li> Essie products are so good! the polishes are exactly as shown the pictures, and with two coats is perfect! thanks!</li>
            <li> I use this color with Essie Fill the Gap. The color is great with just one coat and lasts for days. Great feedback from friends on the festive spring color.</li>
            <li> The color is a great vibrant color not too loutd but good for all seasons. Received alot of compliments on the color.</li>
            <li> I love this shade for summer.  It is exactly as shown in the picture.  It is a very unique shade!</li>
