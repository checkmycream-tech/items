            <li>will update when I use it :)</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this product unless you don&#x27;t mind waiting a month or more for it to arrive.</li>
            <li>great price and large jar perfect for clients, much cheaper than ibd and you get twice as much.</li>
            <li>And it really easy to use.</li>
            <li>This gel isnt really strong and it always breaks on me</li>
            <li>but so far so good it wasn&#x27;t opened or anything.</li>
            <li>This product might be good for someone who already has really strong and long nails.</li>
            <li>Luckily it was super cheap.</li>
            <li>I would still purchase it because even at a 1/4 full tub it&#x27;s still the cheapest around.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>I know that I purchased clear but that was a huge mistake on my part.</li>
            <li>My only issue is that the container makes it look like there is way more than there is</li>
            <li>I actually got this very quickly considering where it was shipped</li>
            <li>which is something that I don&#x27;t really care for.</li>
            <li>thanks guys....  </li>
            <li>I ordered three containers of the clear gel only, so I don&#x27;t know how well the cover pink and white go on, but the clear is very good.</li>
            <li>I received this product very quickly(I ordered this as my birthday present) and it shipped and was delivered withing two days.</li>
            <li>As far as the quality, I like the gel</li>
            <li>So far, the biggest problem is cleaning the brush.</li>
            <li>came faster then expected, thanks!</li>
            <li>only 1/2 full &amp; then 1/2 of that was hard</li>
            <li>I like how clear it is when it dry</li>
            <li>it needs to be put on super thick</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I like how clear it is when it dry</li>
            <li> it needs to be put on super thick</li>
            <li> I got my gel about a week after the purchased date which was earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry correctly at all</li>
            <li> I have not used this item yet, I will update once I do, but so far, it took forever to ship like 3 weeks, and upon opening the foil, I got some of the gel on my finger and had to use my husbands industrial degreaser that he uses to get heavy grease off of him after working on a vehicle to get it off!</li>
            <li> So be careful upon opening.</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to see and in order for the gel to stay strong</li>
            <li> I like to build my nails pretty thick anyways, and thick gel is just easier for me to control with my applicator brush.</li>
            <li> Thick enough...just a kind of smell , but not too bad.</li>
            <li> Also as other reviewers have stated, it is much less volume than you expect by looking at the container, but for the price, I won&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> Not good got the product all over the outside not much in the container</li>
            <li> and I personally like the thick consistency.</li>
            <li> Shipping is a little bit of a  wait.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s like a little cup in the container itself that has the gel in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t hard for me to cure or shape my nails, and I had no skin issues with this product like other customers.</li>
            <li> The product was hard and almost all gone as the cap was off and the foil cover was broken, I threw it out couldn&#x27;t bother sending g out back</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> Not sure how well it works yet</li>
            <li> so I had to dig out the hard chunk.  </li>
            <li> NOT  HAPPY</li>
            <li> I saw some customers a little confused about the stickiness, but with any gel base, you need a cleanser.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s impossible to get an even coat.</li>
            <li> This product was terrible.</li>

            <li> I got my gel about a week after the purchased date which was earlier than expected. I&#x27;m pleased and look forward to using on my clients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dominique</li>

So be careful upon opening. Also as other reviewers have stated, it is much less volume than you expect by looking at the container, but for the price, I won&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> The gel is just ok for me. I know that I purchased clear but that was a huge mistake on my part. It is very difficult to see and in order for the gel to stay strong it needs to be put on super thick which is something that I don&#x27;t really care for. This gel isnt really strong and it always breaks on me so I have to end up ripping the rest of my nails off. This product might be good for someone who already has really strong and long nails.</li>
            <li> fair prices, and recieved my item as stated on the delivery right between the dates, looks as pictured and im very happy. thank you. great price and large jar perfect for clients, much cheaper than ibd and you get twice as much.</li>
            <li> Thick enough...just a kind of smell , but not too bad. Shipping is a little bit of a  wait.</li>
            <li> The product was hard and almost all gone as the cap was off and the foil cover was broken, I threw it out couldn&#x27;t bother sending g out back</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Yay! Great gel for this price.</li>
            <li> It is great for the price. I used it to learn how to do gel nails. It does burn when curing though</li>
            <li> I received this product very quickly(I ordered this as my birthday present) and it shipped and was delivered withing two days. As far as the quality, I like the gel and I personally like the thick consistency. I like to build my nails pretty thick anyways, and thick gel is just easier for me to control with my applicator brush. I ordered three containers of the clear gel only, so I don&#x27;t know how well the cover pink and white go on, but the clear is very good. It wasn&#x27;t hard for me to cure or shape my nails, and I had no skin issues with this product like other customers. I will warn that you need a cleanser to remove the sticky surface after curing. I saw some customers a little confused about the stickiness, but with any gel base, you need a cleanser. Over all a good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m testing craft usage with this.  So far, the biggest problem is cleaning the brush.</li>
            <li> came faster then expected, thanks! wonderful</li>
            <li> This product was terrible. It doesn&#x27;t dry correctly at all and it&#x27;s impossible to get an even coat. Complete waste of money. Luckily it was super cheap.</li>
            <li> Not good got the product all over the outside not much in the container NOT  HAPPY</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  I do my own nails and this is all I use.  It doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg and it lasts.  Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!  thanks guys....  Cathi</li>
            <li> This product is affordable for your basic gel needs. Easy to work with and shines great for application. Love it</li>
            <li> I actually got this very quickly considering where it was shipped from!&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it two days ago &amp;Just got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used it yet but so far so good it wasn&#x27;t opened or anything. My only issue is that the container makes it look like there is way more than there is :/ There&#x27;s like a little cup in the container itself that has the gel in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update when I use it :)</li>
            <li> Not sure how well it works yet but my tubs were not sealed at all, only 1/2 full &amp; then 1/2 of that was hard so I had to dig out the hard chunk.  Now there&#x27;s not much left.  If it works good I would still purchase it because even at a 1/4 full tub it&#x27;s still the cheapest around.</li>
            <li> I like how clear it is when it dry&#x27;s keep in mind you do have to have a UV dryer or it won&#x27;t set. And it really easy to use. And if you like it thinner then just stick it in the microwave for 30 seconds or so.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product unless you don&#x27;t mind waiting a month or more for it to arrive. Might be a great product! No way to tell as yet.</li>
