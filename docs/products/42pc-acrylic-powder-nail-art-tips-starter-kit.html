            <li>Hello, i have received my package and i love everything about it.</li>
            <li>Love this nail starter kit coz being in school for nail art</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li>very thing was great in my package</li>
            <li>Could do better on shipping.</li>
            <li>is ok for those that are learning and practiceing not for clientel use</li>
            <li>I love to do my nails....</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this nail starter kit.</li>
            <li>Amazing quality, quantity, and fast shipment!</li>
            <li>She likes it fine.</li>
            <li>The brushed work great.</li>
            <li>This is a great starting kit</li>
            <li>Oh and the nail clippers are cheap.</li>
            <li>and this is a great kit for practice only.</li>
            <li>the glass dappen dish is great of course but rather tiny</li>
            <li>the nails were cheap</li>
            <li>Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, but I am super happy it&#x27;s here.</li>
            <li>I did not lose a significant amount of powder.</li>
            <li>Its perfect for people who want to do their own at home for fun, and it should last me a long time.</li>
            <li>Not that great...  not much to say about it because it was rather underwhelming.</li>
            <li>Good time to get the product and I likely</li>
            <li>it is a good starting kit.</li>
            <li>Also they acrylic powder is only good for one set</li>
            <li>It was cool had everything I wanted</li>
            <li>It came with lots of cool colors and decorations for nail art.</li>
            <li>Everything was included and full.</li>
            <li>Overall it was a good starter kit.</li>
            <li>I got primer separate because this kit doesn&#x27;t come with any, but not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>other then that it was great.  </li>
            <li>But, it came with way more than just 42 peices, I was thrilled with all the little extras.</li>
            <li>then that it was worth the money</li>
            <li>For someone who is barely starting to do their own nails</li>
            <li>I would recommend buying more clear acrylic</li>
            <li>Pretty cool for beginners</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>Fun to use.</li>
            <li>..hope this review helped .. if your willing to put money into getting the right stuff this will start you off .. you WILL have to purchase additional items ...</li>
            <li>Not only does this make a great start up kit but to restock current supplies.  </li>
            <li>The only problem was the bottles of glue were only filled halfway but other than that it was pretty awesome</li>
            <li>This kit has everything you could possibly need for it &amp; more</li>
            <li>I would been a better set only if it included primer.</li>
            <li>Bought this item for my daughter, everything arrived exactly as shown and described.  </li>
            <li>Definitely should get higher quality brushes other than that the rest is good</li>
            <li>I recieved it yesterday and really got what I paid for.</li>
            <li>I absolutely think it is something that others should buy.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really say much, bought it for my niece</li>
            <li>yesterday very thing was in a package and in bubble wrap</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product and will buy again!</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>when i got it my pakage the smell of the liquid was strong and the glitters were small they are practice size not client size the brushes were cheap...</li>
            <li>And also This company should work on better packaging and making sure that everything is closed correctly because the glitters and powders were not completely closed so they spilled over a little bit.</li>
            <li>the clippers i got were pink , they do work however they seem cheaply made ?</li>
            <li>everything looks great ðŸ˜Š except the grey bottle is only half full from leaking in the box other than that</li>
            <li>I love the package but when I got it, every item was smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li>First of all, all the products arrived in one envelop, no proper packaging.</li>
            <li>Each color is not enough to do a whole set of nails.</li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it is that it took 3 weeks to get as it comes straight from china.</li>
            <li>i ordered this product, expecting a high quality standard.</li>
            <li>else.the sanding blocks were fine , the mold was fine ( dirty from sparkles )</li>
            <li>i did receive a bunch of acrylic colors in which you HAVE to mix with the clear acrylic powders to actually use them for those of which don&#x27;t know .</li>
            <li>shipped fast its what i expected will buy again.</li>
            <li>shipping took a little longer than I expected but otherwise every thing was fine.</li>
            <li>Like all the reviews the liquid is only half full nothing leaked all the acrylic powders and glitters are small but pretty.</li>
            <li>The monomer is only half full, but that was listed in other reviews.</li>
            <li>The box was missing a few items, the monomer liquid was only half full, and the tweezers were junk, but overall worth what I paid for the items I did get.</li>

            <li> I mean you get everything you see here and an added smile.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying again in the distant future.</li>
            <li> The containers of the acrylic powder were not sealed properly, causing acrylic powder to be scattered over all of the other products.</li>
            <li> The containers with the nail glitters were also not sealed properly, therefore spilling over the other products.</li>
            <li> The powders and glitters were a little loose, but nothing major.</li>
            <li> I got the mold loose in the box</li>
            <li> but that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> the glue was good but scary when a dot driped on to a rag and it smoked that was scary</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed with my purchase even though it was missing my 20 random nails.</li>
            <li> Other than that there is everything I need.</li>
            <li> But I would buy things separately from other trusted shops for quality purposes.</li>
            <li> but from other reviews i don&#x27;t want to take the chance and would rather use my other glues</li>
            <li> and I still have some if not most of the product left over...</li>
            <li> the tweezer thing was bent other than that u get all of what&#x27;s there...</li>
            <li> 2 parts clear acrylic to the colored acrylic for it to be proper.the caviar beads unfortunately did get rattled around and the colors mixed , so count on that of course.</li>
            <li> I expected low quality due to the previous reviews, and I was surprised at the fact that it wasn&#x27;t really that bad!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical and hesitant at first after reading some reviews.</li>
            <li> As stated in previous reviews ... GET YOURSELF ACRYLIC BRUSHES and PRIMER ...</li>
            <li> so it took a little over a month</li>
            <li> the primer the glitter was small but other</li>
            <li> Nothing was missing.</li>
            <li> and now i cant use it because it has dried up.</li>
            <li> I did not recieve a few things in my package...</li>
            <li> missing .</li>
            <li> Had trouble getting the nail stuff to stick kept popping off wrote them they walked me threw it.</li>
            <li> The acrylic sets up way too quickly - so much so that it&#x27;s virtually impossible to do any work.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> My boyfriend was the one who opened this package at first and he was taken back at how horribly it smelled of chemicals.</li>
            <li> they are small</li>
            <li> and yes all of the glitter and acrylics are small (even the &amp;#34;big&amp;#34; ones) but it has almost everything you need to start.</li>
            <li> so i did loose a little bit of glitter unfortunately.</li>
            <li> they are not sturdy and therefore fray and don&#x27;t get the job done, Yes the glitters unfortunately do come messy as if someone didn&#x27;t put the lids on tightly</li>
            <li> no one buy  this  because  it stinks and my nails file off the second day</li>
            <li> Shipping was extremely slow.</li>
            <li> The quality and quantity of everything is poor.  </li>
            <li> the liquid was horrible the acrylic when applied was gummy the glue where empty when i received it.</li>
            <li> They had horrible customer service and we&#x27;re very rude!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m disappointed</li>
            <li> very disappointed.</li>

            <li> I would of given this a 5 star had it come with a case for all of the product. It&#x27;s shipped out of China so it took a little over a month but it got. I have a happy grand daughter.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I are getting into doing our own acrylic nails.  This set is amazing with a lot of extras.  The quality of the products is amazing.  Not only does this make a great start up kit but to restock current supplies.  We will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> very good was please got every thing excpt the primer the glitter was small but other then that it was worth the money</li>
            <li> The box was missing a few items, the monomer liquid was only half full, and the tweezers were junk, but overall worth what I paid for the items I did get.</li>
            <li> shipped fast its what i expected will buy again.</li>
            <li> I recieved it yesterday and really got what I paid for. Nothing was missing. The brushed work great. The only problem was the bottles of glue were only filled halfway but other than that it was pretty awesome</li>
            <li> Good time to get the product and I likely</li>
            <li> Hello, i have received my package and i love everything about it. This is a great starting kit and i am so happy that i received everything that it shows in the picture. I absolutely think it is something that others should buy. The only thing that i did not like about this package was that when i received it the mold was not in any packet, it wasnt even in plastic wrap. I got the mold loose in the box and now i cant use it because it has dried up. And also This company should work on better packaging and making sure that everything is closed correctly because the glitters and powders were not completely closed so they spilled over a little bit. Everthing else i have no problem with.&lt;br /&gt;Thankyou i hoped this has helped you.</li>
            <li> I did not recieve a few things in my package...i&#x27;m disappointed</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because the kit does not include primer and the brushes suck. Other than that there is everything I need.</li>
            <li> I  recommend  no one buy  this  because  it stinks and my nails file off the second day</li>
            <li> My boyfriend was the one who opened this package at first and he was taken back at how horribly it smelled of chemicals. I expected low quality due to the previous reviews, and I was surprised at the fact that it wasn&#x27;t really that bad! Everything was included in my box. The monomer is only half full, but that was listed in other reviews. The powders and glitters were a little loose, but nothing major. I did not lose a significant amount of powder. I bought additional brushes and powders and it has made up for the lack of this package. This also took FOREVER to get to my house! Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, but I am super happy it&#x27;s here. It&#x27;s lots of items that a beginner needs, conveniently located in one spot. But I would buy things separately from other trusted shops for quality purposes.</li>
            <li> Not that great...  not much to say about it because it was rather underwhelming. Shipping was extremely slow.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for with this set. I would like to see a suggested nail brush come with this set.</li>
            <li> This product is a starter kit basically do if you are looking for a starter kit for acrylic nail this is most like a good item for you.</li>
            <li> Love this nail starter kit coz being in school for nail art it&#x27;s great to have. This kit has everything you could possibly need for it &amp; more</li>
            <li> Everything came nicely packed and wrapped. Like all the reviews the liquid is only half full nothing leaked all the acrylic powders and glitters are small but pretty. For someone who is barely starting to do their own nails it is a good starting kit. I was not disappointed with my purchase even though it was missing my 20 random nails. Oh and the nail clippers are cheap. Also they acrylic powder is only good for one set they are small I would recommend buying more clear acrylic you will have to add to the color powder hope this helped</li>
            <li> i ordered this product, expecting a high quality standard. First of all, all the products arrived in one envelop, no proper packaging. The containers of the acrylic powder were not sealed properly, causing acrylic powder to be scattered over all of the other products. The containers with the nail glitters were also not sealed properly, therefore spilling over the other products.</li>
            <li> Did not receive my package.... i was looking forward to using it but did not even get a chance to look at it......did not even let me know what is up with my package! so upset</li>
            <li> I was very happy when i received my package everything looks great ðŸ˜Š except the grey bottle is only half full from leaking in the box other than that im happy... now im just waiting on my drill</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a beginners kit, don&#x27;t order this.  If you&#x27;re looking for a set of tools, don&#x27;t order this.  The quality and quantity of everything is poor.  The acrylic sets up way too quickly - so much so that it&#x27;s virtually impossible to do any work.&lt;br /&gt;A&lt;br /&gt;V&lt;br /&gt;O&lt;br /&gt;I&lt;br /&gt;D&lt;br /&gt;this kit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchase somewhere else.  You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a learner and I use this in school on my manikin hand and this is a great kit for practice only. I would been a better set only if it included primer.</li>
            <li> the liquid was horrible the acrylic when applied was gummy the glue where empty when i received it. very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this merchandise</li>
            <li> Very cheap stuff. Each color is not enough to do a whole set of nails. It took forever to get in the mail as well.</li>
            <li> It was cool had everything I wanted</li>
            <li> You have to spend additional money to get the proper brushes</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really say much, bought it for my niece and she has not received it from me yet.</li>
            <li> My wife and I bought this for our niece. She likes it fine. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it is that it took 3 weeks to get as it comes straight from china.</li>
            <li> I  just got my order yesterday very thing was in a package and in bubble wrap very thing was great in my package it was delivered nicely to me and safely I luv everything bout this package. I would order it again</li>
            <li> My daughter loved it. Could do better on shipping. But she loves it.</li>
            <li> Pretty cool for beginners</li>
            <li> Love the kit! Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> The bridges in the kit aren&#x27;t that great. Definitely should get higher quality brushes other than that the rest is good</li>
            <li> Great starter kit. That being said, it is a STARTER kit. Dont expect it to have loads of everything. But, it came with way more than just 42 peices, I was thrilled with all the little extras. It came with lots of cool colors and decorations for nail art. I will definitely be buying again in the distant future. Its perfect for people who want to do their own at home for fun, and it should last me a long time.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical and hesitant at first after reading some reviews. I decided to buy it anyway. Everything was included and full. Nothing spilt only a couple of stray glitters. I would highly recommend this product and will buy again!</li>
            <li> When i received my things in the mail i opened the package to find i had all my nails and glitter missing . I emailed the company and they denied everything and said they couldn&#x27;t do anything to help me. They had horrible customer service and we&#x27;re very rude! So if you want to pay for something and not receive all your items go ahead and buy it .</li>
            <li> As stated in previous reviews ... GET YOURSELF ACRYLIC BRUSHES and PRIMER ... the brushes the company sends are basically junk .. i could only do about one hand then had to use a different brush .. they are not sturdy and therefore fray and don&#x27;t get the job done, Yes the glitters unfortunately do come messy as if someone didn&#x27;t put the lids on tightly so i did loose a little bit of glitter unfortunately. the clippers i got were pink , they do work however they seem cheaply made ?the dotting tools i suppose will definitely do the job. the glass dappen dish is great of course but rather tiny but that is to be expected. i did receive a bunch of acrylic colors in which you HAVE to mix with the clear acrylic powders to actually use them for those of which don&#x27;t know . 2 parts clear acrylic to the colored acrylic for it to be proper.the caviar beads unfortunately did get rattled around and the colors mixed , so count on that of course. the rhinestones are very tiny .. so if you wanted big ones i suggest you order some from someone else.the sanding blocks were fine , the mold was fine ( dirty from sparkles ) the ( wolf) file .. well the one they send you isn&#x27;t wolf but it works. the cuticle oils is very nice and works well and smells lovely. I haven&#x27;t used the glue just yet but from other reviews i don&#x27;t want to take the chance and would rather use my other glues..hope this review helped .. if your willing to put money into getting the right stuff this will start you off .. you WILL have to purchase additional items ... Brushes, Primer,Glue, Rhinestones.</li>
            <li> Everything I needed to use to do my own nails and easy to use</li>
            <li> Would have been perfect if it came with the primer. other then that it was great.  Fun to use. Thanks</li>
            <li> I love the package but when I got it, every item was smaller than I expected. Also this package does not include primer. Which you will need to purchase on your own. Overall it was a good starter kit.</li>
            <li> Bought this item for my daughter, everything arrived exactly as shown and described.  Everything from the brushes to the acrylic powders to the decorative stones works GREAT! Definitely would purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> Excellent purshase, I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
            <li> On time everything was there. Had trouble getting the nail stuff to stick kept popping off wrote them they walked me threw it.</li>
            <li> when i got it my pakage the smell of the liquid was strong and the glitters were small they are practice size not client size the brushes were cheap...the glue was good but scary when a dot driped on to a rag and it smoked that was scary no glue ive used ever did that..the nails were cheap i used diffrent ones i had already purchased and it took forever to ship also it was packaged in a yellow envelope and some of the glitters fell out and i couldnt read the labelnon the liquid since it was in chinese  thisnkit is ok for those that are learning and practiceing not for clientel use</li>
            <li> I love to do my nails.... and if u are just starting out this kit will definitely be the one... it&#x27;s been about 6 or 7 months and I still have some if not most of the product left over... the only problem with this was.... the tweezer thing was bent other than that u get all of what&#x27;s there... great price for the amount...</li>
            <li> Love it arrived on time beautiful colors</li>
            <li> Amazing quality, quantity, and fast shipment!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome starters kit. The nail clippers are not the best and yes all of the glitter and acrylics are small (even the &amp;#34;big&amp;#34; ones) but it has almost everything you need to start. I got primer separate because this kit doesn&#x27;t come with any, but not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this nail starter kit. The packaging was well cared after during shipment. It all works perfectly. I mean you get everything you see here and an added smile.</li>
            <li> Came like in the picture but its very cheap product but it good</li>
            <li> Great quality for the price.</li>
            <li> This is the best of all, if you are into doing your nail your self this will work great for you.</li>
            <li> i got the package this morning and I have to say it&#x27;s amazing! i got it in excellent condition/packaging and everything that was in the picture is in the package!! my friend knew how to apply them so I asked her to do them for me so that I can learn. and she said they were really good powders, acrylic liquid.etc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Package!!!</li>
            <li> The brushes kinda suck except the purple one it&#x27;s pretty good! ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
            <li> Dont buy them nothing they just steal your money !</li>
