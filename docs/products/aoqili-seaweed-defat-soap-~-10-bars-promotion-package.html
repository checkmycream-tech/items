            <li>THis soap is nothing special.  </li>
            <li>This soap makes your skin feel so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>This does have a mild scent when you shower</li>
            <li>I also want to add, since using the soap I&#x27;ve noticed more comfort in my knees and lower back, which led me to research the benefits of seaweed, and found one of many links on the benefit of seaweed, [...] check it out.  </li>
            <li>This soap is really good, it cleans your skin gently and leaves it soft.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad she spoke highly about it.</li>
            <li>I love the soft clean smell.  </li>

            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It makes my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says lost 15 lbs while using product.</li>
            <li>and I most say the quality is still the same.</li>
            <li>A bar can last more than a week</li>
            <li>It also dissolves really fast.</li>
            <li>BUT I WANTED TO REALLY GIVE IT A SHOT...</li>
            <li>it arrived on time, and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>because, really, let&#x27;s face it, it&#x27;s SOAP.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, and bars are good size (lasts a few months with daily use)</li>
            <li>Had high hopes, but dissappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it use it everyday.</li>
            <li>it does not lather up, or clean the same as the regular AOQUILI seaweed soap.  </li>
            <li>An added plus is that they lather up nicely and also last quite a bit longer than other similarly sized bars.  </li>
            <li>I definitely give with soap five (5) stars and highly recommend this to anyone who want a more natural way to work on problem areas or to just lose and firm all over, along with an added bonus, joint support.....</li>
            <li>MY 11 YEAR OLD SAYS,</li>
            <li>WOW MOM</li>
            <li>MY SKIN IS SO SOFT LOOK.</li>
            <li>my skin feels, just yesterday a co-worker mentioned how slim I&#x27;m getting, that was surprisingly unexpected, and made my day.  </li>
            <li>They are gentle on the skin, leaving less dryness than typical soaps, because they don&#x27;t contain all the chemical additives that most name-brand soaps contain.  </li>
            <li>The scent is a little strange....  not fresh at all, or even pleasant.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Aoqili seaweed soap for a little more than three weeks, and can really see the difference in my clothing and how soft and firm</li>
            <li>I absolutely love how it doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell and never leaves my skin tight and itchy like other soaps.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also healthy for the skin, will turn unhealthy skin red and peeling until repeated usage restores the skin to normal.</li>

            <li> This wonderful soap has a very mild scent and leaves my skin baby soft. I use it every day! I absolutely love how it doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell and never leaves my skin tight and itchy like other soaps.</li>
            <li> The soap is a very refreshing without any dangerous or harsh chemicals. Order came on time also.  Will re-order soon.</li>
            <li> It said it&#x27;ll help lose weight ...saw no improvement with my first bar of soap. This does have a mild scent when you shower but it doesn&#x27;t last long after you get out. It also dissolves really fast. Unlike regular soap bars, this one doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry. Overall I would not buy again for the price</li>
            <li> This soap is wonderful.  I had been using another brand of seaweed soap that I had discovered by accident. I loved the way the soap made the skin feel.  I was unaware of the beneficial properties of using seaweed.  Anyway I could not find the soap that I had been using so I decided to try Aoqili.  This soap has a wonderful lather that is so silky on the skin.  I love the soft clean smell.  I love this soap. Right now this is a good buy.  I hope that these positive reviews does not cause the seller to raise the price on this product, which would then make it hard for me to purchase this item again.  Oh, I forgot to mention, the seller does same day shipping on this item.  I ordered this item on the 13th, I had it by the 16th and was taking a bath with it the same evening.  Did I say that I love this soap?...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these soaps repeatedly for the past two years.  They are gentle on the skin, leaving less dryness than typical soaps, because they don&#x27;t contain all the chemical additives that most name-brand soaps contain.  An added plus is that they lather up nicely and also last quite a bit longer than other similarly sized bars.  As for the company&#x27;s claim that this soap helps \\&quot;de-fat\\&quot; your body, I suspect that&#x27;s a little advertising hype to aid sales, so I wouldn&#x27;t buy these if that&#x27;s the effect you&#x27;re hoping for.  If it weren&#x27;t for that misleading claim, I would have rated these 5 stars.</li>
            <li> DONT BOTHER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!IT IS USELESS...DONT BOTHER...WISH I COULD GET MY $ BACK BUT I WANTED TO REALLY GIVE IT A SHOT...SO I USED LIKE 3 BARS...NOTHING NADA ZIP</li>
            <li> My wife told me about this soap and I just had to have it. I am so glad she spoke highly about it.</li>
            <li> THis soap is nothing special.  The shape fits nicely in my hand, but other than that I can&#x27;t understand why all the great reviews.  The scent is a little strange....  not fresh at all, or even pleasant.  My skin is no softer or better than any of the other wonderful (shea) soaps that I use.  I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> The product is exactly as I expected it to be and I will order the same product and the same quantity.     I am very very happy!</li>
            <li> MY FAMILY USES THIS SOAP. THIS IS THE ONLY SOAP I WILL BUY. MY 11 YEAR OLD SAYS, WOW MOM MY SKIN IS SO SOFT LOOK. SHE NOW TAKES 2 SHOWERS A DAY INSTEAD OF ONE. I USED TO USE THIS SOAP IN THE 90&#x27;S DO NOT KNOW WHY I EVER STOPPED. SO GLAD I DISCOVERED IT AGAIN. ;)</li>
            <li> I use this soap for its exfoliating ability. If you leave it on your skin for about an hour a day, it will pull out impurities and blackheads over a LONG period of time, like a year. It has dried up skin tags. It&#x27;s also healthy for the skin, will turn unhealthy skin red and peeling until repeated usage restores the skin to normal. Again, I&#x27;m talking months.</li>
            <li> I have used seaweed soap in the past. I was glad to buy 10 pack. Shipping was fast, and bars are good size (lasts a few months with daily use)</li>
            <li> I love this product! it arrived on time, and shipping was fast. The soap has a great smells!! i love using it i would totally recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get the impact of seaweed in this soap at all. Had high hopes, but dissappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe 2 to 3% of the bar has seaweed in it, so it seems like it is just a \\&quot;buzz word\\&quot; to market the soap!!</li>
            <li> This soap is wonderful. It makes my skin smooth and soft. Will order again.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says lost 15 lbs while using product. Please restock asap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering this product for a couple of years now and I most say the quality is still the same.</li>
            <li> This soap makes your skin feel so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Been using this soap for about 10 years.  Some sites claim it promotes weight loss.  If one were to follow the regimen recommended with massage, etc. while using the soap, it could indeed theoretically help reduce body fat. Maybe I would be fatter if I did not use it, but it&#x27;s basically just good quality soap that I like.</li>
            <li> I did not realize it said AOQILI DEFAT SOAP instead of regular AOQUILI soap it does not lather up, or clean the same as the regular AOQUILI seaweed soap.  I compared the wrappers of the regular soap(I have) and defat soap wrapper they are very different.  I prefer the regular  AOQUILI seaweed soap.</li>
            <li> this soap have assisted me in fat loss</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Aoqili seaweed soap for a little more than three weeks, and can really see the difference in my clothing and how soft and firm my skin feels, just yesterday a co-worker mentioned how slim I&#x27;m getting, that was surprisingly unexpected, and made my day.  I also want to add, since using the soap I&#x27;ve noticed more comfort in my knees and lower back, which led me to research the benefits of seaweed, and found one of many links on the benefit of seaweed, [...] check it out.  I definitely give with soap five (5) stars and highly recommend this to anyone who want a more natural way to work on problem areas or to just lose and firm all over, along with an added bonus, joint support..... Aoqili a true blessing!</li>
            <li> Love it use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. It is the only soap I use. A bar can last more than a week and I shower twice a day. Nice smell too. Clean and soften the skin, Great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for 12+ years on my face, and it&#x27;s the closest I can get to going to the beach every day (for skin care related purposes).  My parents and in-laws have each taken a liking to this soap as well, as do most people who use it while staying at our home!</li>
            <li> wife has used product and loves it. Great product and really great service from seller.</li>
            <li> I wish it was softer on the skin. It requires body cream or lotion after. I like to return it.</li>
            <li> It is a good soap, purifying..... and works well with water as hot as you can stand it. Also, use a sponge or an exfoliant sponge. Watch the weight go!</li>
            <li> This product works wonders on my skin, especially my face. It is said that this soap supports in burning  fat as well. I am not really sure about that.</li>
            <li> My family has been using this soap for over 10 years and we all love it.  This soap is really good, it cleans your skin gently and leaves it soft.  I don&#x27;t know about the weight loss properties of it because, really, let&#x27;s face it, it&#x27;s SOAP.  If you want to lose weight - go to your gym.  However, if you want to take care good of your skin - buy this soap.</li>
            <li> Love this soap but cannot find it at Amazon anymore.  Saw someone has ONE soap for $14!!!!  NO WAY!!&lt;br /&gt;My daughter turned me on to this soap years ago and I have shared with many over the years, everyone liked it.  Not sure why it suddenly disappeared in the 10 pack????</li>
            <li> best soap anyway one of the best soaps that I have ever used before. love the stuff. also get it for a friend too.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it makes my skin feel amazing. It is just as described, and I could not be happier with my purchase.</li>
    </ol>
