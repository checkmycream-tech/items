            <li>Very smooth... and matte finish.</li>
            <li>absolutely love this lipstick and the color.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE the color.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied just as what i wanted.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>i love it ^ . ^ &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>I give it three stars, not because the quality of the lipstick itself is sub-par (I love this line of lipstick, and will continue to purchase it to fulfill my lipstick needs), but because the advertised products were not received.</li>
            <li>I love this color for fall</li>
            <li>Very cool color lipstick.</li>
            <li>badly.&lt;br /&gt;The product was shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li>The free earrings that came with it were super cute as well</li>
            <li>I simply loooove this color its so beautiful and rich.</li>
            <li>It applies smoothly too.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t receive the advertised free earrings though</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll absolutely be buying more products off this buyer.</li>
            <li>bold color and lasts a while&lt;br /&gt;the earrings that came with</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a little darker then I thought but still a very nice color</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gorgeous deep red and it makes my lips smooth.</li>
            <li>Its super dark and really nice just what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I have very dark brown hair (almost black) and pretty fair skin, so I&#x27;ve been looking for a good blue-red for months.</li>
            <li>Every color I&#x27;ve bought has been too orange, so I was very happy to finally have a red with blue undertones.</li>
            <li>Not only did I love the color and the reasonable price, but the lipstick arrived almost a week ahead of schedule.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This lipstick bleeds VERY</li>
            <li>love the color a nice dark red that has blue tones.</li>
            <li>It seems to be a true red, without any orange or purple</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend it for anyone that loves sexy red lips.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more in the future!</li>
            <li>The shade is a little darker than I thought, but I am extremely pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I love the lipstick, it is a little darker than I anticipated</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s right in the middle!</li>
            <li>Again, it is a little dark, but with a little blotting, the color is absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say anything about the formula&#x27;s wearing power, since I immediately took it off, but it is definitely very creamy and not sheer.  </li>
            <li>It wear very well, I only have to refresh once during the day, and that happens after I eat.</li>
            <li>This is a very creamy deep red that would be flattering on someone with medium or dark skin but not on me.  </li>

            <li> I love this color for fall but I find that these versions of nyx lipsticks do bleed off the lip, so you need a pencil with them to line your lips. Great product, great seller would purchase from them again</li>
