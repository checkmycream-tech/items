            <li>but this stuff is great.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>Great product for a great deal.</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>great product always use it works amazing and will keep resupplying when i run out.</li>
            <li>Another good cleanser from proactiv is the one with menthol and salicilates.  </li>
            <li>Good lotion is required.</li>
            <li>The price is good when buying in bulk.</li>
            <li>I think we are getting a good deal because these products are getting close to their expiration date.</li>
            <li>but good product would recommend to anyone...</li>
            <li>The ones that I recieved are all good and won&#x27;t expire until 14 months from now</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Proactive system since 2001 with good result.</li>
            <li>The fact that I can get five for the price of what one costs makes this even more of a great purchase.  </li>
            <li>This mask does a great job of shrinking your pores, evening out skintone and fading most redness almost immediately, all without drying your skin.</li>
            <li>my skin is looking better than ever!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I really love using the mask for spot treatments and weekly masks, and this is an AMAZING price!</li>
            <li>I love this mask!</li>
            <li>Love this bundle and face mask!</li>
            <li>We love it!  </li>
            <li>The stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing...</li>
            <li>This mask is the absolute best I have ever used and believe me, I have tried them all.</li>
            <li>it is, of course, a sulfur acne treatment, but it would be nice if they could improve the smell...</li>
            <li>Effective in getting breakouts under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great item to clean pores and reduce break outs.</li>
            <li>Excellent products and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This was a great deal for 5 full sized refining masks.</li>
            <li>Best proactiv product, people seriously need to try to believe, great deal too!</li>
            <li>I have found great success using it as a spot treatment rather than as a mask.</li>
            <li>Its proactives best product just throw it on at night and wake up with a clear face</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE the proactiv mask, (proactiv itself doesn&#x27;t really do much justice to my skin, jsut doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me) but the refining mask is AMAZING!!</li>
            <li>Have been using for for many years (and my son as well)..works great and quickly zaps those break outs.</li>
            <li>Great alternative to overall great skin product when on a budget</li>
            <li>I suppose they were too good to be true</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>This sulfur mask works magic.  </li>
            <li>The mask is our favorite.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>This process has worked for me and during my more \\&quot;time of the month\\&quot; episodes</li>
            <li>i used to be stuck on the proactiv schedule, but then i realized i could buy them separately, and it&#x27;s a much better deal.  </li>
            <li>and it made me break out in more pimples</li>
            <li>The cost for the tubes was fantastic!</li>
            <li>and I am a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>I have used the mask before and love it, but now worried I should&#x27;ve passed this deal and got the medication I knew was reliable.</li>
            <li>I love this product but never got it in the mail.</li>
            <li>Bonus - 2.5 oz bottles meet airline guidelines :)</li>
            <li>I love the product.  </li>
            <li>Taking a shower gets rid of it better than just rinsing your face off in the sink.</li>
            <li>All things considered, I still use it and love it, and have recommended it to others.</li>
            <li>I have use Proactive on and off for over 15 years now, and I still love it.</li>
            <li>The mask is the best part of the entire Proactive line, if you ask me!</li>
            <li>I love this sulfur mask, and with this order, I got a lot for the price.</li>
            <li>:)))</li>
            <li>The swelling on her pimples is better after leaving this product on her face overnight.</li>
            <li>I have been in love with this mask since they started selling it at Proactiv.</li>
            <li>so I am sure they will be used by then.  </li>
            <li>After I use the mask I can see a more even skin tone and reduced redness.  </li>
            <li>I really love this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so great, and now, it&#x27;s so affordable to buy on Amazon separately from the whole Proactiv set.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i love this face mask.</li>
            <li>I love this product from Proactive.</li>
            <li>This product is great in clearing skin and making your skin healthy and clear.</li>
            <li>I love how quick to absorb it is!  </li>
            <li>However, I was very impressed when I received these in pristine condition, with the original seals in place and an expiration date over a year in the future!</li>
            <li>and I am glad it is available in bulk.</li>
            <li>I thought it was cheap and a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, the Refining Mask has always worked great at shrinking or even eliminating any acne overnight!</li>
            <li>so I tend to break out easily</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not too strong and doesn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li>I think the mask is the newer version where it&#x27;s supposed to be not as strong on your skin.</li>
            <li>My Fiance&#x27; decided to try it because he too works in a kitchen &amp; has frequent break outs &amp; he too has amazing results!</li>
            <li>However, just make sure you get the full number of items you ordered.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect home facial and really gets rid of those blackheads!  </li>
            <li>I got huge cystic acne and a lot of scarring.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed a huge difference with my pores but it has helped with hyperpigmentation.  </li>
            <li>I had a free sample from proactive</li>
            <li>The Amazon price was fantastic.  </li>
            <li>For sure it&#x27;s worth it ....</li>
            <li>I keep this product readily available and have to hide it from my granddaughter when she visits.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s ridiculously cheap for Proactive products.</li>
            <li>the price was great and the set of 5 will last all year.</li>
            <li>I just like two seconds ago ordered this item while I&#x27;m fighting (and starting to win)</li>
            <li>so glad I can just get this and not the whole set and having to buy it every month so thanks AMAZON!!!!</li>
            <li>Very useful.</li>
            <li>I use this product after I shave &amp; it makes my skin feel so smooth, clean &amp; refreshed.</li>
            <li>The main reason I got it is to shrink pores, but it is advertised as a spot treatment also and it would have been nice.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone i love it &amp; will without a doubt be back to buy more :)</li>
            <li>but i love the mask, it really has reduced the size of my pores!  </li>
            <li>I seemed to prefer the original but this will do.</li>
            <li>I have used Proactiv products before so I was familiar with the refining mask.  </li>
            <li>Blemishes disappear (or at the least greatly improve) overnight with this amazing mask.</li>
            <li>just got it to use and clean my face sometimes.....</li>
            <li>A mask makes your face clean, so so quality</li>
            <li>This is about all I use regularly to clean my face, often leaving it on overnight.</li>
            <li>This controls it right away!  </li>
            <li>This is great for me because at night my skin gets very oily and this not only prevents that but also leaves my skin smooth and diminishes the acne while i sleep.</li>
            <li>It contains a sulfur and while applying and wearing it is no problem, no bad smell.</li>
            <li>The reaction between the sulfur and the salicylic acid in the toner (also a Proactiv product) is pretty strong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different kind of masks, and they all leave my face soft to some extent, but this mask is the best I&#x27;ve ever come across yet for shrinking blemishes, clearing up skin, and leaving it</li>
            <li>but so glad I was able to order it elsewhere and not have to pay extra to order through proactive.  </li>
            <li>Product as described, quick shipment.</li>
            <li>quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since had better luck by switching to Clearogen, mainly for the face wash and night treatments, and using drugstore brands for non-comedogenic moisturizers with spf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The new formulation just makes it better.  </li>
            <li>Good but leaves my face dry.</li>
            <li>After your face is clear, maintenance is crucial to maintain a beautiful skin.  </li>
            <li>5 bottles quick shipment and not expired... worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Use this at least once a week as a mask, and use it whenever needed as a spot treatment, and the effect is pretty impressive.</li>
            <li>This stuff did wonders for my son, it cleared his face really well!!</li>
            <li>I received this product about a week and a half early which I loved because I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it!!</li>
            <li>After two treatments my skin is virtually free of blemishes and my large pores noticeably diminished.  </li>
            <li>The prompt delivery helps me enjoy my product that much faster.</li>
            <li>but I figured it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every mask on the market and the Proactiv Refining Mask is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>the price is definitely worth it</li>
            <li>i would suggest this mask, especially for such a good price!</li>
            <li>They work great especially when you need extra help with acne.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only Proactiv product that actually works, but it works great.</li>
            <li>I have been using Proactive for sometime, and was happy to find the refining mask at such a low price.</li>
            <li>but mainly I use it as a spot treatment before I go to bed to reduce redness and size of a pimple, and boy does it work well!!</li>
            <li>The only catch is that it doesn&#x27;t smell very good, as it has sulfur as it&#x27;s active ingredient.</li>
            <li>but first I wash my face</li>
            <li>I also will use it on acne and then put make-up on after the mask is on first which helps stop acne from worsening if needed...</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>First of all, I got five of these for 18 bucks.</li>
            <li>I just finished wiping this off my face for the first time</li>
            <li>I have used Nutrogena, Merle Norman, Clinique, St. Ives,  and so on.&lt;br /&gt;Results with Proactive&#x27;s refining mask can be seen 12 hours after the first application.  </li>
            <li>Where was this in the 70&#x27;s when I really needed it!?  </li>
            <li>Worked at first but skin must have gotten used to it.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want 5 bottles at first try one and see how it works for you.  </li>
            <li>Doesnt take much product to use and this bulk purchase was worth it.</li>
            <li>This product really takes care of pimples overnight and with the right use it takes care of the marks as well.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t work nearly as well as the original purchased from Proactiv.</li>
            <li>I fell in love instantly and brought the whole package for myself.</li>
            <li>It is very tempting to over use this product especially if your blemishes have been overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>I complete a full mask every week and treat my nose and chin once or twice during the week, as well.</li>
            <li>Leads me again to believe that they push their benzo products more because they&#x27;ve patented them while other products that work better don&#x27;t rake in the same $.</li>
            <li>and I can already see a difference in my nose, which has always had large pores.</li>
            <li>I found myself using mostly the renewing cleanser and this refining mask (as per my skin, using all of the steps would dry it out too much)</li>
            <li>You need only a small amount of it to cover the whole face, it has a fine texture and it works at is best with the other Proactiv products.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t tell you how much this stuff works...</li>
            <li>then I put on a cheap generic lotion with salasylic acid (forgive an spelling errors on that)</li>
            <li>I suffered with adult-onset acne for years and tried the whole Proactive line but didn&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
            <li>The price for this set of 5 is really reasonable and the product is mint.  </li>
            <li>When I used proactiv before nothing really worked except the mask.</li>
            <li>I had used Proactive Mask years ago and was wondering if I could get just the mask without having to get the whole package</li>
            <li>I like buying them in bulk, because it is much cheaper that way.</li>
            <li>and when i saw this deal..i could not pass it by...excellent purchase and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t do much anymore</li>
            <li>THe product works really well for me.  </li>
            <li>This product seems to work ok for me so far but have only used it for about a week now.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a lot more affordable than other masks.</li>
            <li>When I was getting married I wanted to have clear skin.</li>
            <li>Product is older version but still works and came sealed and unopened.  </li>
            <li>However, the seller quickly issued a refund for one fifth of the overall purchase price of the set.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product from this particular site because you said &#x27;SET OF 5&#x27; which in means there should have been 5 bottles.</li>
            <li>However, I missed this particular step from the Proactive system.</li>
            <li>Of course you&#x27;ll maximize it&#x27;s effects if you use a kit but even without one you still get decent results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price was good, but this product has never really worked for me other than to help bring pimples forming to the surface on occasion.</li>
            <li>The Proactiv Solution Refining Mask has worked very well as an overnight treatment to clear up my daughter&#x27;s skin and as a cleanser.</li>
            <li>Buying it on Amazon is much easier than trying to get it direct from the company.</li>
            <li>I am not crazy about the smell, but I don&#x27;t feel like that justifies deducting an entire star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li>And buying it in the pack of five is such a great deal, it&#x27;s hard NOT to get this!</li>
            <li>Cant live without it tho.</li>
            <li>All products we&#x27;re brand  new and as promised .</li>
            <li>I mostly use the multiple bottles I have left (seriously this stuff seems to stem from some magical well of infinity) for covering up my face around the house when I don&#x27;t want to be reminded of what might plague my skin that day.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t dry out your skin and leaves it feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I love what this sulfur mask does for my skin, but I do not love the prices proactiv charges.</li>
            <li>To see the dramatic results in such a short  period of time tempts one to think more is better.</li>
            <li>and I still have half of the treatment left as I haven&#x27;t needed any more of it since.</li>
            <li>It will eventually help clear up your skin in about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I started using proactiv about a year ago, i have struggled with acne since i was young</li>
            <li>Bulk is better, for me at least.</li>
            <li>it baby soft.</li>
            <li>This was the only place I could buy this product seperate from buying the whole</li>
            <li>The overall result was pretty good, though, but it smelled bad and the container doesn&#x27;t hold much.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend all of their products, but especially this one.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it as it took only a month to cure my acne</li>
            <li>It is normal, as all the products are still deep in the skin.</li>
            <li>and my skin is back to normal.  </li>
            <li>It lasts much, much longer and this way my skin does not get overly dry.</li>
            <li>The expiration date is about a year and a half away, so this company seems trustworthy for providing a fresh product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They just keep shrinking as you use it each night until gone.&lt;br /&gt;Has a slight sulfur smell after applying, but is tolerable and well worth the results.</li>
            <li>Just put it over night, and you have a clear skin the next morning</li>
            <li>My sons wanted this to help clear up their occasional blemishes.</li>
            <li>I gave it to my sister since ProActiv apparently does not work well on my skin.</li>
            <li>I starting using this product I had dark spots and bumps all over my face, after two weeks i notice no more bumps my face is nice and smooth, I will order the spot remover to get the dark spots out my face but no more BUMPS.</li>
            <li>Beats DDF, Ole Henriksen, Origins, Clinique and every other high end skincare line on the market, plus</li>
            <li>It can certainly be a little drying, so be careful of not over-doing it in the beginning, but this stuff is super helpful.</li>
            <li>It really helps your acne go down the next day.</li>

            <li> GREAT DEAL</li>
            <li> but this stuff is great.</li>
            <li> I tried to look for expiration date before I ordered-because of the great price...</li>
            <li> great product, great price</li>
            <li> It feels great on my face.</li>
            <li> thank you for the great product.</li>
            <li> I was happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The pack of 5 is a great deal given the price that Proactiv charges.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Great product for a great deal.</li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> great product always use it works amazing and will keep resupplying when i run out.</li>
            <li> Another good cleanser from proactiv is the one with menthol and salicilates.  </li>
            <li> Good lotion is required.</li>
            <li> The price is good when buying in bulk.</li>
            <li> I think we are getting a good deal because these products are getting close to their expiration date.</li>
            <li> but good product would recommend to anyone...</li>
            <li> The ones that I recieved are all good and won&#x27;t expire until 14 months from now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Proactive system since 2001 with good result.</li>
            <li> The fact that I can get five for the price of what one costs makes this even more of a great purchase.  </li>
            <li> This mask does a great job of shrinking your pores, evening out skintone and fading most redness almost immediately, all without drying your skin.</li>
            <li> my skin is looking better than ever!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> I really love using the mask for spot treatments and weekly masks, and this is an AMAZING price!</li>
            <li> I love this mask!</li>
            <li> Love this bundle and face mask!</li>
            <li> We love it!  </li>
            <li> The stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing...</li>
            <li> This mask is the absolute best I have ever used and believe me, I have tried them all.</li>
            <li> it is, of course, a sulfur acne treatment, but it would be nice if they could improve the smell...</li>
            <li> Effective in getting breakouts under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great item to clean pores and reduce break outs.</li>
            <li> Excellent products and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This was a great deal for 5 full sized refining masks.</li>
            <li> Best proactiv product, people seriously need to try to believe, great deal too!</li>
            <li> I have found great success using it as a spot treatment rather than as a mask.</li>
            <li> Its proactives best product just throw it on at night and wake up with a clear face</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the proactiv mask, (proactiv itself doesn&#x27;t really do much justice to my skin, jsut doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me) but the refining mask is AMAZING!!</li>
            <li> Have been using for for many years (and my son as well)..works great and quickly zaps those break outs.</li>
            <li> Great alternative to overall great skin product when on a budget</li>
            <li> I suppose they were too good to be true</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> This sulfur mask works magic.  </li>
            <li> The mask is our favorite.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> This process has worked for me and during my more \\&quot;time of the month\\&quot; episodes</li>
            <li> i used to be stuck on the proactiv schedule, but then i realized i could buy them separately, and it&#x27;s a much better deal.  </li>
            <li> and it made me break out in more pimples</li>
            <li> The cost for the tubes was fantastic!</li>
            <li> and I am a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I have used the mask before and love it, but now worried I should&#x27;ve passed this deal and got the medication I knew was reliable.</li>
            <li> I love this product but never got it in the mail.</li>
            <li> Bonus - 2.5 oz bottles meet airline guidelines :)</li>
            <li> I love the product.  </li>
            <li> Taking a shower gets rid of it better than just rinsing your face off in the sink.</li>
            <li> All things considered, I still use it and love it, and have recommended it to others.</li>
            <li> I have use Proactive on and off for over 15 years now, and I still love it.</li>
            <li> The mask is the best part of the entire Proactive line, if you ask me!</li>
            <li> I love this sulfur mask, and with this order, I got a lot for the price.</li>
            <li> :)))</li>
            <li> The swelling on her pimples is better after leaving this product on her face overnight.</li>
            <li> I have been in love with this mask since they started selling it at Proactiv.</li>
            <li> so I am sure they will be used by then.  </li>
            <li> After I use the mask I can see a more even skin tone and reduced redness.  </li>
            <li> I really love this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so great, and now, it&#x27;s so affordable to buy on Amazon separately from the whole Proactiv set.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i love this face mask.</li>
            <li> I love this product from Proactive.</li>
            <li> This product is great in clearing skin and making your skin healthy and clear.</li>
            <li> I love how quick to absorb it is!  </li>
            <li> However, I was very impressed when I received these in pristine condition, with the original seals in place and an expiration date over a year in the future!</li>
            <li> and I am glad it is available in bulk.</li>
            <li> I thought it was cheap and a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, the Refining Mask has always worked great at shrinking or even eliminating any acne overnight!</li>
            <li> so I tend to break out easily</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not too strong and doesn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li> I think the mask is the newer version where it&#x27;s supposed to be not as strong on your skin.</li>
            <li> My Fiance&#x27; decided to try it because he too works in a kitchen &amp; has frequent break outs &amp; he too has amazing results!</li>
            <li> However, just make sure you get the full number of items you ordered.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect home facial and really gets rid of those blackheads!  </li>
            <li> I got huge cystic acne and a lot of scarring.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed a huge difference with my pores but it has helped with hyperpigmentation.  </li>
            <li> I had a free sample from proactive</li>
            <li> The Amazon price was fantastic.  </li>
            <li> For sure it&#x27;s worth it ....</li>
            <li> I keep this product readily available and have to hide it from my granddaughter when she visits.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s ridiculously cheap for Proactive products.</li>
            <li> the price was great and the set of 5 will last all year.</li>
            <li> I just like two seconds ago ordered this item while I&#x27;m fighting (and starting to win)</li>
            <li> so glad I can just get this and not the whole set and having to buy it every month so thanks AMAZON!!!!</li>
            <li> Very useful.</li>
            <li> I use this product after I shave &amp; it makes my skin feel so smooth, clean &amp; refreshed.</li>
            <li> The main reason I got it is to shrink pores, but it is advertised as a spot treatment also and it would have been nice.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone i love it &amp; will without a doubt be back to buy more :)</li>
            <li> but i love the mask, it really has reduced the size of my pores!  </li>
            <li> I seemed to prefer the original but this will do.</li>
            <li> I have used Proactiv products before so I was familiar with the refining mask.  </li>
            <li> Blemishes disappear (or at the least greatly improve) overnight with this amazing mask.</li>
            <li> just got it to use and clean my face sometimes.....</li>
            <li> A mask makes your face clean, so so quality</li>
            <li> This is about all I use regularly to clean my face, often leaving it on overnight.</li>
            <li> This controls it right away!  </li>
            <li> This is great for me because at night my skin gets very oily and this not only prevents that but also leaves my skin smooth and diminishes the acne while i sleep.</li>
            <li> It contains a sulfur and while applying and wearing it is no problem, no bad smell.</li>
            <li> The reaction between the sulfur and the salicylic acid in the toner (also a Proactiv product) is pretty strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different kind of masks, and they all leave my face soft to some extent, but this mask is the best I&#x27;ve ever come across yet for shrinking blemishes, clearing up skin, and leaving it</li>
            <li> but so glad I was able to order it elsewhere and not have to pay extra to order through proactive.  </li>
            <li> Product as described, quick shipment.</li>
            <li> quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since had better luck by switching to Clearogen, mainly for the face wash and night treatments, and using drugstore brands for non-comedogenic moisturizers with spf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The new formulation just makes it better.  </li>
            <li> Good but leaves my face dry.</li>
            <li> After your face is clear, maintenance is crucial to maintain a beautiful skin.  </li>
            <li> 5 bottles quick shipment and not expired... worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Use this at least once a week as a mask, and use it whenever needed as a spot treatment, and the effect is pretty impressive.</li>
            <li> This stuff did wonders for my son, it cleared his face really well!!</li>
            <li> I received this product about a week and a half early which I loved because I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it!!</li>
            <li> After two treatments my skin is virtually free of blemishes and my large pores noticeably diminished.  </li>
            <li> The prompt delivery helps me enjoy my product that much faster.</li>
            <li> but I figured it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every mask on the market and the Proactiv Refining Mask is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> the price is definitely worth it</li>
            <li> i would suggest this mask, especially for such a good price!</li>
            <li> They work great especially when you need extra help with acne.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only Proactiv product that actually works, but it works great.</li>
            <li> I have been using Proactive for sometime, and was happy to find the refining mask at such a low price.</li>
            <li> but mainly I use it as a spot treatment before I go to bed to reduce redness and size of a pimple, and boy does it work well!!</li>
            <li> The only catch is that it doesn&#x27;t smell very good, as it has sulfur as it&#x27;s active ingredient.</li>
            <li> but first I wash my face</li>
            <li> I also will use it on acne and then put make-up on after the mask is on first which helps stop acne from worsening if needed...</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> First of all, I got five of these for 18 bucks.</li>
            <li> I just finished wiping this off my face for the first time</li>
            <li> I have used Nutrogena, Merle Norman, Clinique, St. Ives,  and so on.&lt;br /&gt;Results with Proactive&#x27;s refining mask can be seen 12 hours after the first application.  </li>
            <li> Where was this in the 70&#x27;s when I really needed it!?  </li>
            <li> Worked at first but skin must have gotten used to it.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want 5 bottles at first try one and see how it works for you.  </li>
            <li> Doesnt take much product to use and this bulk purchase was worth it.</li>
            <li> This product really takes care of pimples overnight and with the right use it takes care of the marks as well.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t work nearly as well as the original purchased from Proactiv.</li>
            <li> I fell in love instantly and brought the whole package for myself.</li>
            <li> It is very tempting to over use this product especially if your blemishes have been overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> I complete a full mask every week and treat my nose and chin once or twice during the week, as well.</li>
            <li> Leads me again to believe that they push their benzo products more because they&#x27;ve patented them while other products that work better don&#x27;t rake in the same $.</li>
            <li> and I can already see a difference in my nose, which has always had large pores.</li>
            <li> I found myself using mostly the renewing cleanser and this refining mask (as per my skin, using all of the steps would dry it out too much)</li>
            <li> You need only a small amount of it to cover the whole face, it has a fine texture and it works at is best with the other Proactiv products.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell you how much this stuff works...</li>
            <li> then I put on a cheap generic lotion with salasylic acid (forgive an spelling errors on that)</li>
            <li> I suffered with adult-onset acne for years and tried the whole Proactive line but didn&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
            <li> The price for this set of 5 is really reasonable and the product is mint.  </li>
            <li> When I used proactiv before nothing really worked except the mask.</li>
            <li> I had used Proactive Mask years ago and was wondering if I could get just the mask without having to get the whole package</li>
            <li> I like buying them in bulk, because it is much cheaper that way.</li>
            <li> and when i saw this deal..i could not pass it by...excellent purchase and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t do much anymore</li>
            <li> THe product works really well for me.  </li>
            <li> This product seems to work ok for me so far but have only used it for about a week now.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a lot more affordable than other masks.</li>
            <li> When I was getting married I wanted to have clear skin.</li>
            <li> Product is older version but still works and came sealed and unopened.  </li>
            <li> However, the seller quickly issued a refund for one fifth of the overall purchase price of the set.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product from this particular site because you said &#x27;SET OF 5&#x27; which in means there should have been 5 bottles.</li>
            <li> However, I missed this particular step from the Proactive system.</li>
            <li> Of course you&#x27;ll maximize it&#x27;s effects if you use a kit but even without one you still get decent results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price was good, but this product has never really worked for me other than to help bring pimples forming to the surface on occasion.</li>
            <li> The Proactiv Solution Refining Mask has worked very well as an overnight treatment to clear up my daughter&#x27;s skin and as a cleanser.</li>
            <li> Buying it on Amazon is much easier than trying to get it direct from the company.</li>
            <li> I am not crazy about the smell, but I don&#x27;t feel like that justifies deducting an entire star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> And buying it in the pack of five is such a great deal, it&#x27;s hard NOT to get this!</li>
            <li> Cant live without it tho.</li>
            <li> All products we&#x27;re brand  new and as promised .</li>
            <li> I mostly use the multiple bottles I have left (seriously this stuff seems to stem from some magical well of infinity) for covering up my face around the house when I don&#x27;t want to be reminded of what might plague my skin that day.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t dry out your skin and leaves it feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li> I love what this sulfur mask does for my skin, but I do not love the prices proactiv charges.</li>
            <li> To see the dramatic results in such a short  period of time tempts one to think more is better.</li>
            <li> and I still have half of the treatment left as I haven&#x27;t needed any more of it since.</li>
            <li> It will eventually help clear up your skin in about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I started using proactiv about a year ago, i have struggled with acne since i was young</li>
            <li> Bulk is better, for me at least.</li>
            <li> it baby soft.</li>
            <li> This was the only place I could buy this product seperate from buying the whole</li>
            <li> The overall result was pretty good, though, but it smelled bad and the container doesn&#x27;t hold much.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend all of their products, but especially this one.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it as it took only a month to cure my acne</li>
            <li> It is normal, as all the products are still deep in the skin.</li>
            <li> and my skin is back to normal.  </li>
            <li> It lasts much, much longer and this way my skin does not get overly dry.</li>
            <li> The expiration date is about a year and a half away, so this company seems trustworthy for providing a fresh product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They just keep shrinking as you use it each night until gone.&lt;br /&gt;Has a slight sulfur smell after applying, but is tolerable and well worth the results.</li>
            <li> Just put it over night, and you have a clear skin the next morning</li>
            <li> My sons wanted this to help clear up their occasional blemishes.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my sister since ProActiv apparently does not work well on my skin.</li>
            <li> I starting using this product I had dark spots and bumps all over my face, after two weeks i notice no more bumps my face is nice and smooth, I will order the spot remover to get the dark spots out my face but no more BUMPS.</li>
            <li> Beats DDF, Ole Henriksen, Origins, Clinique and every other high end skincare line on the market, plus</li>
            <li> It can certainly be a little drying, so be careful of not over-doing it in the beginning, but this stuff is super helpful.</li>
            <li> It really helps your acne go down the next day.</li>
            <li> As long as you follow instructions, use it regularly your acne will dissappear.  </li>
            <li> and now i have 5, which will last me for a very long time.</li>
            <li> My nephew used it when he had adolescent acne, and his acne also cleared up in less than a month and has stayed clear since.</li>
            <li> This stuff started working immediately,  and completely cleared my face up within a week and a half.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin or irritate it at all so that is a big plus.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But anyway, I left Proactiv, but could not live without Proactiv Solution Refining Mask.</li>
            <li> I bought these long time ago, and my daughters use these overnight.</li>
            <li> This lasted a long time and was usefel in getting rid of an acne problem.</li>
            <li> Now I only need a spot treatment once in a while when I&#x27;m under extreme stress, and that is when I use the Refining Mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you over use this product you will dry out your skin.  </li>
            <li> and i feel like it&#x27;s cleaning my skin deep down.  </li>
            <li> The 5 pack will definitely last me forever too since a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and if I use the lotion as stated my face doesn&#x27;t dry out!</li>
            <li> (don&#x27;t put it on the whole face or where it is unnecessary, it dryes skin out).</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s to be expected with any sulfur product.</li>
            <li> The only negative I can say is that it smells like a mix of clay when it&#x27;s dry and sulfur when it&#x27;s wet...</li>
            <li> so i use this face mask about every other day &amp;</li>
            <li> Also, becareful when using other products with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want the other products</li>
            <li> A niece in her 30&#x27;s recommended this product to me and I recommended it to my other teenager niece.  </li>
            <li> I suppose that it works as well as any other brand from her viewpoint.</li>
            <li> Leads me to wonder if sulfur masks are much less expensive to produce, are not patented to any company, and have lower profit, therefore are not pushed as much.  </li>
            <li> It was my fault because I selected a previous address of mine.</li>
            <li> Can be a little drying</li>
            <li> CLEARS THE SKIN WITH LITTLE EFFORT FROM YOU.</li>
            <li> with any sulfur mask, it&#x27;s a little stinky -</li>
            <li> I use it everyday now.</li>
            <li> Oh well, it works well and sulfur is the &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; ingredient that really cleared my skin, especially some nasty back acne.</li>
            <li> I spot treat the occasional pimple that I may get (1-2 a year) by leaving a thin covering on overnight.</li>
            <li> I paid $30 for 1 bottle when I could have bought 1 bottle for less than $10!</li>
            <li> The mask also helps me prevent breakouts, and if I do breakout slightly I put a small dab of the mask on overnight for a spot treatment that works wonders.  </li>
            <li> I use the Clarifying Night Cream from Proactiv, as I usually put on the mask in the evening.</li>
            <li> Unhappy because when I got the package the dates were old (2003).  </li>
            <li> I guess the rest of this year and then some to the people out there who are not sure it works</li>
            <li> It will be hard to use them all by then.</li>
            <li> But at least we have it now.  </li>
            <li> Maybe my skin is just crazy out of control oily (it is, actually), but if I am breaking out, I will put this stuff on and leave it on overnight.  </li>
            <li> Helps close pores after a long dirty day at work.</li>
            <li> therefore it was very thick going on and felt filmy and was hard to get off my face.</li>
            <li> The cream takes away also the bad smell from the sulfur but do not worry if in the morning, after using the toner again, the smell comes back.</li>
            <li> I use it as a spot treatment or a really thin mask all over.</li>
            <li> Seriously, just try this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not impressed with the benzo peroxide based products even from proactiv.  </li>
            <li> Quite expensive.</li>
            <li> Breakouts came back, nasty!  </li>
            <li> : I took away a star because it&#x27;s lousy as a spot treatment.</li>
            <li> The bad smell appears at the skin level after removing it and applying the toner.</li>
            <li> But the bad smell goes away in a couple of seconds.</li>
            <li> I like this product even though it quite stinks!  </li>
            <li> I hate it my face smells like matches even after i wash off.</li>
            <li> Annoying.</li>
            <li> Then I dab on the proactive mask and rub on over the areas with the worst acne.</li>
            <li> the smell is horrible</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This mask is the absolute best I have ever used and believe me, I have tried them all. Same goes for their toner. Excellent products and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The stuff is amazing. I&#x27;ve been using this for some time now an it work great. Cheaper to buy from amazon than to buy from Proactiv.</li>
            <li> Just what it was supposed to be.  The expiration date was over a year away.</li>
            <li> This product is great in clearing skin and making your skin healthy and clear. The prompt delivery helps me enjoy my product that much faster. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Got all 5 and will use them cuz this stuff works so glad I can just get this and not the whole set and having to buy it every month so thanks AMAZON!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought these long time ago, and my daughters use these overnight. They work great especially when you need extra help with acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all of proactiv&#x27;s products.  I love this product.  I&#x27;m really not impressed with the benzo peroxide based products even from proactiv.  This sulfur mask works magic.  Leads me to wonder if sulfur masks are much less expensive to produce, are not patented to any company, and have lower profit, therefore are not pushed as much.  This works immediately while benzo peroxide irritates, bleaches your clothes, and takes longer.  I&#x27;ve used this for several years and acne has never been the same ever since.  This controls it right away!  Another good cleanser from proactiv is the one with menthol and salicilates.  Leads me again to believe that they push their benzo products more because they&#x27;ve patented them while other products that work better don&#x27;t rake in the same $.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my teenage son and he&#x27;s been using it a week his face is definetely clearing up cant wait to see what 30 days will do!</li>
            <li> Blemishes disappear (or at the least greatly improve) overnight with this amazing mask. Can be a little drying so it&#x27;s best to use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> I thought acne was over for me. In my 40s, I am struggling with it again. My daughter (age 13) and I are both Proactiv users. The mask is our favorite. It works especially well on blackheads. I highly recommend all of their products, but especially this one.</li>
            <li> This stuff started working immediately,  and completely cleared my face up within a week and a half.</li>
            <li> Love this. It&#x27;s the only Proactiv product that actually works, but it works great.</li>
            <li> I received this product about a week and a half early which I loved because I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it!! I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now &amp; I can definitely see a difference. I work in a kitchen around a lot of grease so I tend to break out easily so i use this face mask about every other day &amp; my skin is looking better than ever! My Fiance&#x27; decided to try it because he too works in a kitchen &amp; has frequent break outs &amp; he too has amazing results! I would recommend this to anyone i love it &amp; will without a doubt be back to buy more :)</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell you how much this stuff works...you have to try it for yourself to believe it. I bought a set of 5 so I could give one to each of my younger cousins who are now in the age of dealing with acne. I can&#x27;t wait to have them try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it one or two times a day Morning and Night but first I wash my face then I put on a cheap generic lotion with salasylic acid (forgive an spelling errors on that) Then I dab on the proactive mask and rub on over the areas with the worst acne. This process has worked for me and during my more \\&quot;time of the month\\&quot; episodes then I up it to twice a day and if I use the lotion as stated my face doesn&#x27;t dry out! I also will use it on acne and then put make-up on after the mask is on first which helps stop acne from worsening if needed...but I prefere to not wear foundation all the time.</li>
            <li> This mask is great for your skin.  I had a free sample from proactive but so glad I was able to order it elsewhere and not have to pay extra to order through proactive.  This mask dries out pimples overnight.  I use it everyday now.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific facial mask.  I received a sample with my Proactiv order and was very impressed with it.  The Amazon price was fantastic.  I massage olive oil on my face and let it sit for 15 minutes or so, then steam, scrub with a baking soda paste, and finish with this mask.  It&#x27;s the perfect home facial and really gets rid of those blackheads!  Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> i used to be stuck on the proactiv schedule, but then i realized i could buy them separately, and it&#x27;s a much better deal.  i&#x27;ve stopped using the face wash, because i think using a scrub with a 2% salicylic acid solution works just as well.  but i love the mask, it really has reduced the size of my pores!  and i feel like it&#x27;s cleaning my skin deep down.  i would suggest this mask, especially for such a good price!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s the best I have ever tried. It tightens pores and bleaches blemishes. And it works great in emergencies. Just put it over night, and you have a clear skin the next morning (don&#x27;t put it on the whole face or where it is unnecessary, it dryes skin out).</li>
            <li> I hate it my face smells like matches even after i wash off. It makes my eyes burn and tear and it made me break out in more pimples</li>
            <li> I suffered with adult-onset acne for years and tried the whole Proactive line but didn&#x27;t see much of a difference. On the other hand, the Refining Mask has always worked great at shrinking or even eliminating any acne overnight! I have found great success using it as a spot treatment rather than as a mask. It lasts much, much longer and this way my skin does not get overly dry. I bought my Proactiv Solution Refining Mask in a set of five at 2.5 oz. each from Beauty N Stuff. The expiration date is about a year and a half away, so this company seems trustworthy for providing a fresh product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I no longer suffer with adult-onset acne because of a homeopathic remedy called &amp;#34;Nature&#x27;s Cure&amp;#34;. There is one formula for females and another one for males. I highly recommend it as it took only a month to cure my acne and I still have half of the treatment left as I haven&#x27;t needed any more of it since. My nephew used it when he had adolescent acne, and his acne also cleared up in less than a month and has stayed clear since. Now I only need a spot treatment once in a while when I&#x27;m under extreme stress, and that is when I use the Refining Mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review will be helpful to others!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing... it&#x27;s works well.  as a bounce I have skin tags on my neck where I have been using this cream the skin tag have begain to fall out..Love it stuff!!!</li>
            <li> I started using proactiv about a year ago, i have struggled with acne since i was young (i got my fathers oily skin) Anyhow my boyfriends sister was using it at the time and gave me her tiny refining mask to try. I fell in love instantly and brought the whole package for myself. Quite expensive. I found myself using mostly the renewing cleanser and this refining mask (as per my skin, using all of the steps would dry it out too much) So i would go to the mall and buy these 2 steps that i would use, and it would come out to $50. I was over joyed to find this deal because i use this nightly. This is great for me because at night my skin gets very oily and this not only prevents that but also leaves my skin smooth and diminishes the acne while i sleep. I swear by this product and now i have 5, which will last me for a very long time. Once those run out, i will be ordering from here again!</li>
            <li> Good but leaves my face dry. Good lotion is required. Cant live without it tho. Also, becareful when using other products with this stuff. Makes your face peel.</li>
            <li> My sons wanted this to help clear up their occasional blemishes. The price for this set of 5 is really reasonable and the product is mint.  We have been very happy.</li>
            <li> For sure it&#x27;s worth it .... Best deal ever ...I recommend this...I saved 50 dollars. Thank god I didn&#x27;t buy. It in the mall</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and got this mask.... It doesn&#x27;t work. I don&#x27;t have problematic skin ... just got it to use and clean my face sometimes..... So those people who were writing all this wonderful about wonderful mask seems like workers of the company who are trying to sell this product. It doesn&#x27;t work or do anything.. Annoying.</li>
            <li> The price was good, but this product has never really worked for me other than to help bring pimples forming to the surface on occasion. I mostly use the multiple bottles I have left (seriously this stuff seems to stem from some magical well of infinity) for covering up my face around the house when I don&#x27;t want to be reminded of what might plague my skin that day.</li>
            <li> For some reason in my 20&#x27;s my skin started acting haywire. I got huge cystic acne and a lot of scarring. When I was getting married I wanted to have clear skin. My dermatologist put me on antibiotics, but I wanted extra protection. When I used proactiv before nothing really worked except the mask. I decided to put the mask on my problem areas and slept in it over night 6 months before my wedding. It helped a lot. When my skin started breaking out again from pregnancy I decided to buy this mask again. I didn&#x27;t want the other products so I searched for just the mask. It definitly helps the skin a lot. If you have problem skin I would recommend dabbing this on and sleeping in it overnight. It really helps your acne go down the next day. It will eventually help clear up your skin in about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I like this product even though it quite stinks!  I have not noticed a huge difference with my pores but it has helped with hyperpigmentation.  The set of 5 is quite a lot but I gave one to a friend and I am still working on the others.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and it works great for me.  I apply it overnight whenever and wherever I need to use it and by morning the problem has been either eradicated or very definitely lessened as an issue.  The fact that I can get five for the price of what one costs makes this even more of a great purchase.  I keep this product readily available and have to hide it from my granddaughter when she visits.</li>
            <li> A mask makes your face clean, so so quality👎 the smell is horrible 👃👃💀💀</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t the best thing, and it took a while to work. The overall result was pretty good, though, but it smelled bad and the container doesn&#x27;t hold much.</li>
            <li> Yes, it smells like sulfur.  Oh well, it works well and sulfur is the &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; ingredient that really cleared my skin, especially some nasty back acne.</li>
            <li> I used to use the entire Proactiv set, but it ruined my skin so I switched. I really love using the mask for spot treatments and weekly masks, and this is an AMAZING price! The bottles are 2.5 times larger than the trial size that comes with the face wash, and the expiry on my set is Oct 2016. If you use the mask, you have to buy this!</li>
            <li> great deal on a great product</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase the 5 pack because it was cheaper per item and I go thru a bottle in 1-2 months. I love this mask! Way cheaper than buying it thru Proactiv.</li>
            <li> Very useful. Targets problem areas....</li>
            <li> This product is great! It actually does work and if you haven&#x27;t yet tried it, I recommend it. Plus, its a bargain. I paid $15 and some change total.</li>
            <li> The Proactiv Solution Refining Mask has worked very well as an overnight treatment to clear up my daughter&#x27;s skin and as a cleanser. The price is good when buying in bulk. The only negative I can say is that it smells like a mix of clay when it&#x27;s dry and sulfur when it&#x27;s wet...it is, of course, a sulfur acne treatment, but it would be nice if they could improve the smell...it would be a 5-star then...</li>
            <li> I love what this sulfur mask does for my skin, but I do not love the prices proactiv charges. This is a great deal.  If you have not used this before, expect the sulfur smell. My husband hates it but it&#x27;s not too strong and doesn&#x27;t bother me.  I like to use it in the morning to absorb some of the oils on my face prior to makeup and such. Leave it on a pimple over night, it doesn&#x27;t miraculously disappear, but it does reduce inflammation time and overall healing time. Some reviews claim expired bottles, mine were not. However, I purchase these in October of 2012, the expiration is Dec 2013. It will be hard to use them all by then. I think we are getting a good deal because these products are getting close to their expiration date. That doesn&#x27;t bother me, expiration dates aren&#x27;t always in stone.</li>
            <li> I had used Proactive Mask years ago and was wondering if I could get just the mask without having to get the whole package so I looked on Amazon. I found this deal and decided to get it. It arrived on the day it was supposed to and there were 5 tubes. The tubes were a lot bigger than the one I had gotten from the company. I think the mask is the newer version where it&#x27;s supposed to be not as strong on your skin. I seemed to prefer the original but this will do. The cost for the tubes was fantastic! All in all I like it and I am a satisfied customer. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Great item to clean pores and reduce break outs.</li>
            <li> Best proactiv product, people seriously need to try to believe, great deal too!</li>
            <li> I received all 5 refining Masks and I like buying them in bulk, because it is much cheaper that way. The mask does wonders for my face!</li>
            <li> I suppose they were too good to be true but I figured it was worth a try. They don&#x27;t work nearly as well as the original purchased from Proactiv.</li>
            <li> Product as described, quick shipment.</li>
            <li> Seller was great and product was great.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Love this bundle and face mask! GREAT DEAL</li>
            <li> This mask is perfect for an skin with acne. You need only a small amount of it to cover the whole face, it has a fine texture and it works at is best with the other Proactiv products. The only &amp;#34;not so nice&amp;#34; thing about it is the smell. It contains a sulfur and while applying and wearing it is no problem, no bad smell. The bad smell appears at the skin level after removing it and applying the toner.The reaction between the sulfur and the salicylic acid in the toner (also a Proactiv product) is pretty strong. But the bad smell goes away in a couple of seconds. Of course, after removing the mask and using the toner, you have to apply a moisturizer. I use the Clarifying Night Cream from Proactiv, as I usually put on the mask in the evening. The cream takes away also the bad smell from the sulfur but do not worry if in the morning, after using the toner again, the smell comes back.It is normal, as all the products are still deep in the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big can of proactive but this stuff is great. Won&#x27;t dry out your skin and leaves it feeling soft and clean. Helps close pores after a long dirty day at work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne since a teenager.. I&#x27;m almost 50.  I&#x27;ve tried everything... The only product that has worked for me is the Proactiv system... The Refining Mask is the best!  As long as you follow instructions, use it regularly your acne will dissappear.  After your face is clear, maintenance is crucial to maintain a beautiful skin.  I&#x27;ve used it for over 5 years now. I stopped because I thought that at my age I wouldn&#x27;t need it anymore. Breakouts came back, nasty!  Back to the system and my skin is back to normal.  Can&#x27;t be without it.  A niece in her 30&#x27;s recommended this product to me and I recommended it to my other teenager niece.  We love it!  Amazon is the greatest supplier, great customer service, great products and great prices.. Great combination:  Proactiv and Amazon!!</li>
            <li> I use this product a lot and I am glad it is available in bulk. Bulk is better, for me at least. I would rather buy a bunch and not have to worry about if I&#x27;m running out or not.</li>
            <li> I tried to look for expiration date before I ordered-because of the great price... Unhappy because when I got the package the dates were old (2003).  I have used the mask before and love it, but now worried I should&#x27;ve passed this deal and got the medication I knew was reliable.</li>
            <li> First of all, I got five of these for 18 bucks. That&#x27;s ridiculously cheap for Proactive products. I just finished wiping this off my face for the first time and I can already see a difference in my nose, which has always had large pores. I didn&#x27;t experience any burning whatsoever. I read an earlier review that said the ones he/she received were expired. Mine don&#x27;t expire for about a year a five months, so that&#x27;s a relief. I am not crazy about the smell, but I don&#x27;t feel like that justifies deducting an entire star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I took away a star because it&#x27;s lousy as a spot treatment. The main reason I got it is to shrink pores, but it is advertised as a spot treatment also and it would have been nice.</li>
            <li> Product is older version but still works and came sealed and unopened.  Great alternative to overall great skin product when on a budget</li>
            <li> great product, great price</li>
            <li> 5 bottles quick shipment and not expired... worth the purchase. Its proactives best product just throw it on at night and wake up with a clear face</li>
            <li> I love this product but never got it in the mail. It was my fault because I selected a previous address of mine. I would recommend the Refining Mask to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> this product is a skin life saver. its the only thing i use and recommend from proactiv brand or products.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product by Proactive.  I have used Nutrogena, Merle Norman, Clinique, St. Ives,  and so on.&lt;br /&gt;Results with Proactive&#x27;s refining mask can be seen 12 hours after the first application.  it can be used as a mask and topical spot treatment.  After two treatments my skin is virtually free of blemishes and my large pores noticeably diminished.  My teenage sons are not too manly to reap the benefits of this mask, though they hide out in the bathroom while the mask does it job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you over use this product you will dry out your skin.  It is very tempting to over use this product especially if your blemishes have been overwhelming.  To see the dramatic results in such a short  period of time tempts one to think more is better.</li>
            <li> Where was this in the 70&#x27;s when I really needed it!?  But at least we have it now.  Bonus - 2.5 oz bottles meet airline guidelines :)</li>
            <li> we have used this product for over 10 years now..and when i saw this deal..i could not pass it by...excellent purchase and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the proactiv mask, (proactiv itself doesn&#x27;t really do much justice to my skin, jsut doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me) but the refining mask is AMAZING!! I use it as a mask sometimes but mainly I use it as a spot treatment before I go to bed to reduce redness and size of a pimple, and boy does it work well!!</li>
            <li> This product seems to work ok for me so far but have only used it for about a week now.  Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin or irritate it at all so that is a big plus.</li>
            <li> This product really takes care of pimples overnight and with the right use it takes care of the marks as well. I really like it.</li>
            <li> Worked at first but skin must have gotten used to it. doesn&#x27;t do much anymore</li>
            <li> Have been using for for many years (and my son as well)..works great and quickly zaps those break outs. apply at bedtime for best result on blemishes. Excellent value.</li>
            <li> CLEARS THE SKIN WITH LITTLE EFFORT FROM YOU. i WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY. ITS A GREAT QUALTY!</li>
            <li> This is the only proactiv product that I actually like.</li>
            <li> This is about all I use regularly to clean my face, often leaving it on overnight. Buying it on Amazon is much easier than trying to get it direct from the company.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for two weeks and I can see my scars and acne dissapearing. Before you try any product, try this and you will like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every mask on the market and the Proactiv Refining Mask is by far my favorite. Beats DDF, Ole Henriksen, Origins, Clinique and every other high end skincare line on the market, plus it&#x27;s a lot more affordable than other masks. I use it as a spot treatment or a really thin mask all over. Use it on my face, neck, chest, back, and it works wonders. The 5 pack will definitely last me forever too since a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Arrived promptly. Products had a 12/16 exp. date, which I love!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love the product.  I have used this for over ten years, and it works.  The new formulation just makes it better.  However, just make sure you get the full number of items you ordered.  I ordered a set of five, but only received four.  However, the seller quickly issued a refund for one fifth of the overall purchase price of the set.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different kind of masks, and they all leave my face soft to some extent, but this mask is the best I&#x27;ve ever come across yet for shrinking blemishes, clearing up skin, and leaving it it baby soft. The only catch is that it doesn&#x27;t smell very good, as it has sulfur as it&#x27;s active ingredient. The smell lingers after the mask is washed off. Taking a shower gets rid of it better than just rinsing your face off in the sink. All things considered, I still use it and love it, and have recommended it to others.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product from this particular site because you said &#x27;SET OF 5&#x27; which in means there should have been 5 bottles. I received the package today and there was only 1! I paid $30 for 1 bottle when I could have bought 1 bottle for less than $10!</li>
            <li> I have use Proactive on and off for over 15 years now, and I still love it. This mask does a great job of shrinking your pores, evening out skintone and fading most redness almost immediately, all without drying your skin. I recommend it to anyone, not just those with acne. The mask is the best part of the entire Proactive line, if you ask me!</li>
            <li> I love this sulfur mask, and with this order, I got a lot for the price. Effective in getting breakouts under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with any sulfur mask, it&#x27;s a little stinky - that&#x27;s to be expected with any sulfur product.</li>
            <li> Lightweight product. It feels great on my face. I love how quick to absorb it is!  I will keep buying this product!</li>
            <li> thank you for the great product. the price was great and the set of 5 will last all year. quick delivery. All products we&#x27;re brand  new and as promised . I look forward to future orders.</li>
            <li> Maybe my skin is just crazy out of control oily (it is, actually), but if I am breaking out, I will put this stuff on and leave it on overnight.  And in the morning, you can see a difference.  And buying it in the pack of five is such a great deal, it&#x27;s hard NOT to get this!</li>
            <li> I used to use the Proactive system but have since switched to Clinque Acne Solutions. However, I missed this particular step from the Proactive system. I like to have a mask type product to use on occasion to help with breakouts. This was the only place I could buy this product seperate from buying the whole system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned with the amount and price of these that there would be a catch (expired product, etc...) *However, I was very impressed when I received these in pristine condition, with the original seals in place and an expiration date over a year in the future! :))) Very very pleased with this product!!</li>
            <li> I thought it was cheap and a pretty good deal. I gave it to my sister since ProActiv apparently does not work well on my skin. She uses it every night and said that it works well on her. The swelling on her pimples is better after leaving this product on her face overnight.</li>
            <li> This was a great deal for 5 full sized refining masks. This has always been one of my favorite products, but since I don&#x27;t use the rest of the proactiv line it can be difficult to find. Will definitely be reordering when I run out!</li>
            <li> This stuff works. I use it as an overnight blemish treatment. It draws the &amp;#34;yuck&amp;#34; out. Even in the &amp;#34;under the skin&amp;#34; bumps. They just keep shrinking as you use it each night until gone.&lt;br /&gt;Has a slight sulfur smell after applying, but is tolerable and well worth the results.</li>
            <li> I just like two seconds ago ordered this item while I&#x27;m fighting (and starting to win) my acme situation I find that this mask helps to string my pores and pimples drastically I&#x27;ve had a refining mask tub since back in 2010 (i dont use them often)and I&#x27;m almost out but this order set should last me ... I guess the rest of this year and then some to the people out there who are not sure it works I will say this it worked for me and had been working no this is not the only mask I use either but I find this mask just strinks pores like almost instantly (well if left on for a couple hours to a night) but good product would recommend to anyone...</li>
            <li> I have been in love with this mask since they started selling it at Proactiv. Works wonders on my skin.</li>
            <li> I was happy with this purchase. I have been using Proactive for sometime, and was happy to find the refining mask at such a low price.</li>
            <li> I have used Proactiv products before so I was familiar with the refining mask.  The ones that I recieved are all good and won&#x27;t expire until 14 months from now so I am sure they will be used by then.  THe product works really well for me.  After I use the mask I can see a more even skin tone and reduced redness.  The mask also helps me prevent breakouts, and if I do breakout slightly I put a small dab of the mask on overnight for a spot treatment that works wonders.  I really love this product.  If you haven&#x27;t tried this before I would suggest trying.  If you don&#x27;t want 5 bottles at first try one and see how it works for you.  The pack of 5 is a great deal given the price that Proactiv charges.</li>
            <li> My daughter is using it and she gave this rating.  I suppose that it works as well as any other brand from her viewpoint.</li>
            <li> great product always use it works amazing and will keep resupplying when i run out. works best when used before bed</li>
            <li> The product arrived expired...therefore it was very thick going on and felt filmy and was hard to get off my face.</li>
            <li> I starting using this product I had dark spots and bumps all over my face, after two weeks i notice no more bumps my face is nice and smooth, I will order the spot remover to get the dark spots out my face but no more BUMPS.</li>
            <li> I should start by saying I have had horrendous acne my entire life, and it&#x27;s such a bummer. I&#x27;ve tried everything, including Proactiv, and it just wasn&#x27;t enough to stay with, considering the expense and extensive routine and just how damaging the stuff all way in drying out skin and bleaching towels and pillowcases. I&#x27;ve since had better luck by switching to Clearogen, mainly for the face wash and night treatments, and using drugstore brands for non-comedogenic moisturizers with spf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But anyway, I left Proactiv, but could not live without Proactiv Solution Refining Mask. It&#x27;s so great, and now, it&#x27;s so affordable to buy on Amazon separately from the whole Proactiv set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use this at least once a week as a mask, and use it whenever needed as a spot treatment, and the effect is pretty impressive. It can certainly be a little drying, so be careful of not over-doing it in the beginning, but this stuff is super helpful. Seriously, just try this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Proactive system since 2001 with good result. I complete a full mask every week and treat my nose and chin once or twice during the week, as well. I spot treat the occasional pimple that I may get (1-2 a year) by leaving a thin covering on overnight.</li>
            <li> i love this face mask. For the price an the amount of product that a received this was a steal.</li>
            <li> Gift for a friend. This lasted a long time and was usefel in getting rid of an acne problem. Doesnt take much product to use and this bulk purchase was worth it.</li>
            <li> This was the best deal that I ever saw on Amazon for the refining mask by Proactiv so I couldn&#x27;t say no. I use this product after I shave &amp; it makes my skin feel so smooth, clean &amp; refreshed. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Great product for a great deal. I love this product from Proactive. IN fact this is the only product that I like by them. I guess this is the only product that works for me.</li>
            <li> Of course you&#x27;ll maximize it&#x27;s effects if you use a kit but even without one you still get decent results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price is definitely worth it and you start to see results over a week.</li>
            <li> This stuff did wonders for my son, it cleared his face really well!! I would recommend it to anyone with severe acne</li>
