            <li>/&gt;It holds easily and naturally without being sticky or cakey and it washes out easily as well.&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li>I just need more hold than this offers.</li>
            <li>The price was fair and the product was as expected.</li>
            <li>Good quality, just as I expected.</li>
            <li>Not sticky and just the right amount of hold.  </li>
            <li>usually use something else, but this was great.</li>
            <li>I have used this product in the past and I love it!!  </li>
            <li>This spray held the style in my wig pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>Better than using regular hair spray on synthetic wigs.</li>
            <li>Product description says it is to for synthetic wigs, but it certainly does not hold well.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>As a result, it doesn&#x27;t hold the hair in place very well.</li>
            <li>This spray held up really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It acts much more like &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; hairspray and gives a finer, dryer mist than the very wet pump style wig sprays I&#x27;ve had before.</li>
            <li>Though I bought the first can from them, subsequent cans were purchased from this sight at a much lower price.  </li>
            <li>I wish it dried a little bit quicker and didn&#x27;t feel so sticky, but for a wig spray it is pretty good.</li>
            <li>I bought this wig spray because I had just purchased a new wig and it came with the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It is clear, does not gunk up the hair fibers and looks natural.  </li>
            <li>It looks light weight and just a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only wig spray that I&#x27;ve found that leaves the hair feeling natural.</li>
            <li>The product arrived sooner than expected, but it doesn&#x27;t produce much of a spray.  </li>
            <li>I shall be ordering again in the near future.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s really perfect for my piece. I can use it everyday and it doesn&#x27;t cause damage to the wig&#x27;s material. It looks light weight and just a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Not sticky and just the right amount of hold.  It&#x27;s the only wig spray that I&#x27;ve found that leaves the hair feeling natural.It&#x27;s the only brand that I use.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by the wig shop from which I bought several wigs.  Though I bought the first can from them, subsequent cans were purchased from this sight at a much lower price.  It is clear, does not gunk up the hair fibers and looks natural.  It is a great hair spray for natural and synthetic wigs.</li>
            <li> Perfect, couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere in my area. Arrived in couple days of ordering. Very happy!!!</li>
            <li> It works as advertised. Few things seem to do that anymore.</li>
            <li> I love this Wig Spray. It can go on too heavy if you are too close, so stay back. I wish it dried a little bit quicker and didn&#x27;t feel so sticky, but for a wig spray it is pretty good. I just need more hold than this offers.</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Great product and meets all expectations.</li>
            <li> This was a difficult item to find in brick &amp; mortar. The price was fair and the product was as expected.</li>
            <li> Brandywine is the only product I use on my hairpieces or wigs.  The shampoo, conditioner and hair spray are all excellent.</li>
            <li> The hair spray was ordered for my mother and the delivery time and product was exceptional.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and I love it!!  Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else!  I&#x27;m delighted and thank you.</li>
            <li> This spray held the style in my wig pretty well.  The downside is that it was so drying that after just one use, my synthetic hair started to break off.  I wear wigs for medical reasons, so I can&#x27;t afford to ruin them like this.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect spray I&#x27;ve been wanting! It acts much more like &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; hairspray and gives a finer, dryer mist than the very wet pump style wig sprays I&#x27;ve had before. This spray looks better and is easier to control and holds well. I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
            <li> Brandywine Aerosol Wig Spray works as a good maximum hold spray on my wig. I will reorder it when I run out.</li>
            <li> This is fragrance free and holds well.  Aerosole wig sprays are difficult to find.</li>
            <li> The product arrived sooner than expected, but it doesn&#x27;t produce much of a spray.  As a result, it doesn&#x27;t hold the hair in place very well.</li>
            <li> This truly is the only holding spray that has ever worked for me on synthetic hair.&lt;br /&gt;It holds easily and naturally without being sticky or cakey and it washes out easily as well.&lt;br /&gt;Plus I love the smell.</li>
            <li> Product came very quickly.  Used on a synthetic wig. Product description says it is to for synthetic wigs, but it certainly does not hold well.  I will be buying a different product.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.  When I had a problem with one can of spray, it was quickly refunded!  Great company and good product.  I shall be ordering again in the near future.  Brandywine was the name suggested when I purchased my hairpiece and it has proved to be a super spray and this company was most helpful! Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Good quality, just as I expected.</li>
            <li> Great hair spray for a wig!!!! Shipping was fast!!! I ordered another one.</li>
            <li> Better than using regular hair spray on synthetic wigs.</li>
            <li> I bought this wig spray because I had just purchased a new wig and it came with the shampoo.  I have enjoyed both the shampoo and wig spray</li>
            <li> It is probably gentle, but it doesn&#x27;t hold well, even for a few minutes.  I finally bought some cheap regular hairspray &amp;#34;Aqua Net.&amp;#34;  Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> This spray held up really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use something else, but this was great.</li>
            <li> Great!  Have used it for years...</li>
            <li> Great holding spray for wigs.Easy to work with .</li>
