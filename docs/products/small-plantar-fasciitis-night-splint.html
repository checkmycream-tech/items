            <li>the price is great</li>
            <li>I came across this one from a friend of mine and works fantastic!!!</li>
            <li>and it fits good.  </li>
            <li>All in all a good product, and</li>
            <li>a good note</li>
            <li>After a lot of internet research I came across this one and loved the price and the reviews I found.  </li>
            <li>Good product but not what my daughter needed.  </li>
            <li>it fits good but is bulky.  </li>
            <li>This is a good night splint for plantar fascititus.  </li>
            <li>The splint is well-constructed and surprisingly lightweight for the size.  </li>
            <li>This is a good quality product.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>The price is just fair</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was tricky to find good settings on the three straps.  </li>
            <li>And this is a really good brace.  </li>
            <li>but for the price I think it was a good deal</li>
            <li>The price is fair for a quality product.</li>
            <li>Good luck and good health.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a perfect fit and feels so comfy to sleep with on.</li>
            <li>but I sure am happy to have some relief from heel pain.</li>
            <li>VERY SATISFIED WITH THIS NIGHT TIME SPLINT.  </li>
            <li>Need to return, I&#x27;m sure for some this is a great help.  </li>
            <li>I am Very satisfied with this splint.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very pleased with this splint.  </li>
            <li>I rigged it up as best as I could to hold my foot as upright as possible, but it wasn&#x27;t ideal</li>
            <li>If I tightened any more my foot would fall asleep!</li>
            <li>When I wear it i have a pain free morning!!  </li>
            <li>that would be better!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I had bought this!</li>
            <li>these fit great around the calves.</li>
            <li>I started out with the medium size based on my shoe size but my toes stuck out over the edge and my foot felt kind of squished</li>
            <li>I also now have orthotics designed for plantar fasciitis in every pair of shoes/slippers I own</li>
            <li>IS EFFECTIVE IN STRETCHING THE MUSCLES IN MY FOOT AND CALF AND RELIEVING SEVERE PAIN IN MY FOOT.  </li>
            <li>Effective for my plantar fascists.  </li>
            <li>This is okay, we are still waiting for my mother to feel all good because she is supposed to wear this for 3 months.</li>
            <li>I guess you have to try this kind of product in a store as it is not</li>
            <li>a one size fits all kind of item.</li>
            <li>They were over $700 originally!!  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very easy to adjust and put on.</li>
            <li>I even paid more for a night splint from my Pod that fit on the front of my foot but this boot fits better and works great.</li>
            <li>However, I should note that I use a duvet/comforter which kind of floats over me and the bed, not a tucked-in top sheet + blanket combo.  </li>
            <li>So far this is the best treatment I have used for plantar faciitis.</li>
            <li>easy on and off once the snaps got used a bit!</li>
            <li>I decided to try sleeping in the splints to see if that will make things better but hasn&#x27;t helped yet.  </li>
            <li>I build up my foot slightly more, so it stays closer to a 90 degree angle from my leg, and this seems to be helping with the pain so much more.</li>
            <li>Hopefully I will continue to feel better and better.</li>
            <li>Another nice feature of this splint is the fact that once you find comfortable adjustments on the three across-the-leg/foot straps, you can keep them at that adjustment because the straps have buckles.</li>
            <li>Oh, but to walk pain-free when I first get up is nice!</li>
            <li>The padding is attached securely with Velcro which means it can be removed for hand-washing -- thankfully!</li>
            <li>My foot has been feeling better so tried a couple nights without the splint.  </li>
            <li>I started wearing it again and better in the morning and all day.  </li>
            <li>I still use and will continue using inserts (plus have lost 23 lbs, yay, 44 more to go).  </li>
            <li>I was pleased with this night splint and feel that it was helpful in the healing process.  </li>
            <li>I began to wonder if the socks (also worn at night) that pull your toes upward might have been the better choice.  </li>
            <li>a condition of plantar fasciitis, the toes should not be able to be bent downward while wearing this brace.  </li>
            <li>I felt better after doing stretches and working with bands.</li>
            <li>and I can feel my foot getting better every day.</li>
            <li>i had no issues getting used to it sleeping however if you&#x27;re in a relationship, things can get interesting and creative if you don&#x27;t want to take it off.</li>
            <li>I can see how it would help most people who need this type of night splint.  </li>
            <li>Cannot sleep comfortably nor relax in this boot!</li>
            <li>I looked into a night splint from the Dr. but was unwilling to pay $300 for something I wasn&#x27;t sure I would even wear.  </li>
            <li>My heel pain is so much better</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this works, but I found it too cumbersome to sleep with.  </li>
            <li>you fan find at most drugstores.</li>
            <li>it feeling better</li>
            <li>8-)</li>
            <li>Mine, no joke, was more like a number 7.</li>
            <li>My husband said it looked more like a ski boot.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad that I did.  </li>
            <li>It is taking weeks but definitely is much better</li>
            <li>The velcro can be longer to allow for more room to loosen.</li>
            <li>Itâ€™s a bit tricky to put on, but it holds my foot better than one that wrapped around.  </li>
            <li>But when I get up in the morning, my foot feels better.</li>
            <li>Like so many folks, she doesn&#x27;t think to take it off when she gets out of bed.   </li>
            <li>much more comfy</li>
            <li>Better padding would help.</li>
            <li>Overall Great product!</li>
            <li>SO MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE!  </li>
            <li>and my feet are feeling so much better</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about how great this product is!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I read the comments about length of splint.  </li>
            <li>Having had plantar fascitis myself it is in the 1st step off the bed where it hurts the most</li>
            <li>and so I am hoping that she would see more of a change after she gets more used to the product and could wear it for longer than 2 hours at night.  ,</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I am able to adjust the angle that my foot is at</li>
            <li>Most of us are undoing years of leg/feet issues.</li>
            <li>I want people who have plantar fasciitis and are giving up and resigned to the pain to try just one more thing.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with the value for the price.</li>
            <li>and I also take off in my sleep, but works better than anything else I&#x27;ve used -</li>
            <li>I wish there were a better solution.</li>
            <li>I found this night splint and was a bit reluctant to order because it was a bit more than I wanted to spend</li>
            <li>After a night&#x27;s sleep, you will feel a difference and feel much better.</li>
            <li>The toes point more so towards the body to the slightest.</li>
            <li>Foot did feel better when I stood in am.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since gotten a pretty good balance with the straps.</li>
            <li>I wish I could figure out a way to make it fit better, I am sure it would help me more</li>
            <li>The fit is very comfortable, and I like that It can be adjusted to flex the foot more as the tendon stretches.</li>
            <li>The straps have quick release which is also nice.</li>
            <li>There is some getting used to wearing it while I sleep, but it is very light weight and comfortable.</li>
            <li>I was able get out of bed and walk normally where before using this product I was hopping around on my good foot for about 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Not the most comfortable to sleep in, but i do not think any of them would be.  </li>
            <li>They need to put some sort of non-slip bottom on these things to protect sleepy people from becoming hospitalized people.</li>
            <li>This is the most comfortable splint I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I did, because it does fit my foot well.  </li>
            <li>It is also not the most comfortable thing to wear.  </li>
            <li>This is not the most comfortable thing to have to wear to bed-</li>
            <li>so I am able to sleep comfortable.</li>
            <li>Good product for a reasonable price</li>
            <li>Good, when I use it, it holds my foot in place and helps so it doesn&#x27;t hurt so much when I get up</li>
            <li>This brace does put your foot in a good stretching position, just  a bit much for me to sleep in.</li>
            <li>Read Amazon reviews to arrive at this model, and you guys are right again!!</li>
            <li>At most 10 to 15 seconds of stretch is all I need now in the morning to be quite comfortable and now I&#x27;m also quite comfortable all day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as light and as comfortable as a splint can probably be, although I felt my foot could use more of a stretch.  </li>
            <li>I could loosen the stretch, and sleep easily, but I&#x27;ve found this uneccesary.  </li>
            <li>Easy to adjust and buckle.</li>
            <li>The splint is easy to use</li>
            <li>Easy to put on and take off.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I wear a 7.5 shoe, wide, and this is a perfect fit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to get on and off.</li>
            <li>It is easy to get off and on.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say that if I wasnt at my \\&quot;rock bottom\\&quot;, so to speak, I would probably have thrown this in my closet after the first night.</li>
            <li>The 3 straps are completely adjustable to get a good fit, and I love that you can tighten the tension as needed.</li>
            <li>best money I ever spent!!</li>
            <li>Thus is a fine splint.</li>
            <li>Fine for daytime use, but I cannot sleep in it.</li>
            <li>it works fine.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s fine and keeps my heel stable...</li>
            <li>and they have been fine, although I know you aren&#x27;t supposed to walk in them.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable and easy to use and gives my foot some rest.  </li>
            <li>Works fine - my foot goes to sleep in it</li>
            <li>I was able to purchase the small and it is a perfect fit.  </li>
            <li>Even without wearing this all night, I have seen a huge change.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>This product is a great fit for people with the smaller feet.</li>
            <li>I noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>When I wear this all night, I walk pain free all day.  </li>
            <li>But the goal is to not hurt/injure the foot so anything which prevents pain is important.  </li>
            <li>I was suprised to find a boot so cheap.  </li>
            <li>I received it the next day and it worked great.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, the device seemed what you would want for night wear - padded straps, light weight, cushioned surfaces.</li>
            <li>Each time, I tried adjusting the straps and just could not find a comfortable position for my foot.</li>
            <li>Pros: Comfortable padding.</li>
            <li>Well padded, comfortable for its purpose.  </li>
            <li>But I couldn&#x27;t wear it all night because it wasn&#x27;t comfortable at all.</li>
            <li>By its design, it wasn&#x27;t comfortable</li>
            <li>Is the boot comfortable?</li>
            <li>Not that comfortable to wear at night</li>
            <li>However, after some brainstorming I didn&#x27;t use the provided buckles and instead used an ACE bandage to secure it in place.  </li>
            <li>I can sleep all night rather comfortably.</li>
            <li>It is well padded and comfortable.</li>
            <li>These are awesome I have been wearing them for a few hours a night to build myself up to sleeping with them on.</li>
            <li>It did help my fascitis now my foot rarely ever hurts any more.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m pain free, but I feel that the pain is lessened and it&#x27;s just going to take time.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t get it to fit.</li>
            <li>They have free returns th .</li>
            <li>I wake up pain free, and sleep all night -</li>
            <li>Fit well.</li>
            <li>though this splint looks in the photo like it would be huge and clunky, it honestly doesn&#x27;t feel very distracting or bothersome when it is fastened on my leg.  </li>
            <li>The exercises didn&#x27;t help much but wearing this splint at night seems to have alleviated most of the pain.  </li>
            <li>These are just the same type of thing and just as good - hubby says actually better.</li>
            <li>Foot much better right away</li>
            <li>something that very rarely has ever happened to me.).  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I am a size 6 1/2 and the small splint fits perfectly.</li>
            <li>Completely adjustable and much more comfortable than the type that fits on the top of your foot.  </li>
            <li>This one was better than some that I have seen and it was not horribly uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>So far I am very pleased and hope these aid in fixing my problem.</li>
            <li>She outgrew those and we thought we should try these first and glad we did.</li>
            <li>Seemed Ok at first.</li>
            <li>After just two nights sleeping with the boot, my foot felt much better when standing on it first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li>but it was so worth the money!</li>
            <li>My plantar fasciitis was caused primarily by weighing too darn much, plus moving into a house with mostly hardwood floors and walking around barefoot/in socks without foot support.  </li>
            <li>I honestly was only able to wear this splint about 3 times.</li>
            <li>She had such great success with hers, so I ordered this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also stays clean this way</li>
            <li>It is easy to snap on and off and is pretty comfortable to wear at night.  </li>
            <li>I have replaced it, more or less successfully, with a piece of nylon cord.</li>
            <li>The straps are all adjustable, so make sure it fits snuggly first, then use the quick release clips to put on and take off the splint.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an excellent product that really works and does so for a fraction of the cost of other splints.</li>
            <li>Specially when you want to turn side to side.</li>
            <li>this special boot is made in order to relief the pain caused by the plantar fascitis.</li>
            <li>My doctor told me these splints would help my feet and relieve the pain from plantar fascitis, and she was RIGHT!</li>
            <li>The price is right and the item works, they got it to me quick also!</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m an extremely sound sleeper and, thanks to my Sleep Number bed, I rarely turn or move more than once during the night.  </li>
            <li>I bought this item only because the price was good</li>
            <li>Now I guess after 15 months I was bound to get better or is it coincidence that when I started wearing this product that I have really improved.  </li>
            <li>Cool item</li>
            <li>I can wear it better on the foot that doesn&#x27;t have as much pain.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this after trying a one size fits all from the drugstore that really didn&#x27;t fit all!</li>
            <li>Short of getting a removable cast that is custom fit to my leg, this thing is the best at the thigns I&#x27;ve tried for holding my foot at enough of an angle.</li>
            <li>I would have to make really lose to not wake me up, but this boot I could adjust and it doesn&#x27;t irritate the top of my foot, or squeeze my toes.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ve reached the break-even point where the inconvenience of the splint (although not bad) outweighs the benefit I get.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to be more active again because I no longer have to wonder if my feet will be able to take me where I need to go.</li>
            <li>It took at least 2 weeks of wearing before I experienced much comfort, but my PF was really severe, causing great difficulty walking.</li>
            <li>Other than that - great job ...</li>
            <li>received the Bird &amp; Cronin yesterday and can echo other reviewers&#x27; comments that it seems well-constructed, well-thought-out, lightweight-but-sturdy, and a great buy at twenty-something.  </li>
            <li>Im finding that I&#x27;m staying on my back or my side more and more now.</li>
            <li>it arrived quickly and well packed.  </li>
            <li>But am surprised that so many people said it was comfortable.  </li>
            <li>A quick note for those who just want size information:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I cannot believe how quickly this splint started alleviating the symptoms of my PF.</li>
            <li>I find the B&amp;C splint to be comfortably padded and very much like the fact that it is adjustable.  </li>
            <li>I bought a cheap, used pair to try them out first, and I had IMMEDIATE RELIEF that very first night.  </li>
            <li>So I tighten this strap as much as comfortable so that my ankle can&#x27;t bend and separate from the device much.  </li>
            <li>You all really found this comfortable?</li>
            <li>The smooth plastic slides around under the sheets and really doesn&#x27;t bother me when I turn.</li>
            <li>Of the several things I&#x27;ve tried for plantar fasciitis, this one seems most effective so far.  </li>
            <li>Was this product worth it?  </li>
            <li>If you can stand to wear it, I would say it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I can definitely get a nice stretch with this splint.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like having a cast on but worth it.</li>
            <li>I have wide feet at EE, and this fit nicely.    </li>
            <li>but I do think it is worth trying.</li>
            <li>I needs far more padding on both the bottom and on the straps.</li>
            <li>When she opened the box, she laughed laughed out loud because of the ridiculous thought of wearing this ski-boot-look-a-like around the house and to bed.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to wear the splint more than 2 nights because of other issues.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and was exactly as stated.</li>
            <li>But you have to experiment and find just the right amount of tension in all the straps.  </li>
            <li>At some point I may see a podiatrist but for right now this is sufficient.    </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t fully figure out the right adjustment for me with all the straps (3 of them).  </li>
            <li>where I could get 2 fingers side-by-side under the straps, was just about right.</li>
            <li>I had a stress fracture on my right foot and started getting cramps and locked calf when I ran.</li>
            <li>it is not made for the right.</li>
            <li>but my toes go right over the edge.</li>
            <li>So instead, I found a way to wrap my foot in an ace bandage so that it stayed at a right angle all night.</li>
            <li>My toes do not hang over but are right at the front of the splint.</li>
            <li>I just have to find the right time/place to wear it.</li>
            <li>Cannot seem to get the straps right to keep my foot in correct position without falling asleep.</li>
            <li>I suspect many folks just stopped using it after the first couple of near mishaps.</li>
            <li>I then got the small size and this is the good fit.</li>
            <li>But wearing it while awake (as long as you don&#x27;t try to walk on it) does really allow good stretching of the plantar fascia.</li>
            <li>It is nicely padded and comfortable on the leg, and the non-skid padding on the bottom is a great feature if you need to do a few little steps with it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried stuffing the heel to make the angle less acute, but then the straps didn&#x27;t fit, and it still hurt me.</li>
            <li>I have a very small and narrow women&#x27;s size 6 foot and was able to adjust it to fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>While my feet will still hurt after excessive use, they have improved greatly.</li>
            <li>easy to use and put on, holds in place all night long, easy to adjust to foot and leg, works well</li>
            <li>This splint is a GREAT value, the only thing I found to be important, (as it was suggested in other reviews I read on this product before purchasing it), you need to get your ankle and foot straps adjusted for comfort.</li>
            <li>very very sturdy.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing this splint for about a month now to combat a pretty severe case of plantar fasciitis and want to update you on the effectiveness and my experience with it.  </li>
            <li>First of all the product.  </li>
            <li>The middle strap (goes kind of over your ankle) is important in that it keeps your foot in the proper position.  </li>
            <li>This is just what finally worked fairly comfortably and effectively for me, your experience might be different.  </li>
            <li>I had immediate relief for that \\&quot;first step\\&quot; in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says it will.  </li>
            <li>The top strap was too short</li>
            <li>, I did find the padding soft and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>This product is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>My insurance company payed a lot more money to buy me a very similar boot.  </li>
            <li>However, I have only been able to wear it a couple hours in bed before I decide it&#x27;s bothering me</li>
            <li>nice fit for small foot.</li>
            <li>Wearing them just once set me back almost a week in progress, by allowing me to overpronate even more, so I got rid of them.  </li>
            <li>She said that after the first 2-3 hours, it began to bother her foot to the point she couldn&#x27;t sleep.  </li>
            <li>I am an avid walker/hiker/gym goer and &amp;#34;resting&amp;#34; for a month is not an option.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t last more than 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>The first night almost all the pain was gone when I got up in the morning.</li>
            <li>but it was way more $$ but basically the same thing.</li>
            <li>I can only wear this for at most 4 hours per night and then I end up waking up from pain in the ball of my foot and taking it off.  </li>
            <li>It is Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not &#x27;uncomfortable&#x27; - just bulky.</li>
            <li>;-)))  </li>
            <li>is already at an angle higher than 90 degrees (she said something about it&#x27;s being like a ski boot; I&#x27;d say my splint probably is at 100 degrees).  </li>
            <li>For the first week, no matter how I adjusted them, the straps would constrict my circulation and the resulting pain in my foot would wake me up about 3 hours after I&#x27;dgone to sleep, and I would have to take the splint off for the rest of the night.  </li>
            <li>I would have marked them five star if it werent for the cheap material that they are lined with.</li>
            <li>This splint really has helped me!</li>
            <li>That first step out of bed in the morning is no longer agonizing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not uncomfortable to sleep with, though it will feel cumbersome at first.  </li>
            <li>In the meantime, I will continue with the night splint as it does help in the mornings when I first start to walk.  </li>
            <li>I first night I slept in this</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this!!</li>
            <li>This is a good tough easy to adjust night splint.</li>
            <li>It really put me on the right path to recovery from plantar fascitis.</li>
            <li>It is kind of hot, and it&#x27;s kind of uncomfortable, but it seems to do the trick regardless.</li>
            <li>I have had PF for several months, and icing, compression, massage, etc. wasn&#x27;t doing much to make things better.</li>
            <li>second requirement of putting less pressure on the top of the foot is why I chose this Bird &amp; Cronin splint over the Active Ankle dorsal splint (they were my top two choices after looking over most of the options that Amazon sells), because the Active Ankle one looks like it requires more from the top of the foot.  </li>
            <li>I can put it on my left with no problems and it fits, but it wont fit my right</li>
            <li>No fault of the splint but a sure sign that it&#x27;s going to be a long time healing.</li>
            <li>My plantar fasciitis is being very stubborn about going away, but this boot does allow me to walk first thing in the morning without pain.  </li>
            <li>I tried pretty much from icing it,rolling it,stretching and nothing seem to work.</li>
            <li>so I switched to the large.  </li>
            <li>My foot size is \\&quot;around\\&quot; 10 or so, I would suggest going to the large if you have any question.    </li>
            <li>It is a large plastic boot you wear to bed</li>
            <li>Before I got the splint, I had a lump in my heel about the size of a large marble.</li>
            <li>To large for a women 7 size foot.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another issue is that they were somewhat difficult to put on and off but that ends up being a positive because this splint does a very good job of rigidly holding your foot in place unlike the Futuro splints</li>
            <li>so I tried the Bird &amp; Cronin splint and found it to be much more effective than the Futuro over-the-top splint.</li>
            <li>your foot is straight up and doing the stretching.</li>
            <li>but nothing was really working.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect it to work.  </li>
            <li>According to the diagram that came with the brace, your entire foot (including toes) should fit on the sole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>as I really want to do everything I can to get rid of the pain in my foot.</li>
            <li>Any splint for PF will place unusual pressure on some part of the leg or foot; there&#x27;s just no way around it.  </li>
            <li>This is really helping stretch out my foot.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very well made.</li>
            <li>really need ability to walk or stand up with this device as well.</li>
            <li>I feel it is really helping with my pain.</li>
            <li>but the boot really works.</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend this product!</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s really helping.</li>
            <li>I found the straps very itchy</li>
            <li>I could see it working if you didn&#x27;t want to sleep in it, but I really need something that will work overnight.</li>
            <li>This splint has really helped.</li>
            <li>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated</li>
            <li>It has really helped my planter fasciitis by wearing it at night.  </li>
            <li>Buy it if you have this problem because it really works.</li>
            <li>Otherwise I really like the brace.</li>
            <li>It is reasonable and seems to be doing the job.  </li>
            <li>They were better quality than we expected for the price.  </li>
            <li>and my foot spent more time at 75 degrees than 90.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t catch in the sheets that much (thankfully, I can wear the small-size splint, which helps).  </li>
            <li>So much cheaper than the Orthopedics office.</li>
            <li>This is a really well made splint.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!  </li>
            <li>I wore them for about a month straight</li>
            <li>its really help my shin and ankle muscle, i have very hight arch feet.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>and it has really helped me get over my plantar fascitis--which I have had for a year now.  </li>
            <li>that straight and I&lt;br /&gt;have</li>
            <li>it straight.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for me, had to return.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable enough</li>
            <li>I have very muscular legs for a woman and</li>
            <li>I was having very severe pain in my heel.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get comfortable enough with it to fall asleep.</li>
            <li>I had to gradually get used to wearing it the whole night.</li>
            <li>This splint has been very helpful in reducing pain</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly convinced that the overnight stretch did at least speed the process.  </li>
            <li>I use this splint several hours a day, most days, while I&#x27;m sedentary, and I crank up the stretch as far as it will go.</li>
            <li>fixed my fasciitis!!!</li>
            <li>I have the one on the toes right, but the ankle strap makes my foot fall asleep, so I am clearly tighening too much and will continue to fiddle around with it.  </li>
            <li>The pain was mainly caused by too much pressure on the ball of my foot.  </li>
            <li>next morning, removal, a few stretches and... amazing!  </li>
            <li>I ordered the small because I have tiny feet (size 6) and its great.</li>
            <li>I found my Sketcher Shape-Ups (which I once loved) seriously aggravated the condition.  </li>
            <li>It is OK for quick trips to the door (let pets in/out) and other short in-home nighttime excursions, despite the warning against walking in it per the directions.  </li>
            <li>First off, I have only one complaint with the seller and that is probably my own fault: they need to put more emphasis on pointing out that these aren&#x27;t pairs - they are only one item, so if you have the problem in both feet you have to buy 2.</li>
            <li>Time will tell how durable it is (notwithstanding my naughty walking with it on) but the price is quite reasonable so as long as it lasts a year, I&#x27;ll consider it a good investment.</li>
            <li>Much lighter and not as tight fitting as the orthopedic prescribed walking boot</li>
            <li>Overall, this is very comfortable for such a seemingly bulky item.</li>
            <li>This is possibly something I&#x27;m going to have to wear for a relatively long time to come, and I&#x27;m confident that this is having a positive effect on my plantar fasciitis.</li>
            <li>less restricting that I like more.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine the more expensive versions being much better.</li>
            <li>This is Ok but big: it does not hold the foot well enough.</li>
            <li>They work better than anything else I have used and are the only ones that don&#x27;t wake me up in the middle of the night wanting to throw them off.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that once you set the velcro in place you can use the plastic tabs and not have to mess with the velcro setting.  </li>
            <li>My podiatrist gave me a cheap version of this boot, but it never fit right</li>
            <li>I need to make sure that the straps are not too tight though.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brace for folks suffering as I did.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>And at such a reasonable price!!</li>
            <li>The bottom strap (over the top of your foot) is not as important in positioning as long as the middle ankle strap is correct, and I have that one quite loose.  </li>
            <li>I wear a size 7/7.5 and have a wide foot and the splint can barely fit on my foot.  </li>
            <li>I also have wide calves so the adjustable straps need to be let out a lot to fit my foot/ankle.  </li>
            <li>It took so much ibuprofen to treat my pain that I developed stomach issues.</li>
            <li>This splint is very well constructed and durable; it is a lot better than the Futuro plantar fasciitis splints which I tried in the past.  </li>
            <li>Worth a try at the unbelievably low Amazon price.</li>
            <li>I will give this product a try for few more months to see if my problem can be cured.</li>
            <li>I rarely have pain now and have gone to wearing the brace only 2-3 nights per week!</li>
            <li>However, this is really great for wearing while sitting down in the evening for a few hours.</li>
            <li>, the brace didn&#x27;t tussle much with it, but I have now switched over to my winter weight duvet (12 tog) and they are battling more with each other, which does wake me up occasionally during the night.  </li>
            <li>After 2 weeks my right foot is almost back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I gave this to my sister and right after the 1st 2 nights with only a couple of hours of use she immediately felt the difference.</li>
            <li>was a gift to a friend because i ordered wrong size and knew someone who could use very nicely made</li>
            <li>I have small feet and BIG calves, and I couldn&#x27;t get this brace to fit me comfortably.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t sleep comfortably at the increased stretch but for short durations it seems extra helpful.</li>
            <li>believe the \\&quot;Small\\&quot; would only fit only up to a  women&#x27;s size 6-1/2!  </li>
            <li>My best wishes to everyone who suffers from this condition, it has a very big impact on lifestyle.</li>
            <li>I am able to walk, not limp or crawl, into the shower each morning and find I have far less pain during the day.  </li>
            <li>I was getting a small amount of relief after about a week of wearing the boot, but I was finding that even with all the straps and support, my foot was still able to find a somewhat relaxed , sleep position, so</li>
            <li>I first tried the Futuro splint because I happened to find it in a local CVS.</li>
            <li>During the day if I walk more than an hour the sharp pain will come back.</li>
            <li>I started out the first night waking after two hours of sleep and taking the thing off, second night lasted 4 hours, etc.  </li>
            <li>Impossible to secure on your own on the right foot as the clips are paced low outer side of the boot.</li>
            <li>The pain in the left heel went away on its own after a month but the right foot kept getting worse, almost crippling in the morning and after sitting for extended periods of time.  </li>
            <li>The splint is extremely well made, light, comfortable, gives a serious (but fully adjustable) stretch, slides underneath the covers easily, doesn&#x27;t scratch or bother my husband while we sleep, and the padded straps don&#x27;t rub or scratch me, no matter how long it&#x27;s on.  </li>
            <li>I have to say that after wearing it to bed for a few nights my plantar fashiatis is almost gone, I wake up with very little pain, and with stretching and icing I have avoided having to get cortisone shots, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>I am in the medical field and am on my feet and on the move all day long, and I am feeling a huge difference.</li>
            <li>As far as the side straps, pull them tighter to increase the stretch, generally just a gentle stretch is all you need.  </li>
            <li>This brace really helps my plantar facitis but am only able to wear it for short periods due to friction on bottom of foot.</li>
            <li>It is even better than the podiatrist&#x27;s because it is a small and hid medium was really too big.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this night splint for just two consecutive nights so far, but just in that short time I am feeling a positive difference.</li>
            <li>was that I had to tighten the strap so tight around the middle of my foot that it caused the top of my foot to redden and bruise.  </li>
            <li>Its a little bulky and takes some getting used to in order to sleep comfortably</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been suffering from plantar fascitis since the summer of 2011, when at first I thought I had just bruised my heel, only after months of not healing I started researching and came to realize it was much more serious.</li>
            <li>Still, a 3-star review because this is clearly a high-quality, well-constructed item.</li>
            <li>But I fixed it by rolling up a couple of socks and placing them under my arch.  </li>
            <li>what I did was raid my sewing fabric stash for some soft fleece.</li>
            <li>Because my job is 90% sedentary, I&#x27;ve taken to frequently wearing the splint while I&#x27;m working.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn it for nearly a month now</li>
            <li>I need a different support that doesn&#x27;t pull the foot so much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn it three nights so far</li>
            <li>It has plenty of ventilation so your feet don&#x27;t sweat, and has soft foam padding against your skin.</li>
            <li>Although it is bulky, it did hold my foot firmly, but comfortable.</li>
            <li>A friend of mine had gotten her splint directly from her doc</li>
            <li>It is almost identical to the $300 professional splint at a fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with how lightweight these are.</li>
            <li>There are times when I forget about the pain completely.  </li>
            <li>These are for our 7 year old daughter in-toeing.</li>
            <li>I still felt I was getting some good out of it, but it was disappointing not to use it the whole night through.  </li>
            <li>As a side sleeper, I had a difficult time finding a position where the weight of the splint didn&#x27;t bother my good foot.  </li>
            <li>Within a week of wearing it my daughter was back to normal!</li>
            <li>I opted for this splint over any of the ones that go on the top of your foot because I still have weird nerve pain and tingling on the top of my foot and the other style would&#x27;ve irritated that.</li>
            <li>As someone who is a regular exerciser, it&#x27;s next to torture to not be able to be as active.  </li>
            <li>Lastly, in the beginning, Alleve (only one tab) was the only thing that would get me through the night, because everything else wore off too quickly.    </li>
            <li>I have not been able to spend an entire night with it; I usually end up taking it off during the night</li>
            <li>A little cumbersome and takes a few days to get used to wearing to sleep in, but fabulous product!!</li>
            <li>I still wear this all night and things are finally improving and almost healed completely!!</li>
            <li>a poster mentioned that you don&#x27;t have to sleep with it super tight.  </li>
            <li>I decided to look for a brace that uses hard plastic as a splint material and which might provide resistance from below the foot more, and pull down on the top of the foot less, than</li>
            <li>You can always work to a greater stretch with time and patience but it will be useless if you push things too far or too fast and cause additional discomfort that deters you from wearing the splint.</li>
            <li>my foot seems to be the largest that would fit this size small.  </li>
            <li>The small is supposed to fit up to a women&#x27;s 7.5, but my toes hang a bit over the edge.  </li>
            <li>I use it on really likes to spasm when seated for a long time which aggravates the plantar fasciitis</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m beginning to have hope that maybe I CAN get back to a somewhat normal life.</li>
            <li>I normally wear a size 7.5 shoe and if your foot is any bigger than that go to the M.</li>
            <li>I certainly didn&#x27;t have to use the side straps to pull my foot any further towards my knee, so I left them slack.  </li>
            <li>We live overseas and use mosquito nets and it gets all tangled up in the net</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update this review if I have any major breakthroughs.    </li>
            <li>I had three major issues with this brace.  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;s an avid athlete and never had the patience to give her feet a break from running and other activities.  </li>
            <li>The flexion of the foot is pretty extreme.  </li>
            <li>The splint is too tall for my leg and hits it right at the center back of my calf.</li>
            <li>I prefer an extreme stretch, so I can&#x27;t sleep with it on for more than a few hours, BUT this has NOTHING to do with the splint.  </li>
            <li>My pain is so much better in the right foot that I can now really see how bad my left foot hurts too.</li>
            <li>I am confused do these fit a left and right foot, are they the same?</li>
            <li>some said the small splint was fine while some said it was too short.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t hard to adjust to fit.</li>
            <li>a hard time getting comfortable because I feel like I have to</li>
            <li>I coudn&#x27;t put it in a manner that will fit me right, If I put snug I end up removing it during the night coz I get numbed bec of poor circulation, when I put it loose</li>
            <li>Seeing what when into this and the quality of the construction, I&#x27;m surprised the price is so low.</li>
            <li>I do wish I had one with a soft underside, though, so I could just get up and walk when I have to in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too early to rate the overall effectiveness of this product.</li>
            <li>The straps running from the top of the brace cuff to the footbed attached right where my pinkie and big toe joints sit, putting pressure on the joints and causing those portions of my foot to go numb.  </li>
            <li>They looked pretty uncomfortable and even with all of the positive reviews, I still didn&#x27;t believe it would make much of a difference</li>
            <li>I have been having trouble with fascitis in my right foot since April.  </li>
            <li>I have small (size 6 1/2) feet and the futuro dorsal model cut off all circulation due to pressure on the top of my arch.  </li>
            <li>The top strap keeps the thing from sliding up and down and as such I have that one somewhat tight.  </li>
            <li>You should be doing other things to help your condition, like stretches (bent knee and straight) and exercises like toe \\&quot;scrunches,\\&quot; periodically throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>If you change these side straps much, you will need to adjust the other 3.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it has been very helpful in alleveing pain.</li>
            <li>pull the foot bend straps pretty tight and then</li>
            <li>It really helps to keep the fibers in the foot stretched, and there is not that big initial pain in the foot when stepping on your foot for the first time after not using it for a few hours.</li>
            <li>It certainly helped with the extreme discomfort and for that I would definitely recommend it.  </li>
            <li>This brace places pressure on the forefoot-- particularly if you like an extreme stretch, as I do-- and this creates a pressure point on the ball of my foot.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the smalled size it was still too big for me, it costed 9$ for the product and $8 for delivery, when I asked to retunr to the product I was told that they would deduct a restocking fee, NOT refund the shipping and didnt even send a return shipping label, so If i returned the product at my own cost, it would have costed me atleast 10$ to send it back and would have probably been retunred $7, I decided not to send the product back, its lying in my closet useless because I cant use it.</li>
            <li>This morning, heel pain was less intense.  </li>
            <li>so it is much easier and less cumbersome to sleep in.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure that it helped with my (near) cure, but it certainly wasn&#x27;t a good thing to allow that ligament to tighten up so badly every night.  </li>
            <li>When the splint is worn nightly it starts to cause issues with other parts of your foot as it is not in a normal position.  </li>
            <li>Both mornings after its use, and throughout the whole day, I had little to no pain in my foot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve talked with a few other people who&#x27;ve had PF and they confirmed that it&#x27;s a long healing process, and can take up to a year.  </li>
            <li>For most people, the Bird &amp; Cronin splint looks like it would be less comfortable to sleep in than the Active Ankle one (in terms of disturbing the sheets, making it hard to turn over, banging into the other limb, etc.), but I took a gamble that the Bird &amp; Cronin&#x27;s underside-only hard plastic would be more comfortable for my particular foot than the Active Ankle&#x27;s overfoot hard</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and, while it felt really awkward and strange wearing it the first night, I got used to is and had it on all night.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only a bit more awkward than the professional ones.</li>

            <li> All in all a good product, and</li>
            <li> a good note</li>
            <li> After a lot of internet research I came across this one and loved the price and the reviews I found.  </li>
            <li> Good product but not what my daughter needed.  </li>
            <li> it fits good but is bulky.  </li>
            <li> This is a good night splint for plantar fascititus.  </li>
            <li> The splint is well-constructed and surprisingly lightweight for the size.  </li>
            <li> This is a good quality product.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> The price is just fair</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was tricky to find good settings on the three straps.  </li>
            <li> And this is a really good brace.  </li>
            <li> but for the price I think it was a good deal</li>
            <li> The price is fair for a quality product.</li>

            <li> but I sure am happy to have some relief from heel pain.</li>
            <li> VERY SATISFIED WITH THIS NIGHT TIME SPLINT.  </li>
            <li> Need to return, I&#x27;m sure for some this is a great help.  </li>
            <li> I am Very satisfied with this splint.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very pleased with this splint.  </li>
            <li> I rigged it up as best as I could to hold my foot as upright as possible, but it wasn&#x27;t ideal</li>
            <li> If I tightened any more my foot would fall asleep!</li>
            <li> When I wear it i have a pain free morning!!  </li>
            <li> that would be better!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I had bought this!</li>
            <li> these fit great around the calves.</li>
            <li> I started out with the medium size based on my shoe size but my toes stuck out over the edge and my foot felt kind of squished</li>
            <li> I also now have orthotics designed for plantar fasciitis in every pair of shoes/slippers I own</li>
            <li> IS EFFECTIVE IN STRETCHING THE MUSCLES IN MY FOOT AND CALF AND RELIEVING SEVERE PAIN IN MY FOOT.  </li>
            <li> Effective for my plantar fascists.  </li>
            <li> This is okay, we are still waiting for my mother to feel all good because she is supposed to wear this for 3 months.</li>
            <li> I guess you have to try this kind of product in a store as it is not</li>
            <li> a one size fits all kind of item.</li>
            <li> They were over $700 originally!!  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very easy to adjust and put on.</li>
            <li> I even paid more for a night splint from my Pod that fit on the front of my foot but this boot fits better and works great.</li>
            <li> However, I should note that I use a duvet/comforter which kind of floats over me and the bed, not a tucked-in top sheet + blanket combo.  </li>
            <li> So far this is the best treatment I have used for plantar faciitis.</li>
            <li> easy on and off once the snaps got used a bit!</li>
            <li> I decided to try sleeping in the splints to see if that will make things better but hasn&#x27;t helped yet.  </li>
            <li> I build up my foot slightly more, so it stays closer to a 90 degree angle from my leg, and this seems to be helping with the pain so much more.</li>
            <li> Hopefully I will continue to feel better and better.</li>
            <li> Another nice feature of this splint is the fact that once you find comfortable adjustments on the three across-the-leg/foot straps, you can keep them at that adjustment because the straps have buckles.</li>
            <li> Oh, but to walk pain-free when I first get up is nice!</li>
            <li> The padding is attached securely with Velcro which means it can be removed for hand-washing -- thankfully!</li>
            <li> My foot has been feeling better so tried a couple nights without the splint.  </li>
            <li> I started wearing it again and better in the morning and all day.  </li>
            <li> I still use and will continue using inserts (plus have lost 23 lbs, yay, 44 more to go).  </li>
            <li> I was pleased with this night splint and feel that it was helpful in the healing process.  </li>
            <li> I began to wonder if the socks (also worn at night) that pull your toes upward might have been the better choice.  </li>
            <li> a condition of plantar fasciitis, the toes should not be able to be bent downward while wearing this brace.  </li>
            <li> I felt better after doing stretches and working with bands.</li>
            <li> and I can feel my foot getting better every day.</li>
            <li> i had no issues getting used to it sleeping however if you&#x27;re in a relationship, things can get interesting and creative if you don&#x27;t want to take it off.</li>
            <li> I can see how it would help most people who need this type of night splint.  </li>
            <li> Cannot sleep comfortably nor relax in this boot!</li>
            <li> I looked into a night splint from the Dr. but was unwilling to pay $300 for something I wasn&#x27;t sure I would even wear.  </li>
            <li> My heel pain is so much better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this works, but I found it too cumbersome to sleep with.  </li>
            <li> you fan find at most drugstores.</li>
            <li> it feeling better</li>
            <li> 8-)</li>
            <li> Mine, no joke, was more like a number 7.</li>
            <li> My husband said it looked more like a ski boot.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad that I did.  </li>
            <li> It is taking weeks but definitely is much better</li>
            <li> The velcro can be longer to allow for more room to loosen.</li>
            <li> Itâ€™s a bit tricky to put on, but it holds my foot better than one that wrapped around.  </li>
            <li> But when I get up in the morning, my foot feels better.</li>
            <li> Like so many folks, she doesn&#x27;t think to take it off when she gets out of bed.   </li>
            <li> much more comfy</li>
            <li> Better padding would help.</li>
            <li> Overall Great product!</li>
            <li> SO MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE!  </li>
            <li> and my feet are feeling so much better</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about how great this product is!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I read the comments about length of splint.  </li>
            <li> Having had plantar fascitis myself it is in the 1st step off the bed where it hurts the most</li>
            <li> and so I am hoping that she would see more of a change after she gets more used to the product and could wear it for longer than 2 hours at night.  ,</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I am able to adjust the angle that my foot is at</li>
            <li> Most of us are undoing years of leg/feet issues.</li>
            <li> I want people who have plantar fasciitis and are giving up and resigned to the pain to try just one more thing.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with the value for the price.</li>
            <li> and I also take off in my sleep, but works better than anything else I&#x27;ve used -</li>
            <li> I wish there were a better solution.</li>
            <li> I found this night splint and was a bit reluctant to order because it was a bit more than I wanted to spend</li>
            <li> After a night&#x27;s sleep, you will feel a difference and feel much better.</li>
            <li> The toes point more so towards the body to the slightest.</li>
            <li> Foot did feel better when I stood in am.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since gotten a pretty good balance with the straps.</li>
            <li> I wish I could figure out a way to make it fit better, I am sure it would help me more</li>
            <li> The fit is very comfortable, and I like that It can be adjusted to flex the foot more as the tendon stretches.</li>
            <li> The straps have quick release which is also nice.</li>
            <li> There is some getting used to wearing it while I sleep, but it is very light weight and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I was able get out of bed and walk normally where before using this product I was hopping around on my good foot for about 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Not the most comfortable to sleep in, but i do not think any of them would be.  </li>
            <li> They need to put some sort of non-slip bottom on these things to protect sleepy people from becoming hospitalized people.</li>
            <li> This is the most comfortable splint I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I did, because it does fit my foot well.  </li>
            <li> It is also not the most comfortable thing to wear.  </li>
            <li> This is not the most comfortable thing to have to wear to bed-</li>
            <li> so I am able to sleep comfortable.</li>
            <li> Good product for a reasonable price</li>
            <li> Good, when I use it, it holds my foot in place and helps so it doesn&#x27;t hurt so much when I get up</li>
            <li> This brace does put your foot in a good stretching position, just  a bit much for me to sleep in.</li>
            <li> Read Amazon reviews to arrive at this model, and you guys are right again!!</li>
            <li> At most 10 to 15 seconds of stretch is all I need now in the morning to be quite comfortable and now I&#x27;m also quite comfortable all day.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as light and as comfortable as a splint can probably be, although I felt my foot could use more of a stretch.  </li>
            <li> I could loosen the stretch, and sleep easily, but I&#x27;ve found this uneccesary.  </li>
            <li> Easy to adjust and buckle.</li>
            <li> The splint is easy to use</li>
            <li> Easy to put on and take off.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I wear a 7.5 shoe, wide, and this is a perfect fit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to get on and off.</li>
            <li> It is easy to get off and on.  </li>
            <li> I can honestly say that if I wasnt at my \\&quot;rock bottom\\&quot;, so to speak, I would probably have thrown this in my closet after the first night.</li>
            <li> The 3 straps are completely adjustable to get a good fit, and I love that you can tighten the tension as needed.</li>
            <li> best money I ever spent!!</li>
            <li> Thus is a fine splint.</li>
            <li> Fine for daytime use, but I cannot sleep in it.</li>
            <li> it works fine.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s fine and keeps my heel stable...</li>
            <li> and they have been fine, although I know you aren&#x27;t supposed to walk in them.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable and easy to use and gives my foot some rest.  </li>
            <li> Works fine - my foot goes to sleep in it</li>
            <li> I was able to purchase the small and it is a perfect fit.  </li>
            <li> Even without wearing this all night, I have seen a huge change.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> This product is a great fit for people with the smaller feet.</li>
            <li> I noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> When I wear this all night, I walk pain free all day.  </li>
            <li> But the goal is to not hurt/injure the foot so anything which prevents pain is important.  </li>
            <li> I was suprised to find a boot so cheap.  </li>
            <li> I received it the next day and it worked great.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, the device seemed what you would want for night wear - padded straps, light weight, cushioned surfaces.</li>
            <li> Each time, I tried adjusting the straps and just could not find a comfortable position for my foot.</li>
            <li> Pros: Comfortable padding.</li>
            <li> Well padded, comfortable for its purpose.  </li>
            <li> But I couldn&#x27;t wear it all night because it wasn&#x27;t comfortable at all.</li>
            <li> By its design, it wasn&#x27;t comfortable</li>
            <li> Is the boot comfortable?</li>
            <li> Not that comfortable to wear at night</li>
            <li> However, after some brainstorming I didn&#x27;t use the provided buckles and instead used an ACE bandage to secure it in place.  </li>
            <li> I can sleep all night rather comfortably.</li>
            <li> It is well padded and comfortable.</li>
            <li> These are awesome I have been wearing them for a few hours a night to build myself up to sleeping with them on.</li>
            <li> It did help my fascitis now my foot rarely ever hurts any more.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m pain free, but I feel that the pain is lessened and it&#x27;s just going to take time.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get it to fit.</li>
            <li> They have free returns th .</li>
            <li> I wake up pain free, and sleep all night -</li>
            <li> Fit well.</li>
            <li> though this splint looks in the photo like it would be huge and clunky, it honestly doesn&#x27;t feel very distracting or bothersome when it is fastened on my leg.  </li>
            <li> The exercises didn&#x27;t help much but wearing this splint at night seems to have alleviated most of the pain.  </li>
            <li> These are just the same type of thing and just as good - hubby says actually better.</li>
            <li> Foot much better right away</li>
            <li> something that very rarely has ever happened to me.).  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I am a size 6 1/2 and the small splint fits perfectly.</li>
            <li> Completely adjustable and much more comfortable than the type that fits on the top of your foot.  </li>
            <li> This one was better than some that I have seen and it was not horribly uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> So far I am very pleased and hope these aid in fixing my problem.</li>
            <li> She outgrew those and we thought we should try these first and glad we did.</li>
            <li> Seemed Ok at first.</li>
            <li> After just two nights sleeping with the boot, my foot felt much better when standing on it first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li> but it was so worth the money!</li>
            <li> My plantar fasciitis was caused primarily by weighing too darn much, plus moving into a house with mostly hardwood floors and walking around barefoot/in socks without foot support.  </li>
            <li> I honestly was only able to wear this splint about 3 times.</li>
            <li> She had such great success with hers, so I ordered this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also stays clean this way</li>
            <li> It is easy to snap on and off and is pretty comfortable to wear at night.  </li>
            <li> I have replaced it, more or less successfully, with a piece of nylon cord.</li>
            <li> The straps are all adjustable, so make sure it fits snuggly first, then use the quick release clips to put on and take off the splint.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is an excellent product that really works and does so for a fraction of the cost of other splints.</li>
            <li> Specially when you want to turn side to side.</li>
            <li> this special boot is made in order to relief the pain caused by the plantar fascitis.</li>
            <li> My doctor told me these splints would help my feet and relieve the pain from plantar fascitis, and she was RIGHT!</li>
            <li> The price is right and the item works, they got it to me quick also!</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m an extremely sound sleeper and, thanks to my Sleep Number bed, I rarely turn or move more than once during the night.  </li>
            <li> I bought this item only because the price was good</li>
            <li> Now I guess after 15 months I was bound to get better or is it coincidence that when I started wearing this product that I have really improved.  </li>
            <li> Cool item</li>
            <li> I can wear it better on the foot that doesn&#x27;t have as much pain.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this after trying a one size fits all from the drugstore that really didn&#x27;t fit all!</li>
            <li> Short of getting a removable cast that is custom fit to my leg, this thing is the best at the thigns I&#x27;ve tried for holding my foot at enough of an angle.</li>
            <li> I would have to make really lose to not wake me up, but this boot I could adjust and it doesn&#x27;t irritate the top of my foot, or squeeze my toes.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve reached the break-even point where the inconvenience of the splint (although not bad) outweighs the benefit I get.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to be more active again because I no longer have to wonder if my feet will be able to take me where I need to go.</li>
            <li> It took at least 2 weeks of wearing before I experienced much comfort, but my PF was really severe, causing great difficulty walking.</li>
            <li> Other than that - great job ...</li>
            <li> received the Bird &amp; Cronin yesterday and can echo other reviewers&#x27; comments that it seems well-constructed, well-thought-out, lightweight-but-sturdy, and a great buy at twenty-something.  </li>
            <li> Im finding that I&#x27;m staying on my back or my side more and more now.</li>
            <li> it arrived quickly and well packed.  </li>
            <li> But am surprised that so many people said it was comfortable.  </li>
            <li> A quick note for those who just want size information:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how quickly this splint started alleviating the symptoms of my PF.</li>
            <li> I find the B&amp;C splint to be comfortably padded and very much like the fact that it is adjustable.  </li>
            <li> I bought a cheap, used pair to try them out first, and I had IMMEDIATE RELIEF that very first night.  </li>
            <li> So I tighten this strap as much as comfortable so that my ankle can&#x27;t bend and separate from the device much.  </li>
            <li> You all really found this comfortable?</li>
            <li> The smooth plastic slides around under the sheets and really doesn&#x27;t bother me when I turn.</li>
            <li> Of the several things I&#x27;ve tried for plantar fasciitis, this one seems most effective so far.  </li>
            <li> Was this product worth it?  </li>
            <li> If you can stand to wear it, I would say it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I can definitely get a nice stretch with this splint.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like having a cast on but worth it.</li>
            <li> I have wide feet at EE, and this fit nicely.    </li>
            <li> but I do think it is worth trying.</li>
            <li> I needs far more padding on both the bottom and on the straps.</li>
            <li> When she opened the box, she laughed laughed out loud because of the ridiculous thought of wearing this ski-boot-look-a-like around the house and to bed.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to wear the splint more than 2 nights because of other issues.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and was exactly as stated.</li>
            <li> But you have to experiment and find just the right amount of tension in all the straps.  </li>
            <li> At some point I may see a podiatrist but for right now this is sufficient.    </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t fully figure out the right adjustment for me with all the straps (3 of them).  </li>
            <li> where I could get 2 fingers side-by-side under the straps, was just about right.</li>
            <li> I had a stress fracture on my right foot and started getting cramps and locked calf when I ran.</li>
            <li> it is not made for the right.</li>
            <li> but my toes go right over the edge.</li>
            <li> So instead, I found a way to wrap my foot in an ace bandage so that it stayed at a right angle all night.</li>
            <li> My toes do not hang over but are right at the front of the splint.</li>
            <li> I just have to find the right time/place to wear it.</li>
            <li> Cannot seem to get the straps right to keep my foot in correct position without falling asleep.</li>
            <li> I suspect many folks just stopped using it after the first couple of near mishaps.</li>
            <li> I then got the small size and this is the good fit.</li>
            <li> But wearing it while awake (as long as you don&#x27;t try to walk on it) does really allow good stretching of the plantar fascia.</li>
            <li> It is nicely padded and comfortable on the leg, and the non-skid padding on the bottom is a great feature if you need to do a few little steps with it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried stuffing the heel to make the angle less acute, but then the straps didn&#x27;t fit, and it still hurt me.</li>
            <li> I have a very small and narrow women&#x27;s size 6 foot and was able to adjust it to fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> While my feet will still hurt after excessive use, they have improved greatly.</li>
            <li> easy to use and put on, holds in place all night long, easy to adjust to foot and leg, works well</li>
            <li> This splint is a GREAT value, the only thing I found to be important, (as it was suggested in other reviews I read on this product before purchasing it), you need to get your ankle and foot straps adjusted for comfort.</li>
            <li> very very sturdy.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this splint for about a month now to combat a pretty severe case of plantar fasciitis and want to update you on the effectiveness and my experience with it.  </li>
            <li> First of all the product.  </li>
            <li> The middle strap (goes kind of over your ankle) is important in that it keeps your foot in the proper position.  </li>
            <li> This is just what finally worked fairly comfortably and effectively for me, your experience might be different.  </li>
            <li> I had immediate relief for that \\&quot;first step\\&quot; in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it will.  </li>
            <li> The top strap was too short</li>
            <li> , I did find the padding soft and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> This product is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> My insurance company payed a lot more money to buy me a very similar boot.  </li>
            <li> However, I have only been able to wear it a couple hours in bed before I decide it&#x27;s bothering me</li>
            <li> nice fit for small foot.</li>
            <li> Wearing them just once set me back almost a week in progress, by allowing me to overpronate even more, so I got rid of them.  </li>
            <li> She said that after the first 2-3 hours, it began to bother her foot to the point she couldn&#x27;t sleep.  </li>
            <li> I am an avid walker/hiker/gym goer and &amp;#34;resting&amp;#34; for a month is not an option.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t last more than 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> The first night almost all the pain was gone when I got up in the morning.</li>
            <li> but it was way more $$ but basically the same thing.</li>
            <li> I can only wear this for at most 4 hours per night and then I end up waking up from pain in the ball of my foot and taking it off.  </li>
            <li> It is Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not &#x27;uncomfortable&#x27; - just bulky.</li>
            <li> ;-)))  </li>
            <li> is already at an angle higher than 90 degrees (she said something about it&#x27;s being like a ski boot; I&#x27;d say my splint probably is at 100 degrees).  </li>
            <li> For the first week, no matter how I adjusted them, the straps would constrict my circulation and the resulting pain in my foot would wake me up about 3 hours after I&#x27;dgone to sleep, and I would have to take the splint off for the rest of the night.  </li>
            <li> I would have marked them five star if it werent for the cheap material that they are lined with.</li>
            <li> This splint really has helped me!</li>
            <li> That first step out of bed in the morning is no longer agonizing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not uncomfortable to sleep with, though it will feel cumbersome at first.  </li>
            <li> In the meantime, I will continue with the night splint as it does help in the mornings when I first start to walk.  </li>
            <li> I first night I slept in this</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this!!</li>
            <li> This is a good tough easy to adjust night splint.</li>
            <li> It really put me on the right path to recovery from plantar fascitis.</li>
            <li> It is kind of hot, and it&#x27;s kind of uncomfortable, but it seems to do the trick regardless.</li>
            <li> I have had PF for several months, and icing, compression, massage, etc. wasn&#x27;t doing much to make things better.</li>
            <li> second requirement of putting less pressure on the top of the foot is why I chose this Bird &amp; Cronin splint over the Active Ankle dorsal splint (they were my top two choices after looking over most of the options that Amazon sells), because the Active Ankle one looks like it requires more from the top of the foot.  </li>
            <li> I can put it on my left with no problems and it fits, but it wont fit my right</li>
            <li> No fault of the splint but a sure sign that it&#x27;s going to be a long time healing.</li>
            <li> My plantar fasciitis is being very stubborn about going away, but this boot does allow me to walk first thing in the morning without pain.  </li>
            <li> I tried pretty much from icing it,rolling it,stretching and nothing seem to work.</li>
            <li> so I switched to the large.  </li>
            <li> My foot size is \\&quot;around\\&quot; 10 or so, I would suggest going to the large if you have any question.    </li>
            <li> It is a large plastic boot you wear to bed</li>
            <li> Before I got the splint, I had a lump in my heel about the size of a large marble.</li>
            <li> To large for a women 7 size foot.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another issue is that they were somewhat difficult to put on and off but that ends up being a positive because this splint does a very good job of rigidly holding your foot in place unlike the Futuro splints</li>
            <li> so I tried the Bird &amp; Cronin splint and found it to be much more effective than the Futuro over-the-top splint.</li>
            <li> your foot is straight up and doing the stretching.</li>
            <li> but nothing was really working.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect it to work.  </li>
            <li> According to the diagram that came with the brace, your entire foot (including toes) should fit on the sole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> as I really want to do everything I can to get rid of the pain in my foot.</li>
            <li> Any splint for PF will place unusual pressure on some part of the leg or foot; there&#x27;s just no way around it.  </li>
            <li> This is really helping stretch out my foot.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very well made.</li>
            <li> really need ability to walk or stand up with this device as well.</li>
            <li> I feel it is really helping with my pain.</li>
            <li> but the boot really works.</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend this product!</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s really helping.</li>
            <li> I found the straps very itchy</li>
            <li> I could see it working if you didn&#x27;t want to sleep in it, but I really need something that will work overnight.</li>
            <li> This splint has really helped.</li>
            <li> Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated</li>
            <li> It has really helped my planter fasciitis by wearing it at night.  </li>
            <li> Buy it if you have this problem because it really works.</li>
            <li> Otherwise I really like the brace.</li>
            <li> It is reasonable and seems to be doing the job.  </li>
            <li> They were better quality than we expected for the price.  </li>
            <li> and my foot spent more time at 75 degrees than 90.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t catch in the sheets that much (thankfully, I can wear the small-size splint, which helps).  </li>
            <li> So much cheaper than the Orthopedics office.</li>
            <li> This is a really well made splint.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!  </li>
            <li> I wore them for about a month straight</li>
            <li> its really help my shin and ankle muscle, i have very hight arch feet.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> and it has really helped me get over my plantar fascitis--which I have had for a year now.  </li>
            <li> that straight and I&lt;br /&gt;have</li>
            <li> it straight.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for me, had to return.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable enough</li>
            <li> I have very muscular legs for a woman and</li>
            <li> I was having very severe pain in my heel.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get comfortable enough with it to fall asleep.</li>
            <li> I had to gradually get used to wearing it the whole night.</li>
            <li> This splint has been very helpful in reducing pain</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly convinced that the overnight stretch did at least speed the process.  </li>
            <li> I use this splint several hours a day, most days, while I&#x27;m sedentary, and I crank up the stretch as far as it will go.</li>
            <li> fixed my fasciitis!!!</li>
            <li> I have the one on the toes right, but the ankle strap makes my foot fall asleep, so I am clearly tighening too much and will continue to fiddle around with it.  </li>
            <li> The pain was mainly caused by too much pressure on the ball of my foot.  </li>
            <li> next morning, removal, a few stretches and... amazing!  </li>
            <li> I ordered the small because I have tiny feet (size 6) and its great.</li>
            <li> I found my Sketcher Shape-Ups (which I once loved) seriously aggravated the condition.  </li>
            <li> It is OK for quick trips to the door (let pets in/out) and other short in-home nighttime excursions, despite the warning against walking in it per the directions.  </li>
            <li> First off, I have only one complaint with the seller and that is probably my own fault: they need to put more emphasis on pointing out that these aren&#x27;t pairs - they are only one item, so if you have the problem in both feet you have to buy 2.</li>
            <li> Time will tell how durable it is (notwithstanding my naughty walking with it on) but the price is quite reasonable so as long as it lasts a year, I&#x27;ll consider it a good investment.</li>
            <li> Much lighter and not as tight fitting as the orthopedic prescribed walking boot</li>
            <li> Overall, this is very comfortable for such a seemingly bulky item.</li>
            <li> This is possibly something I&#x27;m going to have to wear for a relatively long time to come, and I&#x27;m confident that this is having a positive effect on my plantar fasciitis.</li>
            <li> less restricting that I like more.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine the more expensive versions being much better.</li>
            <li> This is Ok but big: it does not hold the foot well enough.</li>
            <li> They work better than anything else I have used and are the only ones that don&#x27;t wake me up in the middle of the night wanting to throw them off.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that once you set the velcro in place you can use the plastic tabs and not have to mess with the velcro setting.  </li>
            <li> My podiatrist gave me a cheap version of this boot, but it never fit right</li>
            <li> I need to make sure that the straps are not too tight though.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brace for folks suffering as I did.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> And at such a reasonable price!!</li>
            <li> The bottom strap (over the top of your foot) is not as important in positioning as long as the middle ankle strap is correct, and I have that one quite loose.  </li>
            <li> I wear a size 7/7.5 and have a wide foot and the splint can barely fit on my foot.  </li>
            <li> I also have wide calves so the adjustable straps need to be let out a lot to fit my foot/ankle.  </li>
            <li> It took so much ibuprofen to treat my pain that I developed stomach issues.</li>
            <li> This splint is very well constructed and durable; it is a lot better than the Futuro plantar fasciitis splints which I tried in the past.  </li>
            <li> Worth a try at the unbelievably low Amazon price.</li>
            <li> I will give this product a try for few more months to see if my problem can be cured.</li>
            <li> I rarely have pain now and have gone to wearing the brace only 2-3 nights per week!</li>
            <li> However, this is really great for wearing while sitting down in the evening for a few hours.</li>
            <li> , the brace didn&#x27;t tussle much with it, but I have now switched over to my winter weight duvet (12 tog) and they are battling more with each other, which does wake me up occasionally during the night.  </li>
            <li> After 2 weeks my right foot is almost back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I gave this to my sister and right after the 1st 2 nights with only a couple of hours of use she immediately felt the difference.</li>
            <li> was a gift to a friend because i ordered wrong size and knew someone who could use very nicely made</li>
            <li> I have small feet and BIG calves, and I couldn&#x27;t get this brace to fit me comfortably.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t sleep comfortably at the increased stretch but for short durations it seems extra helpful.</li>
            <li> believe the \\&quot;Small\\&quot; would only fit only up to a  women&#x27;s size 6-1/2!  </li>
            <li> My best wishes to everyone who suffers from this condition, it has a very big impact on lifestyle.</li>
            <li> I am able to walk, not limp or crawl, into the shower each morning and find I have far less pain during the day.  </li>
            <li> I was getting a small amount of relief after about a week of wearing the boot, but I was finding that even with all the straps and support, my foot was still able to find a somewhat relaxed , sleep position, so</li>
            <li> I first tried the Futuro splint because I happened to find it in a local CVS.</li>
            <li> During the day if I walk more than an hour the sharp pain will come back.</li>
            <li> I started out the first night waking after two hours of sleep and taking the thing off, second night lasted 4 hours, etc.  </li>
            <li> Impossible to secure on your own on the right foot as the clips are paced low outer side of the boot.</li>
            <li> The pain in the left heel went away on its own after a month but the right foot kept getting worse, almost crippling in the morning and after sitting for extended periods of time.  </li>
            <li> The splint is extremely well made, light, comfortable, gives a serious (but fully adjustable) stretch, slides underneath the covers easily, doesn&#x27;t scratch or bother my husband while we sleep, and the padded straps don&#x27;t rub or scratch me, no matter how long it&#x27;s on.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that after wearing it to bed for a few nights my plantar fashiatis is almost gone, I wake up with very little pain, and with stretching and icing I have avoided having to get cortisone shots, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I am in the medical field and am on my feet and on the move all day long, and I am feeling a huge difference.</li>
            <li> As far as the side straps, pull them tighter to increase the stretch, generally just a gentle stretch is all you need.  </li>
            <li> This brace really helps my plantar facitis but am only able to wear it for short periods due to friction on bottom of foot.</li>
            <li> It is even better than the podiatrist&#x27;s because it is a small and hid medium was really too big.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this night splint for just two consecutive nights so far, but just in that short time I am feeling a positive difference.</li>
            <li> was that I had to tighten the strap so tight around the middle of my foot that it caused the top of my foot to redden and bruise.  </li>
            <li> Its a little bulky and takes some getting used to in order to sleep comfortably</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from plantar fascitis since the summer of 2011, when at first I thought I had just bruised my heel, only after months of not healing I started researching and came to realize it was much more serious.</li>
            <li> Still, a 3-star review because this is clearly a high-quality, well-constructed item.</li>
            <li> But I fixed it by rolling up a couple of socks and placing them under my arch.  </li>
            <li> what I did was raid my sewing fabric stash for some soft fleece.</li>
            <li> Because my job is 90% sedentary, I&#x27;ve taken to frequently wearing the splint while I&#x27;m working.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn it for nearly a month now</li>
            <li> I need a different support that doesn&#x27;t pull the foot so much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn it three nights so far</li>
            <li> It has plenty of ventilation so your feet don&#x27;t sweat, and has soft foam padding against your skin.</li>
            <li> Although it is bulky, it did hold my foot firmly, but comfortable.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine had gotten her splint directly from her doc</li>
            <li> It is almost identical to the $300 professional splint at a fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with how lightweight these are.</li>
            <li> There are times when I forget about the pain completely.  </li>
            <li> These are for our 7 year old daughter in-toeing.</li>
            <li> I still felt I was getting some good out of it, but it was disappointing not to use it the whole night through.  </li>
            <li> As a side sleeper, I had a difficult time finding a position where the weight of the splint didn&#x27;t bother my good foot.  </li>
            <li> Within a week of wearing it my daughter was back to normal!</li>
            <li> I opted for this splint over any of the ones that go on the top of your foot because I still have weird nerve pain and tingling on the top of my foot and the other style would&#x27;ve irritated that.</li>
            <li> As someone who is a regular exerciser, it&#x27;s next to torture to not be able to be as active.  </li>
            <li> Lastly, in the beginning, Alleve (only one tab) was the only thing that would get me through the night, because everything else wore off too quickly.    </li>
            <li> I have not been able to spend an entire night with it; I usually end up taking it off during the night</li>
            <li> A little cumbersome and takes a few days to get used to wearing to sleep in, but fabulous product!!</li>
            <li> I still wear this all night and things are finally improving and almost healed completely!!</li>
            <li> a poster mentioned that you don&#x27;t have to sleep with it super tight.  </li>
            <li> I decided to look for a brace that uses hard plastic as a splint material and which might provide resistance from below the foot more, and pull down on the top of the foot less, than</li>
            <li> You can always work to a greater stretch with time and patience but it will be useless if you push things too far or too fast and cause additional discomfort that deters you from wearing the splint.</li>
            <li> my foot seems to be the largest that would fit this size small.  </li>
            <li> The small is supposed to fit up to a women&#x27;s 7.5, but my toes hang a bit over the edge.  </li>
            <li> I use it on really likes to spasm when seated for a long time which aggravates the plantar fasciitis</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m beginning to have hope that maybe I CAN get back to a somewhat normal life.</li>
            <li> I normally wear a size 7.5 shoe and if your foot is any bigger than that go to the M.</li>
            <li> I certainly didn&#x27;t have to use the side straps to pull my foot any further towards my knee, so I left them slack.  </li>
            <li> We live overseas and use mosquito nets and it gets all tangled up in the net</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update this review if I have any major breakthroughs.    </li>
            <li> I had three major issues with this brace.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s an avid athlete and never had the patience to give her feet a break from running and other activities.  </li>
            <li> The flexion of the foot is pretty extreme.  </li>
            <li> The splint is too tall for my leg and hits it right at the center back of my calf.</li>
            <li> I prefer an extreme stretch, so I can&#x27;t sleep with it on for more than a few hours, BUT this has NOTHING to do with the splint.  </li>
            <li> My pain is so much better in the right foot that I can now really see how bad my left foot hurts too.</li>
            <li> I am confused do these fit a left and right foot, are they the same?</li>
            <li> some said the small splint was fine while some said it was too short.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t hard to adjust to fit.</li>
            <li> a hard time getting comfortable because I feel like I have to</li>
            <li> I coudn&#x27;t put it in a manner that will fit me right, If I put snug I end up removing it during the night coz I get numbed bec of poor circulation, when I put it loose</li>
            <li> Seeing what when into this and the quality of the construction, I&#x27;m surprised the price is so low.</li>
            <li> I do wish I had one with a soft underside, though, so I could just get up and walk when I have to in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too early to rate the overall effectiveness of this product.</li>
            <li> The straps running from the top of the brace cuff to the footbed attached right where my pinkie and big toe joints sit, putting pressure on the joints and causing those portions of my foot to go numb.  </li>
            <li> They looked pretty uncomfortable and even with all of the positive reviews, I still didn&#x27;t believe it would make much of a difference</li>
            <li> I have been having trouble with fascitis in my right foot since April.  </li>
            <li> I have small (size 6 1/2) feet and the futuro dorsal model cut off all circulation due to pressure on the top of my arch.  </li>
            <li> The top strap keeps the thing from sliding up and down and as such I have that one somewhat tight.  </li>
            <li> You should be doing other things to help your condition, like stretches (bent knee and straight) and exercises like toe \\&quot;scrunches,\\&quot; periodically throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> If you change these side straps much, you will need to adjust the other 3.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it has been very helpful in alleveing pain.</li>
            <li> pull the foot bend straps pretty tight and then</li>
            <li> It really helps to keep the fibers in the foot stretched, and there is not that big initial pain in the foot when stepping on your foot for the first time after not using it for a few hours.</li>
            <li> It certainly helped with the extreme discomfort and for that I would definitely recommend it.  </li>
            <li> This brace places pressure on the forefoot-- particularly if you like an extreme stretch, as I do-- and this creates a pressure point on the ball of my foot.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the smalled size it was still too big for me, it costed 9$ for the product and $8 for delivery, when I asked to retunr to the product I was told that they would deduct a restocking fee, NOT refund the shipping and didnt even send a return shipping label, so If i returned the product at my own cost, it would have costed me atleast 10$ to send it back and would have probably been retunred $7, I decided not to send the product back, its lying in my closet useless because I cant use it.</li>
            <li> This morning, heel pain was less intense.  </li>
            <li> so it is much easier and less cumbersome to sleep in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that it helped with my (near) cure, but it certainly wasn&#x27;t a good thing to allow that ligament to tighten up so badly every night.  </li>
            <li> When the splint is worn nightly it starts to cause issues with other parts of your foot as it is not in a normal position.  </li>
            <li> Both mornings after its use, and throughout the whole day, I had little to no pain in my foot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve talked with a few other people who&#x27;ve had PF and they confirmed that it&#x27;s a long healing process, and can take up to a year.  </li>
            <li> For most people, the Bird &amp; Cronin splint looks like it would be less comfortable to sleep in than the Active Ankle one (in terms of disturbing the sheets, making it hard to turn over, banging into the other limb, etc.), but I took a gamble that the Bird &amp; Cronin&#x27;s underside-only hard plastic would be more comfortable for my particular foot than the Active Ankle&#x27;s overfoot hard</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and, while it felt really awkward and strange wearing it the first night, I got used to is and had it on all night.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only a bit more awkward than the professional ones.</li>
            <li> for better or worse, small is still not small enough...</li>
            <li> But I figured that the medium must be a couple of inches longer than the small, and those extra inches would probably make a noticeable difference in terms of ease of sleeping in the boot (regarding catching on the sheets, banging into the other limb, ease of turning over, etc.), so I went with the small splint.  </li>
            <li> So I was wearing them for the first few weeks feeling like they were too loose.</li>
            <li> I have had for 3 years and would not be replacing now if not for the new puppy chewing off half the straps.  </li>
            <li> This brace is at least the right size for my foot, but the calf strap just isn&#x27;t long enough.</li>
            <li> At night, I wear adjustable arch bandages (actually, my feet are tiny, so I use futuro wrist bandages instead) to keep my arches gently stretched while I sleep.  </li>
            <li> The first time she got up and tried to walk the 15 feet to the bathroom she was nearly killed slipping on the floor.</li>
            <li> If too loose, your foot can position so that the ligament is not stretched properly and can tighten overnight.  </li>
            <li> Bought those other type booties with the velcro strap that pulls the toes up, they not only made my feet hot because they were enclosed, they jammed my toes together causing my toenails to cut into each other.</li>
            <li> At first it felt a little uncomfortable but not bad at all.</li>
            <li> whole thigh/leg rotates in (excessively flexible</li>
            <li> long story short</li>
            <li> it clears it up in no time flat.  </li>
            <li> It did seem like it did not keep foot flat.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not all the time and appears to be less frequent as time goes by.  </li>
            <li> so I could carefully walk the short distance to the bathroom and back to bed without removing it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But for now I consider my plantar fasciitis if not cured, at least very livable and tolerable.  </li>
            <li> It took a long time to get the injury</li>
            <li> I have a short leg and wide calf.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these in hopes it would help with my planter fascitis after my military basic training.</li>
            <li> I loosened the long straps and it helped.</li>
            <li> I have PF and thought this would keep my feet stretched out through the night.</li>
            <li> reviewer here said that the Bird &amp; Cronin splint when it&#x27;s empty and not pulled back by the side straps</li>
            <li> which frankly is a complete waste of time and money.  </li>
            <li> I get up multiple times and walk carefully in them across the hall to my baby&#x27;s room</li>
            <li> The toes are not completely inside the \\&quot;boot\\&quot; but this is how it should be.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;it seems to do the job: you can feel your fascia is stretched.</li>
            <li> I will do all the things that will promote healing and I look forward to a few months from now when I can start back in to my regular routine at the gym and outside.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had or used this for too long yet.  </li>
            <li> I think this may help me in the long run.  </li>
            <li> The main thing is that the plastic bottom of the splint prevents my foot from flexing too much in the wrong direction, even when the straps are relatively loose.  </li>
            <li> This item was broken right out of the box.  </li>
            <li> I tried this for several night and it didn&#x27;t help because you can&#x27;t make it tight enough to keep you foot flexed.</li>
            <li> I used this splint (along with 2 other items), and within a couple weeks I can FINALLY sleep again.      </li>
            <li> If I slept under a tucked-in top sheet (which is uncomfortable for my feet and legs even when no splint is involved!)</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it a 4 star rating was due to the boot being bulky when sleeping in it.  </li>
            <li> The last one I bought for me was more expensive than this and so poorly made I actually gave it away after only using it 2 nights.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually very comfy to wear and it is a big help for tired feet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now worn it 3 nights in a row on my right leg because that&#x27;s the leg with the worst pain: the first night all night long, but the 2nd and 3rd only about 2/3 of the night.</li>
            <li> I initially adjusted it too snugly and with too much of a stretch and found it uncomfortable after several hours.</li>
            <li> I had tried several others with no success.</li>
            <li> my foot is about 9 inches long - and the small splint fits me, but the boot extends only 1/4th inch above my toes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can walk without limping, even first thing in the morning, and my pain has greatly decreased.  </li>
            <li> but it is difficult to make it through a full night of sleep with it on.</li>
            <li> If you find you can point your toes downward, then this strap is probably too loose.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t give me the stretch or dorsiflex position since it&#x27;s loose</li>
            <li> medium size is too loose for a 7: the foot \\&quot;jiggle\\&quot; and tightening the straps will just \\&quot;cut\\&quot; the blood circulation, not hold the foot</li>
            <li> The only problem is keeping your heel down.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t tighten it enough because it just slides down you calf and lifts you foot out of the bottom and</li>
            <li> I might get a duvet cover that is \\&quot;slicker\\&quot; than my current ones, which would cut down on the friction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I suddenly came down with Plantar Fasciitis in both feet.  </li>
            <li> Really, I can&#x27;t say a single negative thing about the splint itself!    </li>
            <li> Now, if I wake up in advance, I try to remember to increase the stretch an hour or less before I actually have to get up.</li>
            <li> and I wake up and have to remove it--tricky when youâ€™re only half awake</li>
            <li> For the past 2 nights, I have kept it on for the entire time I was sleeping, but this was achieved only by generously reducing the strap tension, which gives my foot quite a bit of latitude to move around.  </li>
            <li> Thought the pressure from the plastic buckles and the cutting nature of the nylon straps would do me in the first night (which ultimately it did, I ripped it off in the middle of the night with no feeling in my foot).  </li>
            <li> the past few weeks, I&#x27;ve been using as an interim night brace a soft ankle brace that a relative of mine had used after ankle surgery.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has used these for a few years and just now are finally wearing down, but now she does not need them anymore, so they definitely helped stretch her calf muscles.</li>
            <li> but I caution that it&#x27;s not necessary to adjust the straps tightly.</li>
            <li> shoe size is 6.5 to 7, and I didn&#x27;t know if I should get the small Bird &amp; Cronin or the medium because there are several other reviews here by women who have a similar shoe size and</li>
            <li> I bought it for my wife and she could only wear it a little at a time.</li>
            <li> The buckles are hard to use for mature customers.</li>
            <li> and so the relief was minimal.</li>
            <li> Just not ready to stop wearing it yet.  </li>
            <li> She has worn it for about 2 - 3 hours per night for roughly 8 - 10 nights.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest going up a size if you are on the cusp between two size ranges, have wide feet or wide</li>
            <li> I tried to loosen, but there&#x27;s not much to loosen.</li>
            <li> This product is a total waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Not what i expected.</li>
            <li> then the one I got from my doc, only wear it  a few hours at night and it help a lot</li>
            <li> Ive used this splint for only a few days and feel it is making a difference in my pain caused by plantar fasciitis.</li>
            <li> Maybe because I&#x27;ve spent hundreds of dollars on inserts and shoes or maybe because I didn&#x27;t want to hurt my husband</li>
            <li> Received faster then expected.</li>
            <li> I have to be careful not to kick my husband while we&#x27;re sleeping...</li>
            <li> I finally just ended up wearing it for a few hours every evening then taking it off to sleep.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely not go a size up as some reviewers suggested.</li>
            <li> noted that the smaller Active Ankle splint was so large that it pressedon her foot in the wrong spot (the ball of her foot instead of the arch).]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The splint did help my fascitis however it is very uncomfortable to sleep in and needs to be made to be less confining to promote better sleep.</li>
            <li> so the issue of legs on top of each other concerned me, but it turned out not to be that bad.  </li>
            <li> I was wrong, you can&#x27;t tighten it very much or your circulation gets cutoff to you legs ankles and feet.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m hoping soon with the other steps, not quite yet.  </li>
            <li> very difficult to fit and put on.</li>
            <li> When I first took it out of the box I thought that it was really complicated</li>
            <li> I am a female with a size 8 shoe and the small fits well.</li>
            <li> We have tried all sorts of other methods for dealing with her plantar fasciitis, tape, lifts, cut out heels, inserts for shoes, you name it....  </li>
            <li> The small size seems to still be too big.  </li>
            <li> Kept hitting the other ankle because I&#x27;m a side sleeper.</li>
            <li> Therefore, I can see why some women who wear around 7 to 7.5 would find the small splint too short, and probably should go up to the medium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had PF as well, several times in the past.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews of them being too small for others with my size, but I prefered to try them smaller</li>
            <li> I was getting muscle cramps in other parts of my leg (</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m going to try to use this while watching a movie or taking a short nap - not during my usual night&#x27;s sleep.  </li>
            <li> Other kinds I have used</li>
            <li> I found that snug was too tight, but lightly loose,</li>
            <li> Then I broke down and purchased this night splint with not much hope.  </li>
            <li> and am very careful not to walk on any non-cushioned surface without these orthotics.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;[Regarding sizing, another reason I didn&#x27;t go for the Active Ankle dorsal splint</li>
            <li> She recently ran in an USMC Mud Run and could hardly walk afterwards due to the plantar fascitis.  </li>
            <li> It is not very comfortable due to being bulky, but it does work.</li>
            <li> They help a little but not much.  </li>
            <li> is that it&#x27;s only offered in two sizes as compared to Bird &amp; Cronin&#x27;s three sizes, and at least one reviewer of the Active Ankle splint who has feet around my size</li>
            <li> The first night on was alright, a little uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> The boot fit well and helps to ease that painful morning &amp;#34;first step&amp;#34; out of bed.</li>
            <li> Plantar fasciitis is not fun, and this splint does what it is advertised to do.</li>
            <li> It has provoked a negative response in my plantar fasciitis that I hope is only temporary.</li>
            <li> and itâ€™s dark.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that if I awake during the night and have to use the restroom, it has to be removed.  </li>
            <li> It works but the whole thing is so bulky that it feel like my foot is in a cast which makes for an uncomfortable nights sleep.  </li>
            <li> Even with a thick sock I couldn&#x27;t tighten the straps enough to hold my foot in place.</li>
            <li> I am back to longer daily walks with my dog again, which sadly had fallen off dramatically.</li>
            <li> so they would be less bulky.</li>
            <li> It does work in the fact that I have substantially less tightness and pain in my calf in the morning, if I can manage to wear it through the night.</li>
            <li> This boot keeps you from twisting or stretching your foot in your sleep and unconsciously reinjuring the plantar fascia, keeping your ankle slightly flexed .</li>
            <li> Almost identical to the one they offered me at the foot &amp; ankle clinic at less than half the price.  </li>
            <li> i find it hard to wear for long stretches of time.</li>
            <li> Did not fit around upper calf so unfortunately sending back.</li>
            <li> A couple of nights I pulled them too tight and</li>
            <li> One night I strapped the ankle too tight and awoke in pain.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not too tight but still doing the job.</li>
            <li> However, the tight straps caused numbness.</li>
            <li> The straps are as tight as they can go and I can still move around.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to get a tight fit on these without being very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> The only negative about the small size that says it fits up to a women&#x27;s 7.5.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a steroid shot and a prescription anti-inflammatory for 6 months with little relief.  </li>
            <li> A little sturdier than this one but for what I needed it for..splint at night..</li>
            <li> I can walk with little pain.  </li>
            <li> They are a little bulky but</li>
            <li> Has a little increased tension on the  tendon.</li>
            <li> I end up taking it off in the middle of the night cause it makes my toes go numb and is super uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> They are not comfortable to sleep in</li>
            <li> Over the course of a few days I managed to sleep with it all night.  </li>
            <li> IT IS NOT COMFORTABLE FOR PROLONGED USE.  </li>
            <li> It adjusts well for my 6.5 inch narrow foot.</li>
            <li> I prefer to wear it for a few hours in the evening rather than eight hours while I sleep.</li>
            <li> I think night braces are a waste...</li>
            <li> Did not fit but also did not feel like it was helping</li>
            <li> However, it was NOT comfortable for me.  </li>
            <li> I obtained a block under my desk, put the ball of my foot on it and let the weight of my leg keep my heel in an L-shape to my leg, and that gives me a few hours a day of the stretching I need.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not comfortable sleeping in it, but I wear it during the day when I&#x27;m working at the computer.  </li>
            <li> that I started wearing heels again to work a few days a week.</li>
            <li> I wear tall socks with them because I hate the cheap feel of the lining on my feet.</li>
            <li> That worked for me (again, PF resolved in a few weeks, no problem since).</li>
            <li> Wasted money.</li>
            <li> One of the straps that held up toes broke -- you cannot walk with the splint on -- straps are not that heavy duty to take the stress.</li>
            <li> It does not fit well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much impossible to walk in the boot, though, so</li>
            <li> (this boot is stiff).</li>
            <li> small Bird &amp; Cronin splint measures approximately 9 and 1/4 inches internally, where the foot goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But because I had been in a cast and walker boot, my calf is unbelievably thin, and this splints strap around the calf cannot go small enough.</li>
            <li> NOT TRUE!  </li>
            <li> I wear a ladies 5 shoe, and although the length of the small is still a little longer than my foot, it doesn&#x27;t impact how this works.</li>
            <li> , I wear a women&#x27;s size 7 and the small one is too small, my toes are hanging half out.</li>
            <li> Impossible to use on your left foot unless you are double jointed, have 4 arms, or have someone to help put it on.</li>
            <li> I have had the Bird and Cronin Plantar Fascitis splint (sz small) for just a few days.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t keep your feet in the position that it needs to, unless it is on very tightly, which then cuts off the blood circulation in your legs.</li>
            <li> Hmmm, not sure</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, that doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> Just got these and ordered a Small because the description states that \\&quot;Small\\&quot; fits up to women&#x27;s size 7-1/2.  </li>
            <li> &quot; size DOES NOT fit!  </li>
            <li> I AM NOT ABLE TO &#x27;SLEEP&#x27; IN THE SPLINT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only sorry we didn&#x27;t buy something sooner....</li>
            <li> Also remember, tighter is not better, took me a couple nights to get it comfy</li>
            <li> On one occasion, my foot actually fell asleep and it was quite uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Small size footing fits my size 6 feet.</li>
            <li> They do run small in size and I have a small foot</li>
            <li> so have a small towel over my leg</li>
            <li> A bit bulky and not sure if it is stretching my feet.</li>
            <li> Initially I was unable to sleep well</li>
            <li> I am a women&#x27;s 6 1/2 and ordered a size small...</li>
            <li> I have small feet.</li>
            <li> Not sure why, i tighten straps and still foot slides forward.</li>
            <li> Because of that I am not sure I am getting the desired stretch required to side in healing my plantar fasciitis.</li>
            <li> Not able to use at night but wear it while watching TV.</li>
            <li> After 4 months of morning heel pain, no more.</li>
            <li> only thing is that you have to wear socks while using it because the straps get uncomfortable after a while.</li>
            <li> , if you wear a ladies&#x27; 7 to a 7.5 shoe, you might wish to get the medium boot, rather than the small (even though the manufacturer says that the small fits up to a 7.5 women&#x27;s foot).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried these in a small, and I am about a size 7-7.5.</li>
            <li> Not sure if a stomach sleeper could use this and still get a night&#x27;s sleep.  </li>
            <li> &#x3D; small not medium!&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from PF for the past five months.  </li>
            <li> I wear a size 7 shoe and the small size fits my foot to a tee.  </li>
            <li> How can we not LOVE it when this pair cost $40.</li>
            <li> I wear a woman&#x27;s size 7-7 1/2 shoe, and the sizing recommendations for a small are correct.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> But can see it being too small if you sometime go to a 71/2.</li>
            <li> This boot is very stiff.  </li>
            <li> I have a bad case of plantar fasciitis (started in one foot, developed in both!)</li>
            <li> We both have had a really hard time keeping it on all night.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Latches are a bit hard to release.&lt;br /&gt;Needs</li>
            <li> /&gt;How can anyone sleep with a hard plastic thing strapped to their leg?  </li>
            <li> I returned, to hard to sleep with it on</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bulky and made from hard plastic-</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t five start not because the product itself has any problems but because it is just so hard to sleep in that thing.</li>
            <li> At least it hasnt been in my case.</li>
            <li> I had never heard of the injury until it was too late.    </li>
            <li> In the meantime, I would recommend it highly at least for relief of morning pain.    </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wish to pull my foot up farther than 90 degrees, at least for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> Since wearing this splint for 4 weeks my PF as improved by at least 75%.</li>
            <li> ) I used this I again woke up in the middle of the night trying desperately to remove this harness as my circulation was being cut off and</li>
            <li> so I forced myself to use it.</li>
            <li> However, because my foot \\&quot;wants\\&quot; to go to about 50 degrees when I&#x27;m sleeping (toes pointed and foot facing downwards on the mattress), the interim brace forced some extension of the fascia, and I could tell that some healing was taking place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a very uncomfortable condition anyway, so the boot is probably a necessary annoyance.  </li>
            <li> After my first pregnancy, I had very bad plantar fasciitus.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, because the splint DOES work, I find it difficult to go without it because everything begins to tighten up again shortly after removing it.</li>
            <li> too bad you can&#x27;t walk on it, you know, the middle of the night bathroom walks...</li>
            <li> Cons: Very difficult to keep the stretched calf without having to tighten all 3 straps.</li>
            <li> I know I should be avoiding heels, but it is hard to do!</li>
            <li> I just try very hard not to put excess stress on the splint when I do so.</li>
            <li> but my plantar fasciitis was getting worse</li>
            <li> But, I could never get the straps adjusted correctly,  I could fall asleep but would wake within a few hours with my foot completely numb.  </li>
            <li> I am not happy with the product.  </li>
            <li> It has a thin rubber pad on the bottom</li>
            <li> I can wear it for approximately four hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no longer wearing the splint but am keeping it around in case it gets worse again.</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m a dancer with an extremely flexible Achilles tendon, but this brace was so painful</li>
            <li> The bottom one if too tight is very uncomfortable and cuts off circulation in my case.  </li>
            <li> I hate that I resisted so long.</li>
            <li> Sleeping with it does make my plantar fasciitis less painful in the mornings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from PF for almost a year now, and Ive gone thru shots, stretching, excerises and expensive custom orthotics, but to no avail.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m putting this review on all sizes of this product, sorry for any redundancy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve adjusted the straps and it is all wrong for me.  </li>
            <li> and it is not that difficult to sleep in the splint.  </li>
            <li> But with the wrong angle, it&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> This was a bit difficult to sleep in.  </li>
            <li> It works, but it is really uncomfortable to sleep with.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical but am now a believer.  </li>
            <li> One of the rivets was not correctly installed, thereby making it useless.</li>
            <li> I could not wear this at night, which it what I bought it for; it&#x27;s too uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It is padded, so it isn&#x27;t too uncomfortable while sleeping.</li>
            <li> Difficult to sleep in.</li>
            <li> I find it difficult to sleep in.</li>
            <li> Sometimes after a long day on my feet if it&#x27;s especially painful i find that putting this on helps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this to bed for approximately two weeks,  I also use sometimes when I&#x27;m watching tv because I tend to sit with my legs crossed which is bad.</li>
            <li> totally uncomfortable, is something is this uncomfortable how can it be helpful?!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed as they were very hard to sleep in.</li>
            <li> Very round, very painful.</li>
            <li> ive had to work up to using it for longer periods as the positioning that it has your foot in makes my toes numb after a bit.</li>
            <li> I plan on cutting off the buckle straps permanently and using this method.  </li>
            <li> It looked so uncomfortable!  </li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed, and slightly angry at the pain it&#x27;s caused.</li>
            <li> Very uncomfortable to sleep when the tip of your foot is pushed up.</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to sleep with as you are not used to have something strapped around our foot.</li>
            <li> I use when I sleeping and its very uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> I could not put any weight at all on my bad foot.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as bad as before (about like after an hour or two nap) but gradually worsened.  </li>
            <li> I have bad tendonitis of my achilles tendon.  </li>
            <li> I purchased 2 of these splints when my plantar fasciitis flared up so bad that the burning in my heels was keeping me awake at night.  </li>
            <li> I have a bad heel spur/plantar fasciitis that started in spring of 2009.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not so bad in the morning.</li>
            <li> Plantar fascitis is painful but with the boot no pain in mornings.</li>
            <li> Terrible finish and poor workmanship.</li>
            <li> It might work, but after fighting to get it buckled on for 45 minutes I found the device too painful to leave on.</li>
            <li> and it gets painful sometimes,</li>
            <li> Hate these, they are not practical and very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> It makes for very awkward walking</li>
            <li> That design was basically worthless</li>
            <li> Unlike the rather worthless Futuro splint, this B&amp;C splint allows you to adjust the degree of stretch by tightening or loosening two Velcro straps.</li>
            <li> I WOULD RECOMMEND IT FOR PLANTAR FASCIITIS WHICH IS A MISERABLE AND PAINFUL CONDITION.</li>
            <li> The strap over the foot is very painful.  </li>
            <li> I tried all the stretching, ibuprophen, and massage, but nothing helped and it was very painful in both feet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed!</li>
            <li> The pain is terrible and unrelenting.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> totally uncomfortable, is something is this uncomfortable how can it be helpful?!</li>
            <li> Great product to help with plantar fasciitis and heel spur problem.  Great alternative to buying a strassburg sock!  I purchased two &amp; I used them at nighttime when I feel the pain getting aggravated.  By using them at bedtime, they&#x27;ve brought some great relief to feet in the morning.  Product was packaged well &amp; delivered in a timely manner. Definitely will order again.</li>
            <li> I have been having trouble with fascitis in my right foot since April.  I have tried everything.  Tennis balls, golf balls, frozen water bottles, foot taped daily for a week, shoes &amp; orthodics and several doctors working on my foot and still can&#x27;t get rid of the pain.  I decided to try sleeping in the splints to see if that will make things better but hasn&#x27;t helped yet.  They are not comfortable to sleep in but if they are doing the necessary stretching then I need to keep working with them.  I don&#x27;t do well sleeping on my back and you need to so your foot is straight up and doing the stretching.</li>
            <li> Very uncomfortable to sleep when the tip of your foot is pushed up. Specially when you want to turn side to side.</li>
            <li> I have been battling plantar fascitis  for 15 months.  I&#x27;ve tried everything. Custom inserts, icing, stretching, massaging, shots, etc. but nothing was really working. I bought this item only because the price was good and I figured that I have nothing to lose.  I really didn&#x27;t expect it to work.  My thought was that I would use this while watching TV and reading.  I had no intention of sleeping with it.  It looked so uncomfortable!  But, I read the reviews here on Amazon and a poster mentioned that you don&#x27;t have to sleep with it super tight.  I took this advice and figured I would try it for an hour or two.  Over the course of a few days I managed to sleep with it all night.  And guess what, my foot pain has improved.  Now I guess after 15 months I was bound to get better or is it coincidence that when I started wearing this product that I have really improved.  Hmmm, not sure but I sure am happy to have some relief from heel pain. I wear a ladies shoe size 7 and it fits good.  When I am watching TV or reading I  pull the foot bend straps pretty tight and then at night I loosen them up.  I won&#x27;t sleep without it.</li>
            <li> When I wear this all night, I walk pain free all day.  But you have to experiment and find just the right amount of tension in all the straps.  A couple of nights I pulled them too tight and the pain in my toes woke me up causing me to take it off.  The pain was mainly caused by too much pressure on the ball of my foot.  But I fixed it by rolling up a couple of socks and placing them under my arch.  If it came with arch support, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.  I was starting to worry the PF would never subside.  What a relief!  All in all, this was a great investment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from PF for almost a year now, and Ive gone thru shots, stretching, excerises and expensive custom orthotics, but to no avail. The pain is terrible and unrelenting. My podiatrist gave me a cheap version of this boot, but it never fit right and so the relief was minimal. Out of desperation, I ordered this boot. Ive been wearing it every night for about 3 weeks now, and I am getting relief from this pain. It takes some determination and commitment to get used to. I can honestly say that if I wasnt at my \\&quot;rock bottom\\&quot;, so to speak, I would probably have thrown this in my closet after the first night. Being mostly a stomach sleeper all my life, this was difficult. I can still position myself on my stomach, but Im finding that I&#x27;m staying on my back or my side more and more now. Also, it takes a bit of trial and error with the straps. One night I strapped the ankle too tight and awoke in pain. I&#x27;ve since gotten a pretty good balance with the straps. I was getting a small amount of relief after about a week of wearing the boot, but I was finding that even with all the straps and support, my foot was still able to find a somewhat relaxed , sleep position, so what I did was raid my sewing fabric stash for some soft fleece. I build up my foot slightly more, so it stays closer to a 90 degree angle from my leg, and this seems to be helping with the pain so much more. I am in the medical field and am on my feet and on the move all day long, and I am feeling a huge difference. I still experience discomfort, but it comes and goes instead of being constant. I am back to longer daily walks with my dog again, which sadly had fallen off dramatically. I still have  fatigue in my feet ,and like I said the pain isnt gone, BUT I&#x27;m beginning to have hope that maybe I CAN get back to a somewhat normal life. I would recommend this boot to anyone with some patience because it might take awhile to make the proper adjustments that will yield some improvements with this condition. Also, to remember it isnt an instant fix. At least it hasnt been in my case. Hopefully I will continue to feel better and better.</li>
            <li> I first tried the Futuro splint because I happened to find it in a local CVS. That design was basically worthless so I tried the Bird &amp; Cronin splint and found it to be much more effective than the Futuro over-the-top splint. I find the B&amp;C splint to be comfortably padded and very much like the fact that it is adjustable.  The company obviously understands that the one-size-fits-\\&quot;most\\&quot; leaves a portion of the population unhelped (Futuro should learn that lesson!) so it was a relief to find a splint that comes in various sizes AND is adjustable. Unlike the rather worthless Futuro splint, this B&amp;C splint allows you to adjust the degree of stretch by tightening or loosening two Velcro straps. Another nice feature of this splint is the fact that once you find comfortable adjustments on the three across-the-leg/foot straps, you can keep them at that adjustment because the straps have buckles. You may have to make adjustments, for example, in response to thickness of fabric if you wear it over clothes but that would be only if you want to wear the brace quite snugly, which is not needed. I initially adjusted it too snugly and with too much of a stretch and found it uncomfortable after several hours. Once I loosened things up, the discomfort went away. Now, if I wake up in advance, I try to remember to increase the stretch an hour or less before I actually have to get up. I can&#x27;t sleep comfortably at the increased stretch but for short durations it seems extra helpful. Unfortunately, because the splint DOES work, I find it difficult to go without it because everything begins to tighten up again shortly after removing it. Oh, but to walk pain-free when I first get up is nice! Unfortunately, that doesn&#x27;t last. No fault of the splint but a sure sign that it&#x27;s going to be a long time healing. Because my job is 90% sedentary, I&#x27;ve taken to frequently wearing the splint while I&#x27;m working. (No, you are NOT supposed to walk with the splint on. I confess that I do walk a bit with it on. I just try very hard not to put excess stress on the splint when I do so. It makes for very awkward walking but if I&#x27;m only going a very short distance, I take my chances.) The padding is attached securely with Velcro which means it can be removed for hand-washing -- thankfully! lol  The splint has definitely been helpful. Time will tell how durable it is (notwithstanding my naughty walking with it on) but the price is quite reasonable so as long as it lasts a year, I&#x27;ll consider it a good investment. I would have given it 4-1/2 stars if I could but I can&#x27;t, so I &#x27;erred&#x27; on the side of conservativeness because I don&#x27;t know how durable it will be. I do recommend it for anyone suffering from plantar fascitis/fasciosis but I caution that it&#x27;s not necessary to adjust the straps tightly. If you try this splint and find it is causing you discomfort, loosen up the straps, the stretch, or both. You can always work to a greater stretch with time and patience but it will be useless if you push things too far or too fast and cause additional discomfort that deters you from wearing the splint. Also remember that a night splint is only one tool in the management of PF. You should be doing other things to help your condition, like stretches (bent knee and straight) and exercises like toe \\&quot;scrunches,\\&quot; periodically throughout the day.  Wishing everyone happier, healthier feet!</li>
            <li> *** I&#x27;m putting this review on all sizes of this product, sorry for any redundancy.  I&#x27;m hoping it will be helpful for anyone considering it ***    I have been wearing this splint for about a month now to combat a pretty severe case of plantar fasciitis and want to update you on the effectiveness and my experience with it.  My plantar fasciitis was caused primarily by weighing too darn much, plus moving into a house with mostly hardwood floors and walking around barefoot/in socks without foot support.  I had never heard of the injury until it was too late.    First of all the product.  I started out with the medium size based on my shoe size but my toes stuck out over the edge and my foot felt kind of squished so I switched to the large.  My foot size is \\&quot;around\\&quot; 10 or so, I would suggest going to the large if you have any question.    How I adjusted the straps.  The top strap keeps the thing from sliding up and down and as such I have that one somewhat tight.  The middle strap (goes kind of over your ankle) is important in that it keeps your foot in the proper position.  If too loose, your foot can position so that the ligament is not stretched properly and can tighten overnight.  So I tighten this strap as much as comfortable so that my ankle can&#x27;t bend and separate from the device much.  If you find you can point your toes downward, then this strap is probably too loose.  The bottom strap (over the top of your foot) is not as important in positioning as long as the middle ankle strap is correct, and I have that one quite loose.  The bottom one if too tight is very uncomfortable and cuts off circulation in my case.  As far as the side straps, pull them tighter to increase the stretch, generally just a gentle stretch is all you need.  If you change these side straps much, you will need to adjust the other 3.  This is just what finally worked fairly comfortably and effectively for me, your experience might be different.  I definitely agree it does take some gettingused to.    Effectiveness - I had immediate relief for that \\&quot;first step\\&quot; in the morning.  I was able get out of bed and walk normally where before using this product I was hopping around on my good foot for about 5 minutes.  I could not put any weight at all on my bad foot.  My foot pain was not entirely gone, but felt just \\&quot;normal\\&quot; as though it was during the day.  I also now have orthotics designed for plantar fasciitis in every pair of shoes/slippers I own (fortunately I am male so that is not many ;-)..) and am very careful not to walk on any non-cushioned surface without these orthotics.    Is my injury \\&quot;fixed\\&quot;?  Not yet.  I think if I were to go a night without this splint I would still be in a lot of pain in the morning.  So this has reduced/eliminated that problem but I still have to wear it and of course the goal is a \\&quot;cure\\&quot; and no longer needing to wear it.  I have a feeling that overall my problem is improving, and if I continue to wear the orthotics and use this product it MIGHT over time go away.  It took a long time to get the injury and I&#x27;m just trying to be patient in my self-treatment of it.  At some point I may see a podiatrist but for right now this is sufficient.    I&#x27;ll update this review if I have any major breakthroughs.    In the meantime, I would recommend it highly at least for relief of morning pain.    ***** Update 9/28/10.  My foot has been feeling better so tried a couple nights without the splint.  It wasn&#x27;t as bad as before (about like after an hour or two nap) but gradually worsened.  I started wearing it again and better in the morning and all day.  Just have to be PATIENT I guess.  But the goal is to not hurt/injure the foot so anything which prevents pain is important.  Just not ready to stop wearing it yet.  But I&#x27;m hoping soon with the other steps, not quite yet.  Still keeping up with the orthotics.    ***** Update 11/18/10 (last one).  I think I&#x27;ve reached the break-even point where the inconvenience of the splint (although not bad) outweighs the benefit I get.  At most 10 to 15 seconds of stretch is all I need now in the morning to be quite comfortable and now I&#x27;m also quite comfortable all day.  I still use and will continue using inserts (plus have lost 23 lbs, yay, 44 more to go).  But for now I consider my plantar fasciitis if not cured, at least very livable and tolerable.  I expect it to continue to improve still.    Was this product worth it?  It certainly helped with the extreme discomfort and for that I would definitely recommend it.  I&#x27;m not sure that it helped with my (near) cure, but it certainly wasn&#x27;t a good thing to allow that ligament to tighten up so badly every night.  I&#x27;m fairly convinced that the overnight stretch did at least speed the process.  If you can stand to wear it, I would say it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> You all really found this comfortable? I found myself thinking the Spanish Inquisition devised something similar. There&#x27;s no way I could sleep with this thing on. I just couldn&#x27;t stand to wear it for any length of time, tried for some time then gave up. Still, a 3-star review because this is clearly a high-quality, well-constructed item. Seeing what when into this and the quality of the construction, I&#x27;m surprised the price is so low.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly. Does exactly what it says it will.  Not the most comfortable to sleep in, but i do not think any of them would be.  very very sturdy. well worth the money.</li>
            <li> very difficult to fit and put on. I needed my husband to put it on. The buckles on the outside of the foot make it more difficult. I have a short leg and wide calf. The top strap was too short so I could not buckle it. Also, my foot would not stay seated. I would tighten the straps to help but then it would cut off my circulation. Returned it.</li>
            <li> Ordered this on physician&#x27;s instructions. Read Amazon reviews to arrive at this model, and you guys are right again!! I&#x27;ve worn it for nearly a month now and I can get up and WALK in the morning! Plantar fasciitis is not fun, and this splint does what it is advertised to do. It is a bit clunky wearing it in bed, but you get used to it, especially in the morning when the pain is gone. The fasteners rub a bit, but a pair of socks with it helps. It is OK for quick trips to the door (let pets in/out) and other short in-home nighttime excursions, despite the warning against walking in it per the directions.  Thank you again, Amazon reviewers! I always trust my fellow Amazonians.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with this night splint and feel that it was helpful in the healing process.  It&#x27;s as light and as comfortable as a splint can probably be, although I felt my foot could use more of a stretch.  I began to wonder if the socks (also worn at night) that pull your toes upward might have been the better choice.  But since I never tried them I can&#x27;t say.  All in all a good product, and I can&#x27;t imagine the more expensive versions being much better.</li>
            <li> Just got these and ordered a Small because the description states that \\&quot;Small\\&quot; fits up to women&#x27;s size 7-1/2.  NOT TRUE!  I wear a 7 or 7-1/2 depending on the shoe maker and style and the \\&quot;Small\\&quot; size DOES NOT fit!  In fact, the brace is so short all but the last two toes hang over.  According to the diagram that came with the brace, your entire foot (including toes) should fit on the sole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a condition of plantar fasciitis, the toes should not be able to be bent downward while wearing this brace.  In all exercises I&#x27;ve seen for this condition, you pull the toes FORWARD while rubbing and stretching the bottom of the foot.  So this problem is somewhat of a \\&quot;Big Deal\\&quot;.  So if you ladies wear a size 7 or 7-1/2, the \\&quot;Medium\\&quot; size is what you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe the \\&quot;Small\\&quot; would only fit only up to a  women&#x27;s size 6-1/2!  So take care when ordering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a good note, I did find the padding soft and comfortable.  Will update later when the correct size is received and I have had an opportunity to actually know how effectual these braces are.</li>
            <li> My daughter has used these for a few years and just now are finally wearing down, but now she does not need them anymore, so they definitely helped stretch her calf muscles.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as described.  I had severe pain from planter fascitis every morning for months.  I wear this every night and wake up pain free-really remarkable!</li>
            <li> VERY SATISFIED WITH THIS NIGHT TIME SPLINT.  I USE IT FOR SEVERAL HOURS DURING THE DAY OR IN THE EVENING BEFORE GOING TO BED.  IS EFFECTIVE IN STRETCHING THE MUSCLES IN MY FOOT AND CALF AND RELIEVING SEVERE PAIN IN MY FOOT.  I AM NOT ABLE TO &#x27;SLEEP&#x27; IN THE SPLINT AS IT IS NOT COMFORTABLE FOR PROLONGED USE.  I WOULD RECOMMEND IT FOR PLANTAR FASCIITIS WHICH IS A MISERABLE AND PAINFUL CONDITION. SINCE USING THIS SPLINT I HAVE RESUMED MY DAILY WALKS.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these in hopes it would help with my planter fascitis after my military basic training. I was disappointed as they were very hard to sleep in. I felt better after doing stretches and working with bands.</li>
            <li> My insurance company payed a lot more money to buy me a very similar boot.  I got rid of said boot during a move and when my plantar started flaring up again I couldn&#x27;t get it to go away.  I tried the socks, inserts, icing...long story short I was suprised to find a boot so cheap.  I received it the next day and it worked great.  It is a large plastic boot you wear to bed so keep that in my mind! My hubby rolls his eyes every time I start strapping my boot on!</li>
            <li> I have bad tendonitis of my achilles tendon.  Was hoping this would give relief....which it did, however I can&#x27;t seem to adjust it so it does not wake me up on the middle of night in pain because it is hitting pressure points on my foot and ankle.  When I do use it and just take it off at 3am when it wakes me, I do notice relief the next day.</li>
            <li> I have had the Bird and Cronin Plantar Fascitis splint (sz small) for just a few days.  I have worn it in the evening when watching TV.  However, I have only been able to wear it a couple hours in bed before I decide it&#x27;s bothering me and I take it off.  I will keep trying...as I really want to do everything I can to get rid of the pain in my foot.</li>
            <li> nice fit for small foot. easy on and off once the snaps got used a bit!</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 of these splints when my plantar fasciitis flared up so bad that the burning in my heels was keeping me awake at night.  I used this splint (along with 2 other items), and within a couple weeks I can FINALLY sleep again.      The splint is extremely well made, light, comfortable, gives a serious (but fully adjustable) stretch, slides underneath the covers easily, doesn&#x27;t scratch or bother my husband while we sleep, and the padded straps don&#x27;t rub or scratch me, no matter how long it&#x27;s on.  Really, I can&#x27;t say a single negative thing about the splint itself!    I prefer an extreme stretch, so I can&#x27;t sleep with it on for more than a few hours, BUT this has NOTHING to do with the splint.  Any splint for PF will place unusual pressure on some part of the leg or foot; there&#x27;s just no way around it.  This brace places pressure on the forefoot-- particularly if you like an extreme stretch, as I do-- and this creates a pressure point on the ball of my foot.  I could loosen the stretch, and sleep easily, but I&#x27;ve found this uneccesary.  In case you&#x27;re suffering from heel pain like I was, here&#x27;s what worked for me--    I use this splint several hours a day, most days, while I&#x27;m sedentary, and I crank up the stretch as far as it will go. At night, I wear adjustable arch bandages (actually, my feet are tiny, so I use futuro wrist bandages instead) to keep my arches gently stretched while I sleep.  The biggest help, however, has been Orthaheel shoes-- I bought a cheap, used pair to try them out first, and I had IMMEDIATE RELIEF that very first night.  I found my Sketcher Shape-Ups (which I once loved) seriously aggravated the condition.  Wearing them just once set me back almost a week in progress, by allowing me to overpronate even more, so I got rid of them.  Lastly, in the beginning, Alleve (only one tab) was the only thing that would get me through the night, because everything else wore off too quickly.    Hope this helps.  If you&#x27;re wanting to stretch your arches and calves, don&#x27;t hesitate to buy these!  Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Thus is a fine splint. It adjusts well for my 6.5 inch narrow foot. I i find it hard to wear for long stretches of time. I prefer to wear it for a few hours in the evening rather than eight hours while I sleep. I can definitely get a nice stretch with this splint.</li>
            <li> After 3 months of pain from plantar fascititis, I decided to try a night splint.  This is really helping stretch out my foot.  I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks and I can feel my foot getting better every day.</li>
            <li> I bought this for plantar fascitis. I like to put it on even when i&#x27;m just relaxing in bed. i had no issues getting used to it sleeping however if you&#x27;re in a relationship, things can get interesting and creative if you don&#x27;t want to take it off. Sometimes after a long day on my feet if it&#x27;s especially painful i find that putting this on helps.</li>
            <li> Need to return, I&#x27;m sure for some this is a great help.  For me, it&#x27;s not.  I need a different support that doesn&#x27;t pull the foot so much. I&#x27;ve adjusted the straps and it is all wrong for me.  But. . . . I can see how it would help most people who need this type of night splint.  It&#x27;s very well made.</li>
            <li> I have plantar fasciitis in both feet, but just ordered one splint.  They looked pretty uncomfortable and even with all of the positive reviews, I still didn&#x27;t believe it would make much of a difference (I have also tried inserts with no noticable improvement and thought this might be the same).  I have only had it two nights and can&#x27;t believe the difference!  I can&#x27;t fully figure out the right adjustment for me with all the straps (3 of them).  I have the one on the toes right, but the ankle strap makes my foot fall asleep, so I am clearly tighening too much and will continue to fiddle around with it.  Both nights, I just wore the splint for a bit reading in bed and then a couple hours of sleep.  I also wore it for about 30 minutes each morning.  Even without wearing this all night, I have seen a huge change.  I can actually get out of bed in the morning and walk again!  It works so well that I just ordered a second one.</li>
            <li> I had three major issues with this brace.  1) As a side sleeper, I had a difficult time finding a position where the weight of the splint didn&#x27;t bother my good foot.  2) The straps running from the top of the brace cuff to the footbed attached right where my pinkie and big toe joints sit, putting pressure on the joints and causing those portions of my foot to go numb.  3) As the instructions state not to attempt to walk with the splint on, I was faced with either taking it off or hopping to the bathroom during the night.  I returned this and went with an ankle stablizing brace, which worked just as well.</li>
            <li> Impossible to secure on your own on the right foot as the clips are paced low outer side of the boot.</li>
            <li> This splint is great. It&#x27;s like having a cast on but worth it. No pain in the morning. Now if I could only quit my job.</li>
            <li> Returning this item...Not made for people with larger legs. Did not fit around upper calf so unfortunately sending back.</li>
            <li> I bought this device for my wife, whom has suffered greatly from plantar fascitis (sp?).  She&#x27;s an avid athlete and never had the patience to give her feet a break from running and other activities.  She recently ran in an USMC Mud Run and could hardly walk afterwards due to the plantar fascitis.  After this, she commissioned me to research and buy something to help her.    I bought this brace and it arrived in about 3 days.  When she opened the box, she laughed laughed out loud because of the ridiculous thought of wearing this ski-boot-look-a-like around the house and to bed.  She has worn it for about 2 - 3 hours per night for roughly 8 - 10 nights.  She said that after the first 2-3 hours, it began to bother her foot to the point she couldn&#x27;t sleep.  Already, she is not experiencing any discomfort from the plantar fascitis.  She has continued running and working out without any pain.    THE RESULT: This brace has dramatically helped my wife from the point of hobbling around to feeling no pain.  I&#x27;m only sorry we didn&#x27;t buy something sooner....</li>
            <li> Tossed and turned. Cannot sleep comfortably nor relax in this boot! really need ability to walk or stand up with this device as well.</li>
            <li> I have a bad heel spur/plantar fasciitis that started in spring of 2009.  I held off going to the Dr. for a year.  I have tried a steroid shot and a prescription anti-inflammatory for 6 months with little relief.  I looked into a night splint from the Dr. but was unwilling to pay $300 for something I wasn&#x27;t sure I would even wear.  After a lot of internet research I came across this one and loved the price and the reviews I found.  My heel pain is so much better and it is not that difficult to sleep in the splint.  I wish I would have done this 6 months ago and avoided the shot and meds.      I need to make sure that the straps are not too tight though.  I love the fact that once you set the velcro in place you can use the plastic tabs and not have to mess with the velcro setting.  I also like the fact that you can adjust the degree of stretch.  I like to add some stretch while watching TV.      I am a size 6 1/2 and the small splint fits perfectly.</li>
            <li> Fine for daytime use, but I cannot sleep in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this works, but I found it too cumbersome to sleep with.  I ditched it after spending several hours tossing and turning.</li>
            <li> This splint is very well constructed and durable; it is a lot better than the Futuro plantar fasciitis splints which I tried in the past.  This splint has adjustable straps and you can adjust the angle of your foot.  The only negative about the small size that says it fits up to a women&#x27;s 7.5.  I wear a size 7/7.5 and have a wide foot and the splint can barely fit on my foot.  I also have wide calves so the adjustable straps need to be let out a lot to fit my foot/ankle.  I would suggest going up a size if you are on the cusp between two size ranges, have wide feet or wide calves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another issue is that they were somewhat difficult to put on and off but that ends up being a positive because this splint does a very good job of rigidly holding your foot in place unlike the Futuro splints you fan find at most drugstores.</li>
            <li> This boot works well for me my foot it feeling better 8-) The price is right and the item works, they got it to me quick also!</li>
            <li> Excellent.  Cured my PF.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this to bed for approximately two weeks,  I also use sometimes when I&#x27;m watching tv because I tend to sit with my legs crossed which is bad. I feel it is really helping with my pain. I am an avid walker/hiker/gym goer and &amp;#34;resting&amp;#34; for a month is not an option. I&#x27;ve tried physical therapy and had orthotics made for my shoes (also helpful) but the boot really works. Get those stretches in while you&#x27;re sleeping,  it helps! Also remember, tighter is not better, took me a couple nights to get it comfy but I got it and it&#x27;s not too tight but still doing the job. Worth a try at the unbelievably low Amazon price.</li>
            <li> BEWARE,DOES NOT PROPERLY POSITION FOOT! The brace I received was not at a 90 degree angle (according to my doctor, the correct \\&quot;neutral\\&quot; position you want for your foot). Mine, no joke, was more like a number 7. Now, I&#x27;m a dancer with an extremely flexible Achilles tendon, but this brace was so painful I didn&#x27;t last more than 15 minutes. I tried stuffing the heel to make the angle less acute, but then the straps didn&#x27;t fit, and it still hurt me. It has provoked a negative response in my plantar fasciitis that I hope is only temporary. Although the photo seems to show a 90 degree angle, believe me, that was not what this brace had (the colors were also different, so perhaps it&#x27;s not the same model). My husband said it looked more like a ski boot. Extremely disappointed, and slightly angry at the pain it&#x27;s caused. Otherwise, the device seemed what you would want for night wear - padded straps, light weight, cushioned surfaces. But with the wrong angle, it&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from plantar fascitis since the summer of 2011, when at first I thought I had just bruised my heel, only after months of not healing I started researching and came to realize it was much more serious. I&#x27;ve used this night splint for just two consecutive nights so far, but just in that short time I am feeling a positive difference. Both mornings after its use, and throughout the whole day, I had little to no pain in my foot. This splint is a GREAT value, the only thing I found to be important, (as it was suggested in other reviews I read on this product before purchasing it), you need to get your ankle and foot straps adjusted for comfort. I found that snug was too tight, but lightly loose, where I could get 2 fingers side-by-side under the straps, was just about right. There is some getting used to wearing it while I sleep, but it is very light weight and comfortable. I highly reccomend this product!</li>
            <li> My plantar fasciitis is being very stubborn about going away, but this boot does allow me to walk first thing in the morning without pain.  It&#x27;s pretty much impossible to walk in the boot, though, so if you wake up in the night and have to get up, you&#x27;ll have to take it off.  Not a big deal because it&#x27;s just held on with three clips.  I do wish I had one with a soft underside, though, so I could just get up and walk when I have to in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li> I honestly was only able to wear this splint about 3 times. Each time, I tried adjusting the straps and just could not find a comfortable position for my foot. On one occasion, my foot actually fell asleep and it was quite uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> package came without instructions.  There was one piece in the bag to be placed somewhere, however, with no instructions, it&#x27;s just sitting in the bag, since I do not know where to put it.</li>
            <li> I really like this. I decided that I needed to conduct an all out war on my plantar fasciitis and after reading a number of reviews of different night splints chose this one and I&#x27;m glad that I did.  When I first took it out of the box I thought that it was really complicated but it&#x27;s very easy to adjust and put on. It&#x27;s light and, while it felt really awkward and strange wearing it the first night, I got used to is and had it on all night.&lt;br /&gt;The next morning, removal, a few stretches and... amazing!  No heel pain on getting out of bed. I&#x27;ve worn it three nights so far and I think it&#x27;s really helping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had plantar fasciitis in both feet for 3 years, tried cortisone shots, ice, stretches, tennis ball, with no luck. Bought those other type booties with the velcro strap that pulls the toes up, they not only made my feet hot because they were enclosed, they jammed my toes together causing my toenails to cut into each other. In desperation and to avoid surgery I bought this based on the ratings and am happy I did. The first night almost all the pain was gone when I got up in the morning. I had only bought one initially to try but it worked so well I got another. It has plenty of ventilation so your feet don&#x27;t sweat, and has soft foam padding against your skin. Easy to adjust and buckle. The bottom has a rubber sole so I don&#x27;t have to remove them on bathroom trips. Wouldn&#x27;t advise stairs or prolonged walking however. The smooth plastic slides around under the sheets and really doesn&#x27;t bother me when I turn. Between these and stair stretches I am finally feeling relief. It is taking weeks but definitely is much better and I hope to be cured in a while. My best wishes to everyone who suffers from this condition, it has a very big impact on lifestyle.</li>
            <li> I had a stress fracture on my right foot and started getting cramps and locked calf when I ran. I bought this after reading the reviews.    Pros: Comfortable padding. Small size footing fits my size 6 feet. I have wide feet at EE, and this fit nicely.    Cons: Very difficult to keep the stretched calf without having to tighten all 3 straps. However, the tight straps caused numbness. I tried to loosen, but there&#x27;s not much to loosen. The velcro can be longer to allow for more room to loosen.</li>
            <li> I wish I had bought this sooner.  I had gotten 2 injections in my heel with no relief but 2 weeks of wearing this while I slept and that did the trick.  Haven&#x27;t had a occurrence since.  This boot was a lot cheaper than the 2 doctor visits and injections!!  Great buy!</li>
            <li> Itâ€™s a bit tricky to put on, but it holds my foot better than one that wrapped around.  The only thing is, I canâ€™t wear it all night, just for a couple of hours.  Then my foot bothers me and I wake up and have to remove it--tricky when youâ€™re only half awake and itâ€™s dark.  But when I get up in the morning, my foot feels better.</li>
            <li> I not only use this at night, but also in the evening while watching tv.  It did take some getting use to in order to sleep, but the pain associated with planter fasciaitis is relieved.</li>
            <li> First off, I have only one complaint with the seller and that is probably my own fault: they need to put more emphasis on pointing out that these aren&#x27;t pairs - they are only one item, so if you have the problem in both feet you have to buy 2. Other than that - great job ... it arrived quickly and well packed.  I bought this to help my wife&#x27;s Fasciitis. With the product itself ... she won&#x27;t wear it. Why? Like so many folks, she doesn&#x27;t think to take it off when she gets out of bed.   My wife gets up three or four times during the night to use the bathroom. The first time she got up and tried to walk the 15 feet to the bathroom she was nearly killed slipping on the floor. These things have no traction at all if you forget to take it off. I suspect many folks just stopped using it after the first couple of near mishaps. They need to put some sort of non-slip bottom on these things to protect sleepy people from becoming hospitalized people.</li>
            <li> Cool item but I don&#x27;t know who posted the sizes, I wear a women&#x27;s size 7 and the small one is too small, my toes are hanging half out. If you wear shoe size 7 buy the medium. Now I have to get in touch with them and ask for a size up.</li>
            <li> The buckles are hard to use for mature customers. The product is great. It does work.It has helped a great deal.</li>
            <li> Well padded, comfortable for its purpose.  Each strap is adjustable.</li>
            <li> The splint is too tall for my leg and hits it right at the center back of my calf.,therefore it has to be loosened. my heel does not hit the back of the splint and me, it is passable..by mid night, it had to be removed from digging into my leg</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to wear the splint more than 2 nights because of other issues. I hurt my ankle &amp; couldn&#x27;t wear it. Although it is bulky, it did hold my foot firmly, but comfortable. It wasn&#x27;t hard to adjust to fit. I like that it can be adjusted &amp; saved by using the connectors instead of the Velcro. I&#x27;d recommend trying this product.</li>
            <li> The first night on was alright, a little uncomfortable.  For the second night, I woke up with my big toe hurting because of lack of blood flow to it. After that, I do not sleep overnight in it.  I use it when I&#x27;m watching TV or reading a book.  Although it did relieve some pain, the result was below what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Wish I had ordered one size up.  Completely adjustable and much more comfortable than the type that fits on the top of your foot.  The only problem is keeping your heel down.  I loosened the long straps and it helped.</li>
            <li> The boot fit well and helps to ease that painful morning &amp;#34;first step&amp;#34; out of bed. It arrived quickly and was exactly as stated. I would recommend this product and this seller.</li>
            <li> Hate these, they are not practical and very uncomfortable. I am confused do these fit a left and right foot, are they the same? I can put it on my left with no problems and it fits, but it wont fit my right it is not made for the right.</li>
            <li> I ordered the smalled size it was still too big for me, it costed 9$ for the product and $8 for delivery, when I asked to retunr to the product I was told that they would deduct a restocking fee, NOT refund the shipping and didnt even send a return shipping label, so If i returned the product at my own cost, it would have costed me atleast 10$ to send it back and would have probably been retunred $7, I decided not to send the product back, its lying in my closet useless because I cant use it.</li>
            <li> This product is a total waste of money.  I have PF and thought this would keep my feet stretched out through the night. I was wrong, you can&#x27;t tighten it very much or your circulation gets cutoff to you legs ankles and feet. You can&#x27;t tighten it enough because it just slides down you calf and lifts you foot out of the bottom and the cuts your circulation off. I tried this for several night and it didn&#x27;t help because you can&#x27;t make it tight enough to keep you foot flexed. The Prostretch is the only product I have found that gives me any relief for my PF.</li>
            <li> I had one from my podiatrist but it was way more $$ but basically the same thing. A little sturdier than this one but for what I needed it for..splint at night..it works fine. They do run small in size and I have a small foot but my toes go right over the edge. It&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re walking with it so it&#x27;s fine. I found the straps very itchy so have a small towel over my leg and then strap it on. I normally wear a size 7.5 shoe and if your foot is any bigger than that go to the M. You&#x27;ll never get the straps to come together as you&#x27;ll run out of adjustment. For the price it&#x27;s fine and keeps my heel stable...I have plantar fascitis.</li>
            <li> This brace is at least the right size for my foot, but the calf strap just isn&#x27;t long enough. I have small feet and BIG calves, and I couldn&#x27;t get this brace to fit me comfortably. Even with the straps tightened, my foot would still not be held in the correct position. If I tightened any more my foot would fall asleep! I think night braces are a waste... I&#x27;m considering trying a Strasbourg (sp?) sock or just not trying to do anything for my plantar fasciitis at night. :( I&#x27;m so disappointed!</li>
            <li> Did not fit but also did not feel like it was helping</li>
            <li> Takes some getting used to but it helps relieve your Plantar Fasciitis. I am a female with a size 8 shoe and the small fits well. Mine splint was just as the one pictured. I am happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The splint is easy to use and I think it does help my Plantar problems. It does bother me after a while and I have to remove it but I do think it is worth trying.</li>
            <li> This was a bit difficult to sleep in.  I can only wear it a short time at night.  A bit bulky and not sure if it is stretching my feet.</li>
            <li> For all practical purposes, this product does serve it&#x27;s purpose.  But I couldn&#x27;t wear it all night because it wasn&#x27;t comfortable at all. Too bulky.</li>
            <li> works well, it holds your foot forward to stretch out the foot.</li>
            <li> Works really great! When I wake up in the morning I don&#x27;t have the pain in my heel like I had been dealing with! Very satisfied with how well it works!</li>
            <li> Not what i expected. It holds your foot in place but doesnt provide the stretch that i need</li>
            <li> I wore this product during the night on and off. Initially I was unable to sleep well but my plantar fasciitis was getting worse so I forced myself to use it. If I can wear the product to sleep overnight the next monring I will not have morning pain. During the day if I walk more than an hour the sharp pain will come back. I will give this product a try for few more months to see if my problem can be cured.</li>
            <li> Good product but not what my daughter needed.  I took a risk for health reasons that didn&#x27;t work out.  Good product for a reasonable price</li>
            <li> I am a women&#x27;s 6 1/2 and ordered a size small... my foot seems to be the largest that would fit this size small.  However, it was NOT comfortable for me.  The stitching/back of straps was abrasive and needed a sock.  But, I could never get the straps adjusted correctly,  I could fall asleep but would wake within a few hours with my foot completely numb.  I would remove it and have pain as circulation returned.  The straps also caught on my sheets quite a bit.  I am not happy with the product.  I am not upset with the company that sold it though.  But am surprised that so many people said it was comfortable.  I could see it working if you didn&#x27;t want to sleep in it, but I really need something that will work overnight.</li>
            <li> I can only wear this for at most 4 hours per night and then I end up waking up from pain in the ball of my foot and taking it off.  I don&#x27;t think that is the way it was meant to work, but that&#x27;s my experience.</li>
            <li> much more comfy then the one I got from my doc, only wear it  a few hours at night and it help a lot</li>
            <li> My plantar  fascitis returned after almost 2 years. This splint has really helped. I was happy it came in my size. I have small feet.</li>
            <li> Easy to put on and take off. My problem is that in the middle of the night, my heel and foot slides forward away from the back wall of the splint. Not sure why, i tighten straps and still foot slides forward. Because of that I am not sure I am getting the desired stretch required to side in healing my plantar fasciitis. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated</li>
            <li> Only a bit more awkward than the professional ones.</li>
            <li> The strap over the foot is very painful.  I have tried loosening it but then it doesn&#x27;t hold my foot at a proper angle.</li>
            <li> Effective for my plantar fascists.  When I wear it i have a pain free morning!!  When I don&#x27;t ,  the pain revisits!  Hoping it will eventually cure the plantar fascists but have been wearing it for just over a month now, and there are definite improvements.</li>
            <li> This is a great item to have if you have signs or suffering from plantar fasciitis. A must check out item</li>
            <li> This brace really helps my plantar facitis but am only able to wear it for short periods due to friction on bottom of foot. Better padding would help. I cut se egg crate padding for foot portion of splint and this helped.</li>
            <li> for better or worse, small is still not small enough...</li>
            <li> It has really helped my planter fasciitis by wearing it at night.  Buy it if you have this problem because it really works.</li>
            <li> I borrowed one from a friend and decided to purchase one in my size.  By its design, it wasn&#x27;t comfortable but I have Plantar Fasciitis and it did help.  It took several days along with icing my foot and exercises but I no longer hobble out of my bedroom.  I can walk with little pain.  I highly recommend this brace for folks suffering as I did.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife who is a distance runner.  We have tried all sorts of other methods for dealing with her plantar fasciitis, tape, lifts, cut out heels, inserts for shoes, you name it....  This product actually helped and has allowed her to get back to running regularly again.  Like anything else, you have to use it in order for it to work. Its been a lifesaver for her.  Highly recommend and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> This boot has speeded up my recovery process.  Plantar fascitis is painful but with the boot no pain in mornings.</li>
            <li> it fits good but is bulky.  It must have done the job because I don&#x27;t have anymore pain from my plantar facitis</li>
            <li> I am Very satisfied with this splint. It is Exactly as described. Ive used this splint for only a few days and feel it is making a difference in my pain caused by plantar fasciitis. ive had to work up to using it for longer periods as the positioning that it has your foot in makes my toes numb after a bit. It helps to take a break and then put it back on after an hour or so. Overall Great product!</li>
            <li> This one was better than some that I have seen and it was not horribly uncomfortable. Cannot walk in it though, it is only for use while sleeping.</li>
            <li> I hope with some tweaking it will help stretch my PF out. Not able to use at night but wear it while watching TV.</li>
            <li> I had purchased a night splint before but it was not adjustable.  This one is working to help stretch  my tendon.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I coudn&#x27;t put it in a manner that will fit me right, If I put snug I end up removing it during the night coz I get numbed bec of poor circulation, when I put it loose it doesn&#x27;t give me the stretch or dorsiflex position since it&#x27;s loose so I&#x27;m working on foot exercise instead and roll a bottle of soda with frozen water.</li>
            <li> I have noticed an incredible difference since I started using the splint.  My only complaint is that if I awake during the night and have to use the restroom, it has to be removed.  Other than that it has been very helpful in alleveing pain.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from PF for about 9 months. My doctor&#x27;s advice was to do the stretches and take ibuprofen. It took so much ibuprofen to treat my pain that I developed stomach issues. I do the stretches and use ice and a tennis ball... all of the things that I have been told or have read would help. I was reluctant to buy this boot though. Maybe because I&#x27;ve spent hundreds of dollars on inserts and shoes or maybe because I didn&#x27;t want to hurt my husband (this boot is stiff). I finally gave in and ordered one, although I have PF in both feet. I purchased the Bird &amp; Cronin brand because of the price. I&#x27;ve now worn it 3 nights in a row on my right leg because that&#x27;s the leg with the worst pain: the first night all night long, but the 2nd and 3rd only about 2/3 of the night. Is the boot comfortable? It&#x27;s not &#x27;uncomfortable&#x27; - just bulky. You can&#x27;t walk in it, and so when my dog needed to go out in the wee hours, I took it off, and fell back asleep without putting it back on. It&#x27;s been 3 nights. My pain is so much better in the right foot that I can now really see how bad my left foot hurts too. I will order another and wear them both. I hate that I resisted so long.</li>
            <li> Good, when I use it, it holds my foot in place and helps so it doesn&#x27;t hurt so much when I get up</li>
            <li> After 4 months of morning heel pain, no more. I even paid more for a night splint from my Pod that fit on the front of my foot but this boot fits better and works great.</li>
            <li> Terrible finish and poor workmanship.</li>
            <li> The small size seems to still be too big.  The straps are as tight as they can go and I can still move around.  Otherwise I really like the brace.</li>
            <li> Wore it once. Kept hitting the other ankle because I&#x27;m a side sleeper. If I bought two of them, then it would be even and ankles would be protected. I&#x27;m keeping it in case I break a leg or a foot and need it for a splint. ;-)))  With Plantar Fascitis, the goal is to have 6-8 hours a day of &#x27;stretching&#x27; as in making an L-shape with the foot. I obtained a block under my desk, put the ball of my foot on it and let the weight of my leg keep my heel in an L-shape to my leg, and that gives me a few hours a day of the stretching I need.</li>
            <li> It works, but it is really uncomfortable to sleep with.</li>
            <li> This is a good night splint for plantar fascititus.  It is reasonable and seems to be doing the job.  Not that comfortable to wear at night but what splint would be.&lt;br /&gt; I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife. She says it helps immensely. Would recommend to anyone suffering from planter fascitis. Great seller. Received faster then expected.</li>
            <li> The splint is well-constructed and surprisingly lightweight for the size.  I&#x27;m not comfortable sleeping in it, but I wear it during the day when I&#x27;m working at the computer.  It&#x27;s made a huge difference.  I can walk without limping, even first thing in the morning, and my pain has greatly decreased.  I would recommend ordering one size up if you&#x27;re close to the size limit.  My foot is a women&#x27;s 6.5B.  The small is supposed to fit up to a women&#x27;s 7.5, but my toes hang a bit over the edge.  Overall, it&#x27;s a quality product.</li>
            <li> We were very happy with these braces! They were better quality than we expected for the price.  Great value! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This boot is very stiff.  I got one for myself and for a friend with plantar fasciitis.  We both have had a really hard time keeping it on all night.  The flexion of the foot is pretty extreme.  I can wear it better on the foot that doesn&#x27;t have as much pain.  Once I loosened the straps quite a bit, that has helped.  It&#x27;s just a very uncomfortable condition anyway, so the boot is probably a necessary annoyance.  I do have one that is less restricting that I like more.  It&#x27;s an ACE brand.</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Lighter weight than another brand I tried.&lt;br /&gt;Works.&lt;br /&gt;Price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Latches are a bit hard to release.&lt;br /&gt;Needs extra foam cushion underneath the lower straps or else they hurt the front of my ankle.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality product.&lt;br /&gt;When you learn how to correctly place it, it works as it should. I recommend you look up a video tutorial on how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is that you have to wear socks while using it because the straps get uncomfortable after a while.</li>
            <li> This splint has improved my plantar fasciitis.  A night splint was recommended for me by my podiatrist.  It is easy to snap on and off and is pretty comfortable to wear at night.  I would definitely recommend this to people suffering from plantar fasciitis</li>
            <li> Great product. I had tried several others with no success. Used this product for two weeks and have already had relief.</li>
            <li> This is the most comfortable splint I have tried.  I have small (size 6 1/2) feet and the futuro dorsal model cut off all circulation due to pressure on the top of my arch.  The wrap style ACE was not quite enough support and put a lot of pressure on the ankle bones while sleeping.  Thought the pressure from the plastic buckles and the cutting nature of the nylon straps would do me in the first night (which ultimately it did, I ripped it off in the middle of the night with no feeling in my foot).  However, after some brainstorming I didn&#x27;t use the provided buckles and instead used an ACE bandage to secure it in place.  OH SO MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE!  I can sleep all night rather comfortably. I plan on cutting off the buckle straps permanently and using this method.  Wish they would just sell them that way to begin with (just the frame, with an ace for wrapping).</li>
            <li> talk about relief! best money I ever spent!! fixed my fasciitis!!!</li>
            <li> This product is a great fit for people with the smaller feet. This is a good tough easy to adjust night splint. It is well padded and comfortable.</li>
            <li> this special boot is made in order to relief the pain caused by the plantar fascitis. My mom has used it, no the time I would and I feel it has helped her. The price is just fair</li>
            <li> A quick note for those who just want size information:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-My small Bird &amp; Cronin splint measures approximately 9 and 1/4 inches internally, where the foot goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I wear a ladies&#x27; 6.5 (sometimes a 7) shoe - my foot is about 9 inches long - and the small splint fits me, but the boot extends only 1/4th inch above my toes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Therefore, if you wear a ladies&#x27; 7 to a 7.5 shoe, you might wish to get the medium boot, rather than the small (even though the manufacturer says that the small fits up to a 7.5 women&#x27;s foot).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this night splint to see if it would help with my plantar fasciitis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the past few weeks, I&#x27;ve been using as an interim night brace a soft ankle brace that a relative of mine had used after ankle surgery.  I rigged it up as best as I could to hold my foot as upright as possible, but it wasn&#x27;t ideal and my foot spent more time at 75 degrees than 90.  However, because my foot \\&quot;wants\\&quot; to go to about 50 degrees when I&#x27;m sleeping (toes pointed and foot facing downwards on the mattress), the interim brace forced some extension of the fascia, and I could tell that some healing was taking place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the big problems with the interim brace was that I had to tighten the strap so tight around the middle of my foot that it caused the top of my foot to redden and bruise.  I decided to look for a brace that uses hard plastic as a splint material and which might provide resistance from below the foot more, and pull down on the top of the foot less, than my interim brace did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That second requirement of putting less pressure on the top of the foot is why I chose this Bird &amp; Cronin splint over the Active Ankle dorsal splint (they were my top two choices after looking over most of the options that Amazon sells), because the Active Ankle one looks like it requires more from the top of the foot.  For most people, the Bird &amp; Cronin splint looks like it would be less comfortable to sleep in than the Active Ankle one (in terms of disturbing the sheets, making it hard to turn over, banging into the other limb, etc.), but I took a gamble that the Bird &amp; Cronin&#x27;s underside-only hard plastic would be more comfortable for my particular foot than the Active Ankle&#x27;s overfoot hard plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the Bird &amp; Cronin yesterday and can echo other reviewers&#x27; comments that it seems well-constructed, well-thought-out, lightweight-but-sturdy, and a great buy at twenty-something.  It is nicely padded and comfortable on the leg, and the non-skid padding on the bottom is a great feature if you need to do a few little steps with it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My shoe size is 6.5 to 7, and I didn&#x27;t know if I should get the small Bird &amp; Cronin or the medium because there are several other reviews here by women who have a similar shoe size and some said the small splint was fine while some said it was too short.  But I figured that the medium must be a couple of inches longer than the small, and those extra inches would probably make a noticeable difference in terms of ease of sleeping in the boot (regarding catching on the sheets, banging into the other limb, ease of turning over, etc.), so I went with the small splint.  I am glad I did, because it does fit my foot well.  However, if my foot were just 1/4th of an inch longer, my toes would be edging over the top of the splint and that would feel uncomfortable.  Therefore, I can see why some women who wear around 7 to 7.5 would find the small splint too short, and probably should go up to the medium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Regarding sizing, another reason I didn&#x27;t go for the Active Ankle dorsal splint is that it&#x27;s only offered in two sizes as compared to Bird &amp; Cronin&#x27;s three sizes, and at least one reviewer of the Active Ankle splint who has feet around my size noted that the smaller Active Ankle splint was so large that it pressedon her foot in the wrong spot (the ball of her foot instead of the arch).]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One reviewer here said that the Bird &amp; Cronin splint when it&#x27;s empty and not pulled back by the side straps is already at an angle higher than 90 degrees (she said something about it&#x27;s being like a ski boot; I&#x27;d say my splint probably is at 100 degrees).  She was displeased with that angle and didn&#x27;t use the boot, but I found that once I had my foot in the boot and the straps adjusted, my foot was almost at 90 degrees in the boot, maybe 95.  I certainly didn&#x27;t have to use the side straps to pull my foot any further towards my knee, so I left them slack.  I don&#x27;t wish to pull my foot up farther than 90 degrees, at least for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though this splint looks in the photo like it would be huge and clunky, it honestly doesn&#x27;t feel very distracting or bothersome when it is fastened on my leg.  It doesn&#x27;t catch in the sheets that much (thankfully, I can wear the small-size splint, which helps).  However, I should note that I use a duvet/comforter which kind of floats over me and the bed, not a tucked-in top sheet + blanket combo.  If I slept under a tucked-in top sheet (which is uncomfortable for my feet and legs even when no splint is involved!), I know that this foot brace would get caught up in it and would therefore be more uncomfortable to sleep in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was using my spring/fall weight duvet (9 tog), the brace didn&#x27;t tussle much with it, but I have now switched over to my winter weight duvet (12 tog) and they are battling more with each other, which does wake me up occasionally during the night.  I might get a duvet cover that is \\&quot;slicker\\&quot; than my current ones, which would cut down on the friction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was tricky to find good settings on the three straps.  For the first week, no matter how I adjusted them, the straps would constrict my circulation and the resulting pain in my foot would wake me up about 3 hours after I&#x27;dgone to sleep, and I would have to take the splint off for the rest of the night.  I still felt I was getting some good out of it, but it was disappointing not to use it the whole night through.  For the past 2 nights, I have kept it on for the entire time I was sleeping, but this was achieved only by generously reducing the strap tension, which gives my foot quite a bit of latitude to move around.  The main thing is that the plastic bottom of the splint prevents my foot from flexing too much in the wrong direction, even when the straps are relatively loose.  Being at an easy-going 80 degrees instead of a strict 95 degrees might reduce the amount of healing that takes place in the foot, but having a splint on for 7 instead of 3 hours per day probably outweighs that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very pleased with this splint.  This is possibly something I&#x27;m going to have to wear for a relatively long time to come, and I&#x27;m confident that this is having a positive effect on my plantar fasciitis.</li>
            <li> This is okay, we are still waiting for my mother to feel all good because she is supposed to wear this for 3 months. She says that there is no improvement in her foot condition yet. It has been over a month now.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than the Orthopedics office. We were told to use this for an achilles strain. Within a week of wearing it my daughter was back to normal!</li>
            <li> This is a really well made splint.  The quality is excellent...better than others I have purchased.  It got rid of my wife&#x27;s plantar fasciitis in about 2 weeks.  I had PF as well, several times in the past.  We are 60 this year and still playing sports like a couple of twenty year olds so something&#x27;s gotta give at some point.  We stretch and exercise but hey!  As a chiropractor for about 3 decades I have seen a lot of stuff thrown at PF and a lot of people make a lot of money treating it....which frankly is a complete waste of time and money.  A night brace is the best thing I&#x27;ve seen and it clears it up in no time flat.  Highly recommended!  And this is a really good brace.  I&#x27;m getting one of these for myself.  The last one I bought for me was more expensive than this and so poorly made I actually gave it away after only using it 2 nights.</li>
            <li> too bad you can&#x27;t walk on it, you know, the middle of the night bathroom walks...I guess you can hop</li>
            <li> This brace does put your foot in a good stretching position, just  a bit much for me to sleep in.</li>
            <li> I went to the orthopedic doc over my plantar fasciitis and he recommended I use a night splint.  He said I could get one through his office, which would run around $300 or I could find one on Amazon.  A friend of mine had gotten her splint directly from her doc and it looked identical to this one.  She had such great success with hers, so I ordered this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advantages:  This product works!  When I wear it I can get out of bed in the morning with no pain.  It is lightweight and easy to use.  It is almost identical to the $300 professional splint at a fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disadvantages:  It is clunky.  It is also not the most comfortable thing to wear.  I have to be careful not to kick my husband while we&#x27;re sleeping... ha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent product that really works and does so for a fraction of the cost of other splints.</li>
            <li> I suffer from plantar fascitis and this type of splint was recommended by my Dr. It does take some getting used to to wear; however provides the correct support and adjustments.</li>
            <li> After all kinds of PT and exercises, this simple device cured my plantar fascitis.  Its a little bulky and takes some getting used to in order to sleep comfortably but it works!</li>
            <li> After my first pregnancy, I had very bad plantar fasciitus. I tried all the stretching, ibuprophen, and massage, but nothing helped and it was very painful in both feet. I tried these in a small, and I am about a size 7-7.5. I read the reviews of them being too small for others with my size, but I prefered to try them smaller so they would be less bulky. My toes do hang off, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. It is hard to get a tight fit on these without being very uncomfortable. So I was wearing them for the first few weeks feeling like they were too loose. They worked though! I wore them for about a month straight and my feet are feeling so much better that I started wearing heels again to work a few days a week. After not wearing them for the last month my feet were aching again so I wore them last night and definitely can tell the difference. I know I should be avoiding heels, but it is hard to do! I will keep these on hand and wear them when necessary. As for quality, they have been holding up... I get up multiple times and walk carefully in them across the hall to my baby&#x27;s room and they have been fine, although I know you aren&#x27;t supposed to walk in them. They have been ok on carpet but are scary on tile or wood floors.... I would have marked them five star if it werent for the cheap material that they are lined with. I wear tall socks with them because I hate the cheap feel of the lining on my feet.</li>
            <li> I suddenly came down with Plantar Fasciitis in both feet.  The pain in the left heel went away on its own after a month but the right foot kept getting worse, almost crippling in the morning and after sitting for extended periods of time.  Too proud(?) to see a Dr I decided to do exercises and buy this splint.  The exercises didn&#x27;t help much but wearing this splint at night seems to have alleviated most of the pain.  It took a couple of nights to get it adjusted correctly.  I am able to walk, not limp or crawl, into the shower each morning and find I have far less pain during the day.  In fact, I can&#x27;t even call it &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; anymore.  After 2 weeks my right foot is almost back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How can anyone sleep with a hard plastic thing strapped to their leg?  I wondered that myself.  I think those that sleep on their back would have the easiest time of getting used to it.  Not sure if a stomach sleeper could use this and still get a night&#x27;s sleep.  I&#x27;m a side sleeper so the issue of legs on top of each other concerned me, but it turned out not to be that bad.  I feared whacking my left ankle or shin, but that never occurred.  However, I&#x27;m an extremely sound sleeper and, thanks to my Sleep Number bed, I rarely turn or move more than once during the night.  Getting up in the middle of the night did not require removing the splint.  It has a thin rubber pad on the bottom so I could carefully walk the short distance to the bathroom and back to bed without removing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical but am now a believer.  This splint really has helped me!</li>
            <li> This item was broken right out of the box.  One of the rivets was not correctly installed, thereby making it useless.</li>
            <li> These are awesome I have been wearing them for a few hours a night to build myself up to sleeping with them on. I will say my hip and knee pain has subsided and it&#x27;s not so bad in the morning. Can&#x27;t wait to see how I feel after I build up to sleeping with them on</li>
            <li> I could not wear this at night, which it what I bought it for; it&#x27;s too uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> somewhat helpful at night.</li>
            <li> Impossible to use on your left foot unless you are double jointed, have 4 arms, or have someone to help put it on. It might work, but after fighting to get it buckled on for 45 minutes I found the device too painful to leave on. I needs far more padding on both the bottom and on the straps.</li>
            <li> I have a bad case of plantar fasciitis (started in one foot, developed in both!) and my orthopedist prescribed me night plints. it was over $120 in a regular store so so I decided to purchase one in amazon and see how it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;reading the reviews I purchase a medium one (I am a size 7). This is Ok but big: it does not hold the foot well enough. I then got the small size and this is the good fit. The toes are not completely inside the \\&quot;boot\\&quot; but this is how it should be.&lt;br /&gt;size 7 &#x3D; small not medium!&lt;br /&gt;the medium size is too loose for a 7: the foot \\&quot;jiggle\\&quot; and tightening the straps will just \\&quot;cut\\&quot; the blood circulation, not hold the foot better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the splint holds the foot correctly. It is very difficult to sleep with as you are not used to have something strapped around our foot. I have not been able to spend an entire night with it; I usually end up taking it off during the night but I guess it is just a matter of being well adjusted and getting use to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it seems to do the job: you can feel your fascia is stretched.</li>
            <li> I had one of these I paid $40 for, a bit funky to sleep in but works great.  I have had for 3 years and would not be replacing now if not for the new puppy chewing off half the straps.  Will be ordering this soon.</li>
            <li> its really help my shin and ankle muscle, i have very hight arch feet.</li>
            <li> I have had PF for several months, and icing, compression, massage, etc. wasn&#x27;t doing much to make things better. Two nights after I got this night splint I noticed a huge difference. Before I got the splint, I had a lump in my heel about the size of a large marble. Very round, very painful. Two nights later, the lump started to flatten back out. That first step out of bed in the morning is no longer agonizing. I cannot believe how quickly this splint started alleviating the symptoms of my PF. I&#x27;m recommending it to all my friends who have PF. I wish I could walk with the splint on, but the instructions say not to. So that&#x27;s the only drawback for me, that I have to remove the boot if I need to get up in the middle of the night. But all in all, this thing has changed my life.</li>
            <li> A little cumbersome and takes a few days to get used to wearing to sleep in, but fabulous product!! I ordered this after trying a one size fits all from the drugstore that really didn&#x27;t fit all! I wear a ladies 5 shoe, and although the length of the small is still a little longer than my foot, it doesn&#x27;t impact how this works. The 3 straps are completely adjustable to get a good fit, and I love that you can tighten the tension as needed. It took at least 2 weeks of wearing before I experienced much comfort, but my PF was really severe, causing great difficulty walking. After several weeks of using this brace, I am amazed at the improvement of my PF!  I rarely have pain now and have gone to wearing the brace only 2-3 nights per week! I can&#x27;t say enough about how great this product is! And at such a reasonable price!!</li>
            <li> This was the second splint I ordered and it worked!  I am cured! I wear a 7.5 shoe, wide, and this is a perfect fit.</li>
            <li> Left the one the podiatrist gave me at a friend&#x27;s house and rather than have her go through packing and shipping or waiting till I could get back there, looked on Amazon and ordered this. It is even better than the podiatrist&#x27;s because it is a small and hid medium was really too big. It definitely helps reduce the plantar inflammation.</li>
            <li> works well for stretching out my achilles and calf after severely straining my gastroc after surgery. But because I had been in a cast and walker boot, my calf is unbelievably thin, and this splints strap around the calf cannot go small enough. I opted for this splint over any of the ones that go on the top of your foot because I still have weird nerve pain and tingling on the top of my foot and the other style would&#x27;ve irritated that. It does work in the fact that I have substantially less tightness and pain in my calf in the morning, if I can manage to wear it through the night. Some nights I can&#x27;t get comfy and I take it off, but I do notice the difference on those mornings. It is kind of hot, and it&#x27;s kind of uncomfortable, but it seems to do the trick regardless.</li>
            <li> The splint did help my fascitis however it is very uncomfortable to sleep in and needs to be made to be less confining to promote better sleep. I finally just ended up wearing it for a few hours every evening then taking it off to sleep. It did help my fascitis now my foot rarely ever hurts any more.</li>
            <li> So far this is the best treatment I have used for plantar faciitis. We live overseas and use mosquito nets and it gets all tangled up in the net but I think anything would.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I read the comments about length of splint.  I was able to purchase the small and it is a perfect fit.  It has also given me the only relieve from pain and I am even traveling with it!  It is comfortable and easy to use and gives my foot some rest.  Thanks</li>
            <li> It works but the whole thing is so bulky that it feel like my foot is in a cast which makes for an uncomfortable nights sleep.  I ended up buying another one that is softer, doesn&#x27;t hold my foot in place as well as this one but it doesn&#x27;t keep me from sleeping like this one.</li>
            <li> This is not the most comfortable thing to have to wear to bed- but for the price I think it was a good deal and it has really helped me get over my plantar fascitis--which I have had for a year now.  Since wearing this splint for 4 weeks my PF as improved by at least 75%.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t keep your feet in the position that it needs to, unless it is on very tightly, which then cuts off the blood circulation in your legs.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this splint keeps your foot that straight and I&lt;br /&gt;have a hard time getting comfortable because I feel like I have to&lt;br /&gt;hold it straight.  Wouldn&#x27;t recomment it.  I&#x27;ve seen another that has&lt;br /&gt;a strap from the ankle to the front foot that you can tighten up.  I&lt;br /&gt;think that would be better!</li>
            <li> I gave this to my sister and right after the 1st 2 nights with only a couple of hours of use she immediately felt the difference. Having had plantar fascitis myself it is in the 1st step off the bed where it hurts the most and so I am hoping that she would see more of a change after she gets more used to the product and could wear it for longer than 2 hours at night.  ,</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for me, had to return.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product father reading another review about how well it worked. I have to say that after wearing it to bed for a few nights my plantar fashiatis is almost gone, I wake up with very little pain, and with stretching and icing I have avoided having to get cortisone shots, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> This things definitely stretches out that plantar whatchamacallit tendon in your foot. I bought it for my wife and she could only wear it a little at a time. It&#x27;s too early to rate the overall effectiveness of this product.</li>
            <li> In my experience, and in the experience of my sister, husband, and a few friends, the only thing that really cures PF is to splint our feet at night. This splint is very well designed and sturdy and worked wonders for my husband (resolved his PF in a few weeks). I found that I couldn&#x27;t sleep through the night in it, because it is rather bulky. So instead, I found a way to wrap my foot in an ace bandage so that it stayed at a right angle all night. That worked for me (again, PF resolved in a few weeks, no problem since).</li>
            <li> easy to use and put on, holds in place all night long, easy to adjust to foot and leg, works well</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I am able to adjust the angle that my foot is at so I am able to sleep comfortable. Great product!</li>
            <li> Of the several things I&#x27;ve tried for plantar fasciitis, this one seems most effective so far.  It is comfortable enough and I can sleep in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  after several months of use, one of the diagonal straps from toe to calf broke.  I have replaced it, more or less successfully, with a piece of nylon cord.</li>
            <li> This product works well on my restless leg syndrome, as well as plantar fascitis. It&#x27;s easy to get on and off. Surprisely, it is comfy to sleep with it on. The price is fair for a quality product. I think this product can help with different leg/foot issues. It took me about 3 nights to get used to wearing it in bed. I also use it when watching TV or reading in a recliner. Give it time would be my advice. Most of us are undoing years of leg/feet issues.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from PF for the past five months.  Have had three cortisone shots, and doing all the recommended remedies such as icing, stretching, ball rolling, anti-inflammatory meds, orthotics, etc.  Heel pain continues to persist.  Doctor tells me that PF can take up to a year to heal.  At the last visit he suggested the night splint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After searching online and reading reviews, this model seemed to be the best one.  Received it in the mail yesterday and wore it last night.  The size is perfect.  I wear a size 7 shoe and the small size fits my foot to a tee.  The straps are all adjustable, so make sure it fits snuggly first, then use the quick release clips to put on and take off the splint.  It&#x27;s not uncomfortable to sleep with, though it will feel cumbersome at first.  This morning, heel pain was less intense.  I will update my review after two weeks.  I&#x27;m feeling hopeful that the healing process is finally taking place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two weeks later:&lt;br /&gt;The night splint has helped with the healing.  I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m pain free, but I feel that the pain is lessened and it&#x27;s just going to take time.  Put the night splint on to watch TV at night.  I&#x27;ve talked with a few other people who&#x27;ve had PF and they confirmed that it&#x27;s a long healing process, and can take up to a year.  In the meantime, I will continue with the night splint as it does help in the mornings when I first start to walk.  One last thought, try to stay off your feet as much as possible while you&#x27;re in pain with PF.  As someone who is a regular exerciser, it&#x27;s next to torture to not be able to be as active.  I will do all the things that will promote healing and I look forward to a few months from now when I can start back in to my regular routine at the gym and outside.</li>
            <li> I just received this and am trying it for Plantar Fascitis per my doctor&#x27;s recommendation. I was pleasantly surprised with how lightweight these are. I have very muscular legs for a woman and these fit great around the calves. I wear a size 6 - 7 shoe (depending on brand, style, etc.) and these are perfect. My toes do not hang over but are right at the front of the splint. The straps have quick release which is also nice. Overall, this is very comfortable for such a seemingly bulky item. So far I am very pleased and hope these aid in fixing my problem.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help my recovery for a one inch tear in my tendon.  It has been wonderful!  I takes some getting used to while sleeping.  But after a couple of weeks I wouldn&#x27;t have given it up for anything!</li>
            <li> I returned, to hard to sleep with it on</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get it to fit. Wasted money.</li>
            <li> I have had plantar fasciitis for almost a year.  Bought the custom orthotics only to find they are not a cure.  Did all the exercises that are recommended on various websites.  They help a little but not much.  Then I broke down and purchased this night splint with not much hope.  It is a challenge to sleep with but something you can get used to.  I started out the first night waking after two hours of sleep and taking the thing off, second night lasted 4 hours, etc.  After each night though I noticed some relief.  I am at about two weeks in now and I have to say it has made a big difference.  I still have some pain here and there throughout the day but it&#x27;s not all the time and appears to be less frequent as time goes by.  There are times when I forget about the pain completely.  The fact that I am writing this says a lot.  I want people who have plantar fasciitis and are giving up and resigned to the pain to try just one more thing.  It might be the answer for you.  It was for me.  Good luck and good health.</li>
            <li> How can we not LOVE it when this pair cost $40. and after insurance the pair from the orthopedic company cost $150. YES AFTER INSURANCE! They were over $700 originally!!  These are just the same type of thing and just as good - hubby says actually better. She outgrew those and we thought we should try these first and glad we did. That is such a rip off to the insurance company (and then those footing the bills to the insurance company).  So even without insurance, we saved $100.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We do not even use these for Plantar Fascitis.  These are for our 7 year old daughter in-toeing. She walks on her toes and turns her feet with toes in. They are a little bulky but so what - she needs them anyway.  She can wear them to bed but we have making her wear them around the house some too to make up for all the time she wasn&#x27;t using any. Retraining her feet essentially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her whole thigh/leg rotates in (excessively flexible - she can turn her leg backwards basically) - so we just wish they sold a brace for that!!  We&#x27;d buy that in a heartbeat too!</li>
            <li> To large for a women 7 size foot.</li>
            <li> I was having very severe pain in my heel.  I have been wearing this while sleeping for several weeks, and it does seem to be helping some.  It is easy to get off and on.  It is padded, so it isn&#x27;t too uncomfortable while sleeping. It seems sturdy enough, but I am hoping I don&#x27;t have to wear it forever!</li>
            <li> The adjustability of this splint is great- I have a very small and narrow women&#x27;s size 6 foot and was able to adjust it to fit perfectly. There was no sleeping in it, however. It&#x27;s bulky and made from hard plastic- I couldn&#x27;t get comfortable enough with it to fall asleep. But wearing it while awake (as long as you don&#x27;t try to walk on it) does really allow good stretching of the plantar fascia. I am pleased with the value for the price.</li>
            <li> Seemed Ok at first. One of the straps that held up toes broke -- you cannot walk with the splint on -- straps are not that heavy duty to take the stress.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had or used this for too long yet.  I first night I slept in this I woke up after an hour of sleep feeling like someone was trying to break my leg.  I attributed that to being a novice that using this this type of device.  The second time (night) I used this I again woke up in the middle of the night trying desperately to remove this harness as my circulation was being cut off and I was getting muscle cramps in other parts of my leg (something that very rarely has ever happened to me.).  I think I&#x27;m going to try to use this while watching a movie or taking a short nap - not during my usual night&#x27;s sleep.  I think this may help me in the long run.  I just have to find the right time/place to wear it.</li>
            <li> This product has helped with reducing some of the pain experienced in the morning. When the splint is worn nightly it starts to cause issues with other parts of your foot as it is not in a normal position.  Yes, sleeping with it takes some getting used to.  I am continuing use as I hope as part of a comprehensive treatment plan this will aide in recovery but I would not recommend as a product that alleviates the issue.</li>
            <li> I had to gradually get used to wearing it the whole night. I worked up to it. It really put me on the right path to recovery from plantar fascitis. Used it a month.</li>
            <li> Much lighter and not as tight fitting as the orthopedic prescribed walking boot so it is much easier and less cumbersome to sleep in. But do not try to walk in it, like if you get up at night to use the bathroom. It also stays clean this way so you don&#x27;t mind putting it in your bed. This boot keeps you from twisting or stretching your foot in your sleep and unconsciously reinjuring the plantar fascia, keeping your ankle slightly flexed . I wear a woman&#x27;s size 7-7 1/2 shoe, and the sizing recommendations for a small are correct. I would absolutely not go a size up as some reviewers suggested.</li>
            <li> Would like to return it. It does not fit well. I bough ti fro my aunt. I guess you have to try this kind of product in a store as it is not a one size fits all kind of item. Waste of money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I had bought this! I had injured myself in a race and had severe heel pain which is caused from Plantar Fasciitis. I tried pretty much from icing it,rolling it,stretching and nothing seem to work. I was getting inpatient from not running so looked into a night splint. I came across this one from a friend of mine and works fantastic!!! I still wear this at night. At first it felt a little uncomfortable but not bad at all. I still wear this all night and things are finally improving and almost healed completely!! Would highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Works fine - my foot goes to sleep in it and it gets painful sometimes, and I also take off in my sleep, but works better than anything else I&#x27;ve used - and I&#x27;ve used a lot!</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it a 4 star rating was due to the boot being bulky when sleeping in it.  It is not very comfortable due to being bulky, but it does work.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. My food kept sliding. They have free returns th .</li>
            <li> This fits my 6 1/2 foot well. But can see it being too small if you sometime go to a 71/2. Difficult to sleep in. Cannot seem to get the straps right to keep my foot in correct position without falling asleep.</li>
            <li> The splint appears to be well made but was just too big for me. Even with a thick sock I couldn&#x27;t tighten the straps enough to hold my foot in place.</li>
            <li> Splint as described and is durable. I find it difficult to sleep in. I can wear it for approximately four hours.</li>
            <li> I use when I sleeping and its very uncomfortable.  But everyone is different</li>
            <li> I wish I could figure out a way to make it fit better, I am sure it would help me more</li>
            <li> Short of getting a removable cast that is custom fit to my leg, this thing is the best at the thigns I&#x27;ve tried for holding my foot at enough of an angle. It isn&#x27;t five start not because the product itself has any problems but because it is just so hard to sleep in that thing. I wish there were a better solution.</li>
            <li> Big and cumbersome but have made a world of difference for my plantar fascitis!  They work better than anything else I have used and are the only ones that don&#x27;t wake me up in the middle of the night wanting to throw them off.  Other kinds I have used I would have to make really lose to not wake me up, but this boot I could adjust and it doesn&#x27;t irritate the top of my foot, or squeeze my toes.</li>
            <li> Almost identical to the one they offered me at the foot &amp; ankle clinic at less than half the price.  Sleeping with it does make my plantar fasciitis less painful in the mornings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 8/29/13: I wore the split nightly for about 3 months. While my feet will still hurt after excessive use, they have improved greatly. I&#x27;m no longer wearing the splint but am keeping it around in case it gets worse again. This splint was a god-send. I&#x27;m able to be more active again because I no longer have to wonder if my feet will be able to take me where I need to go.</li>
            <li> This splint keeps your foot in the flexed position while sleeping. Helps to stretch the planter fasciitis tendon.</li>
            <li> I end up taking it off in the middle of the night cause it makes my toes go numb and is super uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> This splint has been very helpful in reducing pain but it is difficult to make it through a full night of sleep with it on. In addition to the splint, I have been icing the bottom of my foot, doing calf stretches, and seeing my chiropractor for ultrasound and therapeutic massage of my foot/calf.</li>
            <li> My doctor told me these splints would help my feet and relieve the pain from plantar fascitis, and she was RIGHT! I wake up pain free, and sleep all night - would buy them again if I had to.</li>
            <li> Finally got relief... the one type of treatment that actually works. Highly recommend this!!</li>
            <li> Foot much better right away I use it periodically now and the price is great I use it for traveling and that rally helps as I have Ms and the leg I use it on really likes to spasm when seated for a long time which aggravates the plantar fasciitis</li>
            <li> was a gift to a friend because i ordered wrong size and knew someone who could use very nicely made</li>
            <li> This is a bulky device, and too big and bulky for me to wear in bed. However, this is really great for wearing while sitting down in the evening for a few hours. It really helps to keep the fibers in the foot stretched, and there is not that big initial pain in the foot when stepping on your foot for the first time after not using it for a few hours. It&#x27;s actually very comfy to wear and it is a big help for tired feet.</li>
            <li> After having foot pain for months, and feeling like I was standing barefoot on a marble, I purchased my boot. After just two nights sleeping with the boot, my foot felt much better when standing on it first thing in the morning. The fit is very comfortable, and I like that It can be adjusted to flex the foot more as the tendon stretches.</li>
            <li> This night splint is everything that I needed. My heels had been bothering me to the point where I started walking on my toes which then bruised my toes! I started researching and found out I had Plantar Fascitis then started looked for treatments. I found this night splint and was a bit reluctant to order because it was a bit more than I wanted to spend but it was so worth the money! I ordered the small because I have tiny feet (size 6) and its great. It&#x27;s a perfect fit and feels so comfy to sleep with on. After a night&#x27;s sleep, you will feel a difference and feel much better. Great buy, would recommend to anyone with Plantar Fascitis!</li>
            <li> Fit well. Has adjustable Velcro straps for width of foot. It did seem like it did not keep foot flat. Has a little increased tension on the  tendon. The toes point more so towards the body to the slightest. Foot did feel better when I stood in am.</li>
