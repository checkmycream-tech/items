            <li>The product is good, smaller than I thought but the smell and quality is all good.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and smells great.</li>
            <li>will say though, if you have hair that gets greasy easily, these are not for you.</li>
            <li>I live in Chicago, and in this country we have a lot of good products here.</li>
            <li>I love it so much!!</li>
            <li>They smell so good and my hair is so soft to touch.</li>
            <li>very nice shampoo/condidtioner - BIG bottles</li>
            <li>My hair is healthy and it does have an affect of dampening down the fly aways I tend to get with frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to find this on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>1st week of use: really excited.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo, doesn&#x27;t dry my hair.</li>
            <li>This damage care set is amazing and I am so glad that I will be to purchase these products from Amazon in the future.</li>
            <li>I live in Texas and it&#x27;s wonderful on my dry and colored hair.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner make my hair feel soft and nice, which is what I wanted since I feel</li>
            <li>But they leave my hair so nice and soft.</li>
            <li>The bottles do look cool though, so there&#x27;s that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s seriously the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used on my color-treated hair</li>
            <li>I dyed my hair a day before the shampoo and conditioner came, so I was lucky.</li>
            <li>My hair got super silky.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even sure if it is a new and full one.</li>
            <li>I could see the difference from the very first time.</li>
            <li>This product sold on Amazon is exactly like the original one</li>
            <li>are working very well and so smooth.</li>
            <li>I love how soft and manageable it&#x27;s made my hair.</li>
            <li>After doing a quick research on the hair products, I decided to give it a try myself as I wanted to see what the results would be after my first application...</li>
            <li>No more dry ends, easy to manage hair, and wonderful smell.</li>
            <li>We have tried so many different shampoos, truly this is the only kind that makes her hair look like a million bucks .</li>
            <li>and it makes your hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I first tried this while on a trip  to Japan.  </li>
            <li>The bottles are big compared to my favorite shampoo from  the Body Shop.  </li>
            <li>When it ran out I was concerned that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find it again, or that if I was able to find it, the product itself would be different from the Japanese product.  </li>
            <li>First time to use</li>
            <li>Even my husband has stolen some ;]</li>
            <li>This is a great product for damage thick hair.</li>
            <li>stopped using after a month and hair back to be healthy and not fall off anymore.</li>
            <li>I did read all the reviews prior to trying it and I am so glad that I canceled my WEN gallon order to try this product.</li>
            <li>She had gushed that the Tsubaki shampoos had made her hair soft, smooth and feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li>I first discovered this brand while on vacation in Japan.  </li>
            <li>It was stocked by our hotel and for the first time in years my hair was behaving after I started using it.  </li>
            <li>So I first hesitated to order, but I decided to try.</li>
            <li>being an Asian in USA, really cannot find a suitable shampoo or conditioner, so I have to buy these Shiseido online, luckily, they turned out to be very good, though the price is a little bit high, but they do cure my hair (previous damaged by USA&#x27;s hair products)</li>
            <li>Trust me when I say that before this shampoo, my wavy hair was like a freaking birds nest and tangled so easily even after a deep conditioner treatment.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to put up with dry hair anymore :)</li>
            <li>Makes my hair so soft, shiny, and it is super hydrating.</li>
            <li>My hair is more full now and moistured, just like few years ago before I spoilt my hair with all this colouring business.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very soothing; much like Johnson&#x27;s shampoo in my opinion.</li>
            <li>much less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>like I damaged my hair a bit when I dye it so much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are both very hydrating, in a deceiving way.</li>
            <li>very drying; after using it, i got dandruff</li>
            <li>Because it will make your hair very oily and yuck.</li>
            <li>Love it, makes my hair soft and the conditioner doesn&#x27;t leave a bulky greasy residue at all, my hairdresser recommended it to me last summer</li>
            <li>I have used this one and the Shining (Red) version of these shampoo/conditioner sets, and this is my favorite by far.</li>
            <li>Normally it would tangle, but not in this case!</li>
            <li>I would say that to get my ends looking as nice as this duo leaves them, I would have had to use straight up coconut oil in the past.</li>
            <li>It made my hair soft while I was washing it, but didn&#x27;t leave my hair looking healthy when it was dry.  </li>
            <li>Strongly recommend for people who have very dry or even damaged hair.</li>
            <li>First of all, the bottles are very big, and the price very reasonable.</li>
            <li>This set is such a great deal, arrived EARLIER than the expected date, and also works wonders!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think i will ever switch back to anything else ordering my second set to make sure I won&#x27;t ever run out ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
            <li>I have colored hair and this keeps everything all healthy and shiny without being too heavy on my very curly hair.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it may be only week of me trying this product; however I did notice the benefits in only one use.</li>
            <li>My hair turned out well enough, but there wasn&#x27;t a big difference between these products and any other pretty good shampoo and conditioner IMO.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Hair feels soft and conditioned!!</li>
            <li>I have tried sooo many shampoos; cheap, expensive and nothing has ever really fully met my expectations.</li>
            <li>After rinsing the product out of my hair completely, I then applied massaged a generous quarter sized amount of conditioner to my long thick hair and made sure to focus more on the ends.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is smooth and fairly thin, allowing it to lather easily.</li>
            <li>After showering, I did notice that my hair felt very refreshed and my fingers were able to actually glide through my hair while wet!</li>
            <li>2nd week, hair starts to feel a little dry, but still smell great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells</li>
            <li>hair products along with high end international salon products that all promise the same thing, but none have really compared to my first experience with the Shiseido Tsubaki Damage Care Set that I became curious of when an acquaintance of mine made a recent trip to Japan and gushed about her love for Japan hair products by Shiseido that was given as gifts during her stay at a hotel.</li>
            <li>3rd week and later, start to recognize a significant amount of hair loss.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the directions of these products are in Japanese, based on reviews and research, the directions are pretty self-explanatory.</li>
            <li>Frangrance is a little strong</li>
            <li>And I have been looking for a reasonable priced shampoo and conditioner that does not dry it out.</li>
            <li>The product seems to be authentic and works and smells the same as my previous one.</li>
            <li>Secondly, I like how they look in my shower, they even have little ridges at the top to tell which one is shampoo and which one conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My permed damaged hair feels soft and conditioned afterwards.</li>
            <li>Will definitely purchase again and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>These products made my hair alive again.</li>
            <li>I kept the product in for about 3-5 and then rinsed out completely.</li>
            <li>However,  if you have oily hair I would say stay far away from this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have very long, very dry hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li>far as performance, I&#x27;d say I like the shampoo more than the conditioner, which is just not rich enough for my dry hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is dry and break very eaaily .</li>
            <li>and I dry it straight.  </li>
            <li>Once my hair dried naturally, my hair felt extremely soft and looked very shiny!</li>
            <li>/&gt;However the only downside is, like others have mentioned, it does make your hair feel rather oily if you naturally have an oily scalp.</li>
            <li>have wavy hair and with the other shampoos i have used it looks super dry and frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would  highly recommend these product if you have dry unmanageable hair.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to use too much like I do with other brands of shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li>My mom has thinner hair that is not dry, and these were too hydrating for her.</li>
            <li>As long as you sell this product I will be buying it for me and 10 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>Very subtle and clean, and the formula is quite foamy so you actually don&#x27;t need to use much even if you have long hair like</li>

            <li> It made my hair soft while I was washing it, but didn&#x27;t leave my hair looking healthy when it was dry.  </li>
            <li> Strongly recommend for people who have very dry or even damaged hair.</li>
            <li> First of all, the bottles are very big, and the price very reasonable.</li>
            <li> This set is such a great deal, arrived EARLIER than the expected date, and also works wonders!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think i will ever switch back to anything else ordering my second set to make sure I won&#x27;t ever run out ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
            <li> I have colored hair and this keeps everything all healthy and shiny without being too heavy on my very curly hair.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it may be only week of me trying this product; however I did notice the benefits in only one use.</li>
            <li> My hair turned out well enough, but there wasn&#x27;t a big difference between these products and any other pretty good shampoo and conditioner IMO.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Hair feels soft and conditioned!!</li>
            <li> I have tried sooo many shampoos; cheap, expensive and nothing has ever really fully met my expectations.</li>
            <li> After rinsing the product out of my hair completely, I then applied massaged a generous quarter sized amount of conditioner to my long thick hair and made sure to focus more on the ends.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is smooth and fairly thin, allowing it to lather easily.</li>
            <li> After showering, I did notice that my hair felt very refreshed and my fingers were able to actually glide through my hair while wet!</li>
            <li> 2nd week, hair starts to feel a little dry, but still smell great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells</li>
            <li> hair products along with high end international salon products that all promise the same thing, but none have really compared to my first experience with the Shiseido Tsubaki Damage Care Set that I became curious of when an acquaintance of mine made a recent trip to Japan and gushed about her love for Japan hair products by Shiseido that was given as gifts during her stay at a hotel.</li>
            <li> 3rd week and later, start to recognize a significant amount of hair loss.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the directions of these products are in Japanese, based on reviews and research, the directions are pretty self-explanatory.</li>
            <li> Frangrance is a little strong</li>
            <li> And I have been looking for a reasonable priced shampoo and conditioner that does not dry it out.</li>
            <li> The product seems to be authentic and works and smells the same as my previous one.</li>
            <li> Secondly, I like how they look in my shower, they even have little ridges at the top to tell which one is shampoo and which one conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My permed damaged hair feels soft and conditioned afterwards.</li>
            <li> Will definitely purchase again and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> These products made my hair alive again.</li>
            <li> I kept the product in for about 3-5 and then rinsed out completely.</li>
            <li> However,  if you have oily hair I would say stay far away from this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have very long, very dry hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li> far as performance, I&#x27;d say I like the shampoo more than the conditioner, which is just not rich enough for my dry hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry and break very eaaily .</li>
            <li> and I dry it straight.  </li>
            <li> Once my hair dried naturally, my hair felt extremely soft and looked very shiny!</li>
            <li> /&gt;However the only downside is, like others have mentioned, it does make your hair feel rather oily if you naturally have an oily scalp.</li>
            <li> have wavy hair and with the other shampoos i have used it looks super dry and frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would  highly recommend these product if you have dry unmanageable hair.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to use too much like I do with other brands of shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> My mom has thinner hair that is not dry, and these were too hydrating for her.</li>
            <li> As long as you sell this product I will be buying it for me and 10 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> Very subtle and clean, and the formula is quite foamy so you actually don&#x27;t need to use much even if you have long hair like</li>
            <li> I think I will keep looking because this shampoo and conditioner make hair oily quickly and washing hair every day is not good.</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry and fragile and this has really helped to soften and add shine my hair,  without weighing my hair down.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even have to use a flat iron!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and finding a good, thick moisturizing conditioner is iffy - but just a few pumps is all I need</li>
            <li> you have a sensitive scalp and have dandruff, I would recommend you use this product 2-3 times a week or less rather than every day.</li>
            <li> I have very dry and britle hair, that is been coloured multiple times.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t use a flat/curling iron, rarely or never blow dry or chemically treat your hair, I would suggest you try the regular Tsubaki shampoo/conditioner in the red bottle that deep cleans, clarifies and adds shine to your locks.</li>
            <li> Also, this is just the cherry on top, but my hair used to break and fall out like crazy, and since I started using this, it has fallen out</li>
            <li> so this set lasts me a long time.  </li>
            <li> It did not take long at all.</li>
            <li> They are truly for people with dry and damaged hair.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind shelling out a few extra bucks for your hair care, I would definitely try this out!d either way.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind shelling out a few extra bucks for your hair care, I would definitely try this out!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t keep them all down, but it definitely has a noticeable affect.</li>
            <li> I allowed the shampoo to sit in my wet hair for about 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li> its not what I expected,.</li>
            <li> I use a curling iron every other day</li>
            <li> I am not sure what is my hair texture; however I do have curly mixed hair texture.</li>
            <li> and I also use a flat iron regularly, so my hair was a mess, very dry, dull and limp.</li>
            <li> Simple solutions to this are to always blow-dry (your roots at least) and focus any hair creams or serums at your ends.</li>
            <li> shampoo I have ever used, hands down.</li>
            <li> I received the items in less than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> (red is hard to maintain!)</li>
            <li> When my son and daughter-in-law were visiting from Japan she left behind this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> agree with a major of reviewers: make your hair fall off like crazy.</li>
            <li> Works well for my thick, curly hair.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it, makes my hair soft and the conditioner doesn&#x27;t leave a bulky greasy residue at all, my hairdresser recommended it to me last summer and I have been using it ever since, it&#x27;s the only shampoo/conditioner that I have been continually happy with!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it! I thought i should try it to and it makes your hair soft and smooth. XD Seems to work for all types of hair too. I recommend this for both women and men.</li>
            <li> I first tried this while on a trip  to Japan.  I loved how smooth and clean my hair was and took the time to remember the brand.  I was so excited to find this on Amazon.  I live in Texas and it&#x27;s wonderful on my dry and colored hair.  Also smells great. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love this set! The smell is a pleasant, sweet floral smell and my hair feels silky and beautiful after every wash and blowdry.  I use a curling iron every other day so you can imagine the heat I impose on it, but this conditioner is awesome and I feel like it replaces any damage to my hair, while also protecting it from further damage.  I have thick hair and finding a good, thick moisturizing conditioner is iffy - but just a few pumps is all I need so this set lasts me a long time.  I&#x27;ve been using this set for almost a year now and I won&#x27;t go back.  It&#x27;s seriously the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used on my color-treated hair and it&#x27;s in the best condition ever.</li>
            <li> The product is great but when I get the shampoo, it has already been opened.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and conditioner for the price. The bottles are big compared to my favorite shampoo from  the Body Shop.  It made my hair soft while I was washing it, but didn&#x27;t leave my hair looking healthy when it was dry.  Reason I bought it was to give moisture to my hair. I think I will keep looking because this shampoo and conditioner make hair oily quickly and washing hair every day is not good.</li>
            <li> Used this brand for the last six months.  Works well for my thick, curly hair.  Smells nice and I don&#x27;t have to use too much like I do with other brands of shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> The shampoo deserves five stars but the price caused it to drop one. The shampoo is smooth and fairly thin, allowing it to lather easily. The fragrance is very soothing; much like Johnson&#x27;s shampoo in my opinion. I dyed my hair a day before the shampoo and conditioner came, so I was lucky. The shampoo and conditioner did my hair justice!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.  When my son and daughter-in-law were visiting from Japan she left behind this shampoo.  I gave it a try and loved it.  When it ran out I was concerned that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find it again, or that if I was able to find it, the product itself would be different from the Japanese product.  This product sold on Amazon is exactly like the original one my daughter-in-law brought from Japan and gives me silky, shiny hair. No more dry ends, easy to manage hair, and wonderful smell.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo, doesn&#x27;t dry my hair. Love it.</li>
            <li> First time to use and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> The best smelling shampoo/conditioner!</li>
            <li> Love this set. My permed damaged hair feels soft and conditioned afterwards. Frangrance is a little strong but I don&#x27;t mind it.</li>
            <li> This is my thrid time ordering this shampoo and conditioner. Like the quality. They protect my hair from damaging and drying. Strongly recommend for people who have very dry or even damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product - Makes my hair manageable and shiny.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think i have ever seen my hair look this healthy.&lt;br /&gt;I have wavy hair and with the other shampoos i have used it looks super dry and frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think i will ever switch back to anything else ordering my second set to make sure I won&#x27;t ever run out ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
            <li> UPDATE 3-17-2016: I recently purchased this shampoo again and just want to mention that the packaging has changed, but the ingredients are the same. The product seems to be authentic and works and smells the same as my previous one. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it just for a simple package change.&lt;br /&gt;************************************************&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so in love with this shampoo! I have tried sooo many shampoos; cheap, expensive and nothing has ever really fully met my expectations. I tried this shampoo as I was searching for something to quench my poor, damage hair. I dye my hair every month or so (red is hard to maintain!) So my hair isn&#x27;t in the best condition, but immediately upon my FIRST use, I swear I felt the difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells heavenly. Very subtle and clean, and the formula is quite foamy so you actually don&#x27;t need to use much even if you have long hair like me.&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner is just as amazing. I love how soft and manageable it&#x27;s made my hair. Trust me when I say that before this shampoo, my wavy hair was like a freaking birds nest and tangled so easily even after a deep conditioner treatment. Also, this is just the cherry on top, but my hair used to break and fall out like crazy, and since I started using this, it has fallen out much less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best shampoo I have ever used, hands down. Will definitely purchase again and I highly recommend it! Even my husband has stolen some ;]</li>
            <li> wart polecenia. nawilza I pieknie pachnie</li>
            <li> I LOVE this set. I have used this one and the Shining (Red) version of these shampoo/conditioner sets, and this is my favorite by far. I have colored hair and this keeps everything all healthy and shiny without being too heavy on my very curly hair.</li>
            <li> I love the scent that it leaves on my hair! I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells and it&#x27;s not too overwhelming which I love. The shampoo and conditioner make my hair feel soft and nice, which is what I wanted since I feel like I damaged my hair a bit when I dye it so much. I don&#x27;t have to put up with dry hair anymore :)</li>
            <li> very nice shampoo/condidtioner - BIG bottles</li>
            <li> I have very long, very dry hair that tangles easily. And I have been looking for a reasonable priced shampoo and conditioner that does not dry it out. And I think I have found it in these two. First of all, the bottles are very big, and the price very reasonable. Secondly, I like how they look in my shower, they even have little ridges at the top to tell which one is shampoo and which one conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are both very hydrating, in a deceiving way. The shampoo lathers up quite a bit, and the conditioner is rather thin, not like those ones filled with silicones. But they leave my hair so nice and soft. I would say that to get my ends looking as nice as this duo leaves them, I would have had to use straight up coconut oil in the past. Which is a hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before this, I used the Alterna shampoos and conditioners, and these blow them out of the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say though, if you have hair that gets greasy easily, these are not for you. My mom has thinner hair that is not dry, and these were too hydrating for her. They are truly for people with dry and damaged hair. But a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I have bleached hair. They were so damaged and another shampoo didn&#x27;t work well but but this shampoo and conditioner are awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Both are working very well and so smooth. My hair getting softer and full.&lt;br /&gt;Very good products. Please try.</li>
            <li> So this shampoo and conditioner smell awesome. Not quite floral but not quite 100% citrus. Not overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as performance, I&#x27;d say I like the shampoo more than the conditioner, which is just not rich enough for my dry hair. My hair turned out well enough, but there wasn&#x27;t a big difference between these products and any other pretty good shampoo and conditioner IMO. I will use them up but I won&#x27;t order them again. The bottles do look cool though, so there&#x27;s that.</li>
            <li> This made my scalp hurt and some of my hair fall out. I switched and my hair is started to grow back. I must have had an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> This set is such a great deal, arrived EARLIER than the expected date, and also works wonders! I can&#x27;t remember a time when my hair felt and looked so healthy. Also the SMELL is so wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However the only downside is, like others have mentioned, it does make your hair feel rather oily if you naturally have an oily scalp. Simple solutions to this are to always blow-dry (your roots at least) and focus any hair creams or serums at your ends.</li>
            <li> Just amazing. I have very dry and britle hair, that is been coloured multiple times. These products made my hair alive again. I could see the difference from the very first time. My hair is more full now and moistured, just like few years ago before I spoilt my hair with all this colouring business. I would 100% recomend it.</li>
            <li> very drying; after using it, i got dandruff</li>
            <li> No complains. I have course ( Indian hair)  it looks like you used a relaxer. This is a great product for damage thick hair. My hair is dry and break very eaaily . This product is a hair rescue .</li>
            <li> agree with a major of reviewers: make your hair fall off like crazy. 1st week of use: really excited. My hair is soft and smells great. 2nd week, hair starts to feel a little dry, but still smell great. 3rd week and later, start to recognize a significant amount of hair loss. stopped using after a month and hair back to be healthy and not fall off anymore.</li>
            <li> This damage care set is amazing and I am so glad that I will be to purchase these products from Amazon in the future. I did read all the reviews prior to trying it and I am so glad that I canceled my WEN gallon order to try this product. I love the smell and it may be only week of me trying this product; however I did notice the benefits in only one use. As long as you sell this product I will be buying it for me and 10 year old daughter. I am not sure what is my hair texture; however I do have curly mixed hair texture.</li>
            <li> The items are already opened and broken.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many &amp;#34;Made in USA&amp;#34; hair products along with high end international salon products that all promise the same thing, but none have really compared to my first experience with the Shiseido Tsubaki Damage Care Set that I became curious of when an acquaintance of mine made a recent trip to Japan and gushed about her love for Japan hair products by Shiseido that was given as gifts during her stay at a hotel. She had gushed that the Tsubaki shampoos had made her hair soft, smooth and feeling refreshed. After doing a quick research on the hair products, I decided to give it a try myself as I wanted to see what the results would be after my first application...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the directions of these products are in Japanese, based on reviews and research, the directions are pretty self-explanatory.

I can imagine that this would break you out as I&#x27;ve read reviews that this has happened to some folks. If you don&#x27;t use a flat/curling iron, rarely or never blow dry or chemically treat your hair, I would suggest you try the regular Tsubaki shampoo/conditioner in the red bottle that deep cleans, clarifies and adds shine to your locks. Some folks say it smells better, but in my opinion, they both smell good either way. If you don&#x27;t mind shelling out a few extra bucks for your hair care, I would definitely try this out!d either way. If you don&#x27;t mind shelling out a few extra bucks for your hair care, I would definitely try this out!</li>
            <li> being an Asian in USA, really cannot find a suitable shampoo or conditioner, so I have to buy these Shiseido online, luckily, they turned out to be very good, though the price is a little bit high, but they do cure my hair (previous damaged by USA&#x27;s hair products)</li>
            <li> Great product.  Both have a lovely smell and consistency and most importantly, of course, they work great - doing exactly what they are supposed to do.  Hair feels soft and conditioned!! I have coarse, curly hair that has highlights and I dry it straight.  Shampoo and conditioner work like a charm.  I&#x27;m buying it a second time.</li>
            <li> I first discovered this brand while on vacation in Japan.  It was stocked by our hotel and for the first time in years my hair was behaving after I started using it.  I bought some and brought it home with me (who goes to Japan to stock up on shampoo and conditioner?  - this girl).  With my stock running low I will be purchasing these replacements.  My hair is healthy and it does have an affect of dampening down the fly aways I tend to get with frizzy hair.  It doesn&#x27;t keep them all down, but it definitely has a noticeable affect.</li>
            <li> I use this on my granddaughters hair. It&#x27;s the best !!! We have tried so many different shampoos, truly this is the only kind that makes her hair look like a million bucks .</li>
            <li> Love smell! My hair got super silky.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the Shiseido Tsubaki shampoo and conditioner.  My hair is very dry and fragile and this has really helped to soften and add shine my hair,  without weighing my hair down.  I would  highly recommend these product if you have dry unmanageable hair.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. Makes my hair so soft, shiny, and it is super hydrating. It smells divine too! I colour my hair all the time and I also use a flat iron regularly, so my hair was a mess, very dry, dull and limp. But this shampoo, after just one wash, totally gave life to my hair! I love it so much!! I would recommend this to anyone with damaged hair. However,  if you have oily hair I would say stay far away from this stuff. Because it will make your hair very oily and yuck.</li>
            <li> The product is good, smaller than I thought but the smell and quality is all good. However, when it is delivered, one of them is open and there is shampoo or conditioner all over the bottle and inside the box. I&#x27;m not even sure if it is a new and full one.</li>
            <li> Love it. My sister told me about this one. I live in Chicago, and in this country we have a lot of good products here. So I first hesitated to order, but I decided to try. It did not take long at all. I received the items in less than 2 weeks. After I tried, I love it. They smell so good and my hair is so soft to touch. Love it, I will order agin when I finish.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! I get compliments on my hair all the time!</li>
            <li> its not what I expected,. doesn&#x27;t make my hair anything... and the label doesnt have English translation</li>
