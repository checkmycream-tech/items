            <li> I was thrilled to be able to obtain salon quality products at a lower price ! I will continue to purchase this .</li>
            <li> I love all L&#x27;Oreal products and this is no exception.</li>
            <li> The only hair conditioner I will use.</li>
            <li> This product was not worth the money. I still have half a bottle of the shampoo left. As far as color fade goes, my stylist asked me why my gold looked so brassy this time around. I tried a sample of the Intense Repair masque. I will try that with the matching shampoo next time.</li>
            <li> I like this product but it was written in other languages besides english.  I do not know the directions, so i used it like i would any conditioner.</li>
            <li> This may cost a little more than other brands from a salon, but it is well worth the money.  It leaves my hair silky and the color shines and I get asked quite a bit if I have highlighted my hair ... and that&#x27;s after I had it done weeks ago!  You should try it!</li>
            <li> Thank you for providing such great prices and deals on your site.  Love to shop from home to get what I need and I don&#x27;t need to leave my house and fight traffic!</li>
            <li> Got a free sample at my salon and loved it so much that I needed to purchase. Hair is silky smooth with no greasy or heavy feeling! Highly suggest</li>
            <li> Is great for colored hair.  My hair is long, dark and a little dry makes it feel so soft and looks great.  Have used this product over 2 years and will not use anything else.  Try the shampoo goes great together!</li>
            <li> I have been using this conditioner for a while. I&#x27;d thought I&#x27;d cut corners and switch to a different conditioner. How much different could it be. My curls went from soft, curly and pretty to looking like a bad perm. I will never switch again this works great with my colored naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> This line was recommended by my hair stylist and is hard to find. It is pricey but lasts a long time and keeps my hair hydrated. I have straight, short, blonde foiled hair and have used this for years.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  My straight hair is silky, shiny and smells wonderful.  Use with the Vitamino shampoo.  Worth the price</li>
            <li> This conditioner is a dream! I haven&#x27;t found any conditioner that can tame and soften my  fine/curly hair anywhere near this product. Reduces frizz drastically!</li>
            <li> I did not like the conditioner at all. I felt that it drag doen my hair. Perhaps this product isn&#x27;t for me. Or, it is a fake. I have used this line before - when i bought it from my hairdresser. And I figured I should order it online and save a couple bucks. But not worth it!</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for about 3 years and think it is one of the best conditioners out there - especially for color treated hair.  As a blonde, I am always looking for a product to moisturize and this is so good.</li>
            <li> Smells Good, is great for your hair, no alcohol in this product. The price is 3 times better than the salon prices. Especially if you set up on Subscribe and Save</li>
            <li> Good products, good price</li>
            <li> Excellent conditioner</li>
            <li> A bit pricey but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Great product... I am ordering it again!</li>
            <li> Good stuff for the price.</li>
            <li> I use this daily in conjunction with the shampoo from the same line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dyed hair, semi-permanent, oily scalp, am prone to frizziness, no natural shine, and my hair is easily weighed down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this conditioner, my color is rich, my hair is smooth, shiny, and has volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would call this a miracle conditioner, well worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive hair and dye it, this is the conditioner for you!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is wonderful for my ash blonde colored hair.  My first purchase was at my salon, where they highly recommended it.  My ends typically split and break off, and this definitely makes them soft, shiny and last a long time before any, IF any breakage takes place. Highly recommend for colored hair.</li>
            <li> Tried many conditioners for colored hair, and L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Expert is by far the best for my hair! Amazon delivered it quickly, too! Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Nothing special at all about this conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I came back to the Suave color care because in my hair it performs better.&lt;br /&gt;To me it was a waste of money, but maybe it will work for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
            <li> I have curly dry hair.  This conditioner really defines my curls and makes my hair soft.  I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it.</li>
            <li> My favorite conditioner.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and still can&#x27;t find one I like better.  I have long, fine, curly, color treated (highlights and lowlights) hair.  It&#x27;s light and does not weigh my hair down but still does the job.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair feeling silky smooth and looking shiny.  The red highlights in my hair seem to keep their color longer.</li>
            <li> Love this.  Revived my lifeless hair after coloring. However I found that a lot of hair came off during the wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used with paired Condtioner in set.  Recommend - esp after color treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have not yet used the 3rd item which is the Iron Finish TechniArt.</li>
            <li> Love this cream rinse and appreciate the sellers packaging.  Works great with Vitamino shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a number of years. I have tried others but I always come back to this---great conditioning and color protection.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product from my hair dresser, but it was much more expensive at the beauty salon.  I was happy to find it online; it arrived quickly and as described.</li>
            <li> bought this the first time at a clearance store. Absolutely loved it. did not know where to find it and my daughter gave me a gift certificate online to amazon and I found it there. Love the product. If you have dry, colored or frizzy hair, this one is for you. You don&#x27;t need a lot of it. When I use it, the water in my hair just squeezes out. My hair is silky and shiny. I have thick fine hair and no body, but with this product I have beautiful hair. If you have fine hair, do not use a lot and  do not use it near the scalp. lasts a long time. bought some for a friend and she loves it also</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy and you only need a little. I don&#x27;t need to use it every time I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> A nice product - leaves hair silky!</li>
            <li> Not worth the money at all</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal products are great quality and value.  At the hair salon, I pay so much more. Investing in good quality products when so much is spent on hair cut/color is worth it!  I highly recommend the conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so healthy and shines like the breck girl.:) why does it have to be so expensive! It tames my frizzys&lt;br /&gt;Away.</li>
            <li> Rinse-out daily-use conditioner to remove excess shampoo and keep hair in good condition without removing curls or body. Nice fragrance</li>
            <li> Great light conditioner for fine hair.  Doesn&#x27;t leave hair limp or feeling greasy. It also provides enough conditioning without drying your hair out.</li>
            <li> I have to change my previous review  to a very positive one. Since switching my shampoo to Nexus Therappe, this conditioner works beautifully and makes my hair very moisturized and smooth. No tangles, the combe slides right through it and I don&#x27;t need to use a lot. I highly recommend this,</li>
