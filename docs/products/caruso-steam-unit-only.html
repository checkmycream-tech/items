            <li>The Caruso Steam Curling System has always been one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Awesome</li>
            <li>The unit itself is great tho.</li>
            <li>Am happy</li>
            <li>If you want the Primo of Caruso curlers, go to eBay and buy the Happy Traveler one that uses salt.</li>
            <li>They had a great product then, so why improve on perfection?</li>
            <li>The Caruso Steam Unit works great.  </li>
            <li>WORKS GREAT.</li>
            <li>I bought this hair enhancer about a month ago, when my husband saw what it looked like he looked at me with great skepticism ....</li>
            <li>3 steamers, but in this length of time, I think that&#x27;s remarkable.  </li>
            <li>This is superior.</li>
            <li>Works well good steam and curls</li>
            <li>I remove the rollers, brush out the curls and am  good to go.  </li>
            <li>This unit arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li>Very fast delivery, everything perfect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Caruso every day for 4 or 5 years and love it!  </li>
            <li>Love my Caruso steam set!</li>
            <li>I have been cruising Amazon for this exact item for quite some time and was thrilled to see it for an excellent price.</li>
            <li>This amazing steamer adds shine to my curls.</li>
            <li>In order for me to get any kind of volume, I have to use curlers or a curling iron, but both damage my hair.</li>
            <li>This makes the curles stay in and is so easy to use!  </li>
            <li>Curls very fine hair and holds curl longer.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Caruso lookin good!</li>
            <li>Better than ANYTHING I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>and I just love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought so many of these...</li>
            <li>This steamer works better on my hair than the irons do.  </li>
            <li>I love this steam unit.</li>
            <li>I love the steam rollers.</li>
            <li>Most satisfied with unit and Amazon service.</li>
            <li>I love this steam unit and rollers.  </li>
            <li>love, love, love the Caruso Steam for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Stopped perms many years ago after finding this steamer.</li>
            <li>As much as I love the steam system I&#x27;m giving up.</li>
            <li>I went to beauty school (lol) after high school.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad to have found this on amazon, My original unit burned out, now my investment in all those steam curlers has been saved</li>
            <li>Easy on the hair, also.</li>
            <li>Very quick to heat up.  </li>
            <li>i have used the Caruso steam setter for many years and have found it to be a quick, easy setting tool for causal and evening styling.  </li>
            <li>if you need a new hair setter, don&#x27;t pass this one by, I have tried them all and this one works the best for me by far!</li>
            <li>I use it when my fine (frog fur) hair is a bit longer</li>
            <li>The salt ones were a huge bother to me.  </li>
            <li>So great that Amazon allows you to buy the steam unit or the curlers individually.  </li>
            <li>The first one lasted five years!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick, easy and like the results.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted, since I already have a healthy collection of the rollers.</li>
            <li>I love the Caruso hot roller steamer, but</li>
            <li>I had my original Caruso steam unit, the one where you add salt, for 3 years, now I can&#x27;t get through 3 weeks without it blowing some fuse or something.</li>
            <li>which is what I originally was looking for.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and stick straight.</li>
            <li>Very good for my wife&#x27;s everyday use</li>
            <li>I found the steamer unit stand alone without having to buy the whole kit (and more curlers) again.</li>
            <li>Mine broke after many years and I immediately purchased a new one.</li>
            <li>It is fast to use, and it is easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>I have been using it since the first time I bought the original system from an infomercial years ago.  </li>
            <li>This was one of the first ones I bought years ago, and lasts forever!</li>
            <li>My Caruso Steam Unit gave up the after some major miles, through many hair styles.&lt;br</li>
            <li>she loves this one very much</li>
            <li>If I could give it a higher rating I would.</li>
            <li>I have used them for more than ten years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these type of hot roller for almost 20 yrs.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Caruso Steam set and many extra curlers years ago when it first came on the market.</li>
            <li>I feel they work better than dry rollers.</li>
            <li>I tried ceramic, adjustable heat settings, and many different curling irons and dryers that was new on the market.</li>
            <li>My hair is short and fine</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and the Cariso steam unit is the only way my curls stay for a day or two.</li>
            <li>this steam system holds the curl in my extremely straight hair.</li>
            <li>With this unit, I am being very diligent in filling with distilled water</li>
            <li>I really like the Caruso hairsetter, as this is probably the 5th or 6th one I&#x27;ve gotten.</li>
            <li>I fill it up with water to the line that it shows and within seconds, it is ready to use.  </li>
            <li>used 6-8 curlers for my whole head.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can run my fingers through my hair as much as I want.&lt;br /&gt;There is never those bent ends of hair, curls just fall, I shake my head, move a curl or two with my fingers</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Caruso since the 90s because i have incredibly straight hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Thanks for having these .</li>
            <li>I still use my irons on some days when I want a more casual look but for work I have to look nice.    </li>
            <li>I had lots of rollers, the original steamer finally broke (it was dropped by one of my granddaughters)</li>
            <li>I had already purchased extra rollers with my original unit.</li>
            <li>It needs to warm up for at least 10 minutes and the rollers need to sit for 30-45 seconds each to get completely hot.  </li>
            <li>When my hair was much longer it was really fantastic looking and stayed all day long.     </li>
            <li>It is also super fast, low maintenance</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s a new advocate!</li>
            <li>so I just bought a new one!  </li>
            <li>When I use the medium to smaller rollers, this contraption gives me curl into the next day, If I use the jumbo rollers I get hair that is much less curly and wavy with a nice smooth texture.</li>
            <li>These sponge steam rollers are gentle, fast and make your hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>My wife swears by this style and when her old broke she was very upset.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find that I could order the unit only, because I have enough of the rollers to last a lifetime.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without my Caruso hairsetting system..</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live with out the Carusso Steam rollers.</li>
            <li>I purchased my first unit at the beauty supply store, but they do not offer units only.  </li>
            <li>even more so when I just need the steamer itself and not more rollers.</li>
            <li>By the time my last curler is in, I&#x27;m taking the first ones out.  </li>
            <li>new unit I received is not round like this picture.</li>
            <li>The original steamers used salt and last for a long time...</li>
            <li>However, I think they have a design flaw, do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t get tangled in the soft foam.</li>
            <li>Just like my old Caruso Steam unit (without the salt).&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Curls are soft and natural</li>
            <li>I tap it on a cloth after picking up the hot roller to tap out the accumulated moisture in the center.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, thin and pencil straight.  </li>
            <li>Does not dry my hair out like the old electric curlers used to.  </li>
            <li>However, this unit barely emits steam.  </li>
            <li>I want the old one back.</li>
            <li>Even though I love the convenience of stream rolling my hair and how well it works, I&#x27;m not happy with having to replace the machine every 6 months.</li>
            <li>Takes up a lot less space than the electric roller sets and much, much easier to use!</li>

            <li> Takes up a lot less space than the electric roller sets and much, much easier to use!</li>
            <li> I have very thick, straight American Indian hair that was prematurely gray hair before I could graduate high school.  </li>
            <li> It never holds a curl--will literally go flat after an hour regardless of products.</li>
            <li> It is very healthy on your hair, cutting down on damaging heat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a busy girl with little time to fuss with my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for probably close to 20 years, and as long at they still make them</li>
            <li> I use long hair clips to hold them, not the holders they come with.</li>
            <li> my curls don&#x27;t stay in very long</li>

            <li> I owned 4 Caruso Steam rollers, and they ALL stopped working after about 2 or 3 months. I like the idea of working with steam and not damaging your hair. However, I think they have a design flaw, do not waste your money. It is not worthed to repair , so you just throw money away.</li>
            <li> I have been using Caruso Steam rollers for over 20 years.  The units usually last 2-3 years before needing replacement.  I was thrilled to find that I could order the unit only, because I have enough of the rollers to last a lifetime.  However, this unit barely emits steam.  It needs to warm up for at least 10 minutes and the rollers need to sit for 30-45 seconds each to get completely hot.  I&#x27;m a busy girl with little time to fuss with my hair.</li>
            <li> Read alot about these curlers and they didn&#x27;t deliver the goods...had to send them back...also the steaming unit and the curlers were delivered from two different vendors making return difficult</li>
            <li> This Caruso Steam Unit is the ONLY thing I&#x27;ll ever use to curl my hair. If I could give it a higher rating I would. Doesn&#x27;t burn my fingers. I tap it on a cloth after picking up the hot roller to tap out the accumulated moisture in the center. 15 minutes is all that&#x27;s needed. Perfect results. Better than ANYTHING I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> This is hands-down one of the best inventions ever created. It is very healthy on your hair, cutting down on damaging heat. It is also super fast, low maintenance and I just love it. Mine broke after many years and I immediately purchased a new one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought so many of these...it&#x27;s the only hair curling system I like. They don&#x27;t damage your hair. The only issue I ever have with these is the clogging up or failing to steam. I still can&#x27;t remember if you&#x27;re suppose to use salt in the water or not...it&#x27;s been awhile since I&#x27;ve used them again. The unit itself is great tho. The only one I would consider using to curl my hair. I&#x27;ve been using Caruso for 25 years.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without my Caruso hairsetting system.. I have been using it since the first time I bought the original system from an infomercial years ago.  I used to then buy the hair setting system in beauty supply stores however they have stopped producing them I was told.  That&#x27;s when I decided to research on the computer and found I could still get them thru Amazon.  I do set my hair every day before I go to work and this steam system holds the curl in my extremely straight hair.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted, since I already have a healthy collection of the rollers. I purchased my first unit at the beauty supply store, but they do not offer units only.  With this unit, I am being very diligent in filling with distilled water (we have very hard water and lime build up is terrible) and emptying properly as described in the directions.  I&#x27;ve used Caruso every day for 4 or 5 years and love it!  Excellent delivery service from this vendor.</li>
            <li> I love the Caruso hot roller steamer, but even more so when I just need the steamer itself and not more rollers. I wore out the other 2 I had from before but it was because I didn&#x27;t read the directions and put regular water in it instead of the distilled.  Now I probably won&#x27;t need another for quite awhile.    This steamer works better on my hair than the irons do.  My hair is short and fine so it&#x27;s difficult for the curl to last throughout the day for me.  When my hair was much longer it was really fantastic looking and stayed all day long.     I still use my irons on some days when I want a more casual look but for work I have to look nice.    Thanks, Caruso lookin good!</li>
            <li> I love this steam unit. I wore my last one out and still had the curlers. Am happy I found the steamer unit stand alone without having to buy the whole kit (and more curlers) again. Works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I have used this steam system for over 20+ years on and off, depending on my hair length.  I use it when my fine (frog fur) hair is a bit longer and I use the jumbo curlers (without sheild) I use Scunci clips to hold them in, I think the sheilds make lines.  By the time my last curler is in, I&#x27;m taking the first ones out.  My curl is softer, my hair less damaged, and the curl lasts longer than electric or overnight curlers.  I&#x27;ve been through I think 3 steamers, but in this length of time, I think that&#x27;s remarkable.  The salt ones were a huge bother to me.  This is superior. Recently on a trip with a sister I showed them to her and did her hair.  She&#x27;s a new advocate!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these daily for years and they always seem to last well (except for one).  I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without them. My hair benefits from not using electric curling products which dry and burn the hair. These sponge steam rollers are gentle, fast and make your hair soft and shiny. I would recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> I really like the Caruso hairsetter, as this is probably the 5th or 6th one I&#x27;ve gotten. I feel they work better than dry rollers. The only drawback is that after a while they do die so you have to replace them. I&#x27;ve been using these for probably close to 20 years, and as long at they still make them and I have hair, I&#x27;ll continue to use it.    Delivery was a day sooner than promised, always a plus.</li>
            <li> This is the best item for setting curls and keeping them.  Have used it for over 6 years and will keep buying.</li>
            <li> Would not use any other unit or type of heating for my hair.  This makes the curles stay in and is so easy to use!  I had lots of rollers, the original steamer finally broke (it was dropped by one of my granddaughters) so I just bought a new one!  Takes up a lot less space than the electric roller sets and much, much easier to use!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad to have found this on amazon, My original unit burned out, now my investment in all those steam curlers has been saved</li>
            <li> wife had one a few years back it stopped working she loves this one very much</li>
            <li> i have used the Caruso steam setter for many years and have found it to be a quick, easy setting tool for causal and evening styling.  Easy on the hair, also.</li>
            <li> Curls very fine hair and holds curl longer. My hair is very fine and stick straight. In order for me to get any kind of volume, I have to use curlers or a curling iron, but both damage my hair. These work for me and are not as damaging. I use long hair clips to hold them, not the holders they come with.</li>
            <li> This is the worst of the Caruso line of curlers. I&#x27;ve bought two of these, and each one quit working after two uses. If you want the Primo of Caruso curlers, go to eBay and buy the Happy Traveler one that uses salt. This was one of the first ones I bought years ago, and lasts forever! Which is probaly why they quit making them. They had a great product then, so why improve on perfection?</li>
            <li> This is my second Caruso unit. The first one lasted five years!! I love the steam rollers. My hair doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;fry\\&quot; and get dry. The curl holds for days. My hair doesn&#x27;t get tangled in the soft foam. I can find nothing to complain about with this product.     The only complaint I have is with marketing. Replacement heat/steam units have to be purchased on line. You can buy a \\&quot;new\\&quot; unit but you have to get the rollers with it. I feel the heating/steam unit ought to be sold separately for those of us who have all the rollers we need and simply need a replacement unit. I give it five stars.</li>
            <li> The Caruso Steam Unit works great.  Very quick to heat up.  I fill it up with water to the line that it shows and within seconds, it is ready to use.  I bought (2) different sizes of rollers to use.  So, buying the steam unit seperate allowed me to buy what I needed and not have a lot of unused rollers.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery, everything perfect. Thank you</li>
            <li> I have used this product before.  I use it every day.  The only problem is that it has a tendency to break every 6 months.  This is my third one.  Even though I love the convenience of stream rolling my hair and how well it works, I&#x27;m not happy with having to replace the machine every 6 months.</li>
            <li> Most satisfied with unit and Amazon service.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000NWMOBS Caruso Steam Unit - Only]]  I love this steam unit and rollers.  I have used them for more than ten years.  I think I&#x27;m on my third or forth unit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 30 years now. No damage to my hair and the style lasts. Love my Caruso steam set!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these type of hot roller for almost 20 yrs. Won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> OMG !!!!!!!  I have been cruising Amazon for this exact item for quite some time and was thrilled to see it for an excellent price. I had been to retail and beauty supply stores everywhere I went, only to be told I could not order just the unit. I had already purchased extra rollers with my original unit. My Caruso Steam Unit gave up the after some major miles, through many hair styles.&lt;br /&gt; I have very thick, straight American Indian hair that was prematurely gray hair before I could graduate high school.  I purchased the Caruso Steam set and many extra curlers years ago when it first came on the market. I had tried various kinds of steam roller sets that were difficult to wrap my straight hair around. They were pokey and heavy with painful steel pins to hold rollers in my hair; only for the curls to fall out almost immediately. I tried ceramic, adjustable heat settings, and many different curling irons and dryers that was new on the market. I combined hair gels or mousse with them only to have curls and waves fall out within minutes. I went to beauty school (lol) after high school. Really not my thing&lt;br /&gt;The new unit I received is not round like this picture. It is kidney shaped.&lt;br /&gt;The old version I had to add a small amount of salt to the water.&lt;br /&gt;The newer version has a slider switch for OFF, STEAM and IONIC STEAM.&lt;br /&gt;I love, love, love the Caruso Steam for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I used 6-8 curlers for my whole head.&lt;br /&gt;Literally seconds to put each in and about the time I get them all in it is time to take them out. Just like my old Caruso Steam unit (without the salt).&lt;br /&gt;My curls last three days minimum.&lt;br /&gt;I DO NOT use hair products on my hair ever.&lt;br /&gt;Curls are soft and natural feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Caruso Steamer does not damage hair. Stopped perms many years ago after finding this steamer. This amazing steamer adds shine to my curls. I can run my fingers through my hair as much as I want.&lt;br /&gt;There is never those bent ends of hair, curls just fall, I shake my head, move a curl or two with my fingers and I am out the door.&lt;br /&gt;I have missed this little time saver and am continually complimented on my hair and how much younger I look.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps someone, lets me know how you use your Caruso Steamer</li>
            <li> I have been using the Caruso Steam System for probably over twenty years.  I have gone through I think three base units.  So great that Amazon allows you to buy the steam unit or the curlers individually.  Does not dry my hair out like the old electric curlers used to.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT. PERFECT REPLACEMENT.</li>
            <li> Works well good steam and curls</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and the Cariso steam unit is the only way my curls stay for a day or two. Otherwise the curl goes flat after about a half hour. I have used these products for about 15 years. Even my hairdresser can&#x27;t get my curls to last aspng as Caruso.</li>
            <li> I have fine,thin hair and these rollers work wonders on it. After I leave the rollers in, I blow dry my hair for a couple of minutes to make it smoother and less curly.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I have purchased three Caruso Steam roller units. These units are wonderful! My hair is fine, thin and pencil straight.  I put the rollers in before applying my makeup, by the time to get dressed I remove the rollers, brush out the curls and am  good to go.  Can&#x27;t live with out the Carusso Steam rollers.</li>
            <li> I had my original Caruso steam unit, the one where you add salt, for 3 years, now I can&#x27;t get through 3 weeks without it blowing some fuse or something. As much as I love the steam system I&#x27;m giving up. Kris</li>
            <li> I have been using the Caruso steam setter since they introduced it. Would not be with out it. It&#x27;s quick, easy and like the results. I have long hair, usually wear it up and I&#x27;m 70 years old.(great, for any length )</li>
            <li> I bought this hair enhancer about a month ago, when my husband saw what it looked like he looked at me with great skepticism .... I have a ton of hair that is thick and heavy, so curls usually last about an hour. When I use the medium to smaller rollers, this contraption gives me curl into the next day, If I use the jumbo rollers I get hair that is much less curly and wavy with a nice smooth texture. It is fast to use, and it is easy to travel with. Do I recommend that you buy it? Yes I do. It works like a charm and the best part is that it does not leave a clip mark on your hair........which is what I originally was looking for. I cant stand that look!&lt;br /&gt;So if you need a new hair setter, don&#x27;t pass this one by, I have tried them all and this one works the best for me by far!</li>
            <li> I have used this system for past twenty years. Works like a charm. I am african american and my sisters of different ethnicity say that it makes their hair to damp.  So, this is for thicker hair that usually has a hard time taking a curl.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Caruso since the 90s because i have incredibly straight hair. It never holds a curl--will literally go flat after an hour regardless of products. Caruso not only holds a curl, but since i dont need products to keep it, there is no stickiness or build up. The original steamers used salt and last for a long time... i did need to replace them periodically, but so what?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one stopped working and was horrible. I want the old one back.</li>
            <li> I already had plenty curlers and just needed a replacement for a deceased steam unit.  This unit arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  The Caruso Steam Curling System has always been one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> My wife swears by this style and when her old broke she was very upset. Thanks for having these . Awesome</li>
            <li> very small unit.This is not what I got &amp; my curls don&#x27;t stay in very long</li>
            <li> Very good for my wife&#x27;s everyday use</li>
