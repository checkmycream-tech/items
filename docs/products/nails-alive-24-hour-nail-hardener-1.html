            <li>Really keeps your nails healthy and beautiful.  </li>
            <li>My nails feel strong and they grow nicely.</li>
            <li>It adds a lovely gleam to any manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works better tan anything I have tried before.</li>
            <li>One of the features is that you don&#x27;t have to keep your hand in the drying booth for 5 or more minutes.</li>
            <li>I love this nail hardener.  </li>
            <li>as the top coat.  </li>
            <li>When traveling, bag the bottle as the top can leak in a pressurized cabin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it has formaldehyde...</li>
            <li>Still - it is the best nail product I have used - my nails are starting to grow!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many products over the years and they just collected in a basket under the sink.</li>
            <li>then a top coat over/under colored polish.</li>
            <li>I ordered two bottles in March of this year and use it as bottom and top coats on my finger and toe nails.</li>
            <li>There is not a store in this area that sells it, so, I went to Amazon and was able to purchase it on line.</li>
            <li>Nails look shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product and am glad i found it.</li>
            <li>then a top coat over/under colored polish.</li>
            <li>I ordered two bottles in March of this year and use it as bottom and top coats on my finger and toe nails.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>to say I love the product and will continue to use it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;So glad to have found it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months now--one coat under polish, and again as a top coat--and my nails look better than they ever have before.</li>
            <li>I am quite happy so far. :)</li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s working great.  </li>
            <li>They also tear easily.</li>
            <li>I have naturally strong nails to start off with, but I&#x27;ve never seen polish stay on</li>
            <li>this product to make them strong again.</li>
            <li>My nails feel strong and have been growing without splitting.</li>
            <li>My nails have never been so strong.</li>
            <li>my ENTIRE life and my nails look SOOOO beautiful</li>
            <li>It seems fine</li>
            <li>Really strengthens my nails - I love it!</li>
            <li>This is what they use at the salon I go to and noticed a huge improvement since I started to use it.</li>
            <li>Followed instructions precisely, and still have peeling/breaking nails.</li>
            <li>Actually, I enjoy doing my nail myself</li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>had very problematic nails, chipping, splitting and breakage, now they&#x27;re strong and growing long and look great!</li>
            <li>and I have to take off the polish and put on a fresh coat to keep it looking clean and clear but does work great as I hit my nail on my stair railing</li>
            <li>and my nails are 100% back to normal and probably look the best they ever have.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other nail hardeners, and none has been successful.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and it really does work!</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about a week, applying it every day or so and have not noticed a significant difference.</li>
            <li>and I only used it 4 times and it works really good</li>
            <li>I am now on my 2nd bottle, so you know it&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li>Using this product -I have given up the artificial nails and have been able to grow my own beautiful nails.</li>
            <li>but now they all look healthy, have free edge and don&#x27;t break near as easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Super for your nails, strong clear and easy to apply</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life I enjoyed straight, polished nails.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a manicure on my natural nails that lasted more than 3 days without chipping.  </li>
            <li>I have used Nails Alive for many years and it does everything it claims to do.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always worth a try.</li>
            <li>, she was right</li>
            <li>Right now I use 1 coat of Rejuvacoat, 1 of Nails</li>
            <li>After more than 60 years of soft, peeling, fragile nails, and many unsuccessful trials of costly nail products, I tried this on the recommendation of a manicurist.  </li>
            <li>You do have to be consistent about applying a coat every day or two ... remove after 7 days and start fresh.  </li>
            <li>Alive makes them grow strong.</li>
            <li>That definitely helped, but I felt I needed more.</li>
            <li>Most of the time I don&#x27;t do another thing for an entire week</li>
            <li>so I knew the product was doing exactly as it promised.</li>
            <li>I first discovered this product in a Salon.</li>
            <li>Thanks for finding it!</li>
            <li>This stuff really does harden your nails!  </li>
            <li>and it really does work!  </li>
            <li>(They are generally brittle, chip/break easily).  </li>
            <li>Since I use it as a base and top coat and change my polish weekly, I have essentially followed the instructions and am proudly reaping the benefits of strong, healthy nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this product .The</li>
            <li>nail hardener really works .I</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a bit stronger, but not by much.</li>
            <li>Really see a difference since using it.  </li>
            <li>Nail polish stays on longer and the nail peeling has really improved.</li>
            <li>It has helped so much with my nail&#x27;s to strengthen them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it highly!</li>
            <li>really helps my nails from breaking and spliting.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product doesn&#x27;t really hold up if you use your hands a lot.</li>
            <li>I REALLY LIKE NAIL</li>
            <li>thank you much.  </li>
            <li>and I have a nail that wants to split.</li>
            <li>Thanks to a supply store in Grants Pass Oregon,&lt;br /&gt;Maggie  (Margaret Gribnau)</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>This product really works well.</li>
            <li>they grow much longer and stronger</li>
            <li>I use it as a top coat and apply it every other day or two.</li>
            <li>I now have very long, strong nails.     </li>
            <li>Only time will tell the true story, as she indicated it would take about a year of usind</li>
            <li>First of all this product really works it does what it claims ,i have about 40 nailhardeners and this is the only one that it works!!i love this product now i can grow my nails long!!</li>
            <li>My nails have grown steadily stronger---no splitting--since I began using this product.</li>
            <li>My nails have grown steadily stronger---no splitting--since I began using this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for people with brittle nails.</li>
            <li>For the most part, it works better than other brands I bought in the past.  </li>
            <li>This does keep my nails from breaking as it makes them nice and hard</li>
            <li>this stuff makes my nails hard and nice.</li>
            <li>I use this nearly every day and really do see results.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who is having trouble achieving healthy nails.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Follow the directions and you won&#x27;t be disappointed :) Also, it comes in a good size, glass bottle.</li>
            <li>After using Nails Alive!</li>
            <li>This is the first product that has ever actually made them stronger and grow faster (it seemed) as well.</li>
            <li>Far exceeded my expectations!  </li>
            <li>I still have enough in my first bottle for another 15 uses.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I still have enough in my first bottle for another 15 uses.</li>
            <li>After decades of soft, splitting, torn nails, I tried Nails Alive, and it works!  </li>
            <li>Can use over any nail color or wear clear.  </li>
            <li>Alive.    </li>
            <li>Alive Hardener, nail polish and then 1 coat of Nails</li>
            <li>Alive Biotin Thickener.</li>
            <li>Alive.</li>
            <li>My nail tech recommended it for my soft nails.  </li>
            <li>Alive is fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The product works some what well, as long as you follow the directions EXACTLY.</li>
            <li>But after one week of using Nails Alive</li>
            <li>/&gt;&#x27;Nails Alive&#x27; is a wonderfu product if used as directed.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is just as good if not better -- due to the wand&#x27;s qualities and nail-strengthening properties -- than many a pricey base and top coat.</li>
            <li>By using the hardener daily for the first 3-4 days, then on alternate days after that, I can go 10-14 days between manicures.  </li>
            <li>I had purchsed from my nail salon at first and it was more expensive then on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I truly recommend every girl 2 buy this product I loved the way it made my nails grow a little thick</li>
            <li>An additional aid is to file the tips more-or-less straight across, only rounding the corners, which gives extra strength.  </li>
            <li>When it is gone I will try going with only the Nails Alive products.</li>
            <li>I immediately placed the order and now I have no regrets.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to go back to my natural nails</li>
            <li>Alive brough my nails back within 3 weeks of using this application.  </li>
            <li>You have to use it a few times a week, but it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>However I am sure without the product it would be much worse.</li>
            <li>but my they were always a hot mess.  </li>
            <li>I find that it really makes my nails hard, and they grow our very nicely.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nails are harder, but I am also using this new mircle gel polish, that you don&#x27;t need to cure</li>
            <li>The price is a little high for the product, but no other complaints.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had trouble with my nails breaking once they get to a certain length.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s always worth a try.</li>
            <li> , she was right</li>
            <li> Right now I use 1 coat of Rejuvacoat, 1 of Nails</li>
            <li> After more than 60 years of soft, peeling, fragile nails, and many unsuccessful trials of costly nail products, I tried this on the recommendation of a manicurist.  </li>
            <li> You do have to be consistent about applying a coat every day or two ... remove after 7 days and start fresh.  </li>
            <li> Alive makes them grow strong.</li>
            <li> That definitely helped, but I felt I needed more.</li>
            <li> Most of the time I don&#x27;t do another thing for an entire week</li>
            <li> so I knew the product was doing exactly as it promised.</li>
            <li> I first discovered this product in a Salon.</li>
            <li> Thanks for finding it!</li>
            <li> This stuff really does harden your nails!  </li>
            <li> and it really does work!  </li>
            <li> (They are generally brittle, chip/break easily).  </li>
            <li> Since I use it as a base and top coat and change my polish weekly, I have essentially followed the instructions and am proudly reaping the benefits of strong, healthy nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this product .The</li>
            <li> nail hardener really works .I</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a bit stronger, but not by much.</li>
            <li> Really see a difference since using it.  </li>
            <li> Nail polish stays on longer and the nail peeling has really improved.</li>
            <li> It has helped so much with my nail&#x27;s to strengthen them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> really helps my nails from breaking and spliting.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t really hold up if you use your hands a lot.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE NAIL</li>
            <li> thank you much.  </li>
            <li> and I have a nail that wants to split.</li>
            <li> Thanks to a supply store in Grants Pass Oregon,&lt;br /&gt;Maggie  (Margaret Gribnau)</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> This product really works well.</li>
            <li> they grow much longer and stronger</li>
            <li> I use it as a top coat and apply it every other day or two.</li>
            <li> I now have very long, strong nails.     </li>
            <li> Only time will tell the true story, as she indicated it would take about a year of usind</li>
            <li> First of all this product really works it does what it claims ,i have about 40 nailhardeners and this is the only one that it works!!i love this product now i can grow my nails long!!</li>
            <li> My nails have grown steadily stronger---no splitting--since I began using this product.</li>
            <li> My nails have grown steadily stronger---no splitting--since I began using this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for people with brittle nails.</li>
            <li> For the most part, it works better than other brands I bought in the past.  </li>
            <li> This does keep my nails from breaking as it makes them nice and hard</li>
            <li> this stuff makes my nails hard and nice.</li>
            <li> I use this nearly every day and really do see results.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who is having trouble achieving healthy nails.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Follow the directions and you won&#x27;t be disappointed :) Also, it comes in a good size, glass bottle.</li>
            <li> After using Nails Alive!</li>
            <li> This is the first product that has ever actually made them stronger and grow faster (it seemed) as well.</li>
            <li> Far exceeded my expectations!  </li>
            <li> I still have enough in my first bottle for another 15 uses.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I still have enough in my first bottle for another 15 uses.</li>
            <li> After decades of soft, splitting, torn nails, I tried Nails Alive, and it works!  </li>
            <li> Can use over any nail color or wear clear.  </li>
            <li> Alive.    </li>
            <li> Alive Hardener, nail polish and then 1 coat of Nails</li>
            <li> Alive Biotin Thickener.</li>
            <li> Alive.</li>
            <li> My nail tech recommended it for my soft nails.  </li>
            <li> Alive is fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The product works some what well, as long as you follow the directions EXACTLY.</li>
            <li> But after one week of using Nails Alive</li>
            <li> /&gt;&#x27;Nails Alive&#x27; is a wonderfu product if used as directed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is just as good if not better -- due to the wand&#x27;s qualities and nail-strengthening properties -- than many a pricey base and top coat.</li>
            <li> By using the hardener daily for the first 3-4 days, then on alternate days after that, I can go 10-14 days between manicures.  </li>
            <li> I had purchsed from my nail salon at first and it was more expensive then on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I truly recommend every girl 2 buy this product I loved the way it made my nails grow a little thick</li>
            <li> An additional aid is to file the tips more-or-less straight across, only rounding the corners, which gives extra strength.  </li>
            <li> When it is gone I will try going with only the Nails Alive products.</li>
            <li> I immediately placed the order and now I have no regrets.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to go back to my natural nails</li>
            <li> Alive brough my nails back within 3 weeks of using this application.  </li>
            <li> You have to use it a few times a week, but it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> However I am sure without the product it would be much worse.</li>
            <li> but my they were always a hot mess.  </li>
            <li> I find that it really makes my nails hard, and they grow our very nicely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nails are harder, but I am also using this new mircle gel polish, that you don&#x27;t need to cure</li>
            <li> The price is a little high for the product, but no other complaints.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble with my nails breaking once they get to a certain length.</li>
            <li> I got my nails done at a salon where they used it as a base and top coat, and my polished lasted 2 weeks!!  </li>
            <li> With a baby I&#x27;m constantly washing my hands, washing dishes, &amp; bathing the baby, I got a manicure last weak and my nails still look fresh and no chipped nail polish.  </li>
            <li> , so I have had acrylic nails for a long time; when I took them off the last time, someone told me about this product</li>
            <li> my nails have always been thin and peeled; if you use this product every day or every other day, it really does work... would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The product color was different from what I expected, but the results were the same</li>
            <li> /&gt;its been a month now and my nails have grown fast and hard.</li>
            <li> this long before.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use this nail hardener for as long as the manufacturer produces it.  </li>
            <li> and I could not grow them very long without them tearing and</li>
            <li> Plus, the texture is so sticky, that it takes forever to dry.  </li>
            <li> purchased this after wearing fake nails for a few months, this not helped my splitting nails, but it also helped my natural nails grow quickly.</li>
            <li> I cut them down because they were breaking, had split nails constantly and radical chipping which all drove me to a frenzy.  </li>
            <li> the only complaint which is with most products is that after bout 4 or 5 days my nails start to get that dirty yellow look</li>
            <li> I have very, very soft nails that peel, break off and are hard to grow.  </li>
            <li> I been using this product for approximately three (3) weeks now and see a positive improvement in my nails.  </li>
            <li> At this point, I really did start to notice my nails building a stronger bond as they were not as weak.</li>
            <li> My nails have gotten harder and longer than they ever have in my life...</li>
            <li> I am curious as to what is in it...</li>
            <li> I notice my nails are getting harder and they are not breaking as often as they used to before.</li>
            <li> There was not any extreme growth at this point yet all the signs of brittle nails did vanish</li>
            <li> HARDENER.I  went other</li>
            <li> so I hardly ever to to a manicurist except for a French Manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It can be used as a base and top coat.</li>
            <li> Something that I tried was using it as the base coat then as a top coat over the nail polish to prevent chipping (that was suggested by the manufacture).</li>
            <li> I took the nail hardner with me along with my choice of color, I told the lady to use the nail hardner as a base coat, apply 2 coats of color and again use the nail hardner as a top coat.  </li>
            <li> Typically, I don&#x27;t believe in 2-in-1 products (namely combining shampoo and conditioner), but this is my one exception.</li>
            <li> a little sketchy that it&#x27;s not listed.</li>
            <li> It seemed to be a little stronger when I put on the hardner.</li>
            <li> I used to put acrylic on my nails and when i decided to stop the acrylic my nails where fragile and extremely weak.</li>
            <li> Used at salon when I began having trouble with my nails peeling.  </li>
            <li> so I proceeded to do the base coat but never got around to the other part due to my busy schedule.</li>
            <li> Used a few days now, seems to work!</li>
            <li> IT NEEDS TO SAY WHETHER IT&#x27;s thick or not.</li>
            <li> I mean, oiling them each night and do faithfully weekly manicures.  </li>
            <li> as a base coat, I use two coats of any preferred color, then use Nails Alive!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even kiddding here, I have had crappy weak peeling nails</li>
            <li> My nails have always been weak and prone to peeling.</li>
            <li> I have always had problem nails; thin, weak, peeling, etc.</li>
            <li> My nails area still weak and thin.  </li>
            <li> product I have found for my weak and thin nails</li>
            <li> I think that when a product like this has reviews, it should say whether it goes on like a thin water, or, whether it goes on like a polish &amp; has to be taken off like a polish every day.</li>
            <li> My nails are thin and split.</li>
            <li> My nails before using this were so thin</li>
            <li> I hate them, but I can deal with them to have long nails.</li>
            <li> If you have weak, brittle nails, that do not grow  try this, it has worked for me!</li>
            <li> It was useless.  </li>
            <li> My nails have been horrible - splitting down to the edge of my fingers.  </li>
            <li> I needed something to help my nails what a disappointment.</li>
            <li> it is worthless after awhile -</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed with this product!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff is incredible. My nail technician introduced me to it while I was getting a manicure. It can be used as a base and top coat. My nails used to break once the white tips started to elongate, but now, they are stronger than ever. The directions suggest removing it weekly and then reapplying. Since I use it as a base and top coat and change my polish weekly, I have essentially followed the instructions and am proudly reaping the benefits of strong, healthy nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle and brush are a pleasure to use. It&#x27;s well suited for ladies&#x27; hands and applies like a dream. The width of the bristles make mitigating the amount of product on the tip very simple and painless. It adds a lovely gleam to any manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just as good if not better -- due to the wand&#x27;s qualities and nail-strengthening properties -- than many a pricey base and top coat. Typically, I don&#x27;t believe in 2-in-1 products (namely combining shampoo and conditioner), but this is my one exception. Check it out!</li>
            <li> I can never grow my nails because they break and Nails Alive makes them grow strong. It works better tan anything I have tried before.</li>
            <li> I have always had problem nails; thin, weak, peeling, etc., so I have had acrylic nails for a long time; when I took them off the last time, someone told me about this product so I tried it...IT IS THE BEST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER TRIED FOR MY NAILS!!  My nails have gotten harder and longer than they ever have in my life...I have gotten alot of my friends to try it as well...I love this product!!</li>
            <li> My aunt told me about this for my nails, she was right it is great. My nails chip, peel and split from the job I do. Being a welder takes a tole on my nails, I use this just like it says, works wonders!😀</li>
            <li> The product is great. One of the features is that you don&#x27;t have to keep your hand in the drying booth for 5 or more minutes. And as it says it is a great hardner.</li>
            <li> my nails have never looked this good.  just got thru wearing solar nails because mine would not grow and the expense was killing me so off they came.  found this and thought i would try it...WILL NEVER STOP USING THIS PRODUCT. it is amazing how great my nails look.</li>
            <li> I love this nail hardener.  Really keeps your nails healthy and beautiful.  I would recommend this to anyone who is having trouble achieving healthy nails.</li>
            <li> I really like this product .The nail hardener really works .I never had my nails grow so beautiful .I would recommend this product .</li>
            <li> After more than 60 years of soft, peeling, fragile nails, and many unsuccessful trials of costly nail products, I tried this on the recommendation of a manicurist.  For the first time in my life I enjoyed straight, polished nails.  By using the hardener daily for the first 3-4 days, then on alternate days after that, I can go 10-14 days between manicures.  An additional aid is to file the tips more-or-less straight across, only rounding the corners, which gives extra strength.  After using Nails Alive! as a base coat, I use two coats of any preferred color, then use Nails Alive! as the top coat.  When traveling, bag the bottle as the top can leak in a pressurized cabin.</li>
            <li> Followed instructions precisely, and still have peeling/breaking nails. They&#x27;re a bit stronger, but not by much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even kiddding here, I have had crappy weak peeling nails my ENTIRE life and my nails look SOOOO beautiful now I can&#x27;t even explain....DEFINITELY USE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a manicure on my natural nails that lasted more than 3 days without chipping.  I got my nails done at a salon where they used it as a base and top coat, and my polished lasted 2 weeks!!  I have naturally strong nails to start off with, but I&#x27;ve never seen polish stay on this long before.  I am curious as to what is in it... I&#x27;m sure it has formaldehyde...a little sketchy that it&#x27;s not listed. I will continue to search for the perfect, chip free, and non-dangerous top coat.</li>
            <li> My nails have always been weak and prone to peeling. In addition, I had the damage from years of acrylic nail use. I started out with Rejuvacoat ordered from Amazon. That definitely helped, but I felt I needed more. I did some research and ended up ordering both the nail hardener and the Biotin thickener by Nails Alive.    Right now I use 1 coat of Rejuvacoat, 1 of Nails Alive Hardener, nail polish and then 1 coat of Nails Alive Biotin Thickener. Most of the time I don&#x27;t do another thing for an entire week and then I remove everything and start over. I do not apply a coat every day as the directions say. Maybe you will need to but I didn&#x27;t. I now have very long, strong nails.     When my Rejuvacoat is gone I am going to try going with only the Nails Alive. I had the Rejuvacoat so wanted to use it up. When it is gone I will try going with only the Nails Alive products. If I see any weakening of my nails I will reorder Rejuvacoat and go back to the steps described above.    I do always wear gloves to wash dishes or do any cleaning. I hate them, but I can deal with them to have long nails.</li>
            <li> I think that when a product like this has reviews, it should say whether it goes on like a thin water, or, whether it goes on like a polish &amp; has to be taken off like a polish every day. IT NEEDS TO SAY WHETHER IT&#x27;s thick or not.</li>
            <li> I truly recommend every girl 2 buy this product I loved the way it made my nails grow a little thick and I only used it 4 times and it works really good I give it 2 thumbs-up.....</li>
            <li> Used at salon when I began having trouble with my nails peeling.  Really see a difference since using it.  Nail polish stays on longer and the nail peeling has really improved.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a couple of years and it does work! My nails are thin and split. Using this product -I have given up the artificial nails and have been able to grow my own beautiful nails. You do have to be consistent about applying a coat every day or two ... remove after 7 days and start fresh.  Can use over any nail color or wear clear.  You will not be disappointed with this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for three days but so far so good. The day it arrived, I used it along with painting my nails like suggested, since it is Christmas. Something that I tried was using it as the base coat then as a top coat over the nail polish to prevent chipping (that was suggested by the manufacture). On day two, I decided to remove the nail polish and change the color so I proceeded to do the base coat but never got around to the other part due to my busy schedule. On day three I used another coat of the nail hardener and let it soak in. At this point, I really did start to notice my nails building a stronger bond as they were not as weak. There was not any extreme growth at this point yet all the signs of brittle nails did vanish so I knew the product was doing exactly as it promised. I am impressed and will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> this product is great.  I had purchsed from my nail salon at first and it was more expensive then on Amazon.  If you follow the instructions you will see great results.</li>
            <li> My nails have been horrible - splitting down to the edge of my fingers.  This product is wonderful!!  You have to be faithful however - noticed when it chipped off my nails started to break.  Still - it is the best nail product I have used - my nails are starting to grow!!</li>
            <li> I have tried many other nail hardeners, and none has been successful.  The manicurist were using a product that seem to make my nails stronger. (They are generally brittle, chip/break easily).  Upon return, I noticed the name on the bottle (Nails Alive).&lt;br /&gt;I went to AMAZON.COM  and there were only 1 bottle left!! I immediately placed the order and now I have no regrets.  My nails are now longer and stronger.  I am deeply amazed at the results; and I do recommed this product to any one who may be having problems with split nails, etc.</li>
            <li> purchased this after wearing fake nails for a few months, this not helped my splitting nails, but it also helped my natural nails grow quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble with my nails breaking once they get to a certain length. This is the first product that has ever actually made them stronger and grow faster (it seemed) as well. I&#x27;ve tried so many products over the years and they just collected in a basket under the sink. I&#x27;ll definitely continue using this.</li>
            <li> Super for your nails, strong clear and easy to apply</li>
            <li> My nail tech recommended it for my soft nails.  After years on acrylic nails, I have to go off them for a year and my nails constantly break, split and peel.  So far, it&#x27;s working great.  Only time will tell the true story, as she indicated it would take about a year of usind this product to make them strong again.</li>
            <li> This product works well but it peels off after 3 or 4 layers so I have to remove and start all over again.  For the most part, it works better than other brands I bought in the past.  I would still recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This did nothing but peel off my nails. I needed something to help my nails what a disappointment. Total garbage</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for over a month and it seems to be doing a good job. I notice my nails are getting harder and they are not breaking as often as they used to before. I think I found a product that works. Happy customer!!</li>
            <li> Still using it as directed and it seems to be doing a great job. Another couple weeks will tell. I am quite happy so far. :)</li>
            <li> I first discovered this product in a Salon. It has helped so much with my nail&#x27;s to strengthen them. Glad to have found it here on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Just paint it on every night and watch your nails get longer and your polish stay on longer!  When I don&#x27;t use it my nails peel.</li>
            <li> Used a few days now, seems to work! Nails are harder, but I am also using this new mircle gel polish, that you don&#x27;t need to cure, that could be helping. It seemed to be a little stronger when I put on the hardner.</li>
            <li> Best nail top coat and hardener I ever used. I found a bottle of it in a rental car and am so happy I did!</li>
            <li> Nails Alive is fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;I had very problematic nails, chipping, splitting and breakage, now they&#x27;re strong and growing long and look great!</li>
            <li> Far exceeded my expectations!  Something that actually works as advertised.  I will definitely purchase this product again.  Thanks for finding it!</li>
            <li> I have been using the nail hardener as directed on the bottle for over 3 weeks.  My nails area still weak and thin.  They also tear easily.</li>
            <li> This product was supposed to strengthen and harden nails.  I used 3 coats of it.  It was useless.  My nails showed no improvement.  Plus, the texture is so sticky, that it takes forever to dry.  I would throw it out, but fear it would infect the landfill.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does harden your nails!  I am now on my 2nd bottle, so you know it&#x27;s good.  I have very, very soft nails that peel, break off and are hard to grow.  I use this nearly every day and really do see results.  I&#x27;d recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> Lasts forever, does a great job as a first coat then a top coat over/under colored polish. I ordered two bottles in March of this year and use it as bottom and top coats on my finger and toe nails. I still have enough in my first bottle for another 15 uses.My nails have grown steadily stronger---no splitting--since I began using this product.</li>
            <li> Is the beast product ever! Definitly i will buy this again . Is the only product help my wife to look a beautifull hands!</li>
            <li> Love this nail hardner!  This should be sold in every beauty supply store.  With a baby I&#x27;m constantly washing my hands, washing dishes, &amp; bathing the baby, I got a manicure last weak and my nails still look fresh and no chipped nail polish.  I took the nail hardner with me along with my choice of color, I told the lady to use the nail hardner as a base coat, apply 2 coats of color and again use the nail hardner as a top coat.  I also would apply one coat before bed time every night after manicure , for this does the trick. I will continue to do this until the next manicure.  Perfection!  My nails still look great, and I don&#x27;t use gloves when washing dishes.  As an added bonus my nails are stronger than ever!  I can&#x27;t say enough about this product, just keep it in stock!</li>
            <li> a product that actually works!! nail growth and hardens.</li>
            <li> Really strengthens my nails - I love it!</li>
            <li> I have used Nails Alive for many years and it does everything it claims to do. My nails stopped splitting and grow longer when I use it. There is not a store in this area that sells it, so, I went to Amazon and was able to purchase it on line. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Have been using this stuff for over a year now and it&#x27;s like a miracle.  Wow!</li>
            <li> This is some good stuff! If you have weak, brittle nails, that do not grow  try this, it has worked for me!</li>
            <li> My nails feel strong and have been growing without splitting. I only use it 2-3x weekly. Nails look shiny and healthy. Highly recommend for people with brittle nails.</li>
            <li> never seen a difference</li>
            <li> I love this product and it really does work! I use it as a top coat and apply it every other day or two. My nails feel strong and they grow nicely. Have bought them as presents and everyone seems to love it!</li>
            <li> I have nails that peel, and this is the only product that solves the problem. You have to use it a few times a week, but it is well worth it. My nails have never been so strong.</li>
            <li> This does keep my nails from breaking as it makes them nice and hard the only complaint which is with most products is that after bout 4 or 5 days my nails start to get that dirty yellow look and I have to take off the polish and put on a fresh coat to keep it looking clean and clear but does work great as I hit my nail on my stair railing and if I hadn&#x27;t has this product on I know my nail would have broke and it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> really helps my nails from breaking and spliting.&lt;br /&gt;best product I have found for my weak and thin nails&lt;br /&gt;just once a week seems to do the trick</li>
            <li> First of all this product really works it does what it claims ,i have about 40 nailhardeners and this is the only one that it works!!i love this product now i can grow my nails long!!</li>
            <li> The product works some what well, as long as you follow the directions EXACTLY. The price is a little high for the product, but no other complaints. It&#x27;s always worth a try. The product doesn&#x27;t really hold up if you use your hands a lot.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE NAIL HARDENER.I  went other one.makes my nails hard.&lt;br /&gt; bottle looks purple.but its not.  thank you much.  tooth3.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product and am glad i found it. I used to put acrylic on my nails and when i decided to stop the acrylic my nails where fragile and extremely weak. But after one week of using Nails Alive i saw improvement so i got soo excited;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its been a month now and my nails have grown fast and hard. I would recommend this to anyone..</li>
            <li> i have been using this product for years and it really does work!  my nails have always been thin and peeled; if you use this product every day or every other day, it really does work... would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have not had enough time to decide about this product. It seems fine but it has to be applied every day or so. The 24 hours nail hardener name is kind of mis-leading. I have been using it for about a week, applying it every day or so and have not noticed a significant difference.</li>
            <li> This is what they use at the salon I go to and noticed a huge improvement since I started to use it. I was happy to find my own bottle.</li>
            <li> Lasts forever, does a great job as a first coat then a top coat over/under colored polish. I ordered two bottles in March of this year and use it as bottom and top coats on my finger and toe nails. I still have enough in my first bottle for another 15 uses.My nails have grown steadily stronger---no splitting--since I began using this product.</li>
            <li> Been using this product now for two weeks. And my nails are more brittle than before!  I&#x27;m going back to my trusty Sally Hansen products</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wore acrylics for years then recently switched to shellac. I wanted to go back to my natural nails but my they were always a hot mess.  So I tried OPI Nail Envy for a couple weeks. It seemed to help somewhat but not enough so I gave this a try and what a difference. I&#x27;ve only been using it for four weeks and my nails are 100% back to normal and probably look the best they ever have. They used to crack, split and peel but now they all look healthy, have free edge and don&#x27;t break near as easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow the directions and you won&#x27;t be disappointed :) Also, it comes in a good size, glass bottle. Should last forever.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  It makes my nails very healthy. I have  only one  problem and I have a nail that wants to split. However I am sure without the product it would be much worse. My nails before using this were so thin and I could not grow them very long without them tearing and breaking.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say I love the product and will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;So glad to have found it. Thanks to a supply store in Grants Pass Oregon,&lt;br /&gt;Maggie  (Margaret Gribnau)</li>
            <li> I been using this product for approximately three (3) weeks now and see a positive improvement in my nails.  I cut them down because they were breaking, had split nails constantly and radical chipping which all drove me to a frenzy.  I take great pride in my nails and enjoy seeing them meticulously manicured.  By taking good care I mean, oiling them each night and do faithfully weekly manicures.  Actually, I enjoy doing my nail myself so I hardly ever to to a manicurist except for a French Manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;Nails Alive&#x27; is a wonderfu product if used as directed.  It stops all chipping, breakage, splitting, etc.  You actually see your nails improving.  I stopping using &#x27;Nailtiques&#x27; it is worthless after awhile - my nails were splitting, cracking and breaking with nailtiques.  Nails Alive brough my nails back within 3 weeks of using this application.  Great hardening treatment.  Give it a try !!!</li>
            <li> Not like it use to be.  I have been using this product for years but &amp;#34;with formaldehyde&amp;#34; and it doesn&#x27;t work the same.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  I find that it really makes my nails hard, and they grow our very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Regards&lt;br /&gt;Margaret Grbnau</li>
            <li> It really works. My nails are stronger than ever</li>
            <li> This product really works well. The product color was different from what I expected, but the results were the same</li>
            <li> this stuff makes my nails hard and nice. they grow much longer and stronger</li>
            <li> After decades of soft, splitting, torn nails, I tried Nails Alive, and it works!  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months now--one coat under polish, and again as a top coat--and my nails look better than they ever have before. A manicure lasts a week! No splitting, no bending, no tearing, and my nails have actually grown out to just beyond my fingertips. I will continue to use this nail hardener for as long as the manufacturer produces it.  Great stuff!</li>
