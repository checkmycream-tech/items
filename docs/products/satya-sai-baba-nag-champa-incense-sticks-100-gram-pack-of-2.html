            <li>I liked the way it was packaged, because you couldn&#x27;t smell it through the box.  </li>
            <li>this is the absolute best smelling incense i&#x27;ve ever encountered.</li>
            <li>But these are the absolute best!  </li>
            <li>It creates a nice mood for my house.</li>

            <li>One of the best incenses ever.&lt;br /&gt;I was introduced to this years ago, when I got a stick as a freebie at a New Age store.</li>

            <li>Super fresh and amazing!!</li>

            <li>BEST RELAXING INCENSE, LONG BURN LASTING.&lt;br /&gt;LALI</li>
            <li>This is the best incense I have found in a long time....</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to Nag Champa about 12 years ago and have loved it ever since.</li>
            <li>The sticks burn long and leave a great fragrance in our home!</li>
            <li>Large quantity , long burning, and gorgeous scent to bring you into the perfect zone whether meditating, doing yoga or just relaxing.</li>
            <li>My favorite incense ever, the smell is so clean and relaxing.  </li>
            <li>A good classic.</li>
            <li>It can be strong as soon as you get it.</li>
            <li>the smell was realllly strong, and when I opened the shipping bag ....</li>
            <li>It was soooo strong, my eyes were watering and burning.  </li>
            <li>So I don&#x27;t know WHY this smells so strong or toxic ?  </li>
            <li>an incense that isn&#x27;t obnoxiously strong.</li>
            <li>Beautiful and strong, last a while.</li>
            <li>hands down the best smelling incense i have ever found.  </li>
            <li>What else can I say other than a classic scent I&#x27;ve always loved and the quality is always amazing!!</li>
            <li>Quickly arrived and since these are my favorite, they stay lit in my house.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and pleasant.</li>
            <li>good quanity  but not very thick on the stick</li>
            <li>Still the same great incense.</li>
            <li>I light these up all the time at home and it smells like the 1960s in here.</li>
            <li>and she doesn&#x27;t enjoy any others.</li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love Satya Sai Baba brand Nag Champa, it doesn&#x27;t get any better, but upon purchasing 200 grams maybe 5grams actually would stay lit and burn.</li>
            <li>This pack seems to not want to light up.  </li>
            <li>The company keeps the product very fresh.</li>
            <li>The scent is strong enough to permeate a couple of rooms but pleasant to the senses.</li>
            <li>Very clean and fresh smelling without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Love this scent, it reminds me of head shops I used to visit in high school. :)</li>
            <li>i checked the mail this morning, there it was sitting in my p.o. box smelling of deliciousness :) very pleased with my purchase overall</li>
            <li>I have worked in the best New Age Shops throughout Boston and Salem, and have smelled a myriad of incense , but my family and I always come back to Nag Champa.</li>
            <li>In our experience this is the most pleasing &amp; consistent of the nag champa incense sticks.</li>
            <li>I use it consistently, and love it a lot.</li>
            <li>This incense has a wonderful aroma and lots of sticks which will last a long time before I have to buy more which is what I want.</li>
            <li>This is a good deal for a double pack</li>
            <li>Sweet and spicy but not intrusive on the nostrils.</li>
            <li>True to count..</li>
            <li>Thanks for selling it, as it is my favorite incense.</li>
            <li>very clean...will order more of this...</li>
            <li>Burns and smells as it should, what more can I really ask for.  </li>
            <li>Just get the right holder so you don&#x27;t have to clean up the mess from the ash, Amazon sells a couple very good ones.</li>
            <li>My favorite classic scent Nag Champa for relaxation, mood setting, paint indulgent sensation.</li>
            <li>Wonderful smell, long lasting.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like all the hassle of getting a label and shipping bag !!  </li>
            <li>This is a great scent for relaxing or falling asleep with the window half open with a stick lit on a nice night.</li>
            <li>love it, burns slow and lasts long time, not over bearing, but smooth and elegant, love this stuff, fan forever!!</li>
            <li>I always have a few boxes of these around, quality packaged great burn time.</li>
            <li>and this is a great way to have enough on hand so that I never run out and have to drive to some store someplace to find it for a marked up price</li>
            <li>These were fresh and fragrant.</li>
            <li>WORTH 20 BUCKS.</li>
            <li>Just the nice regular fragrance ??  </li>
            <li>if you care, you treat my incenses like you care for cool breeze on a hot day.  </li>
            <li>So far this is the cheapest price I&#x27;ve been able to find.</li>
            <li>these are very powdery and not the original ones I used to get</li>
            <li>Helps me get my mind right.</li>
            <li>My favourite incense delivered right to my door.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the old reliable Nag Champa we all know &amp; love, there&#x27;s something about that smell that so very intoxicating.</li>
            <li>Came as described, new in box and original incense...not a knock off.</li>
            <li>I have been using this brand of Nag Champa incense for years, but this is the first time I have ever ordered it online.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping !</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Nag Champa incense... smells dreamy!!  </li>
            <li>Consistent performance.</li>
            <li>Another reviewer posted photos of the product and that is exactly how this one was.</li>
            <li>Just be ready for your house to be smokey!</li>
            <li>Great scent long lasting</li>
            <li>it is exactly what an incense should smell like....relaxing and soothing.</li>
            <li>this was the first time I purchased it from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Expensive but wonderful.</li>
            <li>I should have bought it from the local store for a better price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different incense styles, sticks just like these.  </li>
            <li>As long as they keep the quality and scent, I&#x27;ll keep coming back for more!!</li>
            <li>Has a very nice scent and burns slow and evenly</li>
            <li>Because I&#x27;ve tried no other and I&#x27;m fine with this.</li>
            <li>Very fresh and a nice slow burn.</li>
            <li>I love this product, been burning it for a *long* time.  </li>
            <li>, they don&#x27;t always continue to burn and one burning stick fell apart and it was pure luck</li>
            <li>Turns out its just one large box.</li>
            <li>I can only get Nag Champa if I drive 40 minutes away from where I live, EACH WAY.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s a much better option.</li>
            <li>It is very grounding to me.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment</li>
            <li>Very relaxing</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I had to throw the whole thing away.</li>
            <li>Every time I light a stick, I&#x27;m zapped back to my days in the college dorm.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really think of much to say.  </li>
            <li>Real Nag Champa at a value price</li>
            <li>very calming scent...</li>
            <li>with a very pleasent smell....</li>

            <li>I can smell it but isn&#x27;t overpowering then open up and enjoy.</li>
            <li>Very calming.  </li>
            <li>I live in a single wide mobile home and just 1 of these makes my entire place smell nice for hours :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a sweet, earthy smelling product.</li>
            <li>Love this product and it is so much cheaper to buy it in larger packages then in the smaller ones.</li>
            <li>Hands down favorite sticks</li>
            <li>Classic scent.</li>
            <li>This particular batch from this seller, however, is somehow defective.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and burns slow!!</li>
            <li>This incense I highly recommend if you meditate or you have a feeling of unrest your looking to ease.</li>
            <li>While it is not very versatile (doesn&#x27;t function well for other things one might burn incense for), Satya Sai Baba is a wonderful mood setter, and few of my clients are allergic to it.  </li>
            <li>Other types have heavy perfumes that really irritate my nose and throat, this brand is so mild and smells lovely.</li>
            <li>live this stuff....</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even get this stuff where I live, so two boxes for $15 is a steal.</li>
            <li>I live in NYC</li>
            <li>It is usually a kind of subtle, under-scent that awakens me to meditation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually sorry that I spent $29 on a double order, feeling confident that it was a product I am very familiar with and enjoy.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my mother as she is an avid burner of nag champa and was running low.</li>
            <li>I bought a sampler pack and like some of those scents much better (though I usually like Nag Champa)</li>
            <li>My FAVORITE everyday incense!</li>
            <li>THESE, on the other hand, burned quickly with just a small stream of mostly smoke smelling(like burned wood or paper as opposed to incense)smoke.</li>
            <li>is my only choice for insence and buying in large quantities saves money.</li>
            <li>Would definitely order very soon</li>
            <li>Some of the local stores really hike of the prices.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t sit too close to it because I have an overly sensitive nose</li>
            <li>It completely destroyed the incense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I took a fancy wine glass, filled half full with brown rice, stuck a few in, off to the side, ready to burn, and place the other one I&#x27;m currently burning, more center of the rice.  </li>
            <li>They can be more expensive than other sticks around, still the higher price is worth it.</li>
            <li>I like the house to smell good as I&#x27;m cleaning, so I usually burn a few sticks around the house once a week.</li>
            <li>at first, i had to cancel my order on a due to lack of funds in my account, so i received the refund.</li>
            <li>The price is also quite reasonable when compared to other offers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so messy to use, and the sticks going out is such an annoyance, that I am not going to get anywhere near $29 worth of value from this purchase.</li>
            <li>Alway been extremely consistent product, lights up well and burns down to end end without issue every time.</li>
            <li>This batch smells the same as it always has, it&#x27;s just a bit hard to light.  </li>
            <li>The packages are full of powdery incense dust, and the sticks require relighting at least twice as they burn.</li>
            <li>Its also much dustier than previous purchases.</li>
            <li>I have been to places and gotten it cheaper, but I live in a smaller town now so it is harder to find.</li>

            <li> Makes my whole home smell beautiful.</li>
            <li> it was too good to be true.</li>
            <li> Super fresh and amazing!!</li>

            <li> Love the way it smells.  </li>
            <li> Most of the incense had been rubbed off the stick, I&#x27;m basically burning the wood.</li>

            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> So, I searched for more products and I found this.</li>

            <li> BEST RELAXING INCENSE, LONG BURN LASTING.&lt;br /&gt;LALI</li>
            <li> This is the best incense I have found in a long time....</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to Nag Champa about 12 years ago and have loved it ever since.</li>
            <li> The sticks burn long and leave a great fragrance in our home!</li>
            <li> Large quantity , long burning, and gorgeous scent to bring you into the perfect zone whether meditating, doing yoga or just relaxing.</li>
            <li> My favorite incense ever, the smell is so clean and relaxing.  </li>
            <li> A good classic.</li>
            <li> It can be strong as soon as you get it.</li>
            <li> the smell was realllly strong, and when I opened the shipping bag ....</li>
            <li> It was soooo strong, my eyes were watering and burning.  </li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t know WHY this smells so strong or toxic ?  </li>
            <li> an incense that isn&#x27;t obnoxiously strong.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and strong, last a while.</li>
            <li> hands down the best smelling incense i have ever found.  </li>
            <li> What else can I say other than a classic scent I&#x27;ve always loved and the quality is always amazing!!</li>
            <li> Quickly arrived and since these are my favorite, they stay lit in my house.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and pleasant.</li>
            <li> good quanity  but not very thick on the stick</li>
            <li> Still the same great incense.</li>
            <li> I light these up all the time at home and it smells like the 1960s in here.</li>
            <li> and she doesn&#x27;t enjoy any others.</li>
            <li> Enjoy.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love Satya Sai Baba brand Nag Champa, it doesn&#x27;t get any better, but upon purchasing 200 grams maybe 5grams actually would stay lit and burn.</li>
            <li> This pack seems to not want to light up.  </li>
            <li> The company keeps the product very fresh.</li>
            <li> The scent is strong enough to permeate a couple of rooms but pleasant to the senses.</li>
            <li> Very clean and fresh smelling without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li> Love this scent, it reminds me of head shops I used to visit in high school. :)</li>
            <li> i checked the mail this morning, there it was sitting in my p.o. box smelling of deliciousness :) very pleased with my purchase overall</li>
            <li> I have worked in the best New Age Shops throughout Boston and Salem, and have smelled a myriad of incense , but my family and I always come back to Nag Champa.</li>
            <li> In our experience this is the most pleasing &amp; consistent of the nag champa incense sticks.</li>
            <li> I use it consistently, and love it a lot.</li>
            <li> This incense has a wonderful aroma and lots of sticks which will last a long time before I have to buy more which is what I want.</li>
            <li> This is a good deal for a double pack</li>
            <li> Sweet and spicy but not intrusive on the nostrils.</li>
            <li> True to count..</li>
            <li> Thanks for selling it, as it is my favorite incense.</li>
            <li> very clean...will order more of this...</li>
            <li> Burns and smells as it should, what more can I really ask for.  </li>
            <li> Just get the right holder so you don&#x27;t have to clean up the mess from the ash, Amazon sells a couple very good ones.</li>
            <li> My favorite classic scent Nag Champa for relaxation, mood setting, paint indulgent sensation.</li>
            <li> Wonderful smell, long lasting.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like all the hassle of getting a label and shipping bag !!  </li>
            <li> This is a great scent for relaxing or falling asleep with the window half open with a stick lit on a nice night.</li>
            <li> love it, burns slow and lasts long time, not over bearing, but smooth and elegant, love this stuff, fan forever!!</li>
            <li> I always have a few boxes of these around, quality packaged great burn time.</li>
            <li> and this is a great way to have enough on hand so that I never run out and have to drive to some store someplace to find it for a marked up price</li>
            <li> These were fresh and fragrant.</li>
            <li> WORTH 20 BUCKS.</li>
            <li> Just the nice regular fragrance ??  </li>
            <li> if you care, you treat my incenses like you care for cool breeze on a hot day.  </li>
            <li> So far this is the cheapest price I&#x27;ve been able to find.</li>
            <li> these are very powdery and not the original ones I used to get</li>
            <li> Helps me get my mind right.</li>
            <li> My favourite incense delivered right to my door.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the old reliable Nag Champa we all know &amp; love, there&#x27;s something about that smell that so very intoxicating.</li>
            <li> Came as described, new in box and original incense...not a knock off.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand of Nag Champa incense for years, but this is the first time I have ever ordered it online.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping !</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Nag Champa incense... smells dreamy!!  </li>
            <li> Consistent performance.</li>
            <li> Another reviewer posted photos of the product and that is exactly how this one was.</li>
            <li> Just be ready for your house to be smokey!</li>
            <li> Great scent long lasting</li>
            <li> it is exactly what an incense should smell like....relaxing and soothing.</li>
            <li> this was the first time I purchased it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Expensive but wonderful.</li>
            <li> I should have bought it from the local store for a better price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different incense styles, sticks just like these.  </li>
            <li> As long as they keep the quality and scent, I&#x27;ll keep coming back for more!!</li>
            <li> Has a very nice scent and burns slow and evenly</li>
            <li> Because I&#x27;ve tried no other and I&#x27;m fine with this.</li>
            <li> Very fresh and a nice slow burn.</li>
            <li> I love this product, been burning it for a *long* time.  </li>
            <li> , they don&#x27;t always continue to burn and one burning stick fell apart and it was pure luck</li>
            <li> Turns out its just one large box.</li>
            <li> I can only get Nag Champa if I drive 40 minutes away from where I live, EACH WAY.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s a much better option.</li>
            <li> It is very grounding to me.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment</li>
            <li> Very relaxing</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I had to throw the whole thing away.</li>
            <li> Every time I light a stick, I&#x27;m zapped back to my days in the college dorm.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really think of much to say.  </li>
            <li> Real Nag Champa at a value price</li>
            <li> very calming scent...</li>
            <li> with a very pleasent smell....</li>
            <li> I would recommend, if you want the real thing, Cheri</li>
            <li> My whole family loves this incense.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real deal.  </li>
            <li> fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I can smell it but isn&#x27;t overpowering then open up and enjoy.</li>
            <li> Very calming.  </li>
            <li> I live in a single wide mobile home and just 1 of these makes my entire place smell nice for hours :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a sweet, earthy smelling product.</li>
            <li> Love this product and it is so much cheaper to buy it in larger packages then in the smaller ones.</li>
            <li> Hands down favorite sticks</li>
            <li> Classic scent.</li>
            <li> This particular batch from this seller, however, is somehow defective.  </li>
            <li> Smells great and burns slow!!</li>
            <li> This incense I highly recommend if you meditate or you have a feeling of unrest your looking to ease.</li>
            <li> While it is not very versatile (doesn&#x27;t function well for other things one might burn incense for), Satya Sai Baba is a wonderful mood setter, and few of my clients are allergic to it.  </li>
            <li> Other types have heavy perfumes that really irritate my nose and throat, this brand is so mild and smells lovely.</li>
            <li> live this stuff....</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even get this stuff where I live, so two boxes for $15 is a steal.</li>
            <li> I live in NYC</li>
            <li> It is usually a kind of subtle, under-scent that awakens me to meditation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually sorry that I spent $29 on a double order, feeling confident that it was a product I am very familiar with and enjoy.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother as she is an avid burner of nag champa and was running low.</li>
            <li> I bought a sampler pack and like some of those scents much better (though I usually like Nag Champa)</li>
            <li> My FAVORITE everyday incense!</li>
            <li> THESE, on the other hand, burned quickly with just a small stream of mostly smoke smelling(like burned wood or paper as opposed to incense)smoke.</li>
            <li> is my only choice for insence and buying in large quantities saves money.</li>
            <li> Would definitely order very soon</li>
            <li> Some of the local stores really hike of the prices.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t sit too close to it because I have an overly sensitive nose</li>
            <li> It completely destroyed the incense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I took a fancy wine glass, filled half full with brown rice, stuck a few in, off to the side, ready to burn, and place the other one I&#x27;m currently burning, more center of the rice.  </li>
            <li> They can be more expensive than other sticks around, still the higher price is worth it.</li>
            <li> I like the house to smell good as I&#x27;m cleaning, so I usually burn a few sticks around the house once a week.</li>
            <li> at first, i had to cancel my order on a due to lack of funds in my account, so i received the refund.</li>
            <li> The price is also quite reasonable when compared to other offers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so messy to use, and the sticks going out is such an annoyance, that I am not going to get anywhere near $29 worth of value from this purchase.</li>
            <li> Alway been extremely consistent product, lights up well and burns down to end end without issue every time.</li>
            <li> This batch smells the same as it always has, it&#x27;s just a bit hard to light.  </li>
            <li> The packages are full of powdery incense dust, and the sticks require relighting at least twice as they burn.</li>
            <li> Its also much dustier than previous purchases.</li>
            <li> I have been to places and gotten it cheaper, but I live in a smaller town now so it is harder to find.</li>
            <li> When I looked over the box I saw that it said &amp;#34;2014 series&amp;#34; as compared to the last box I bought at the shop which said &amp;#34;2015 series.&amp;#34; So I would wager a bet that these are old and dried out.</li>
            <li> Karma is not good, wake up man and see the sun for the moon and you will understand that you can never escape your crimes of pretending to be a machine when you are really a person!  </li>
            <li> it has a subltle smell that does not linger too long</li>
            <li> But the sticks burn for a long time and fill the house with aromatic smoke.</li>
            <li> This is the scent that holds you captivated at the head shop and doesn&#x27;t let you go til you spent your last dime.</li>
            <li> Even when I have put the incense out, or just leave the stick there, the fragrance will still permeate the room for a long time.</li>
            <li> They seem to burn longer, the scent lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> box of these smell as Nag Champa should, but the other box has an off odor that makes me think of poop whenever I open the drawer where I store them.</li>
            <li> The only reason I don&#x27;t order this month after month is that I like a little variety</li>
            <li> Perhaps it has gotten wet?  </li>
            <li> It seems like the packaging may have gotten wet and the retailer sold them anyway.</li>
            <li> The sticks completely flake off and the smell is pretty bad.</li>
            <li> Had been buying from the mall and those were small boxes for the same price.</li>
            <li> Always keep this stocked up and burn regularly with 4 fur children in a small home.</li>
            <li> Although if you have not this is what nag champa is supposed to smell like, do not bother with the other types.</li>
            <li> I usually put a fan on low and crack a window</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t buy any other incense, smell or brand.</li>
            <li> The boxes look identical to any other Nap Champa I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
            <li> Very difficult to light and does not remain lit.  </li>
            <li> As expected!</li>
            <li> Unlike any other scent out there.  </li>
            <li> Too late to get my money back on this.</li>
            <li> I was not worth buying on this site.</li>
            <li> it did not start a fire when it landed on a cardboard box down on the floor.</li>
            <li> Items arrived broken, wet and essentially unusable.</li>
            <li> No sweet, sticky smell or feel.</li>
            <li> Nicely, tightly packaged.</li>
            <li> They go out after burning for a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> Have purchased from Amazon a few times as a gift.</li>
            <li> so I find these messy as they disintegrate if not handled gingerly</li>
            <li> Looks different, dusty sort of.  </li>
            <li> Wow man I came home from vacation and like the incense look beat up by an angry gorilla.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of nag champa but lots of folks are....</li>
            <li> (yes, they sell bootleg incense, you can tell by how long the stick burns, these sticks are supposed to burn for about 45 minutes).</li>
            <li> I have no idea what poor storage and handling the seller must have done with this product to make this happen, because as someone who has used it for years, I&#x27;ve never seen it in such shoddy quality.</li>
            <li> At least then I know I&#x27;m not ordering something that&#x27;s a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Never had problems in the past but</li>
            <li> Not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> Once you get a flame, wait at least 5 seconds before blowing it out.  </li>
            <li> Earthy scent with slow burn.</li>
            <li> There no better incense like nah champa !</li>
            <li> No good.</li>
            <li> I am very angry I spent money on this.</li>
            <li> Burns slow!</li>
            <li> I usually but and have for over 20 years !!  </li>
            <li> It relaxes me and is WAY less expensive than candles!</li>
            <li> The packaging flattened the product on the inside and caused unnecessary damage.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I just got a bad batch but probably wont buy this incense again.</li>
            <li> One of my favorites, you can&#x27;t go wrong with Nag Champa.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t ever go wrong with Nag Champa.</li>
            <li> The box we received from here made all of the others that we have bought from stores in the U.S. seem stale.</li>
            <li> I have used this incense for yeard &amp; it has yet to fail me.</li>
            <li> Too expensive.</li>
            <li> (I suppose that was my stupidity not to consider accidents.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> is dangerous for a person like me who is allergic to mold.  </li>
            <li> maybe i got a bad bag..</li>
            <li> Too bad the sticks go out and have to be re-lit.</li>
            <li> and I never ever get sick of the scent.</li>
            <li> Not a savings at all :(</li>
            <li> I was disappointed by these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is HORRIBLE!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> The best incense out there.</li>
            <li> I love Nag Champa but this doesnt smell quite like Nag Champa, perfume smell. Not sure if I just got a bad batch but probably wont buy this incense again.</li>
            <li> Nag Champa is my favorite, I burn it every day! It is very grounding to me. This is a good deal for a double pack and I love knowing I am not going to run out.</li>
            <li> Nagchampa! The OG in incents</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Nag Champs just like it should be. Sticks were nice and moist and burn evenly. Ordering more soon.</li>
            <li> Competitively priced!</li>
            <li> The incense won&#x27;t stay lit. They go out after burning for a few seconds.  It has not been uncommon for us to have to relight one stick 4 times.</li>
            <li> I have worked in the best New Age Shops throughout Boston and Salem, and have smelled a myriad of incense , but my family and I always come back to Nag Champa. Large quantity , long burning, and gorgeous scent to bring you into the perfect zone whether meditating, doing yoga or just relaxing.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and great price</li>
            <li> will order more They smell very great</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand of Nag Champa incense for years, but this is the first time I have ever ordered it online. The packages are full of powdery incense dust, and the sticks require relighting at least twice as they burn. I have no idea what poor storage and handling the seller must have done with this product to make this happen, because as someone who has used it for years, I&#x27;ve never seen it in such shoddy quality. I&#x27;m actually sorry that I spent $29 on a double order, feeling confident that it was a product I am very familiar with and enjoy. It&#x27;s so messy to use, and the sticks going out is such an annoyance, that I am not going to get anywhere near $29 worth of value from this purchase. Not a savings at all :(</li>
            <li> It met my expectations.  I brought some before but could not find them again.</li>
            <li> Will buy again. Fast shipment</li>
            <li> Our favorite incense smell.  Glad to see it sold on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Quickly arrived and since these are my favorite, they stay lit in my house. I love um! And you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> maybe i got a bad bag.. but both boxes appear to have been exposed to moisture. the incense was crumbling apart and it will not stay lit. the contents of the box from amazon were covered with the incense powder. very disappointed. returning.</li>
            <li> Great product, shipped well.</li>
            <li> A wonderful deal on my favorite incense. I will buy this again and again.</li>
            <li> It arrived fast and was perfect. Thank ou.</li>
            <li> No good. The sticks completely flake off and the smell is pretty bad.</li>
            <li> Hands down favorite sticks</li>
            <li> There no better incense like nah champa ! Fast shipping ! Would definitely order very soon</li>
            <li> Best incense I have ever burned. A good classic. Sweet and spicy but not intrusive on the nostrils. No sickeningly floral or soapy smell like many incenses. Great for the hippie vibe without the patchouli hippie stigma.  No offense to those hippies.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this product. It&#x27;s soft and pleasant.</li>
            <li> Still the same great incense. Very relaxing</li>
            <li> The best Incense ever.</li>
            <li> Have purchased from Amazon a few times as a gift. Recommend.</li>
            <li> As advertised and on time. I recommend this source.</li>
            <li> Love my inscence.. True to count.. Smell beautifully.. Thank you so much..♥️</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.Classic scent.Great price.Nuff said.</li>
            <li> I burn these every day and they smell heavenly! Definitely Nag Champa!</li>
            <li> LOVE&amp;#60; LOVE&amp;#60; LOVE!!!!! I&#x27;ll never be without my Nag Champa. Been burning this for longer than I care to admit! Nicely, tightly packaged. Very fresh and a nice slow burn. As long as they keep the quality and scent, I&#x27;ll keep coming back for more!!</li>
            <li> BEST RELAXING INCENSE, LONG BURN LASTING.&lt;br /&gt;LALI</li>
            <li> You get a LOT of sticks in these boxes. Had been buying from the mall and those were small boxes for the same price. Excellent deal!</li>
            <li> I have been buying this kind of incense for 10 years. The last batch was just too overpowering. I had to throw the whole thing away. I usually love this fragrance, but NOT THIS TIME. It is usually a kind of subtle, under-scent that awakens me to meditation. This batch just made my nose itch and even made my eyes water. Look for a different supplier. This is HORRIBLE!</li>
            <li> Fantastic scent! I will continue to buy again and again!</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love Nag Champa? It&#x27;s such a sweet, earthy smelling product. Everytime I smell it, it brings me back to my teenage years of visiting different shops. I light these for meditation, massage, and just to make my house smell amazing!</li>
            <li> I have bought this incense from this company 4 times.  No problems, excellent quality.</li>
            <li> Love this incense it&#x27;s my favorite. Earthy scent with slow burn. No sweet, sticky smell or feel. The only incese I buy now and 1 stick will stay for awhile and linger.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use my incense, this is one of my favorite types of incense now, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy anything else.  This was a really good deal and I was so glad for that.  Some of the local stores really hike of the prices.</li>
            <li> These are perfect!! I highly recommend Nag Champa incense... smells dreamy!!  I bought the pack of 2 and it was a worthwhile purchase. ♥</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the old reliable Nag Champa we all know &amp; love, there&#x27;s something about that smell that so very intoxicating. Alway been extremely consistent product, lights up well and burns down to end end without issue every time. There&#x27;s plenty included in these two boxes to last awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Again!</li>
            <li> live this stuff....it is the best smelling incense I know if on the market.  it has a subltle smell that does not linger too long</li>
            <li> Best incense ever! Always keep this stocked up and burn regularly with 4 fur children in a small home. Hubby loves the scent too and he is picky.</li>
            <li> Cheapest price I can find and there.perfect!</li>
            <li> Love it. The best Nag.</li>
            <li> Great product and good transaction</li>
            <li> This stuff just smells like my misspent youth!  Every time I light a stick, I&#x27;m zapped back to my days in the college dorm.  It also reminds me of my years of Yoga training and teaching.  I have it now just to burn occasionally, and it always smells wonderful to me.  I&#x27;m sure it would be too much for some folks, but I think it is, without a doubt, the best incense there is.</li>
            <li> Best incense, good price and fast service. What&#x27;s not to give this a 2 thumbs up. Makes me feel like I&#x27;m in India when I burn Nag Champa.</li>
            <li> Great value-this is the best brand for nag champa in my opinion. The price was too good to pass up. Very happy with the product</li>
            <li> This is just what I wanted and they are great.</li>
            <li> Great price for a great product</li>
            <li> very nice scent for meditation...</li>
            <li> Best quallity,a nd scent on market...has been, and will be the Benchmark for ALL others!</li>
            <li> Best Nag Champa you can get.</li>
            <li> In our experience this is the most pleasing &amp; consistent of the nag champa incense sticks. Part of our daily routine- not overpowering</li>
            <li> This incense is the greatest fragrance of incense that I have found.  I even like getting the body oils and using them as perfume.</li>
            <li> I thought I already wrote this review, but I guess not.  I can&#x27;t really think of much to say.  I bought this for my mother as she is an avid burner of nag champa and was running low. This is the same brand she always gets and always has. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of nag champa but lots of folks are.... and this is nag champa and that&#x27;s what it smells like. So, it gets 5 stars.  It smells like what it&#x27;s supposed to smell like and burns correctly.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> By far the best smelling incense out there. Love this stuff and is so comforting when you smell it, no complaints</li>
            <li> This is my ALLLL time favorite incense.  It came shipped to me in a padded envelope and the 100g boxes inside were smashed but the product inside was all intact.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to the Japanese style (Morningstar brand) incense so I find these messy as they disintegrate if not handled gingerly, they don&#x27;t always continue to burn and one burning stick fell apart and it was pure luck it did not start a fire when it landed on a cardboard box down on the floor. (I suppose that was my stupidity not to consider accidents.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One box of these smell as Nag Champa should, but the other box has an off odor that makes me think of poop whenever I open the drawer where I store them. I bought a sampler pack and like some of those scents much better (though I usually like Nag Champa) but I don&#x27;t want to deal with the powdery stuff that falls off the sticks when I remove them from their packages and finding they&#x27;ve stopped burning, so I&#x27;ll go back to Japanese style incense when these are gone.</li>
            <li> This is incense incense. It is what people are thinking of when they think of incense.</li>
            <li> Very clean and fresh smelling without being overpowering.  I don&#x27;t sit too close to it because I have an overly sensitive nose but it works great!</li>
            <li> Consistent performance.</li>
            <li> Good to be able to order in bulk.  Thanks for selling it, as it is my favorite incense. I will order from you again, as soon as my supply runs low.</li>
            <li> Great scent has a very sweet to it so if you like that than this is great for you</li>
            <li> Smells incredible and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Smells great! Burns slow! I love them :)</li>
            <li> While this product seemed too affordable for this brand of Nag Champa Saibaba incense it was too good to be true. I purchased this along with the Sandalwood incense and BOTH ended up being INFESTED yes I said infested with mold. You could even smell it IF you could get it lit. The product was so moist and moldy it became a health hazard as mold is dangerous for a person like me who is allergic to mold.  Another reviewer posted photos of the product and that is exactly how this one was. Too late to get my money back on this. I will not and do not recommend this product from this buyer.</li>
            <li> Real Nag Champa at a value price</li>
            <li> Best smelling incense ever!</li>
            <li> Strong but wonderful aroma.</li>
            <li> This is the best incense I have found in a long time....very calming scent...</li>
            <li> The best incense!!! Ideal for people with sensitivity to smell as there are no artificial ingredients!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed by these. I usually buy my Nag at a local import store at a higher price. But the sticks burn for a long time and fill the house with aromatic smoke. THESE, on the other hand, burned quickly with just a small stream of mostly smoke smelling(like burned wood or paper as opposed to incense)smoke. When I looked over the box I saw that it said &amp;#34;2014 series&amp;#34; as compared to the last box I bought at the shop which said &amp;#34;2015 series.&amp;#34; So I would wager a bet that these are old and dried out. Won&#x27;t be purchasing online again. I&#x27;ll stick to buying where I can look at the package.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of Nag Champa!  I would buy these by the gross if it were possible to do so.  I light these up all the time at home and it smells like the 1960s in here.</li>
            <li> Nag Champa has always been one of my favorite incenses..and this is a great way to have enough on hand so that I never run out and have to drive to some store someplace to find it for a marked up price</li>
            <li> This is a very good fine...with a very pleasent smell....very clean...will order more of this...</li>
            <li> This is the scent that holds you captivated at the head shop and doesn&#x27;t let you go til you spent your last dime. Very nice for prayer and meditation.</li>
            <li> I WILL BE A REGULAR CUSTOMER FOR THIS PRODUCT. I BURN TWO TO THREE STICKS A DAY</li>
            <li> This is the best Nag Champa ever made. The company keeps the product very fresh. Wonderful smell, long lasting. I would recommend, if you want the real thing, Cheri</li>
            <li> My entire home smells of this brand of Nag Champa. I&#x27;ve found nothing else to set the stage for meditation or trance.  While it is not very versatile (doesn&#x27;t function well for other things one might burn incense for), Satya Sai Baba is a wonderful mood setter, and few of my clients are allergic to it.  I use it consistently, and love it a lot.</li>
            <li> One of the best incenses ever.&lt;br /&gt;I was introduced to this years ago, when I got a stick as a freebie at a New Age store. I lit it in the car and went back in to find out what it was.  This ... is what incense should smell like.  Exotic and soothing.  Once you&#x27;ve tried it, you&#x27;ll never want anything else.</li>
            <li> My whole family loves this incense.</li>
            <li> This is a great scent for relaxing or falling asleep with the window half open with a stick lit on a nice night.</li>
            <li> Always my favorite.  Came as described, new in box and original incense...not a knock off.</li>
            <li> these are very powdery and not the original ones I used to get</li>
            <li> Nag Champa is my favorite incense.  This batch smells the same as it always has, it&#x27;s just a bit hard to light.  Once you get a flame, wait at least 5 seconds before blowing it out.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Perfect! About 50 sticks in a box</li>
            <li> Love the way it smells.  This is the only incense that doesn&#x27;t give me a headache after smelly it for a while.</li>
            <li> Burns and smells as it should, what more can I really ask for.  I do not think may of the people buying this product have never used it before.  Although if you have not this is what nag champa is supposed to smell like, do not bother with the other types.</li>
            <li> Items arrived broken, wet and essentially unusable. I&#x27;m extremely disappointed. The packaging flattened the product on the inside and caused unnecessary damage. I am very angry I spent money on this. Most of the incense had been rubbed off the stick, I&#x27;m basically burning the wood. It completely destroyed the incense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never be ordering from this listing again. I can only get Nag Champa if I drive 40 minutes away from where I live, EACH WAY.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s a much better option. At least then I know I&#x27;m not ordering something that&#x27;s a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> One of my favorites, you can&#x27;t go wrong with Nag Champa.  The only reason I don&#x27;t order this month after month is that I like a little variety but this is some good smelling stuff.  :)</li>
            <li> Great for neutralizing odors.</li>
            <li> I live in a single wide mobile home and just 1 of these makes my entire place smell nice for hours :)</li>
            <li> My favorite classic scent Nag Champa for relaxation, mood setting, paint indulgent sensation.</li>
            <li> A bargains when it comes to Nag Champa Incense!</li>
            <li> My favorite incense ever, the smell is so clean and relaxing.  Other types have heavy perfumes that really irritate my nose and throat, this brand is so mild and smells lovely.</li>
            <li> If you like the smell of this stuff (who doesn&#x27;t?!) it&#x27;s an awesome buy. I like the house to smell good as I&#x27;m cleaning, so I usually burn a few sticks around the house once a week. People always rave about how great my house smells and the familiar odour just makes me feel at ease. Love this stuff. Can&#x27;t recommend it enough. Just be ready for your house to be smokey! I usually put a fan on low and crack a window so I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m going to suffocate ... but, I do burn like 4 sticks in one room. So, that might be a personal issue.</li>
            <li> Helps me get my mind right.</li>
            <li> They are great and reasonably priced !!</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this purchase. My wife was not a fan of patchouli as a scent in soap or candle. I love it. To find a happy medium, I tried some nag champa soap and I couldn&#x27;t keep her away from it. She loved it (Hey, Mikey). So, I searched for more products and I found this. incense made a lot of sense to me as I could burn it where candles would be unsafe. The sticks do not disintegrate when handled and the burn is even. The scent is strong enough to permeate a couple of rooms but pleasant to the senses. The price is also quite reasonable when compared to other offers. Buy with confidence.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real deal.  Great scent long lasting</li>
            <li> good quanity  but not very thick on the stick</li>
            <li> at first, i had to cancel my order on a due to lack of funds in my account, so i received the refund. but, i went to my bank yesturday, an noticed it had been taken back out again. to my surprise went i checked the mail this morning, there it was sitting in my p.o. box smelling of deliciousness :) very pleased with my purchase overall</li>
            <li> always a great product</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to Nag Champa about 12 years ago and have loved it ever since. This is a great price for the quantity.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t ever go wrong with Nag Champa. Even some of my friends &amp; family members that don&#x27;t like inscense like this one.</li>
            <li> I love the scent because it fills the room with a pleasant smell which reminds me for some reason of my Memere&#x27;s house.  Sean Griggs</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brand of Nag Champa and this was a good quantity for the price.  I liked the way it was packaged, because you couldn&#x27;t smell it through the box.  Sometimes the mailman complains if they don&#x27;t happen to like the way it smells.</li>
            <li> I love this Nag Champa incense. It arrived quickly and it smells great! I bought 4 boxes so they should last a while.</li>
            <li> The incense sticks burn well and have a wonderful fragrance.</li>
            <li> Good price. Nag Champa is awesome, classic scent. I don&#x27;t buy any other incense, smell or brand.</li>
            <li> hands down the best smelling incense i have ever found.  it is exactly what an incense should smell like....relaxing and soothing.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent and this brand is wonderful.  Nice sized sticks and the same type and wonderful scent every time, which made me feel safe ordering from Amazon as opposed to a store.</li>
            <li> It was in one package. I was expecting two packages so that way i could put them in two separate rooms. Turns out its just one large box. Its also much dustier than previous purchases. Not the best quality this time.</li>
            <li> Too bad the sticks go out and have to be re-lit.</li>
            <li> The best incense available. I&#x27;ve tried many types of incense sticks during my life time, Nag Champa Satya Sai Baba have the best aroma and last for some time. They can be more expensive than other sticks around, still the higher price is worth it.</li>
            <li> The incense arrived quickly and were the best I have ever had. I have bought Nag Champa many times before, it&#x27;s my girlfriends favorite and she doesn&#x27;t enjoy any others. The box we received from here made all of the others that we have bought from stores in the U.S. seem stale. These were fresh and fragrant. I just finished placing my second order and will continue to.</li>
            <li> fast delivery. LOVE this scent, will definately keep purchasing here!</li>
            <li> My favourite incense delivered right to my door. Wonderful!</li>
            <li> My absolutely favorite. Authentic, and lasts a while. Love it.</li>
            <li> Love this scent, it reminds me of head shops I used to visit in high school. :)</li>
            <li> Beautiful and strong, last a while. Even when I have put the incense out, or just leave the stick there, the fragrance will still permeate the room for a long time. So lovely! I have always loved this ancient fragrance.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this nag champa incense.</li>
            <li> The best incense.  Period!</li>
            <li> What can I say? This is THE best incense out there. I bought another brand claiming to be nag champa. I burned one stick of it and threw it in the trash. Outside. Lingered for days. This stuff is mellow, and won&#x27;t force you out of your house to get away from it. It can be strong as soon as you get it. I let it air out a bit somewhere I can smell it but isn&#x27;t overpowering then open up and enjoy. I can&#x27;t even get this stuff where I live, so two boxes for $15 is a steal. Will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Super fresh and amazing!!</li>
            <li> This incense has a wonderful aroma and lots of sticks which will last a long time before I have to buy more which is what I want.</li>
            <li> Nag Champa makes me so so happy and as I was walking to my mailbox I could smell it even through the packaging.  This deal is really good because you get 200 sticks of nag champa for 20 bucks.  I have been to places and gotten it cheaper, but I live in a smaller town now so it is harder to find. WORTH 20 BUCKS. best scent in the world.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever give a review with 1 star, but when I went to my mail box to pick this up (ordered 2 boxes) when I opened the mail box the smell was realllly strong, and when I opened the shipping bag .... it did not smell like the nag champa I usually but and have for over 20 years !!  It was soooo strong, my eyes were watering and burning.  I set them out on the patio as I didn&#x27;t want them in the house as I was getting a toxic reaction.  The boxes look identical to any other Nap Champa I&#x27;ve ever had (and I ALWAYS have a box here)  Never had this reaction before. I went to the metaphysical store and the same brand there does not have a bad/strong toxic smell to it.  Just the nice regular fragrance ??  So I don&#x27;t know WHY this smells so strong or toxic ?  I have not yet requested a RETURN ... I don&#x27;t really like all the hassle of getting a label and shipping bag !!  Would like to hear if anyone else has bought this and had similar reaction ?</li>
            <li> I love this product, been burning it for a *long* time.  This particular batch from this seller, however, is somehow defective.  Perhaps it has gotten wet?  Looks different, dusty sort of.  Very difficult to light and does not remain lit.  This is all going in the trash, I cannot use this.</li>
            <li> love it, burns slow and lasts long time, not over bearing, but smooth and elegant, love this stuff, fan forever!!</li>
            <li> As expected! Everyone loves Nag Champa!</li>
            <li> this is the absolute best smelling incense i&#x27;ve ever encountered. i have bought this product numerous times. it&#x27;s time to buy some more, as a matter of fact.</li>
            <li> This my second time (and won&#x27;t be my last) buying this product. Has a very nice scent and burns slow and evenly so it lasts longer.</li>
            <li> What else can I say other than a classic scent I&#x27;ve always loved and the quality is always amazing!!</li>
            <li> Unlike any other scent out there.  My FAVORITE everyday incense!</li>
            <li> The smell is great.  I took a fancy wine glass, filled half full with brown rice, stuck a few in, off to the side, ready to burn, and place the other one I&#x27;m currently burning, more center of the rice.  Nice look, and the fragrance is wonderful and peaceful.  Enjoy.</li>
            <li> Love this incense and have used it for decades. SO nice to be able to get it without leaving the house.</li>
            <li> The best incense on the market. period.</li>
            <li> excellent product at an excellent price. the incense was delivered in perfect condition</li>
            <li> Only incense I ever get. Why? Because I&#x27;ve tried no other and I&#x27;m fine with this. Most stores charge an arm and a leg for this, so purchasing online is the way to go.</li>
            <li> The best of the best IMO.&lt;br /&gt;This is my only choice for insence and buying in large quantities saves money.</li>
            <li> Only insense I use. Love Nag Champa.</li>
            <li> Best smelling incense ever and it helps repel bugs while out in the yard.</li>
            <li> it has always been my favorite and is entrancing...I have purchased it for years and my friends love it too.</li>
            <li> Great Quality!!! Makes my whole home smell beautiful.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love Satya Sai Baba brand Nag Champa, it doesn&#x27;t get any better, but upon purchasing 200 grams maybe 5grams actually would stay lit and burn. Never had problems in the past but this was the first time I purchased it from Amazon. It seems like the packaging may have gotten wet and the retailer sold them anyway.</li>
            <li> Satya makes the best nag champa. wouldn&#x27;t be home without it.</li>
            <li> Arrived in good shape.</li>
            <li> quik deliver great quality</li>
            <li> Love this item.  Expensive but wonderful.</li>
            <li> I only burn one stick and I threw the rest of the box in the garbage can cause it gave me a headache !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guylaine from Canada</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff since college and just started using it again. It relaxes me and is WAY less expensive than candles! Just get the right holder so you don&#x27;t have to clean up the mess from the ash, Amazon sells a couple very good ones.</li>
            <li> Very calming.  Not overwhelming.  It is a great way to start the day.</li>
            <li> love it! an incense that isn&#x27;t obnoxiously strong.</li>
            <li> Wow man I came home from vacation and like the incense look beat up by an angry gorilla.  Like man if you care, you treat my incenses like you care for cool breeze on a hot day.  Karma is not good, wake up man and see the sun for the moon and you will understand that you can never escape your crimes of pretending to be a machine when you are really a person!  I look at myself in the ice and see my breath and I forgive you.  Can you forgive yourself from the shame, man?</li>
            <li> Good value and arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> Great price fast shipping</li>
            <li> Wonderful aroma and rapid delivery</li>
            <li> Love the smell of my deceased son favorite scent!</li>
            <li> Got here on time. Smells Awesome.</li>
            <li> Love this product and it is so much cheaper to buy it in larger packages then in the smaller ones.</li>
            <li> more than 100 sticks, great scent</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this incense.  The sticks burn long and leave a great fragrance in our home!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been burning this brand of incense for over 10 years and I never ever get sick of the scent. So far this is the cheapest price I&#x27;ve been able to find. I live in NYC and yes I can find this all over BK and Harlem for lower prices, but you do have to be cautious of imitations at times (yes, they sell bootleg incense, you can tell by how long the stick burns, these sticks are supposed to burn for about 45 minutes).</li>
            <li> I have bought this brand before and loved it.  This pack seems to not want to light up.  It will burn for a minute and stop.  I tried putting the pack in the fridge to get the moisture out of it but that didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> Very Satisfied - All of the incense burned well and it covers up all smells you don&#x27;t want to be smelled!</li>
            <li> I always have a few boxes of these around, quality packaged great burn time.</li>
            <li> This incense I highly recommend if you meditate or you have a feeling of unrest your looking to ease. I have used this incense for yeard &amp; it has yet to fail me. If you want a constant incense that is always quality-based please pick this specific brand!</li>
            <li> I was not worth buying on this site. Too expensive. I should have bought it from the local store for a better price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different incense styles, sticks just like these.  But these are the absolute best!  They seem to burn longer, the scent lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> I use this every day. It creates a nice mood for my house. My guests always ask what it is. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Smells great and burns slow!! The original and best!!</li>
