            <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>It always works, smells nice, and makes my hair routine easier.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d read reviews from two camps, those who loved the \\&quot;musky\\&quot; scent, and those who thought it smelled more like \\&quot;Grandma.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>/&gt;While the bottle and liquid are beautiful, it does look VERY glittery when sprayed onto your hair.</li>
            <li>and I love the smell...</li>
            <li>Love this product for the shine and softness</li>
            <li>and I love it - worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I thought the scent would grow on me, but really it&#x27;s very distinct and not something</li>
            <li>My hair dresser used this on my fly away hair after she blew me dry.</li>
            <li>Love it so much.</li>
            <li>Not only am I taking good care of my hair</li>
            <li>The musky smell is intoxicating and the shimmer is just right.</li>
            <li>Smells sweet, very shiny.</li>
            <li>Awesome to add a little shine to transitioning hair (brown to white)!!</li>
            <li>love this product, adds shine to my strawberry blonde hair and softness</li>
            <li>product is a big fat just ok,  </li>
            <li>Is a good thing it will last for a long time because I won&#x27;t be ordering anymore ( for the cost reason ).</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s too soon to say if the repairing element is doing me any good, and at $10 an ounce, I&#x27;m hardly using it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used this once and must have used too much because my hair looked oily.</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Kind of feel like I wasted my money here.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very expensive but worth every penny for sure</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty cool even though I feel silly for spending the $$.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s pretty cool even though I feel silly for spending the $$.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the same as the Moroccan oil spray and all the other sprays.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not really noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Fun for a night out, I suppose, but again, not really my thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t order this again, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Not so much of a subtle shimmer as remnants of last night&#x27;s glitter that didn&#x27;t wash out.</li>
            <li> Gives my a hair a little shine.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of infrequent use, I&#x27;m in the Grandma Camp.</li>
            <li> I would like it if it didnt smell like men&#x27;s cologne :/</li>
            <li> Not so dull looking</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to find something that gives your hair shine but doesn&#x27;t make it greasy..</li>
            <li> Shiny poor!</li>
            <li> However, It is way too expensive !  </li>
            <li> but it smells incredibly bad.</li>
            <li> Smells bad and is way over priced</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything, and it&#x27;s very expensive!</li>

            <li> My fave. I give as a gift. Love it so much. Gives my a hair a little shine. Not so dull looking</li>
            <li> I actually use this as a detangler and finish spray and I love it - worth every penny. It always works, smells nice, and makes my hair routine easier. My hair stylist introduced me to this product and I will always indulge from now on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty cool even though I feel silly for spending the $$.</li>
            <li> Always check the actual size of the product you&#x27;re ordering...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d read reviews from two camps, those who loved the \\&quot;musky\\&quot; scent, and those who thought it smelled more like \\&quot;Grandma.\\&quot; After a few weeks of infrequent use, I&#x27;m in the Grandma Camp.

            <li> This product does what it claims to  do...put shine on your hair. However, It is way too expensive !  Is a good thing it will last for a long time because I won&#x27;t be ordering anymore ( for the cost reason ).</li>
            <li> I like what it does to my hair but it smells incredibly bad.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser used this on my fly away hair after she blew me dry. I used this once and must have used too much because my hair looked oily. I have to learn to use only a tiny bit. It is a good product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything, and it&#x27;s very expensive!</li>

            <li> One word: MEH...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a big fat just ok,  it&#x27;s the same as the Moroccan oil spray and all the other sprays. It&#x27;s a 45$ piece of clutter.</li>
            <li> Smells bad and is way over priced</li>
