    <ol>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else and the price is perfect buying in a set of three from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Without a doubt, this is the very best hairspray that I have ever used for my hair!</li>
            <li>This hairspray is the best.</li>
            <li>so this was great finding it.  </li>
            <li>I was so happy to find this product .</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>Like the non-aerosol option and great hold</li>
            <li>Good hold without stiffness.</li>
            <li>Pantene has always been a good brand</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, will buy again!</li>
            <li>Great price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>This is better than Walmart for the price for sure.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I discovered this.</li>
            <li>In fact I don&#x27;t even feel it when I touch my hair, but it does hold it better than anything else I have used.</li>
            <li>Over the years I&#x27;ve tried several and this is the best one for me.  </li>
            <li>This hairspray is light and does not make one&#x27;s hair feel like a board.  </li>
            <li>Light fragrance, which is why I tried it - fragrances can nauseate me.  </li>
            <li>This is the best hairspray available that isn&#x27;t too sticky or that makes your hair too stiff.  </li>
            <li>Very helpful in hair styling for fine hair.</li>
            <li>and I gave two away and didn&#x27;t finish the first one.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Smells good, holds all day (barring winds) without being heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li>Have been happily using this brand for years, but what I received used older purple &amp; white packaging, and in my opinion, the smell was very slightly different than a more recently purchased bottle with the yellow/gold label.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rate it 5 stars as a hairspray, but I pretty much don&#x27;t use it because of the smell.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed and got it so fast.</li>
            <li>I have gone through so many hairsprays over the years looking for one that was right for my thin, fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li>I like the &amp;#34;touchable&amp;#34; aspect and the minimal perfume, though the hold might be a tad better.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for fine hair with maximum control without looking plastered down or artificial.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that could possibly make it any better, in my opinion, if it was unscented, but I can live with that.  </li>
            <li>The spray is fine enough so that it doesn&#x27;t move my hair, and it definitely is touchable.</li>
            <li>It tames fine, flyaway hair, but leaves the hair flexible and doesn&#x27;t make it stiff and sticky.</li>
            <li>leaves your hair soft yet holds the style all day</li>
            <li>I have natural waves and there is not flating or buildup of this product.  </li>
            <li>Also, I have no trouble brushing through it and do not wake up with my hair looking and feeling like straw.</li>
            <li>I only started using it a few days ago but just went out and bought two more bottles so that I don&#x27;t have to worry about running out any time soon.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair seem heavier and less full of volume.</li>
            <li>Problem is, the smell is much too strong, not particularly pleasant, and lasts until you wash your hair.</li>

            <li> leaves your hair soft yet holds the style all day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several years and don&#x27;t plan to change.</li>
            <li> This is not an aerosol as I thought from the picture. It is a pump spray which unfortunately doesn&#x27;t have the same characteristics for my hair when I use it. It makes my hair seem heavier and less full of volume.</li>
            <li> Smells good, holds all day (barring winds) without being heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble finding this hairspray in the stores lately so this was great finding it.  I like the &amp;#34;touchable&amp;#34; aspect and the minimal perfume, though the hold might be a tad better.</li>
            <li> Not a fan.  Leaves hair sticky.  Came in a 3 pack and I gave two away and didn&#x27;t finish the first one.</li>
            <li> Love this. Holds really well for my thin hair. Can still run my fingers thru hair and it still holds well.</li>
            <li> I have used this hairspray for several years.  I have natural waves and there is not flating or buildup of this product.  It is much less expensive than others that claim the same thing.</li>

Very helpful in hair styling for fine hair.</li>
            <li> Works well; holds without stiffness.</li>
            <li> As a hairspray, it works as it says it will. It tames fine, flyaway hair, but leaves the hair flexible and doesn&#x27;t make it stiff and sticky. Problem is, the smell is much too strong, not particularly pleasant, and lasts until you wash your hair. I&#x27;d rate it 5 stars as a hairspray, but I pretty much don&#x27;t use it because of the smell.</li>
            <li> Whenever I ran out of spray, I am buying these spray from this Amazon.com. This is better than Walmart for the price for sure.</li>
            <li> Good hold without stiffness.</li>
            <li> I have gone through so many hairsprays over the years looking for one that was right for my thin, fine, straight hair. I have always tended to stay away from pump sprays because they all blast my hair and either flatten or destroy the style all together. I also have not gotten much hold from aerosol hairsprays and am sick having to clean up the sticky residue that winds up coating everything in the bathroom. I am so glad I discovered this.

I only started using it a few days ago but just went out and bought two more bottles so that I don&#x27;t have to worry about running out any time soon. Without a doubt, this is the very best hairspray that I have ever used for my hair! The only thing that could possibly make it any better, in my opinion, if it was unscented, but I can live with that.  PS: Walmart sells it for $4.</li>
            <li> Pantene has always been a good brand and I like the control that this hairspray has on my hair.  I have stick-straight hair, so when I curl it, this hairspray helps so keep the style.  And I don&#x27;t feel a build-up of the product even though I am not a daily shampooer.  It&#x27;s non-aerosol, which is what I prefer.</li>
            <li> This is the only spray I use.  Over the years I&#x27;ve tried several and this is the best one for me.  I like that it&#x27;s non-aerosol, so I feel as if I&#x27;m helping the ozone while getting the hold I prefer with my hair style.</li>
            <li> This hairspray is the best. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed and got it so fast.</li>
            <li> Have been happily using this brand for years, but what I received used older purple &amp; white packaging, and in my opinion, the smell was very slightly different than a more recently purchased bottle with the yellow/gold label. So while I like this hairspray a lot, I am personally not totally sure this provider is entirely authentic/current.</li>
            <li> works well and not stcky</li>
            <li> This hairspray is light and does not make one&#x27;s hair feel like a board.  The pump is healthier for one than the aerosol.</li>
            <li> Light fragrance, which is why I tried it - fragrances can nauseate me.  Not sticky, can use it and the next day cannot tell. Provides shine - I have colored hair and it isn&#x27;t always as shiny as I would like otherwise.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find this product .</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, will buy again! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Holds without stiffness.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Not widely available.  Thankfully there is Amazon.</li>
            <li> Like the non-aerosol option and great hold</li>
    </ol>
