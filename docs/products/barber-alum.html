            <li>It feels great.</li>

            <li>It is not made to help with ingrown hair, or make you fly...</li>
            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>Works great and makes for a pleasant shave.</li>
            <li>use it on both my face and head after shaving, and it&#x27;s really nice!</li>
            <li>it was a good price and great travel size.  </li>
            <li>All in all good product.    </li>
            <li>After my face air dries, I apply a good balm (not an alcohol based aftershave).    </li>
            <li>I ordered the block and it arrived fairly promptly</li>
            <li>but I assume that means that it is doing something good for my face.</li>
            <li>then again those guys look like they don&#x27;t appreciate a good shave</li>
            <li>I purchased this product based on good reviews and price.</li>
            <li>and I am good to go.</li>
            <li>This is a good, substantially sized block.</li>
            <li>It is a good value and arrived on time.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly 50 times longer than those bottled</li>
            <li>( good thing )</li>
            <li>This is hefty and feels good in the hand.  </li>
            <li>I have not cut myself yet, but I think it is also fairly good at stopping bleeding.</li>
            <li>Good product and a good value.</li>
            <li>This is a good replacement for the chemically cocktail of an aftershave solutions out there.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for toning in this respect too.</li>
            <li>This is an exceptionally well priced block, which is why I bought it.  </li>
            <li>Alum is very refreshing after you shave.</li>
            <li>I have to say that I am very satisfied with the purchase.  </li>
            <li>Works great, no reason to spend more.</li>
            <li>and I was very pleased, then my elation fell into dismay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seeing as how this one had many great reviews</li>
            <li>prooves that Turks make excellent shaving stuff at very reasonable price range.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li>Always the first and best post razor step for me.</li>
            <li>Item exactly as described and received in excellent condition.</li>
            <li>; I&#x27;ll probably never need to order more again!  </li>
            <li>For the first week I had it (after removing the crust,) it was awesome</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even use after shave any more!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing</li>
            <li>This is fairly good, it&#x27;s not as effective as I thought it would be, sometime a styptic pencil works better for</li>
            <li>work well as a kind of isolated mini-soap dish, with the cup&#x27;s teeth being turned upwards, towards the bar of alum.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product, highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I will say that it kind of stings</li>
            <li>In fact, I happen to have a jar of food-grade alum, perhaps I should grow my own crystal, like we did in school</li>
            <li>Run it under warm water and hold it over a nick to stop the bleeding and prevent infection.</li>
            <li>No fancy packaging whatsoever, so have a soap dish handy to store it in.</li>
            <li>Works just as good as alum bars that are sold for 4x more.</li>
            <li>I know its kind of spendy</li>
            <li>I liked the results and would recommend / purchase again.</li>
            <li>Not as effective as styptic.</li>
            <li>Nice if you are going to show off the box around your neck for three times the price.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Closes the pores nicely, with a cooling sting (no pain).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase, and I wish I had known about using an alum bar after shaving many years ago.  </li>
            <li>Not too much to add to the fact that this is a good size bar of alum for a great price.</li>
            <li>Kind of refreshing</li>
            <li>This was marked as being ~4oz and at that price this was the perfect buy.</li>
            <li>since for $1 more you get a nice storage container.  </li>
            <li>Sure, it isn&#x27;t in a nice plastic holder.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t honestly believe that the Razorock is any better formed, as one reviewer does.</li>
            <li>In the privacy of my own home this sits proudly on the sink, ready if needed.</li>
            <li>its just not for shavers either would be great in a first aid kit</li>
            <li>Very cheap, sealed off my nick with ease.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know any better.  </li>
            <li>Now that I have tried others which are more well-formed (like razorock&#x27;s alum stick)</li>
            <li>this helps!coolness, most of the time I can&#x27;t even see what caused it.    </li>
            <li>why pay more.</li>
            <li>But it is neccessary for cuts and covers more area than a stick.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ask for much more than that.     </li>
            <li>I love this for the price and it works.</li>
            <li>but it gets the job done better than most alum.</li>
            <li>Can burn like heck, but stops any nicks you might have from bleeding and helps tighten up your skin before you use your favorite soothing after shave.</li>
            <li>Alum was used by the Egyptians more than 4,000 years ago.</li>
            <li>Save it for a better soap or razor.</li>
            <li>Nothing more needs to be said.</li>
            <li>so I am probably safe.</li>
            <li>Having never used an alum block before, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>Make you sure you pick &amp;#34;potassium alum&amp;#34; and not &amp;#34;ammonium alum&amp;#34; (which works, but stings more).</li>
            <li>Better to travel with.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>There are better options out there.</li>
            <li>What more could you want to know?</li>
            <li>My husband used more profane words, but that is what he meant.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d be better off to get a styptic pen, which works quite well.</li>
            <li>Why pay more for a brand name?</li>
            <li>There are better out there</li>
            <li>Best to only shave as close as your skill level allows.  </li>
            <li>Sure it&#x27;s not in a over priced package or name brand</li>
            <li>Make sure you have a dish for it to sit in, because you will end up with alum crystals all in your wife&#x27;s medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li>I rinse the apply an after shave lotin and my face has never looked or felt better.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>over all though seems to be ok</li>
            <li>There are better deals out there.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Better quality than this one and even comes with a plastic tray to sit in.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use aftershave any more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had issues with razor burn and nicks and cuts, so when I decided to switch to a safety razor I saw that many folks recommended an alum block.</li>
            <li>Excellent product that will last years.</li>
            <li>and I was able to reorder another brand (Razorock) on eBay.</li>
            <li>Alum is alum, there&#x27;s no point in shelling out more money than you have to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always found this to be the best finish-up after a shave, and they last me for about a year</li>
            <li>more can be said about this alum bar.</li>
            <li>But the rounded and exposed nature of the Razorock makes it wetter, makes it stay wetter, and makes it erode more.</li>
            <li>If you know what this is for and how to use it, you will love it.</li>
            <li>Much better than the pencil type.</li>
            <li>A refreshing addition to my shaving collection</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fifth thing you need to know (and the end of this already too long review!): This stuff works GREAT!</li>
            <li>Great item at a cheap price, might sting a fraction more then my old one that I paid $18 for</li>
            <li>Brilliant, can&#x27;t recommend enough.</li>
            <li>Easily done though.</li>
            <li>This is great stuff, it feels a bit rough to be honest...</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product was shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great product to close the pores and tighten your face after treating yourself to a nice wet</li>
            <li>after i have washed off i am ass good as new and hours after you don&#x27;t can&#x27;t even know that you cut yourself.</li>
            <li>These alum stones work fine for me.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s just fine by me.</li>
            <li>you are not paying name brand prices for this which is fine.</li>
            <li>The alum is fine, the block just crumbled on me.</li>
            <li>The edges are a bit rougher than my alum block, but it does the job just fine.</li>
            <li>The alum block is refreshing and does an excellent job of stopping any &amp;#34;weepers&amp;#34; or small nicks.</li>
            <li>Nice large piece of alum.  </li>
            <li>It took a bit of washing and light scrubbing to remove the spots before I felt comfortable applying it to my face though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For nicks I use Nick Relief Powder, available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>now I know why it was so cheap.</li>
            <li>I bought a couple blocks of these since they were cheap, but they were cheap quality too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is silky smooth on my face after i shave.&lt;br /&gt;Dont</li>
            <li>What can I say it was cheap</li>
            <li>but if you are strategist razor / DE shaver you know an alum block is fantastic.</li>
            <li>This causes its own irritation and as the whole idea of using an alum block is to avoid later irritation, it isn&#x27;t so great to be scraping the heck out of your face.</li>
            <li>This is cheap and does the job.  </li>
            <li>I would happily choose this product again over any big name brand.</li>
            <li>This fit the bill in all reguards.</li>
            <li>Buy a better version/brand and you&#x27;ll get much longer life out of your alum block and have better shaving experience.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great for minor cuts.  </li>
            <li>Order more than one at a time though, as shipping on just one is pretty steep.</li>
            <li>so we could read what the original manufacturer printed.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>If there are rough bits, run a fingernail over the top after wetting the bar, and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>Within a day or so any acne I had is cleared up and my face feels toned and clean.</li>
            <li>Great if you&#x27;re looking to get into wet shaving.</li>
            <li>Some days a really great wet shave still leaves your skin feeling a bit beaten up.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much smoother and better formed - and it stays like that as you use it, and it&#x27;s in a format where you don&#x27;t need a container.  </li>
            <li>Not painful, just means its working on any razor burn you might have.  </li>
            <li>cool razor burn after shaving.</li>
            <li>I find this easiest to work with by dunking this in sink that is still full of shaving water.</li>
            <li>but this was full if it.</li>
            <li>it does such a good jobas a tool for after shave that i have stopped using after shave...</li>
            <li>Natural and effective.</li>
            <li>This is a good sized bar of Alum that should last quite a while.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>I could easily see someone getting a bar where NONE of the sides are pretty.</li>
            <li>This is a very small block of barber alum, but it is perfect for doing the job.  </li>
            <li>It stops bleeding nicks quickly.  </li>
            <li>thing that&#x27;s worthy of note: you&#x27;ll need to figure out some sort of storage system.  </li>
            <li>Deteriorates quickly.</li>
            <li>The product arrived just as promised, and was adequately packaged.</li>
            <li>If you need something mild this might work for you.</li>
            <li>One time during shaving I accidentally cut myself, enough to bleed a fair amount (for a shaving cut), and just circling the alum block around it for a couple seconds stopped it right away.</li>
            <li>What makes this one stand out is the price, far more reasonable than most others.</li>
            <li>: The packaging isn&#x27;t very pretty.</li>
            <li>and it was pretty cheap</li>
            <li>Overall very pleased with the product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to have a simple, natural styptic solution that&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>This is gently abrasive so its great for rubbing your face with after you shave to rub away any dry skin and it will seal up any cuts you might have.</li>
            <li>This no-name block can easily be found (depending on seller) for about $4 for an 80g, is the same size and slightly more dense (by 5g) than the Bloc Osma that sells for $8+ or the 104g Art of Shaving block that goes for $20 in the stores.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an all natural Alum Block with a smooth contour allowing for easy glide on the face.</li>
            <li>This is a great little alum bar.</li>
            <li>This is a small clean Alumblock it works great.</li>
            <li>I use alum as a regular aftershave treatment, and I shave a very good percentage of my body, as well as my entire face/neck.</li>
            <li>Shipment on time, it is a real alum piece, and it&#x27;s really cheap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do very well.  </li>
            <li>This alum seems to be great for my acne;  if I forget to use it for a few days, my acne seems to return.  </li>
            <li>It generally feels nice and cool, it gently tightens up your pores, and (I think) cleans your wounds.</li>
            <li>so I was extra careful unpacking and hoping for the best.</li>
            <li>The current price is spectacular for this item compared to others</li>
            <li>This stuff is economical, so don&#x27;t forget it when buying shaving supplies.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t pay more for Alum, there&#x27;s absolutely no reason as it doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.</li>
            <li>Nice simple way to seal the pores after shaving.  </li>
            <li>couple chunks broke off, and it&#x27;s not even worth it to try to save them.</li>
            <li>It also seems to do help prevent acne from what I&#x27;ve noticed, as it sanitizes and gets absorbed into the pores.</li>
            <li>I have used other alum blocks and have had good results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right amount of sting and cooling you need after a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like to rub this on my face right after shaving.  </li>
            <li>Uh,  you know what it does, right?  </li>
            <li>The price was right and the performance of the product exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>It should seal up right</li>
            <li>Sure it takes twice as long as just dragging a multi-blade razor across my face, but I actually enjoy it.</li>
            <li>It cost me very little and feels great after a shave.</li>
            <li>Later I found that this product was far better than some of the top brand</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s been shaving for several months now, and he&#x27;s said that this little bar is the greatest after shave he&#x27;s ever used.</li>
            <li>The seller (Tulumba) shipped it super fast - ordered on a Saturday afternoon, received a USPS notification on Sunday and it shipped on Monday.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great and one block will likely last a couple years.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just amazing that all these products are so unknown..</li>
            <li>In the interest of getting an even better shave, I decided to pick up some barber alum at the recommendation of several shaving websites.</li>
            <li>A nice block of alum, a must have for wet shaving</li>
            <li>This one is much cheaper than the rest, so it is worth a shot.      </li>
            <li>You can tell when it finds something, because you&#x27;ll feel the smallest sting in the middle of the coolness, most of the time I can&#x27;t even see what caused it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Looks and feels exactly like my first $25 alum block.</li>
            <li>Way better than a styptic pencil, more economical and extremely long lasting.  </li>
            <li>I first received this, it looked moldy?</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Used it yesterday after shaving - same thing, more convenient.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this over 2 years, yes, but I started using it more regularly about a month ago - both after shaving and also as a deodorant</li>
            <li>You can get a better deal by getting &amp;#34;deodorant stones&amp;#34; which is the same thing.</li>
            <li>the first alum i bought was a nice solid opaque white smooth block.  </li>
            <li>waster your money on this scrap alum, buy a nice solid smooth as silk block, it will last you over a year.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Most alum blocks are the same.</li>
            <li>I used it a ton at first</li>
            <li>This is the first time using alum as part of the after shave process.  </li>
            <li>Went straight from receiving package to the garbage!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m confident a more expensive block would not have done me better.</li>
            <li>A few strokes post shave seals nicks, closes pores, and feels pretty darn good, too.  </li>
            <li>Came exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>I used it the first time I cut myself shaving</li>
            <li>That said, most of this block will simply crumble in your hand after you use it for a while.</li>
            <li>At first, you might try to &amp;#34;save&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used alum on my face after shaving.  </li>
            <li>I would anticipate one bar should last many months with every day usage.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my man after buying him his first safety razor.</li>
            <li>Block of alum, does exactly what it should.</li>
            <li>and I can guarantee you&#x27;ll love it and never go back.</li>
            <li>ok, but cheap alum, big hole in the middle, wears quickly.</li>
            <li>I just couldn&#x27;t get a nice smooth surface on it which is harsh on a newly shaved face.</li>
            <li>in all, I strongly suggest popping the extra $2 for a better quality of properly handled product.</li>
            <li>Would have been nice if the shipper had left the package labelling clear of its inventory control tags though,</li>
            <li>While it was cheap to purchase, the sides started pitting unevenly, and instead of a rectangle, it is more of a trapezium (I just googled this).</li>
            <li>A great price compared to other products being offered that do the exact same thing.  </li>
            <li>think all these alum blocks are pretty much identical</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the safety razor or the alum [or a combination of the two] as well as good pre/post shaving techniques</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For small nicks its really good though.</li>
            <li>My only gripe: this is more of a &amp;#34;refill&amp;#34; than a complete &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; - it would be nice to have some sort of a paper &amp;#34;case&amp;#34; - a way to hold it without getting it all wet.</li>
            <li>Apply this after shaving, before the after shave, and seal up all the little spots you didn&#x27;t know hurt yet from shaving a bit too close...finish with your favorite after shave and you&#x27;re set!</li>
            <li>Be sure to dry it off after you use it to lengthen the life of the bar.</li>
            <li>Good price for a long lasting product.</li>
            <li>(Also, I have a strong suspicion that this may have contributed to the second issue, read on for the details.)</li>
            <li>pure alum</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fourth thing you need to know: Some of the sides aren&#x27;t pretty, meaning smooth and flat.</li>
            <li>This generic bar works just fine, at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>This really makes your face feel smooth, relieves the skin from razor burn and it will stop the occasional nick from bleeding.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price and fast shipping though.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to use after shaving with my straight razor.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product and would recommend it&#x27;s use to others.  </li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>really, it immediately stops any bleeding--and helps with reducing razor burn.  </li>
            <li>This is the cheapest brand at Amazon.com, it is OK, there are not much differences between them.</li>
            <li>It did have some &amp;#34;green growth&amp;#34; on it, but I just rinsed it off really well.</li>
            <li>I shave with a straight razor, and I&#x27;d heard that this helps soothe the skin.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t notice much of anything the one time I tried it.</li>
            <li>A real necessity for shaving if razor burn is a problem.</li>
            <li>Seriosuly, he loves the way it helps his skin heal after a straight razor shave.</li>
            <li>The block does what is intended to do at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I do have to say that when I received it a corner was broken off but its worked great.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice much sting when using this either.</li>
            <li>It is tiny and cheap, but does the job.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone wetshaving on a budget, it really makes a difference in your post-shave skin care.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price</li>
            <li>But do you really want to pay $ 20.00 to stop a bleeder?</li>
            <li>Really, Alum blocks are all chemically the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>If you carefully cut the top part of the package to make a flap you do not need a container.</li>
            <li>and it really worked well.  </li>
            <li>I must say I really like how my face feels after using it.  </li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift, and if you&#x27;re really pinching then go for it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sometimes at night if I just want to do a quick clean of my face or if I have a breakout I&#x27;ll wet the alum bar and rub it all over.</li>
            <li>The general consensus seems to be that alum is pretty much all the same but varies greatly in price due to brand name.</li>
            <li>It lasts a really long time and is really easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works so well and very quickly to stop minor shaving nicks.</li>
            <li>Not much to say, other than this product is a great example of an alum bar.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this if it&#x27;s your only option, but be aware there are much better ones out there and probably for the same price!</li>
            <li>I did finally find clean area</li>
            <li>it stings slightly more its not remotely painful in the least.</li>
            <li>I liked this because it was my only alum solution for shaving for a long time.  </li>
            <li>First, when I opened it, it was half covered in patchy groups in some kind of crust of hard nearly concrete-like blobs, presumably some kind of mineralization from improper storage allowing in moisture containing mineral that reacted with the alum</li>
            <li>The more expensive alum that I have remains very smooth after drying.</li>
            <li>Had to wear it down to be able to use it on my face.</li>
            <li>Stings a bit, but less than most over-the-counter aftershave products.</li>
            <li>Ali Biyikli is enjoyable to use and and performs as well as alum block that I&#x27;ve used for much less money</li>
            <li>and I received my last from AKM quickly.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s the cheapest block I found to try and will likely last many years.</li>
            <li>This particular brand is the potassium one, not the ammonium one</li>
            <li>it will last me for several more months..</li>
            <li>I think I will purchase a different brand next time with better quality control.</li>
            <li>If your brush didn&#x27;t cost $200 it can&#x27;t possibly be any good, and you can&#x27;t possibly get good lather from any soap or cream that costs less than $25 for a small cake or tube.    </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This is a cute little alum block.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to rinse your face a little after using, because if you sweat with it on your face, it leaves a film on everything (cellphone screens, etc), but any alum will do that.</li>
            <li>Could use a little sanding/polishing to make it smoother but at this price that is OK.</li>
            <li>this little brick is more than sufficient.</li>
            <li>I have no doubt this block will last me many years if it doesn&#x27;t get dropped in the toilet or lost.</li>
            <li>This rinses clean and doesn&#x27;t have much a scent, and certainly not one that lingers.</li>
            <li>I started getting into wet shaving about a year ago and wanted something cheap that would help close my pores/help irritation/stop bleeding.</li>
            <li>I plan on buying a few more of these just to stock up at this</li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty much all the same ..</li>
            <li>It will last a long time for sure.</li>
            <li>And it has neat packaging that you normally will not find in the states.</li>
            <li>I bought this recently and everyone was right.</li>
            <li>but then I started to actually learn how to shave with my safety razor and haven&#x27;t really used this guy much</li>
            <li>Old school shaving classic.</li>
            <li>It looks like it was very old and not quality and new.</li>
            <li>Also, the dimensions of the block in question measure 1-3/8 x 2-3/16 x 7/8 inches, given allowance for certain off-square faces--the block apparently having been crystallized in two sections which were then sandwiched together like congealed paraffin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very cheap and seems to last quite a while, as I am still on the same bar that I bough summer of last year.  </li>
            <li>Using alum is a great way to get feedback on the shave since nicks and raw spots may sting a little for a minute or two.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the same stuff that others are charging anywhere from $10 to $80 for, just not packaged as well, and frankly, thie Alum isn&#x27;t as pretty as the others either.</li>
            <li>Feels like it will last a couple of years just like my first block.</li>
            <li>Next time I think I&#x27;ll go with a higher quality alum though.</li>
            <li>They are the same exact thing - an alum block shaped like a deodorant stick, with convenient dispenser.</li>
            <li>Charging or paying up to 5 times for exactly the same thing is shear madness.</li>
            <li>Pretty simple...</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need a fancy package, especially when the product does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>For just $4 it&#x27;s definitely worth it and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Rinse with cool water, and rub the alum bar on my wet face.</li>
            <li>I rub this alum block over my cool wet face after shaving.</li>
            <li>I received an item called \\&quot;icy cool alum\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>If the seller would drop the shipping price a little, it would easily be five stars.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It tightens up the pores, stops the razor burn and generally makes shaving just a little bit better.</li>
            <li>bought a block in a old drug store for $10, it was probably 3 oz, the same as my first one.  </li>
            <li>I just use the other full side on my face.  </li>
            <li>its not a bad product, but as the other reviewer noted shipping will kill you</li>
            <li>Sure, you get less &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; with other packaged alum products, but I&#x27;ve found that they last pretty much forever and don&#x27;t crumble the way this did.</li>
            <li>This is alum folks, pure and simple.</li>
            <li>This thing is an absolute godsend after a nice hot shave- leave your face wet, run this under cold water for a few seconds, then rub it all over your face and neck to tighten things up so nicely you can bounce a quarter off of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These little alum bars stop the blood from oozing out my hacked-up face, and they&#x27;re cheap as can be.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little square bar that will fit in the palm of your hand.</li>
            <li>I was a little suspicious of the packaging and quality of this stuff -- especially when there are better looking products for two and three times the price.</li>
            <li>It kind of gives a light stinging sensation as well, nothing really painful.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena Men Sensitive Skin Post Shave Balm, 3.4 Ounce (Pack of 3)]] and</li>
            <li>the process is complete leaving my face feeling like I&#x27;ve had a spa day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Supposedly this has also been used as a natural deodorant for hundreds of years</li>
            <li>You can really now see that it&#x27;s made up of smaller crystals pressed together.</li>
            <li>Rub this stuff on your still-wet face after you&#x27;ve shaved, and you will see far fewer bumps and ingrown hairs pop up on your face.</li>
            <li>use a smooth block, without green coloration, you deserve</li>
            <li>Yes, it tends to be cheaper, but it is for a far inferior product in my experience.</li>
            <li>This is a basic tool that does not need much review.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to go old school.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the same stuff, but twice as much for 1/2 the price.</li>
            <li>You can really feel it closing your pores as it dries, you skin feels like it&#x27;s tightening like when you use a facial mask.</li>
            <li>I have somewhat sensitive skin, and the alum seems to soothe rather than irritate.</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;m still getting my money&#x27;s worth out of it, but next time I&#x27;ll look for a solid block.</li>
            <li>this is a really good value, nothing wrong with this product at all.</li>
            <li>Minor nicks and cuts stop bleeding, but I really like how my face feels tight and smooth after rubbing it over my face.  </li>
            <li>I had to clean off all of the green mold before using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since then, it has been working well and seems to be lasting a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li>Small size if much more maneuverable than the bigger Alum blocks.</li>
            <li>I accidentally dropped it from about a foot above my sink into the sink (so not all the way to the floor, mind you) and it shattered into many small pieces.</li>
            <li>The center dissolved early, maybe because I used it under hot water.</li>
            <li>Many wet shavers that use single or double edged razors use alum.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smaller than I expected, but I still expect it to last me many months to a year with daily use.</li>
            <li>I tried this block this morning for the very first time, rubbing it over my face and neck like a small bar of soap after wet shaving, and it seems to do a fine job--revealing potential razor burn, tightening the skin, and drawing pores to a close.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m torn on the the value of alum in general, but I do use it when I&#x27;ve gone too far and caused myself some razor burn.</li>
            <li>He says that it&#x27;s cooling, sometimes can sting a little after a super close shave, but he won&#x27;t use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A little rough, but OK.</li>
            <li>A must if you are new to double edge/single edge shaving.</li>
            <li>I have had mine for over a year and it is still the same size as I got it when new.</li>
            <li>Seemed very cheap and was broken in the package when I opened it.</li>
            <li>Some it seals right off while other need an extra touch with my [[ASIN:B002HTI2TI Proraso Styptic Gel, 10 ml]].</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s not just this brand, just product in general.</li>
            <li>I think by the third use mine was drying on my face clear as glass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seeing as the bar functions like a tiny bar of soap, and not knowing where to let it drain afterwards, I have by chance discovered that Ace hardware-brand \\&quot;clear</li>
            <li>Run it under cold water and lightly rub  it over your face to cool your face and ease the burn after a shave.</li>
            <li>I rinsed it off and set it on a counter, and apparently the exposure to water and air got rid of the spots before I ever used it.  </li>
            <li>Made from potash alum, an alum block is an old staple in traditional barbershops.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve barely made a dent in it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s difficult to identify exactly how big of an impact this product made as I changed many aspects of my shaving regimen at one time, but I have noticed a big improvement in regards to shaving irritation since I started using this product.  </li>
            <li>This small bar will last pretty much forever from what I can tell</li>
            <li>If you have the option, goto a local health food store and buy some natural deoderant.</li>
            <li>When I got mine the corners were broken but most of the block was still usable.</li>
            <li>I had to use it carefully a couple times smooth down the edges.</li>
            <li>this is due to a reaction from contact with certain minerals.)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an active member of one of the major on-line straight razor forums.</li>
            <li>I bought this when i started using a safety razor and it have helped me a lot, in the beginning i got a lot of small cuts and just drag this over my face and most of the cuts will stop bleeding at the same time.</li>
            <li>IMHO, I would get like a wet piece of cotton cloth (like a T-shirt) or something similar, and rub whatever sides you want to flatten on the cloth until they&#x27;re ready for prime time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was always rough against my face even after a few shaves and even after trying to rub it smooth under running water for a while.</li>
            <li>First thing you should know: This block is little.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Third thing you should know: Until you break it in, the first couple uses may leave a slight white residue on your face, like a styptic does.</li>
            <li>No residues after the first few uses with and you can feel the sting and skin tighten during use.</li>
            <li>This block disolves much faster than others I&#x27;ve ordered, and does not maintain a slick surface after drying - feels like sandpaper after a fresh shave - not very comfortable.</li>
            <li>This really cuts down on any bleeding or irritation.  </li>
            <li>At first I was not sure if this product would be much of a difference than other after-shave products I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>Every time I use a new blade, even being careful, it seems there is some bleeding.</li>
            <li>Looks a little funky straight out of the package, as the salt crystalizes in a gray pattern in some places.</li>
            <li>I was a little apprehensive about this product and didn&#x27;t expect much.  </li>
            <li>After a shave this stuff works great in healing nicks and cuts on your face, a little cold water a rub with it and waala</li>
            <li>I am only giving this four stores because I thought that the shipping was a little much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to write an exciting review about astringent.</li>

            <li> All in all good product.    </li>
            <li> After my face air dries, I apply a good balm (not an alcohol based aftershave).    </li>
            <li> I ordered the block and it arrived fairly promptly</li>
            <li> but I assume that means that it is doing something good for my face.</li>
            <li> then again those guys look like they don&#x27;t appreciate a good shave</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on good reviews and price.</li>
            <li> and I am good to go.</li>
            <li> This is a good, substantially sized block.</li>
            <li> It is a good value and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly 50 times longer than those bottled</li>
            <li> ( good thing )</li>
            <li> This is hefty and feels good in the hand.  </li>
            <li> I have not cut myself yet, but I think it is also fairly good at stopping bleeding.</li>
            <li> Good product and a good value.</li>
            <li> This is a good replacement for the chemically cocktail of an aftershave solutions out there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for toning in this respect too.</li>
            <li> This is an exceptionally well priced block, which is why I bought it.  </li>
            <li> Alum is very refreshing after you shave.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I am very satisfied with the purchase.  </li>
            <li> Works great, no reason to spend more.</li>
            <li> and I was very pleased, then my elation fell into dismay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seeing as how this one had many great reviews</li>
            <li> prooves that Turks make excellent shaving stuff at very reasonable price range.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li> Always the first and best post razor step for me.</li>
            <li> Item exactly as described and received in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> ; I&#x27;ll probably never need to order more again!  </li>
            <li> For the first week I had it (after removing the crust,) it was awesome</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use after shave any more!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing</li>
            <li> This is fairly good, it&#x27;s not as effective as I thought it would be, sometime a styptic pencil works better for</li>
            <li> work well as a kind of isolated mini-soap dish, with the cup&#x27;s teeth being turned upwards, towards the bar of alum.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I will say that it kind of stings</li>
            <li> In fact, I happen to have a jar of food-grade alum, perhaps I should grow my own crystal, like we did in school</li>
            <li> Run it under warm water and hold it over a nick to stop the bleeding and prevent infection.</li>
            <li> No fancy packaging whatsoever, so have a soap dish handy to store it in.</li>
            <li> Works just as good as alum bars that are sold for 4x more.</li>
            <li> I know its kind of spendy</li>
            <li> I liked the results and would recommend / purchase again.</li>
            <li> Not as effective as styptic.</li>
            <li> Nice if you are going to show off the box around your neck for three times the price.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Closes the pores nicely, with a cooling sting (no pain).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase, and I wish I had known about using an alum bar after shaving many years ago.  </li>
            <li> Not too much to add to the fact that this is a good size bar of alum for a great price.</li>
            <li> Kind of refreshing</li>
            <li> This was marked as being ~4oz and at that price this was the perfect buy.</li>
            <li> since for $1 more you get a nice storage container.  </li>
            <li> Sure, it isn&#x27;t in a nice plastic holder.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t honestly believe that the Razorock is any better formed, as one reviewer does.</li>
            <li> In the privacy of my own home this sits proudly on the sink, ready if needed.</li>
            <li> its just not for shavers either would be great in a first aid kit</li>
            <li> Very cheap, sealed off my nick with ease.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know any better.  </li>
            <li> Now that I have tried others which are more well-formed (like razorock&#x27;s alum stick)</li>
            <li> this helps!coolness, most of the time I can&#x27;t even see what caused it.    </li>
            <li> why pay more.</li>
            <li> But it is neccessary for cuts and covers more area than a stick.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t ask for much more than that.     </li>
            <li> I love this for the price and it works.</li>
            <li> but it gets the job done better than most alum.</li>
            <li> Can burn like heck, but stops any nicks you might have from bleeding and helps tighten up your skin before you use your favorite soothing after shave.</li>
            <li> Alum was used by the Egyptians more than 4,000 years ago.</li>
            <li> Save it for a better soap or razor.</li>
            <li> Nothing more needs to be said.</li>
            <li> so I am probably safe.</li>
            <li> Having never used an alum block before, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> Make you sure you pick &amp;#34;potassium alum&amp;#34; and not &amp;#34;ammonium alum&amp;#34; (which works, but stings more).</li>
            <li> Better to travel with.  </li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> There are better options out there.</li>
            <li> What more could you want to know?</li>
            <li> My husband used more profane words, but that is what he meant.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d be better off to get a styptic pen, which works quite well.</li>
            <li> Why pay more for a brand name?</li>
            <li> There are better out there</li>
            <li> Best to only shave as close as your skill level allows.  </li>
            <li> Sure it&#x27;s not in a over priced package or name brand</li>
            <li> Make sure you have a dish for it to sit in, because you will end up with alum crystals all in your wife&#x27;s medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> I rinse the apply an after shave lotin and my face has never looked or felt better.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> over all though seems to be ok</li>
            <li> There are better deals out there.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Better quality than this one and even comes with a plastic tray to sit in.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use aftershave any more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had issues with razor burn and nicks and cuts, so when I decided to switch to a safety razor I saw that many folks recommended an alum block.</li>
            <li> Excellent product that will last years.</li>
            <li> and I was able to reorder another brand (Razorock) on eBay.</li>
            <li> Alum is alum, there&#x27;s no point in shelling out more money than you have to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always found this to be the best finish-up after a shave, and they last me for about a year</li>
            <li> more can be said about this alum bar.</li>
            <li> But the rounded and exposed nature of the Razorock makes it wetter, makes it stay wetter, and makes it erode more.</li>
            <li> If you know what this is for and how to use it, you will love it.</li>
            <li> Much better than the pencil type.</li>
            <li> A refreshing addition to my shaving collection</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fifth thing you need to know (and the end of this already too long review!): This stuff works GREAT!</li>
            <li> Great item at a cheap price, might sting a fraction more then my old one that I paid $18 for</li>
            <li> Brilliant, can&#x27;t recommend enough.</li>
            <li> Easily done though.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff, it feels a bit rough to be honest...</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product was shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great product to close the pores and tighten your face after treating yourself to a nice wet</li>
            <li> after i have washed off i am ass good as new and hours after you don&#x27;t can&#x27;t even know that you cut yourself.</li>
            <li> These alum stones work fine for me.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s just fine by me.</li>
            <li> you are not paying name brand prices for this which is fine.</li>
            <li> The alum is fine, the block just crumbled on me.</li>
            <li> The edges are a bit rougher than my alum block, but it does the job just fine.</li>
            <li> The alum block is refreshing and does an excellent job of stopping any &amp;#34;weepers&amp;#34; or small nicks.</li>
            <li> Nice large piece of alum.  </li>
            <li> It took a bit of washing and light scrubbing to remove the spots before I felt comfortable applying it to my face though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For nicks I use Nick Relief Powder, available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> now I know why it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> I bought a couple blocks of these since they were cheap, but they were cheap quality too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is silky smooth on my face after i shave.&lt;br /&gt;Dont</li>
            <li> What can I say it was cheap</li>
            <li> but if you are strategist razor / DE shaver you know an alum block is fantastic.</li>
            <li> This causes its own irritation and as the whole idea of using an alum block is to avoid later irritation, it isn&#x27;t so great to be scraping the heck out of your face.</li>
            <li> This is cheap and does the job.  </li>
            <li> I would happily choose this product again over any big name brand.</li>
            <li> This fit the bill in all reguards.</li>
            <li> Buy a better version/brand and you&#x27;ll get much longer life out of your alum block and have better shaving experience.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great for minor cuts.  </li>
            <li> Order more than one at a time though, as shipping on just one is pretty steep.</li>
            <li> so we could read what the original manufacturer printed.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> If there are rough bits, run a fingernail over the top after wetting the bar, and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> Within a day or so any acne I had is cleared up and my face feels toned and clean.</li>
            <li> Great if you&#x27;re looking to get into wet shaving.</li>
            <li> Some days a really great wet shave still leaves your skin feeling a bit beaten up.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much smoother and better formed - and it stays like that as you use it, and it&#x27;s in a format where you don&#x27;t need a container.  </li>
            <li> Not painful, just means its working on any razor burn you might have.  </li>
            <li> cool razor burn after shaving.</li>
            <li> I find this easiest to work with by dunking this in sink that is still full of shaving water.</li>
            <li> but this was full if it.</li>
            <li> it does such a good jobas a tool for after shave that i have stopped using after shave...</li>
            <li> Natural and effective.</li>
            <li> This is a good sized bar of Alum that should last quite a while.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> I could easily see someone getting a bar where NONE of the sides are pretty.</li>
            <li> This is a very small block of barber alum, but it is perfect for doing the job.  </li>
            <li> It stops bleeding nicks quickly.  </li>
            <li> thing that&#x27;s worthy of note: you&#x27;ll need to figure out some sort of storage system.  </li>
            <li> Deteriorates quickly.</li>
            <li> The product arrived just as promised, and was adequately packaged.</li>
            <li> If you need something mild this might work for you.</li>
            <li> One time during shaving I accidentally cut myself, enough to bleed a fair amount (for a shaving cut), and just circling the alum block around it for a couple seconds stopped it right away.</li>
            <li> What makes this one stand out is the price, far more reasonable than most others.</li>
            <li> : The packaging isn&#x27;t very pretty.</li>
            <li> and it was pretty cheap</li>
            <li> Overall very pleased with the product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to have a simple, natural styptic solution that&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> This is gently abrasive so its great for rubbing your face with after you shave to rub away any dry skin and it will seal up any cuts you might have.</li>
            <li> This no-name block can easily be found (depending on seller) for about $4 for an 80g, is the same size and slightly more dense (by 5g) than the Bloc Osma that sells for $8+ or the 104g Art of Shaving block that goes for $20 in the stores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an all natural Alum Block with a smooth contour allowing for easy glide on the face.</li>
            <li> This is a great little alum bar.</li>
            <li> This is a small clean Alumblock it works great.</li>
            <li> I use alum as a regular aftershave treatment, and I shave a very good percentage of my body, as well as my entire face/neck.</li>
            <li> Shipment on time, it is a real alum piece, and it&#x27;s really cheap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do very well.  </li>
            <li> This alum seems to be great for my acne;  if I forget to use it for a few days, my acne seems to return.  </li>
            <li> It generally feels nice and cool, it gently tightens up your pores, and (I think) cleans your wounds.</li>
            <li> so I was extra careful unpacking and hoping for the best.</li>
            <li> The current price is spectacular for this item compared to others</li>
            <li> This stuff is economical, so don&#x27;t forget it when buying shaving supplies.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t pay more for Alum, there&#x27;s absolutely no reason as it doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.</li>
            <li> Nice simple way to seal the pores after shaving.  </li>
            <li> couple chunks broke off, and it&#x27;s not even worth it to try to save them.</li>
            <li> It also seems to do help prevent acne from what I&#x27;ve noticed, as it sanitizes and gets absorbed into the pores.</li>
            <li> I have used other alum blocks and have had good results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the right amount of sting and cooling you need after a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like to rub this on my face right after shaving.  </li>
            <li> Uh,  you know what it does, right?  </li>
            <li> The price was right and the performance of the product exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> It should seal up right</li>
            <li> Sure it takes twice as long as just dragging a multi-blade razor across my face, but I actually enjoy it.</li>
            <li> It cost me very little and feels great after a shave.</li>
            <li> Later I found that this product was far better than some of the top brand</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been shaving for several months now, and he&#x27;s said that this little bar is the greatest after shave he&#x27;s ever used.</li>
            <li> The seller (Tulumba) shipped it super fast - ordered on a Saturday afternoon, received a USPS notification on Sunday and it shipped on Monday.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great and one block will likely last a couple years.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just amazing that all these products are so unknown..</li>
            <li> In the interest of getting an even better shave, I decided to pick up some barber alum at the recommendation of several shaving websites.</li>
            <li> A nice block of alum, a must have for wet shaving</li>
            <li> This one is much cheaper than the rest, so it is worth a shot.      </li>
            <li> You can tell when it finds something, because you&#x27;ll feel the smallest sting in the middle of the coolness, most of the time I can&#x27;t even see what caused it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Looks and feels exactly like my first $25 alum block.</li>
            <li> Way better than a styptic pencil, more economical and extremely long lasting.  </li>
            <li> I first received this, it looked moldy?</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> Used it yesterday after shaving - same thing, more convenient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this over 2 years, yes, but I started using it more regularly about a month ago - both after shaving and also as a deodorant</li>
            <li> You can get a better deal by getting &amp;#34;deodorant stones&amp;#34; which is the same thing.</li>
            <li> the first alum i bought was a nice solid opaque white smooth block.  </li>
            <li> waster your money on this scrap alum, buy a nice solid smooth as silk block, it will last you over a year.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Most alum blocks are the same.</li>
            <li> I used it a ton at first</li>
            <li> This is the first time using alum as part of the after shave process.  </li>
            <li> Went straight from receiving package to the garbage!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m confident a more expensive block would not have done me better.</li>
            <li> A few strokes post shave seals nicks, closes pores, and feels pretty darn good, too.  </li>
            <li> Came exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> I used it the first time I cut myself shaving</li>
            <li> That said, most of this block will simply crumble in your hand after you use it for a while.</li>
            <li> At first, you might try to &amp;#34;save&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used alum on my face after shaving.  </li>
            <li> I would anticipate one bar should last many months with every day usage.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my man after buying him his first safety razor.</li>
            <li> Block of alum, does exactly what it should.</li>
            <li> and I can guarantee you&#x27;ll love it and never go back.</li>
            <li> ok, but cheap alum, big hole in the middle, wears quickly.</li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t get a nice smooth surface on it which is harsh on a newly shaved face.</li>
            <li> in all, I strongly suggest popping the extra $2 for a better quality of properly handled product.</li>
            <li> Would have been nice if the shipper had left the package labelling clear of its inventory control tags though,</li>
            <li> While it was cheap to purchase, the sides started pitting unevenly, and instead of a rectangle, it is more of a trapezium (I just googled this).</li>
            <li> A great price compared to other products being offered that do the exact same thing.  </li>
            <li> think all these alum blocks are pretty much identical</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the safety razor or the alum [or a combination of the two] as well as good pre/post shaving techniques</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For small nicks its really good though.</li>
            <li> My only gripe: this is more of a &amp;#34;refill&amp;#34; than a complete &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; - it would be nice to have some sort of a paper &amp;#34;case&amp;#34; - a way to hold it without getting it all wet.</li>
            <li> Apply this after shaving, before the after shave, and seal up all the little spots you didn&#x27;t know hurt yet from shaving a bit too close...finish with your favorite after shave and you&#x27;re set!</li>
            <li> Be sure to dry it off after you use it to lengthen the life of the bar.</li>
            <li> Good price for a long lasting product.</li>
            <li> (Also, I have a strong suspicion that this may have contributed to the second issue, read on for the details.)</li>
            <li> pure alum</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fourth thing you need to know: Some of the sides aren&#x27;t pretty, meaning smooth and flat.</li>
            <li> This generic bar works just fine, at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> This really makes your face feel smooth, relieves the skin from razor burn and it will stop the occasional nick from bleeding.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price and fast shipping though.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use after shaving with my straight razor.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product and would recommend it&#x27;s use to others.  </li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> really, it immediately stops any bleeding--and helps with reducing razor burn.  </li>
            <li> This is the cheapest brand at Amazon.com, it is OK, there are not much differences between them.</li>
            <li> It did have some &amp;#34;green growth&amp;#34; on it, but I just rinsed it off really well.</li>
            <li> I shave with a straight razor, and I&#x27;d heard that this helps soothe the skin.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t notice much of anything the one time I tried it.</li>
            <li> A real necessity for shaving if razor burn is a problem.</li>
            <li> Seriosuly, he loves the way it helps his skin heal after a straight razor shave.</li>
            <li> The block does what is intended to do at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I do have to say that when I received it a corner was broken off but its worked great.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice much sting when using this either.</li>
            <li> It is tiny and cheap, but does the job.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone wetshaving on a budget, it really makes a difference in your post-shave skin care.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price</li>
            <li> But do you really want to pay $ 20.00 to stop a bleeder?</li>
            <li> Really, Alum blocks are all chemically the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> If you carefully cut the top part of the package to make a flap you do not need a container.</li>
            <li> and it really worked well.  </li>
            <li> I must say I really like how my face feels after using it.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift, and if you&#x27;re really pinching then go for it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sometimes at night if I just want to do a quick clean of my face or if I have a breakout I&#x27;ll wet the alum bar and rub it all over.</li>
            <li> The general consensus seems to be that alum is pretty much all the same but varies greatly in price due to brand name.</li>
            <li> It lasts a really long time and is really easy to use.  </li>
            <li> This stuff works so well and very quickly to stop minor shaving nicks.</li>
            <li> Not much to say, other than this product is a great example of an alum bar.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this if it&#x27;s your only option, but be aware there are much better ones out there and probably for the same price!</li>
            <li> I did finally find clean area</li>
            <li> it stings slightly more its not remotely painful in the least.</li>
            <li> I liked this because it was my only alum solution for shaving for a long time.  </li>
            <li> First, when I opened it, it was half covered in patchy groups in some kind of crust of hard nearly concrete-like blobs, presumably some kind of mineralization from improper storage allowing in moisture containing mineral that reacted with the alum</li>
            <li> The more expensive alum that I have remains very smooth after drying.</li>
            <li> Had to wear it down to be able to use it on my face.</li>
            <li> Stings a bit, but less than most over-the-counter aftershave products.</li>
            <li> Ali Biyikli is enjoyable to use and and performs as well as alum block that I&#x27;ve used for much less money</li>
            <li> and I received my last from AKM quickly.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s the cheapest block I found to try and will likely last many years.</li>
            <li> This particular brand is the potassium one, not the ammonium one</li>
            <li> it will last me for several more months..</li>
            <li> I think I will purchase a different brand next time with better quality control.</li>
            <li> If your brush didn&#x27;t cost $200 it can&#x27;t possibly be any good, and you can&#x27;t possibly get good lather from any soap or cream that costs less than $25 for a small cake or tube.    </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is a cute little alum block.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to rinse your face a little after using, because if you sweat with it on your face, it leaves a film on everything (cellphone screens, etc), but any alum will do that.</li>
            <li> Could use a little sanding/polishing to make it smoother but at this price that is OK.</li>
            <li> this little brick is more than sufficient.</li>
            <li> I have no doubt this block will last me many years if it doesn&#x27;t get dropped in the toilet or lost.</li>
            <li> This rinses clean and doesn&#x27;t have much a scent, and certainly not one that lingers.</li>
            <li> I started getting into wet shaving about a year ago and wanted something cheap that would help close my pores/help irritation/stop bleeding.</li>
            <li> I plan on buying a few more of these just to stock up at this</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty much all the same ..</li>
            <li> It will last a long time for sure.</li>
            <li> And it has neat packaging that you normally will not find in the states.</li>
            <li> I bought this recently and everyone was right.</li>
            <li> but then I started to actually learn how to shave with my safety razor and haven&#x27;t really used this guy much</li>
            <li> Old school shaving classic.</li>
            <li> It looks like it was very old and not quality and new.</li>
            <li> Also, the dimensions of the block in question measure 1-3/8 x 2-3/16 x 7/8 inches, given allowance for certain off-square faces--the block apparently having been crystallized in two sections which were then sandwiched together like congealed paraffin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very cheap and seems to last quite a while, as I am still on the same bar that I bough summer of last year.  </li>
            <li> Using alum is a great way to get feedback on the shave since nicks and raw spots may sting a little for a minute or two.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same stuff that others are charging anywhere from $10 to $80 for, just not packaged as well, and frankly, thie Alum isn&#x27;t as pretty as the others either.</li>
            <li> Feels like it will last a couple of years just like my first block.</li>
            <li> Next time I think I&#x27;ll go with a higher quality alum though.</li>
            <li> They are the same exact thing - an alum block shaped like a deodorant stick, with convenient dispenser.</li>
            <li> Charging or paying up to 5 times for exactly the same thing is shear madness.</li>
            <li> Pretty simple...</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a fancy package, especially when the product does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> For just $4 it&#x27;s definitely worth it and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Rinse with cool water, and rub the alum bar on my wet face.</li>
            <li> I rub this alum block over my cool wet face after shaving.</li>
            <li> I received an item called \\&quot;icy cool alum\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> If the seller would drop the shipping price a little, it would easily be five stars.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It tightens up the pores, stops the razor burn and generally makes shaving just a little bit better.</li>
            <li> bought a block in a old drug store for $10, it was probably 3 oz, the same as my first one.  </li>
            <li> I just use the other full side on my face.  </li>
            <li> its not a bad product, but as the other reviewer noted shipping will kill you</li>
            <li> Sure, you get less &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; with other packaged alum products, but I&#x27;ve found that they last pretty much forever and don&#x27;t crumble the way this did.</li>
            <li> This is alum folks, pure and simple.</li>
            <li> This thing is an absolute godsend after a nice hot shave- leave your face wet, run this under cold water for a few seconds, then rub it all over your face and neck to tighten things up so nicely you can bounce a quarter off of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These little alum bars stop the blood from oozing out my hacked-up face, and they&#x27;re cheap as can be.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little square bar that will fit in the palm of your hand.</li>
            <li> I was a little suspicious of the packaging and quality of this stuff -- especially when there are better looking products for two and three times the price.</li>
            <li> It kind of gives a light stinging sensation as well, nothing really painful.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Men Sensitive Skin Post Shave Balm, 3.4 Ounce (Pack of 3)]] and</li>
            <li> the process is complete leaving my face feeling like I&#x27;ve had a spa day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Supposedly this has also been used as a natural deodorant for hundreds of years</li>
            <li> You can really now see that it&#x27;s made up of smaller crystals pressed together.</li>
            <li> Rub this stuff on your still-wet face after you&#x27;ve shaved, and you will see far fewer bumps and ingrown hairs pop up on your face.</li>
            <li> use a smooth block, without green coloration, you deserve</li>
            <li> Yes, it tends to be cheaper, but it is for a far inferior product in my experience.</li>
            <li> This is a basic tool that does not need much review.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to go old school.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same stuff, but twice as much for 1/2 the price.</li>
            <li> You can really feel it closing your pores as it dries, you skin feels like it&#x27;s tightening like when you use a facial mask.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin, and the alum seems to soothe rather than irritate.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m still getting my money&#x27;s worth out of it, but next time I&#x27;ll look for a solid block.</li>
            <li> this is a really good value, nothing wrong with this product at all.</li>
            <li> Minor nicks and cuts stop bleeding, but I really like how my face feels tight and smooth after rubbing it over my face.  </li>
            <li> I had to clean off all of the green mold before using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since then, it has been working well and seems to be lasting a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> Small size if much more maneuverable than the bigger Alum blocks.</li>
            <li> I accidentally dropped it from about a foot above my sink into the sink (so not all the way to the floor, mind you) and it shattered into many small pieces.</li>
            <li> The center dissolved early, maybe because I used it under hot water.</li>
            <li> Many wet shavers that use single or double edged razors use alum.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller than I expected, but I still expect it to last me many months to a year with daily use.</li>
            <li> I tried this block this morning for the very first time, rubbing it over my face and neck like a small bar of soap after wet shaving, and it seems to do a fine job--revealing potential razor burn, tightening the skin, and drawing pores to a close.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m torn on the the value of alum in general, but I do use it when I&#x27;ve gone too far and caused myself some razor burn.</li>
            <li> He says that it&#x27;s cooling, sometimes can sting a little after a super close shave, but he won&#x27;t use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little rough, but OK.</li>
            <li> A must if you are new to double edge/single edge shaving.</li>
            <li> I have had mine for over a year and it is still the same size as I got it when new.</li>
            <li> Seemed very cheap and was broken in the package when I opened it.</li>
            <li> Some it seals right off while other need an extra touch with my [[ASIN:B002HTI2TI Proraso Styptic Gel, 10 ml]].</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s not just this brand, just product in general.</li>
            <li> I think by the third use mine was drying on my face clear as glass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seeing as the bar functions like a tiny bar of soap, and not knowing where to let it drain afterwards, I have by chance discovered that Ace hardware-brand \\&quot;clear</li>
            <li> Run it under cold water and lightly rub  it over your face to cool your face and ease the burn after a shave.</li>
            <li> I rinsed it off and set it on a counter, and apparently the exposure to water and air got rid of the spots before I ever used it.  </li>
            <li> Made from potash alum, an alum block is an old staple in traditional barbershops.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve barely made a dent in it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to identify exactly how big of an impact this product made as I changed many aspects of my shaving regimen at one time, but I have noticed a big improvement in regards to shaving irritation since I started using this product.  </li>
            <li> This small bar will last pretty much forever from what I can tell</li>
            <li> If you have the option, goto a local health food store and buy some natural deoderant.</li>
            <li> When I got mine the corners were broken but most of the block was still usable.</li>
            <li> I had to use it carefully a couple times smooth down the edges.</li>
            <li> this is due to a reaction from contact with certain minerals.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an active member of one of the major on-line straight razor forums.</li>
            <li> I bought this when i started using a safety razor and it have helped me a lot, in the beginning i got a lot of small cuts and just drag this over my face and most of the cuts will stop bleeding at the same time.</li>
            <li> IMHO, I would get like a wet piece of cotton cloth (like a T-shirt) or something similar, and rub whatever sides you want to flatten on the cloth until they&#x27;re ready for prime time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was always rough against my face even after a few shaves and even after trying to rub it smooth under running water for a while.</li>
            <li> First thing you should know: This block is little.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Third thing you should know: Until you break it in, the first couple uses may leave a slight white residue on your face, like a styptic does.</li>
            <li> No residues after the first few uses with and you can feel the sting and skin tighten during use.</li>
            <li> This block disolves much faster than others I&#x27;ve ordered, and does not maintain a slick surface after drying - feels like sandpaper after a fresh shave - not very comfortable.</li>
            <li> This really cuts down on any bleeding or irritation.  </li>
            <li> At first I was not sure if this product would be much of a difference than other after-shave products I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> Every time I use a new blade, even being careful, it seems there is some bleeding.</li>
            <li> Looks a little funky straight out of the package, as the salt crystalizes in a gray pattern in some places.</li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive about this product and didn&#x27;t expect much.  </li>
            <li> After a shave this stuff works great in healing nicks and cuts on your face, a little cold water a rub with it and waala</li>
            <li> I am only giving this four stores because I thought that the shipping was a little much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to write an exciting review about astringent.</li>
            <li> this causes too much irritation then switch to a plain astringent like witch hazel.</li>
            <li> Great After Shave it soothes your skin, closes pores and stops minor nicks, if it dries your skin you need to wash it off with cold water after few minutes and use regular after shave.  </li>
            <li> Mine arrived with a part of it chipped off, ended up making a razor sharp edge that I cut my neck with when applying it, although it has helped reduce my irritation after shaving, recommended for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> At $4.49 for an 80 gram block versus $20+ for a 75 gram block of Taylor of Old Bond Street or any of the other so called name brands, it&#x27;s a no brainer.</li>
            <li> The plastic wrapper is difficult to open and one could easily break the alum, which is very fragile to start with.</li>
            <li> Recently started back on wet shaving and a block of Alum is essential.</li>
            <li> but how long it lasts.. i&#x27;ve had this thing for 2 months now and it is still the same size..</li>
            <li> But after you&#x27;ve got a few dozen pieces of varying sizes, it just gets old and you end up throwing the whole messy lot of it away.</li>
            <li> My last alum &#x27;bar&#x27; was a Razorock, and it didn&#x27;t last long simply because it wore itself away being wet.</li>
            <li> This is much rougher than the other alum that I had previously used.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t drop it like any alum block and it will last a long time!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is  not a solid block , it is pressed together pieces, who knows what the green is?&lt;br /&gt;It is very sharp and the flat sides are not smooth, it is pressed together cheap pieces, probably off the floor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m new to the safety razor, I still get a few nicks here and there, so this is important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I know each block will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> The reason for 4 stars rather than 5 is that when I leave it to dry, salt like grains develop on its surface when I pick it up the next morning.  </li>
            <li> The price cannot be beat and it will last a long, long time.</li>
            <li> What alum really does well is to remove soap scum.</li>
            <li> or put more cold water on.</li>
            <li> To say the least, the product does exactly what I expected it to do.  </li>
            <li> Long Handled Safety Razor]])</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s minor</li>
            <li> The product was smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> Wherever this block had been stored it must have been humid and for a long time.</li>
            <li> If you want to be technical, this is an immense value over buying other antiseptic aftershave products which basically use the same compounds as their active ingredient anyway.</li>
            <li> You may need to spend a few minutes smoothing a side down on a piece of cloth or something before it&#x27;s ready for your face.</li>
            <li> You want to dry the product after use (I just use a square of toilet paper) and then let it air dry.  </li>
            <li> but, any cuts I&#x27;ve had (small so far thank goodness) are instantly sealed and after rinsing with cold water my face is left feeling very smooth and tight.  </li>
            <li> (I shave only every other day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> It comes in a shrink-wrap, which I basically peel back to expose a little bit of the bar as necessary.</li>
            <li> Sometimes when I&#x27;m finished, I&#x27;ll have some tiny little nicks, nothing big.</li>
            <li> This block lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> your self a favor and get a soap saver like the Spectrum 52150 Dino Soap Saver to let it dry and keep it from dissolving.</li>
            <li> FYI, canned foams and gels can irritate and dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget to rinse the stuff off after a minute, don&#x27;t want to dry out your face.</li>
            <li> I use it just after I rinse my face before I dry it.  </li>
            <li> Mold does grow on it if you do not keep dry</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s pretty important to me because I have dropped them before and had they shatter into small pieces making them nearly impossible to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is no functional difference between this and more expensive brands so don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> In other words, this stuff lasts a long, LONG time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dry off when done, and you tend not to get the rough bits.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use that often unless I cut myself, but even so for less than five dollars it does what it is suppose to and last forever.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about the size of a pencil eraser, perhaps a little bigger.</li>
            <li> I was a little miffed, but am currently using up the pieces before the intact block.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little smaller than I expected, but it works the way alum is supposed to work.</li>
            <li> Run it under cold water and lightly rub it over your face to soothe and</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s small, but unless you bleed-out every time you shave, it should last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Works on dogs too.</li>
            <li> Just wet it and slide it on.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for use with wet shaving.</li>
            <li> My block arrived with a bunch of green and yellow stuff on it.  </li>
            <li> The block is incredibly rough as well, like sandpaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Never knew I could or what it was for until I started wet shaving with a dbl-edge razor this month.</li>
            <li> I just got into wet shaving and it was suggested to use this stuff after.</li>
            <li> These are sold by weight, so the size isn&#x27;t considered, but for some reason I expected it to be the size of a bar of soap.</li>
            <li> I was worried that being a packed crystal it would dissolve/crumble from wet use, but it stays intact and acts like a touch-up pencil.</li>
            <li> This product performs as expected.</li>
            <li> Apply it wet, and keep it wet for a minute before taking it off with a damp towel.</li>
            <li> I have never heard of an alum before a few months back..</li>
            <li> All the rough edges on the product kept me from even using it.</li>
            <li> Only had it a few weeks</li>
            <li> Not much to be said about this.  </li>
            <li> Works as expected.  </li>
            <li> Really brittle &amp; easily broken.</li>
            <li> Just apply to wet skin, post shave, and before any &amp;#34;aftershave&amp;#34; you use.  </li>
            <li> I rinse with cold water and apply witch hazel after waiting a few minutes for the alum to do its magic..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done this with other brands and since they were solid pieces they would maybe chip a little or not be affected at all.</li>
            <li> but, don&#x27;t take my word on this as I am not certain of the scientific truth of it.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to do - stanch the bleeding - but without leaving that awkward looking white chalky residue that a styptic pencil does.</li>
            <li> So, it fails a drop test (pretty common in a wet bathroom) and it wouldn&#x27;t hold a smooth surface and was constantly rough against my face leaving little &#x27;grains&#x27; of alum behind.</li>
            <li> I am an extreme case and like every other product I have tried, this did not soothe the ingrown hairs on my neck.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter that it&#x27;s so small, because if you are truly using it every day for an after shave facial wipe-down, it will probably still be in your medicine cabinet when the sun goes super-nova!</li>
            <li> I bought 3, kept one and packaged the other 2 with shaving kits for xmas.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an Alum block, it works, and it&#x27;s cheaper than other branded alum blocks.</li>
            <li> and it now had sharp edges.  </li>
            <li> The block I received was a bit misshapen, but other than that it performs as advertised.</li>
            <li> i based my decision to buy the 5 pack on other people&#x27;s reviews..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another thing you will read several times is just how small it is..</li>
            <li> All alums consist of the same basic ingredient, and as such there is no reason to purchase expensive alum blocks.</li>
            <li> Other than homemade Tend Skin</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe some of the prices on other brands of alum blocks that I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> No need to buy the other \\&quot;brand name\\&quot; products in fancy packaging.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is no difference between this and any other I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually nick myself badly enough for a pencil, so</li>
            <li> Less expensive than other choices, The size and shape just right for gliding over my face.</li>
            <li> I wet the block a little under the facet then rub it all over my wet face.  </li>
            <li> Secondly, the crystalline structure of this brand of block causes it to degrade in a very uneven fashion which I have not experienced with slightly more expensive blocks.</li>
            <li> The alum block is dirty and very rough - it can easily cut or scratch the skin, and is definitely not suitable to apply to the face.</li>
            <li> just dab a little water on the block, and put the wet corner of the block on the nick or weeper on my face.</li>
            <li> After a few minutes I wet my face and apply either a quality shave cream (by hand) or shaving soap lather (with a brush</li>
            <li> Too rough on the skin after a few uses.</li>
            <li> This one costs less than $9 shipped.</li>
            <li> and I still have half the block.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Frankly, I could care less about that.</li>
            <li> but I had scraped off half the block</li>
            <li> My skin could care less about the brand that I put on it.</li>
            <li> I now use it after every shave to help less the razor burn.</li>
            <li> One edge was cut at an odd angle leaving the edge jagged.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made the learning curve with my safety razor less painful...literally.</li>
            <li> Block I received was very uneven and rough surfaced.</li>
            <li> It stings a little but it stops the bleeding immediately like</li>
            <li> It does sting a little after shaving.</li>
            <li> because mine disintegrated into a crumbly mess in a few of weeks.</li>
            <li> and it does the job, though not very elegantly.</li>
            <li> If it ever wears down, will buy another one ASAP!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I could see fractures through the clear wrapping even before I opened it up.</li>
            <li> (it doesn&#x27;t come with one) and it came a bit &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; and not smooth to slide across skin.  </li>
            <li> The block is wrapped in a Saran-wrap type of plastic, with a green sticker on it.</li>
            <li> Had green looking mold spots on it..</li>
            <li> The block arrived covered in a green moldy substance.</li>
            <li> version that&#x27;s made to look like deodorant for men and &amp;#34;Crystal&amp;#34; version (round) made for women.</li>
            <li> and it still smelled heavily of mold.</li>
            <li> looked for the ingredients, since i saw a lot of green coloration in the block.  </li>
            <li> I can feel my skin tighten and the alum i believe kills bacteria that may be left behind while shaving.  </li>
            <li> Not as harsh as styptic.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;ll occasionally will end up in your mouth and taste horrible, but this actually taste decent...</li>
            <li> It does sting very slightly</li>
            <li> , not sure, just know it&#x27;s little).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for the past few months</li>
            <li> I shave usually twice to three times weekly, and I use this after every shave, and all over my face / neck, so I use it heavily.  </li>
            <li> I was told about this item and after a few uses after shaving the need for the nic stick was no more.</li>
            <li> The block catches all of the little nicks that are too small to bleed, even too small to see.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than this issue, the product works as I expected; it&#x27;s just disappointing how fragile it is.</li>
            <li> Then I shave (usually 2 passes, re-lathering in between).</li>
            <li> Small size but lasts months.</li>
            <li> It heals up small nicks and cuts--</li>
            <li> It tightens the pores and tends to close small nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li> Although it is small, it gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> It is soothing and serves to close the pours and address any small nicks - even those you can&#x27;t see.  </li>
            <li> Alum is used by shavers to sooth the skin and to help close any &amp;#34;weapers&amp;#34; (small cuts).  </li>
            <li> it gets those small nicks and cuts..</li>
            <li> This product is half or even less than half of the expensive shave companies&#x27; Alum Blocks.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on fancy ones!</li>
            <li> I bought two blocks, and one arrived shattered into small pieces.  </li>
            <li> in mind that this is fairly small.</li>
            <li> I can tell you that this little alum bar packs a serious punch,</li>
            <li> shave, wet your face with cold water, wet the block and rub it all over.</li>
            <li> This does provide the chemical equivalent of cold water, with a weak styptic effect... but cold water and styptic are better options.</li>
            <li> hard as rock, not sure how to soften for use</li>
            <li> so it was hard to manage</li>
            <li> As I found out the hard way, all  alum blocks are the same.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li> It stings a bit when applied directly after shaving, but it&#x27;s not as bad as after-shave and it stops bleeding on contact.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do a final rinse with cold water</li>
            <li> I use it at least 2x / week.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, mine was hollow and crumbled apart after about 2 to 3 month use.  </li>
            <li> I have to agree with some of the other reviewers, I don&#x27;t see why you would need to buy the expensive alum from Art Of Shaving or others, this one works</li>
            <li> then just put this inder some cold water and rub (flat side) all over your face.  </li>
            <li> Very small.</li>
            <li> Came with a small sliver broken off on one corner.  </li>
            <li> The bar is very small, and I used another reviewer&#x27;s advice to use a plastic table leg cup as a dish for it.  </li>
            <li> This is a very small bar--not like a bar of soap--but plenty for what it&#x27;s used for--stopping nicks from bleeding.</li>
            <li> But seriously this is recommended by Leisureguy, the man who literally wrote the book on shaving.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a ridiculous ripoff given that you&#x27;re buying an identical product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All I have to do is wet the bar with cold water and rub the bar over my face.</li>
            <li> ;  If you have hard times on your neck after shaving this will cure the redness and ingrown hairs!  </li>
            <li> It immediately fixes broken skin but does leave a powdery layer after applying it.</li>
            <li> Worse yet, I had these ingrown hair/pimple type sores that I&#x27;ve never had after using this.</li>
            <li> and I bought this when I started to step up my shaving game with a safety razor, brush, and cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It very rapidly pits terribly and scrapes one&#x27;s face while being applied.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The broken block was no fault of the seller.  </li>
            <li> Poor QC</li>
            <li> Poor quality product.</li>
            <li> If its a small little cut... put some cold water on your face, and cold water on the alum and then hold it against the cut.</li>
            <li> but it was covered in some weird substance, looks like a mold or something.</li>
            <li> random side note: Sometimes when you wash off alum</li>
            <li> I know sounds weird</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d used those styptic pencils for years and they always get fairly nasty when dealing with actual cuts.</li>
            <li> If you bleed after shaving, you shaved wrong.</li>
            <li> Am I doing it wrong?  </li>
            <li> No more bloody wash towels while shaving.</li>
            <li> After my shave I rinse the bar in cold water and rub it across my face.  </li>
            <li> Run some cold water on it before and after applying it on the skin.</li>
            <li> Disappointing to see the mold that the product was covered in.</li>
            <li> Nothing worse than a bloody shave.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy expensive bars of alum!</li>
            <li> It was very uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> It is just as bad.    </li>
            <li> I used a bad blade which hacked up my face, man did this burn it.  </li>
            <li> Too bad b/c</li>
            <li> worst is if it comes damaged broken to pieces which mine did.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall just very disappointing.</li>
            <li> If you want to pay stupid show off prices go ahead while I save my money.</li>
            <li> you wont be disappointed!</li>
            <li> bother spending your money on the outrageously priced name-brands.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I liked this because it was my only alum solution for shaving for a long time.  I didn&#x27;t know any better.  Now that I have tried others which are more well-formed (like razorock&#x27;s alum stick) I can&#x27;t ever go back to this product.  It is 100% alum yes, but you have to have a container for it (it doesn&#x27;t come with one) and it came a bit &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; and not smooth to slide across skin.  Razorock&#x27;s alum stick glides across your skin - it&#x27;s much smoother and better formed - and it stays like that as you use it, and it&#x27;s in a format where you don&#x27;t need a container.  I&#x27;d recommend this if it&#x27;s your only option, but be aware there are much better ones out there and probably for the same price!</li>
            <li> Alum is alum, it&#x27;s all the same. What makes this one stand out is the price, far more reasonable than most others. I plan on buying a few more of these just to stock up at this price.&lt;br /&gt;Do your self a favor and get a soap saver like the Spectrum 52150 Dino Soap Saver to let it dry and keep it from dissolving.</li>
            <li> It has helped me with nicks and razor burn. A must if you are new to double edge/single edge shaving. If it&#x27;s burning, you know it&#x27;s working!</li>
            <li> I recently started shaving with a double-edged blade and a safety razor. In the interest of getting an even better shave, I decided to pick up some barber alum at the recommendation of several shaving websites. And I&#x27;m glad I did! It stings a bit when applied directly after shaving, but it&#x27;s not as bad as after-shave and it stops bleeding on contact. Since I&#x27;m new to the safety razor, I still get a few nicks here and there, so this is important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on both my face and head after shaving, and it&#x27;s really nice!</li>
            <li> This is my second order on one of these, with shipping you are looking at $10 and change vice $18+ for the same thing. A nice block of alum, a must have for wet shaving and I received my last from AKM quickly. The packaging isn&#x27;t fancy but who cares?</li>
            <li> I have read lots of postings from men who claim that alum blocks will relieve them of razorburn, nicks and razor bumps.    I am an extreme case and like every other product I have tried, this did not soothe the ingrown hairs on my neck.  It is just as bad.    Like I said, NOTHING has worked to soothe me and I have tried it all.  Seems to work for everyone else though.  This one is much cheaper than the rest, so it is worth a shot.      Reasonable price and fast shipping though.</li>
            <li> First thing you should know: This block is little. It&#x27;s like 2\\&quot; x 1\\&quot; x .75\\&quot; (that&#x27;s just a guess, not sure, just know it&#x27;s little). It doesn&#x27;t matter that it&#x27;s so small, because if you are truly using it every day for an after shave facial wipe-down, it will probably still be in your medicine cabinet when the sun goes super-nova! In other words, this stuff lasts a long, LONG time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second thing you should know: The packaging isn&#x27;t very pretty. See the picture? That&#x27;s the stuff. The block is wrapped in a Saran-wrap type of plastic, with a green sticker on it. That&#x27;s it. Kind of refreshing actually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third thing you should know: Until you break it in, the first couple uses may leave a slight white residue on your face, like a styptic does. Just rinse your face off and use it again. I think by the third use mine was drying on my face clear as glass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth thing you need to know: Some of the sides aren&#x27;t pretty, meaning smooth and flat. I could easily see someone getting a bar where NONE of the sides are pretty. You may need to spend a few minutes smoothing a side down on a piece of cloth or something before it&#x27;s ready for your face. Easily done though. IMHO, I would get like a wet piece of cotton cloth (like a T-shirt) or something similar, and rub whatever sides you want to flatten on the cloth until they&#x27;re ready for prime time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fifth thing you need to know (and the end of this already too long review!): This stuff works GREAT! It&#x27;s the same stuff that others are charging anywhere from $10 to $80 for, just not packaged as well, and frankly, thie Alum isn&#x27;t as pretty as the others either. So what. After you shave and rinse your face, rub the block anywhere you shaved. It generally feels nice and cool, it gently tightens up your pores, and (I think) cleans your wounds. The block catches all of the little nicks that are too small to bleed, even too small to see. You can tell when it finds something, because you&#x27;ll feel the smallest sting in the middle of the coolness, most of the time I can&#x27;t even see what caused it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!coolness, most of the time I can&#x27;t even see what caused it.    Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Looks and feels exactly like my first $25 alum block. This one costs less than $9 shipped. Feels like it will last a couple of years just like my first block.</li>
            <li> prooves that Turks make excellent shaving stuff at very reasonable price range. why pay more.</li>
            <li> Gives a sting when put on your face after shaving.  Not painful, just means its working on any razor burn you might have.  I used a bad blade which hacked up my face, man did this burn it.  But it is neccessary for cuts and covers more area than a stick.  All in all good product.    I bought 3, kept one and packaged the other 2 with shaving kits for xmas.</li>
            <li> Well it&#x27;s alum. The general consensus seems to be that alum is pretty much all the same but varies greatly in price due to brand name. And this is the cheapest I could find. The seller (Tulumba) shipped it super fast - ordered on a Saturday afternoon, received a USPS notification on Sunday and it shipped on Monday. Can&#x27;t ask for much more than that.     Alum seems to work as described. After 17 years of multi-blade/disposable head, I just (4 shaves ago) switched to a Merkur ([[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor]]) double edge razor with Derby blades and couldn&#x27;t be happier. I got fed up with Gillette and Schick bending me over every time I needed to buy a pack of cartridges. At what point did it become acceptable to charge $4-$5 per DISPOSABLE cartridge head? That&#x27;s insanity - and I think their strategy it going to backfire. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the safety razor or the alum [or a combination of the two] as well as good pre/post shaving techniques but I haven&#x27;t had any razor burn since I made the switch.    What I do:    In the shower I wash my face with Neutragena (unscented) bar soap then apply hair conditioner to soften the stubble. I leave the conditioner on until my final rinse. After the shower I rub about 1 tsp of baby oil on my face to lubricate my skin and to further soften the stubble. After a few minutes I wet my face and apply either a quality shave cream (by hand) or shaving soap lather (with a brush [[ASIN:B000G647Y8 Tweezerman Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush]]). FYI, canned foams and gels can irritate and dry out your skin. Then I shave (usually 2 passes, re-lathering in between). Rinse with cool water, and rub the alum bar on my wet face. After my face air dries, I apply a good balm (not an alcohol based aftershave).    Sure it takes twice as long as just dragging a multi-blade razor across my face, but I actually enjoy it. So it takes ten minutes instead of five, big deal. The best part, NO RAZOR BURN!!!</li>
            <li> Recently started back on wet shaving and a block of Alum is essential. This is fairly good, it&#x27;s not as effective as I thought it would be, sometime a styptic pencil works better for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For small nicks its really good though.</li>
            <li> Awesome buy. The price cannot be beat and it will last a long, long time.</li>
            <li> Great Value, I use after shaving and as deodorant, Tightens the face and doesn&#x27;t stain your shirts  WHY PAY MORE~!!!</li>
            <li> I rub this alum block over my cool wet face after shaving. It creates a sting but it&#x27;s an invigorating one and the pain is short lived. Immediately after using this product I put on [[ASIN:B003156NJS Neutrogena Men Sensitive Skin Post Shave Balm, 3.4 Ounce (Pack of 3)]] and the process is complete leaving my face feeling like I&#x27;ve had a spa day. Shaving with the addition of products such as these will turn an every day chore into an \\&quot;experience\\&quot; to which you&#x27;ll look forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product to close the pores and tighten your face after treating yourself to a nice wet shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think all these alum blocks are pretty much identical so I recommend you shop price per ounce. There&#x27;s no need to pay extra for a designer label on one of these.</li>
            <li> I use this to stop bleeding - shaving and otherwise - and for deoderant/antimocrobial wipe-on. Just wet it and slide it on.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t heard any issues about using alum.  This stuff works great for minor cuts.  Sometimes leave your face with powder white sheen though.</li>
            <li> I read prior reviews about fragility of this product so I was extra careful unpacking and hoping for the best. Unfortunately I could see fractures through the clear wrapping even before I opened it up. Still, when I fully opened it I ended up with three pieces of alum block and some powdered pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than this issue, the product works as I expected; it&#x27;s just disappointing how fragile it is.</li>
            <li> I tried this block this morning for the very first time, rubbing it over my face and neck like a small bar of soap after wet shaving, and it seems to do a fine job--revealing potential razor burn, tightening the skin, and drawing pores to a close.    Seeing as the bar functions like a tiny bar of soap, and not knowing where to let it drain afterwards, I have by chance discovered that Ace hardware-brand \\&quot;clear plastic cups\\&quot; (intended to be placed under table legs, so as to protect the floor) work well as a kind of isolated mini-soap dish, with the cup&#x27;s teeth being turned upwards, towards the bar of alum.  (See my uploaded image for further clarification.)    Also, the dimensions of the block in question measure 1-3/8 x 2-3/16 x 7/8 inches, given allowance for certain off-square faces--the block apparently having been crystallized in two sections which were then sandwiched together like congealed paraffin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use after shaving with my straight razor.  Way better than a styptic pencil, more economical and extremely long lasting.  All I have to do is wet the bar with cold water and rub the bar over my face. It does sting very slightly but, any cuts I&#x27;ve had (small so far thank goodness) are instantly sealed and after rinsing with cold water my face is left feeling very smooth and tight.  I really like this product and would recommend it&#x27;s use to others.  As an aside, I understand that alum has some anti-bacterial properties as well which would be a definite plus but, don&#x27;t take my word on this as I am not certain of the scientific truth of it.</li>
            <li> Alum bar works great.  It stops bleeding nicks quickly.  It also gives me feedback, the sting, on my shaving technique.  Excellent product, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> What a deal. Please, do yourself a favor and do not by \\&quot;branded\\&quot; pieces of alum for $20. It is still the same rock!</li>
            <li> Shipment on time, it is a real alum piece, and it&#x27;s really cheap. I love this for the price and it works.</li>
            <li> its not a bad product, but as the other reviewer noted shipping will kill you</li>
            <li> I ordered the block and it arrived fairly promptly but it was covered in some weird substance, looks like a mold or something.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for use with wet shaving. It does great on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first received this, it looked moldy? Had green looking mold spots on it.. It took a bit of washing and light scrubbing to remove the spots before I felt comfortable applying it to my face though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then, it has been working well and seems to be lasting a decent amount of time. Next time I think I&#x27;ll go with a higher quality alum though.</li>
            <li> My block arrived with a bunch of green and yellow stuff on it.  I was told by a barber that the spots were a sign of impurities in the alum.  I rinsed it off and set it on a counter, and apparently the exposure to water and air got rid of the spots before I ever used it.  The block is incredibly rough as well, like sandpaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up buying alum for six bucks from another seller and tossed this block into the garbage.  I kept thinking about how I was rubbing it on cuts without really knowing what the deal was with the green and yellow spots.</li>
            <li> I bought this recently and everyone was right. Barber Alum is all the same except for the quantity for the price. This was marked as being ~4oz and at that price this was the perfect buy. It just so happens that it isn&#x27;t 4 oz and that there is a typo. It is actually 2.6oz just like the rest of the offerings.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff, it feels a bit rough to be honest...but it gets the job done better than most alum. It&#x27;s just the right amount of sting and cooling you need after a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also random side note: Sometimes when you wash off alum it&#x27;ll occasionally will end up in your mouth and taste horrible, but this actually taste decent...I know sounds weird but anybody who&#x27;s been using alum regularly knows this issue. It&#x27;s minor but this is one of the stupidest and big selling points on this alum for me haha. But seriously this is recommended by Leisureguy, the man who literally wrote the book on shaving. So his recommendation is gold, definitely get one of these in your shaving tool kit!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used alum before. Never knew I could or what it was for until I started wet shaving with a dbl-edge razor this month. Works great - no irritation anymore!</li>
            <li> Contrary to what some reviewers have said,alum does not heal nicks.For nicks I use Nick Relief Powder, available on Amazon.Powder works well but could stain undershirt etc. I shave w/out wearing any t shirt.Alum is very refreshing after you shave. Small size but lasts months.Thank Amazon for carrying these products.</li>
            <li> The alum is the no frills antiseptic. No scent or oily elements. It immediately fixes broken skin but does leave a powdery layer after applying it. I have been using it for a year and I still have half the block.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst is if it comes damaged broken to pieces which mine did.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy expensive bars of alum! This is all you&#x27;ll ever need. In fact, buy two or three so that when you drop one, you&#x27;ll have a backup. Can burn like heck, but stops any nicks you might have from bleeding and helps tighten up your skin before you use your favorite soothing after shave.</li>
            <li> The plastic wrapper is difficult to open and one could easily break the alum, which is very fragile to start with. Again this is about the product not the seller.</li>
            <li> Great for tightening up pores, nicks and cuts after shaving... Small size if much more maneuverable than the bigger Alum blocks.</li>
            <li> Very small. looks bigger in picture. it works but id rather have a larger one that lasts forever then pay shipping when this one runs out. its just not for shavers either would be great in a first aid kit</li>
            <li> Mine arrived with a part of it chipped off, ended up making a razor sharp edge that I cut my neck with when applying it, although it has helped reduce my irritation after shaving, recommended for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this alum block for use after shaving.  To say the least, the product does exactly what I expected it to do.  It heals up small nicks and cuts--really, it immediately stops any bleeding--and helps with reducing razor burn.  It meets the dimensions given in the description, and was indeed the product I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that&#x27;s worthy of note: you&#x27;ll need to figure out some sort of storage system.  You want to dry the product after use (I just use a square of toilet paper) and then let it air dry.  For this, any sort of dish will suffice.  I use a cashed glade scent thing--small glass square.  At the time I bought this product, it was price around $8.  I would have recommended anyone to purchase [[ASIN:B003LEXEDW RazoRock Alum Block]] since for $1 more you get a nice storage container.  However, seeing that the price has dropped to $3.75, I&#x27;d recommend just buying this.  As another reviewer said, alum is alum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m torn on the the value of alum in general, but I do use it when I&#x27;ve gone too far and caused myself some razor burn. It tightens the pores and tends to close small nicks and cuts. If you&#x27;re going to buy alum this is a really good value, nothing wrong with this product at all.</li>
            <li> Made from potash alum, an alum block is an old staple in traditional barbershops. Its all-natural antiseptic properties work as an astringent that instantly closes razor nicks from shaving. soothes and cools razor burn when rubbed over the entire face after a shave.  Run it under cold water and lightly rub it over your face to soothe and cool razor burn after shaving. Alum was used by the Egyptians more than 4,000 years ago. This is the cheapest brand at Amazon.com, it is OK, there are not much differences between them.</li>
            <li> Works as it should.  Don&#x27;t spend big money on something so simple.  Save it for a better soap or razor.</li>
            <li> I am only giving this four stores because I thought that the shipping was a little much. With that being said, you cannot complain about the quality of the product. No it does not have a plastic container to keep it in. Frankly, I could care less about that. I can tell you that this little alum bar packs a serious punch, not in the sense that the sting is unbearable, rather it does what it is intended to do. prevent razor burn and irritation. If the seller would drop the shipping price a little, it would easily be five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product was shipped very quickly. Great service!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a Great deal for the price. It&#x27;s an Alum block, it works, and it&#x27;s cheaper than other branded alum blocks. Nothing more needs to be said.</li>
            <li> Works great for stopping nicks, cuts, and razor burn. Stings a bit, but less than most over-the-counter aftershave products. Great if you&#x27;re looking to get into wet shaving. Can&#x27;t beat the Amazon add-on price.</li>
            <li> Is what it says it is, great for post shave</li>
            <li> I just got into wet shaving and it was suggested to use this stuff after. I will say that it kind of stings but I assume that means that it is doing something good for my face. The packaging seemed like it might land me on a terrorist watch list... then again those guys look like they don&#x27;t appreciate a good shave so I am probably safe.</li>
            <li> It arrived looking just like the picture. It did have some &amp;#34;green growth&amp;#34; on it, but I just rinsed it off really well. I shave with a straight razor, and I&#x27;d heard that this helps soothe the skin. I found that it did not soothe anything. It was very uncomfortable to use. Worse yet, I had these ingrown hair/pimple type sores that I&#x27;ve never had after using this. It took about a week for them to go away. I looked like a meth head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d used those styptic pencils for years and they always get fairly nasty when dealing with actual cuts. This rinses clean and doesn&#x27;t have much a scent, and certainly not one that lingers. I find this easiest to work with by dunking this in sink that is still full of shaving water. This is gently abrasive so its great for rubbing your face with after you shave to rub away any dry skin and it will seal up any cuts you might have. I have very sensitive skin and I bought this when I started to step up my shaving game with a safety razor, brush, and cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no functional difference between this and more expensive brands so don&#x27;t waste your money. I&#x27;ve used this for the past few months and I&#x27;ve barely made a dent in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supposedly this has also been used as a natural deodorant for hundreds of years but I didn&#x27;t notice much of anything the one time I tried it. Your mileage may vary.</li>
            <li> I have used other alum blocks and have had good results. I purchased this product based on good reviews and price. I should have stuck with one of competitor products. The block arrived covered in a green moldy substance. I decided to rinse it off and the block crumbled to pieces.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Having never used an alum block before, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. The product was smaller than I expected. It&#x27;s about the size of a pencil eraser, perhaps a little bigger. These are sold by weight, so the size isn&#x27;t considered, but for some reason I expected it to be the size of a bar of soap. After having used the alum block I&#x27;m convinced it will be part of my shaving routine for years.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  Nice large piece of alum.  I had to use it carefully a couple times smooth down the edges.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to identify exactly how big of an impact this product made as I changed many aspects of my shaving regimen at one time, but I have noticed a big improvement in regards to shaving irritation since I started using this product.  It lasts a really long time and is really easy to use.  It&#x27;s smaller than I expected, but I still expect it to last me many months to a year with daily use.</li>
            <li> UPDATE 06/10/2015: alum blocks went up in price everywhere. Do yourself a favor: look up Crystal Deodorant. Get a $1 off coupon on their website, then go to your local Discount Drug Mart or another pharmacy where they carry out. Make you sure you pick &amp;#34;potassium alum&amp;#34; and not &amp;#34;ammonium alum&amp;#34; (which works, but stings more). I picked up a &amp;#34;Rock&amp;#34; version that&#x27;s made to look like deodorant for men and &amp;#34;Crystal&amp;#34; version (round) made for women. They are the same exact thing - an alum block shaped like a deodorant stick, with convenient dispenser. Used it yesterday after shaving - same thing, more convenient. Better to travel with.  UPDATE: I&#x27;ve had this over 2 years, yes, but I started using it more regularly about a month ago - both after shaving and also as a deodorant (it works great for that - wont&#x27; stop you from sweating, but you won&#x27;t stink).  Anyway, it still has its overall shape, but the corners are starting to crumble away and on each end there are &amp;#34;caverns&amp;#34; growing. You can really now see that it&#x27;s made up of smaller crystals pressed together. I guess I&#x27;m still getting my money&#x27;s worth out of it, but next time I&#x27;ll look for a solid block. In fact, I happen to have a jar of food-grade alum, perhaps I should grow my own crystal, like we did in school :)  This product is what it is, which is what I needed - barber alum. I was worried that being a packed crystal it would dissolve/crumble from wet use, but it stays intact and acts like a touch-up pencil. My only gripe: this is more of a &amp;#34;refill&amp;#34; than a complete &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; - it would be nice to have some sort of a paper &amp;#34;case&amp;#34; - a way to hold it without getting it all wet. I have it wrapped in saran wrap and it does the job, though not very elegantly. But it&#x27;s the cheapest block I found to try and will likely last many years.</li>
            <li> A real necessity for shaving if razor burn is a problem. It will also help with nicks and cuts. Run it under warm water and hold it over a nick to stop the bleeding and prevent infection. Run it under cold water and lightly rub  it over your face to cool your face and ease the burn after a shave. I&#x27;ve heard it works as a deodorant and even an acne treatment as well, but haven&#x27;t tried it. The current price is spectacular for this item compared to others alum bars I&#x27;ve seen. Order more than one at a time though, as shipping on just one is pretty steep.</li>
            <li> This is much rougher than the other alum that I had previously used.  It will use it up, but will buy a different alum in the future.</li>
            <li> This is a very small block of barber alum, but it is perfect for doing the job.  Based on recommendations through a variety of research in getting the best shave, I sought out barber alum for my shave routine.  I found this at an incredible price through Amazon and added it to my order.  Although it is small, it gets the job done.  After my shave I rinse the bar in cold water and rub it across my face.  It is soothing and serves to close the pours and address any small nicks - even those you can&#x27;t see.  Followed up with a quality alcohol-free after shave and I am good to go.</li>
            <li> This would be a five star item in terms of value but when I opened the flimsy cellophane wrapper I found mold growing all over the block! Wherever this block had been stored it must have been humid and for a long time. I did not think it was possible for mold to grow on alum blocks but this was full if it. I did try to scrape it off but the mold went deep into the block.  I did finally find clean area but I had scraped off half the block and it still smelled heavily of mold. No way Im rubbing it in open cuts! Too bad b/c it was a good price and great travel size.  Guess now I know why it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> There are better options out there. This block disolves much faster than others I&#x27;ve ordered, and does not maintain a slick surface after drying - feels like sandpaper after a fresh shave - not very comfortable. Would not buy again nor recommend.</li>
            <li> Rub this stuff on your still-wet face after you&#x27;ve shaved, and you will see far fewer bumps and ingrown hairs pop up on your face. Don&#x27;t forget to rinse the stuff off after a minute, don&#x27;t want to dry out your face. What more could you want to know?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do very well.  The reason for 4 stars rather than 5 is that when I leave it to dry, salt like grains develop on its surface when I pick it up the next morning.  The more expensive alum that I have remains very smooth after drying.</li>
            <li> My husband used more profane words, but that is what he meant. Seriosuly, he loves the way it helps his skin heal after a straight razor shave. Looks a little funky straight out of the package, as the salt crystalizes in a gray pattern in some places. However, this  is ESSENTIAL for men&#x27;s grooming. I might be eyeing to use it after shaving my legs soon!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. You may as well get a rock from the yard and rub it on your face. You&#x27;d be better off to get a styptic pen, which works quite well.</li>
            <li> Very cheap, sealed off my nick with ease. Why pay more for a brand name? I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a good, substantially sized block. Always the first and best post razor step for me. This stuff is economical, so don&#x27;t forget it when buying shaving supplies.</li>
            <li> This product performs as expected. It&#x27;s hard to write an exciting review about astringent. It is a good value and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t suppose there is any way to improve on a basic Alum Block.  I have to say that I am very satisfied with the purchase.  The block does what is intended to do at a reasonable price.  Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price. There are better out there but of course if your about price you cant beat this.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother with the simple block. You can get a better deal by getting &amp;#34;deodorant stones&amp;#34; which is the same thing. They actually come in an applicator.</li>
            <li> I was going through a stypic pen every ten days.  Now I doubt I can use the block up.  Great savings.</li>
            <li> Good price for a long lasting product.</li>
            <li> the first alum i bought was a nice solid opaque white smooth block.  It felt wonderful and i still use it.  I dropped it and it broke so it was hard to manage and it now had sharp edges.  I bought a couple blocks of these since they were cheap, but they were cheap quality too.&lt;br /&gt;I looked for the ingredients, since i saw a lot of green coloration in the block.  There were zero ingredients listed in english. The only writing was maybe Turkish ,what you see in the picture is your ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I am sure this is an illegal import, since ingredients must be listed in english.&lt;br /&gt;It is  not a solid block , it is pressed together pieces, who knows what the green is?&lt;br /&gt;It is very sharp and the flat sides are not smooth, it is pressed together cheap pieces, probably off the floor.&lt;br /&gt;I bought a block in a old drug store for $10, it was probably 3 oz, the same as my first one.  It is silky smooth on my face after i shave.&lt;br /&gt;Dont waster your money on this scrap alum, buy a nice solid smooth as silk block, it will last you over a year.&lt;br /&gt;I see they use this also for hemorrhoids, that is what i am going to use these blocks for, they will be perfect for that.&lt;br /&gt;After a nice shave  use a smooth block, without green coloration, you deserve it.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon , if there are no ingredients, you are not suppose to sell it, same with country of origin, nothing in english&#x3D; no country of origin per US import laws</li>
            <li> If you bleed after shaving, you shaved wrong. (Believe me, I&#x27;ve done it plenty of times.) This does provide the chemical equivalent of cold water, with a weak styptic effect... but cold water and styptic are better options. Best to only shave as close as your skill level allows.  What alum really does well is to remove soap scum. Apply it wet, and keep it wet for a minute before taking it off with a damp towel. Then rinse again. It takes enough hydration out of the stratum corneum that you can get some oil in there after the shave.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with some of the other reviewers, I don&#x27;t see why you would need to buy the expensive alum from Art Of Shaving or others, this one works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just dab a little water on the block, and put the wet corner of the block on the nick or weeper on my face. It stings a little but it stops the bleeding immediately like magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re learning how to shave with a DE razor or straight razor, you&#x27;re bound to get a few nicks along the way. Do you self a favor and get an alum block. It works wonders.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying this again once it wears away. Ive used mine for about 4 months now and i still probably have another 3 months out of it. Couldn&#x27;t be happier</li>
            <li> At $4.49 for an 80 gram block versus $20+ for a 75 gram block of Taylor of Old Bond Street or any of the other so called name brands, it&#x27;s a no brainer. I don&#x27;t care what brand you buy, it&#x27;s all hydrated aluminium potassium sulfate... period. Charging or paying up to 5 times for exactly the same thing is shear madness. I&#x27;m an active member of one of the major on-line straight razor forums. It never ceases to amaze me how snobbish people get about names and prices. If your brush didn&#x27;t cost $200 it can&#x27;t possibly be any good, and you can&#x27;t possibly get good lather from any soap or cream that costs less than $25 for a small cake or tube.    This is alum folks, pure and simple. Taylor, Dovo, Osma, Art of Shaving, Trumper, et al... it&#x27;s all just alum. If you want to pay stupid show off prices go ahead while I save my money.</li>
            <li> The block I received was a bit misshapen, but other than that it performs as advertised. shave, wet your face with cold water, wet the block and rub it all over. I have no doubt this block will last me many years if it doesn&#x27;t get dropped in the toilet or lost.</li>
            <li> Not too much to add to the fact that this is a good size bar of alum for a great price. Arrived well wrapped in perfect condition. Alum is alum and this is alum. No fancy packaging whatsoever, so have a soap dish handy to store it in.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty much all the same .. So I don&#x27;t think a name brand matters .. These alum stones work fine for me.</li>
            <li> This alum was not of the same quality as others I&#x27;ve used (Bloc Osma, etc). The alum was &#x27;cloudy&#x27; and didn&#x27;t seem to be a solid piece, but rather an aggregate or amalgamation of smaller pieces . It was always rough against my face even after a few shaves and even after trying to rub it smooth under running water for a while. I just couldn&#x27;t get a nice smooth surface on it which is harsh on a newly shaved face. Yes, it tends to be cheaper, but it is for a far inferior product in my experience. I accidentally dropped it from about a foot above my sink into the sink (so not all the way to the floor, mind you) and it shattered into many small pieces. I&#x27;ve done this with other brands and since they were solid pieces they would maybe chip a little or not be affected at all. So, it fails a drop test (pretty common in a wet bathroom) and it wouldn&#x27;t hold a smooth surface and was constantly rough against my face leaving little &#x27;grains&#x27; of alum behind. All in all, skip this brand. Buy a better version/brand and you&#x27;ll get much longer life out of your alum block and have better shaving experience.</li>
            <li> Pretty simple...it&#x27;s a block of Alum. Sure it&#x27;s not in a over priced package or name brand but if you want Alum that works just the same, buy this product.  Alum is Alum no matter the package it comes in that you through away.</li>
            <li> After a shave this stuff works great in healing nicks and cuts on your face, a little cold water a rub with it and waala.....&lt;br /&gt;If you shave this is a must have period. ..</li>
            <li> I bought this when i started using a safety razor and it have helped me a lot, in the beginning i got a lot of small cuts and just drag this over my face and most of the cuts will stop bleeding at the same time. some places where your skin moves a lot it  you maybe need to go over twice. or put more cold water on. after i have washed off i am ass good as new and hours after you don&#x27;t can&#x27;t even know that you cut yourself.</li>
            <li> Great Value. Works just as good as alum bars that are sold for 4x more.</li>
            <li> Most alum blocks are the same. They&#x27;re chunks of potassium alum and that&#x27;s it. This no-name block can easily be found (depending on seller) for about $4 for an 80g, is the same size and slightly more dense (by 5g) than the Bloc Osma that sells for $8+ or the 104g Art of Shaving block that goes for $20 in the stores. Don&#x27;t let a fancy box rip you off.</li>
            <li> For a beginner,I didn&#x27;t want to spend alot of money on something I never tried. It does sting a little after shaving. Seems to make my face feel a bit tighter. If it ever wears down, will buy another one ASAP!</li>
            <li> It works and is great. I know its kind of spendy but you will never need to buy one again in your life. I have had this thing for months and it hasn&#x27;t went anywhere. I used it a ton at first but then I started to actually learn how to shave with my safety razor and haven&#x27;t really used this guy much but it is a great product. I do have to say that when I received it a corner was broken off but its worked great.</li>
            <li> The center dissolved early, maybe because I used it under hot water. Make sure you have a dish for it to sit in, because you will end up with alum crystals all in your wife&#x27;s medicine cabinet. Besides that, it&#x27;s alum and it worked great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a block of Alum. Alum is used by shavers to sooth the skin and to help close any &amp;#34;weapers&amp;#34; (small cuts).  Many wet shavers that use single or double edged razors use alum.  I use it just after I rinse my face before I dry it.  I wet the block a little under the facet then rub it all over my wet face.  I then apply witch hazel aftershave.  It works great.</li>
            <li> These little alum bars stop the blood from oozing out my hacked-up face, and they&#x27;re cheap as can be. Bonus!</li>
            <li> This thing is an absolute godsend after a nice hot shave- leave your face wet, run this under cold water for a few seconds, then rub it all over your face and neck to tighten things up so nicely you can bounce a quarter off of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this causes too much irritation then switch to a plain astringent like witch hazel. Sissy.</li>
            <li> Since I have been DE shaving I figured I needed this alum.  This particular brand is the potassium one, not the ammonium one so it is considered &amp;#34;better.&amp;#34;  If you have hard times on your neck after shaving this will cure the redness and ingrown hairs!  It also seems to make the shave last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do a final rinse with cold water then just put this inder some cold water and rub (flat side) all over your face.  I follow it with non-alcohol witch hazel, alcohol based aftershave then aftershave balm.  Lots of variables, but since using this alum my neck ingrown have vanished (7 days).</li>
            <li> This is a basic tool that does not need much review. It will last a long time for sure. I don&#x27;t notice much sting when using this either.</li>
            <li> At first I was not sure if this product would be much of a difference than other after-shave products I&#x27;ve seen. Later I found that this product was far better than some of the top brand after-shave products out there. It&#x27;s an all natural Alum Block with a smooth contour allowing for easy glide on the face. This block lasts a very long time. Surprisingly 50 times longer than those bottled After shaves out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no problems with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone giving the old-school shaving style a try (Shaving Brush, Safety Razor/Straight Razor, Shaving Brush, etc,.)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve shave for 40+ years without an Alum bar. Now, I can&#x27;t imagine not having one.</li>
            <li> Works great to soothe your face after a close shave. Apply this after shaving, before the after shave, and seal up all the little spots you didn&#x27;t know hurt yet from shaving a bit too close...finish with your favorite after shave and you&#x27;re set!</li>
            <li> The alum block is dirty and very rough - it can easily cut or scratch the skin, and is definitely not suitable to apply to the face.</li>
            <li> This is the first time using alum as part of the after shave process.  I liked the results and would recommend / purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is a cute little alum block. It cost me very little and feels great after a shave. It is tiny and cheap, but does the job.</li>
            <li> burns like heck at times.</li>
            <li> I like to rub this on my face right after shaving.  I can feel my skin tighten and the alum i believe kills bacteria that may be left behind while shaving.  I rinse the apply an after shave lotin and my face has never looked or felt better.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s not just this brand, just product in general. hard as rock, not sure how to soften for use</li>
            <li> Item exactly as described and received in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> I have never heard of an alum before a few months back.. i based my decision to buy the 5 pack on other people&#x27;s reviews.. it does what others say.. it cools the face.. it gets those small nicks and cuts.. it stops the bleeding.. but for me it has gone a step further.. it also has eliminated the use of after shave..... it does such a good jobas a tool for after shave that i have stopped using after shave...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing you will read several times is just how small it is.. but how long it lasts.. i&#x27;ve had this thing for 2 months now and it is still the same size.. it will last me for several more months.. it&#x27;s just amazing that all these products are so unknown.. buy it.. try it.. love it</li>
            <li> Works great, no reason to spend more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much smaller than I though it was going to be, I actually haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it ( good thing ) over all though seems to be ok</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the fancy packaging that Block Osma has, but an alum block works just the same no matter who&#x27;s name is on the label. I would recommend it to anyone wetshaving on a budget, it really makes a difference in your post-shave skin care. Just make sure to rinse your face a little after using, because if you sweat with it on your face, it leaves a film on everything (cellphone screens, etc), but any alum will do that.</li>
            <li> What can I say it was cheap but it&#x27;s what you pay for. This small bar will last pretty much forever from what I can tell so you&#x27;re set, one time purchase.</li>
            <li> All the rough edges on the product kept me from even using it. Went straight from receiving package to the garbage! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this to anyone! Went out and bought an alum block from the art of shaving. You definitely pay for what you get. Though any alum does the job, I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to bring this product to my face!</li>
            <li> Use with every shave!</li>
            <li> This product is half or even less than half of the expensive shave companies&#x27; Alum Blocks. Works perfect!! Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Works as intended. After shaving this helps to prevent acne, etc. Only had it a few weeks but it should last a while or until I drop it.</li>
            <li> Less expensive than other choices, The size and shape just right for gliding over my face. Using alum is a great way to get feedback on the shave since nicks and raw spots may sting a little for a minute or two. I rinse with cold water and apply witch hazel after waiting a few minutes for the alum to do its magic..you wont be disappointed!</li>
            <li> There are better deals out there.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011DKJQ0/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o02_s00_i01?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;The Lafe&#x27;s is sold as a deodorant crystal, but it&#x27;s just a 2 inch cube of alum.  Better quality than this one and even comes with a plastic tray to sit in.</li>
            <li> Simple, does what it&#x27;s supposed to.  Reasonable price; I&#x27;ll probably never need to order more again!  Would have been nice if the shipper had left the package labelling clear of its inventory control tags though, so we could read what the original manufacturer printed.</li>
            <li> Great product - but if you are strategist razor / DE shaver you know an alum block is fantastic. This one is big - Will last you forever. I have had mine for over a year and it is still the same size as I got it when new. I use it at least 2x / week. It works great.</li>
            <li> Not much to be said about this.  It&#x27;s alum, and it does what you expect alum to do.  This is an exceptionally well priced block, which is why I bought it.  And it has neat packaging that you normally will not find in the states.</li>
            <li> Got this to use as aftershave, block works great and was at a great price! Don&#x27;t drop it like any alum block and it will last a long time! Don&#x27;t waste your money on fancy ones! They are all the same thing on the inside, ALUM!</li>
            <li> What can you say... its Alum, it works, this is enough to last a lifetime if you just use it once in a while to close a weeper. I recommend taking it out of the plastic though. Mine started corroding and building up a cluster of oxidation or something. I just cut it into smaller bricks.</li>
            <li> All alums consist of the same basic ingredient, and as such there is no reason to purchase expensive alum blocks. This has worked wonders for my skin and I&#x27;m confident a more expensive block would not have done me better.</li>
            <li> Yep, just like the more expensive blocks, it is Pot. Alum. However, a couple issues with this product. First, when I opened it, it was half covered in patchy groups in some kind of crust of hard nearly concrete-like blobs, presumably some kind of mineralization from improper storage allowing in moisture containing mineral that reacted with the alum (Also, I have a strong suspicion that this may have contributed to the second issue, read on for the details.) Secondly, the crystalline structure of this brand of block causes it to degrade in a very uneven fashion which I have not experienced with slightly more expensive blocks. It very rapidly pits terribly and scrapes one&#x27;s face while being applied. This causes its own irritation and as the whole idea of using an alum block is to avoid later irritation, it isn&#x27;t so great to be scraping the heck out of your face. For the first week I had it (after removing the crust,) it was awesome and I was very pleased, then my elation fell into dismay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I strongly suggest popping the extra $2 for a better quality of properly handled product.</li>
            <li> A little smaller than I expected, but it works the way alum is supposed to work. It tightens up the pores, stops the razor burn and generally makes shaving just a little bit better.</li>
            <li> Stops bleeding from a knick here or there. Very nice.</li>
            <li> Old school shaving classic. Been using for a year</li>
            <li> Block I received was very uneven and rough surfaced. Had to wear it down to be able to use it on my face. Deteriorates quickly. Wife did not like the smell of it.</li>
            <li> This sort of revolutionized my morning shave.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The product arrived just as promised, and was adequately packaged. Everything opening and looking at the product reminded me that I paid a very low price. But that&#x27;s just fine by me. You don&#x27;t need a fancy package, especially when the product does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to. I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
            <li> All men out there. This is a must for your grooming kit. Natural and effective. Run some cold water on it before and after applying it on the skin. I don&#x27;t use aftershave any more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had issues with razor burn and nicks and cuts, so when I decided to switch to a safety razor I saw that many folks recommended an alum block. Seeing as how this one had many great reviews and it was pretty cheap, I ordered a block.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Putting it on can&#x27;t be simpler and it is actually great at what it does. One time during shaving I accidentally cut myself, enough to bleed a fair amount (for a shaving cut), and just circling the alum block around it for a couple seconds stopped it right away. Brilliant, can&#x27;t recommend enough.</li>
            <li> Did not stop the bleeding.  Am I doing it wrong?  Mold does grow on it if you do not keep dry</li>
            <li> Excellent product that will last years. Has some tingling when applied but not a burn at all.</li>
            <li> This alum seems to be great for my acne;  if I forget to use it for a few days, my acne seems to return.  Other than homemade Tend Skin, this is the best thing I&#x27;ve found to help me with my acne.</li>
            <li> It works. Who hasn&#x27;t nicked themselves? Sure, it isn&#x27;t in a nice plastic holder. But do you really want to pay $ 20.00 to stop a bleeder? In the privacy of my own home this sits proudly on the sink, ready if needed.</li>
            <li> Seemed very cheap and was broken in the package when I opened it. Amazon was awesome and refunded my money and I was able to reorder another brand (Razorock) on eBay. I don&#x27;t hold it against Amazon, but I will never recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Really, Alum blocks are all chemically the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t bother spending your money on the outrageously priced name-brands.  They&#x27;re a ridiculous ripoff given that you&#x27;re buying an identical product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a product, this stuff lasts utterly forever.  1 block of this will last you probably a year!  For 6$, can&#x27;t be beat.  I shave usually twice to three times weekly, and I use this after every shave, and all over my face / neck, so I use it heavily.  This really cuts down on any bleeding or irritation.  If you want a deal on an alum block, buy this one.</li>
            <li> Not as effective as styptic. Not as harsh as styptic. If you need something mild this might work for you.</li>
            <li> Works great! Yes it&#x27;s small, but unless you bleed-out every time you shave, it should last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Works on dogs too. I nicked my dog while trimming her and it stopped the bleed immediately.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to go old school. I got the 3 pack and one was broke and another was crumbly. this works like it says. also this is a value for alum. you are not paying name brand prices for this which is fine. pure alum</li>
            <li> Alum is alum, there&#x27;s no point in shelling out more money than you have to. This stuff is great and one block will likely last a couple years.</li>
            <li> I am a newbie DE razor user.  This is hefty and feels good in the hand.  A few strokes post shave seals nicks, closes pores, and feels pretty darn good, too.  A great price compared to other products being offered that do the exact same thing.  Maybe I should stock up...?</li>
            <li> Came exactly as pictured. Could use a little sanding/polishing to make it smoother but at this price that is OK. I used it on my face as a post shave and it did make my face seem smoother. If you carefully cut the top part of the package to make a flap you do not need a container. One star of for the roughness.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe some of the prices on other brands of alum blocks that I&#x27;ve seen. I&#x27;ve always found this to be the best finish-up after a shave, and they last me for about a year (I shave only every other day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money. No need to buy the other \\&quot;brand name\\&quot; products in fancy packaging. After all, it&#x27;s just alum! My skin could care less about the brand that I put on it.</li>
            <li> Great item at a cheap price, might sting a fraction more then my old one that I paid $18 for but I have no complaints. Even tho it stings slightly more its not remotely painful in the least. I would recommend this over the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t pay more for Alum, there&#x27;s absolutely no reason as it doesn&#x27;t get any better than this. This is a good sized bar of Alum that should last quite a while. I&#x27;d never used alum before purchasing this, and will never go without it again. If you happen to nick yourself, get the alum damp, and slap it to your wound. It will stop bleeding almost immediately.</li>
            <li> Where has this been all my life. Since I started shaving I have used the nic stick. I was told about this item and after a few uses after shaving the need for the nic stick was no more. I now use it after every shave to help less the razor burn. I bought two, one for home and 1 for travel.</li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive about this product and didn&#x27;t expect much.  I used it the first time I cut myself shaving and it really worked well.  No more bloody wash towels while shaving.</li>
            <li> Chose this item for the lowest price. And I think it will last forever.&lt;br /&gt;What more can be said about this alum bar. Oh yes, it works!</li>
            <li> Very good price, and helps keep my fingers from sliding on my razor in the shower.  Also, seems to be helping a bit with ingrown hairs.  I have not cut myself yet, but I think it is also fairly good at stopping bleeding.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.  Nice simple way to seal the pores after shaving.  Shipped promptly and a great price.  This should be in everyone&#x27;s bathroom for nicks and razor burn.</li>
            <li> I had never seen a block of alum priced this low before, so when my $20 block disappeared, I decided to buy two of these to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no difference between this and any other I&#x27;ve ever used.  None.  Alum is, well, alum!  I bought two blocks, and one arrived shattered into small pieces.  I was a little miffed, but am currently using up the pieces before the intact block.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The broken block was no fault of the seller.  It&#x27;s just the nature of the substance.  Really brittle &amp; easily broken.</li>
            <li> If you want to be technical, this is an immense value over buying other antiseptic aftershave products which basically use the same compounds as their active ingredient anyway. That said, most of this block will simply crumble in your hand after you use it for a while. At first, you might try to &amp;#34;save&amp;#34; it by collecting the smaller bits and using those after you shave. But after you&#x27;ve got a few dozen pieces of varying sizes, it just gets old and you end up throwing the whole messy lot of it away. Sure, you get less &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; with other packaged alum products, but I&#x27;ve found that they last pretty much forever and don&#x27;t crumble the way this did.</li>
            <li> This is a great little alum bar. It&#x27;s about the cheapest option you can find, and yes, that means you don&#x27;t get the luxury of a wasteful plastic canister like with Razorock. It comes in a shrink-wrap, which I basically peel back to expose a little bit of the bar as necessary. Dry off when done, and you tend not to get the rough bits. If there are rough bits, run a fingernail over the top after wetting the bar, and you&#x27;re good to go. I don&#x27;t honestly believe that the Razorock is any better formed, as one reviewer does. But the rounded and exposed nature of the Razorock makes it wetter, makes it stay wetter, and makes it erode more. My last alum &#x27;bar&#x27; was a Razorock, and it didn&#x27;t last long simply because it wore itself away being wet. This generic bar works just fine, at a fraction of the price. I use alum as a regular aftershave treatment, and I shave a very good percentage of my body, as well as my entire face/neck. This product has proven itself to me.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised. A little rough, but OK. I wish it came in a larger size. I will have to get another one for my travel kit.</li>
            <li> This is a small clean Alumblock it works great. I use it for my travel kit and use witchhazel at home because its a liquid. My grandfather would grind these into powder.</li>
            <li> If you know what this is for and how to use it, you will love it.</li>
            <li> This bar is smaller than I&#x27;m used to but is thicker and easier to hold onto while using it. That&#x27;s pretty important to me because I have dropped them before and had they shatter into small pieces making them nearly impossible to use. Good product and a good value.</li>
            <li> Its Alum.  Uh,  you know what it does, right?  Came with a small sliver broken off on one corner.  I just use the other full side on my face.  Works perfectly.</li>
            <li> This is a must need if you shave and nick yourself. This is a good replacement for the chemically cocktail of an aftershave solutions out there. It will burn where nicks and cuts are present and this thing will last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> This is cheap and does the job.  Unfortunately, mine was hollow and crumbled apart after about 2 to 3 month use.  I purchased a slightly more expensive one to replace it and it is thicker, smoother and a solid block.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used alum on my face after shaving.  I must say I really like how my face feels after using it.  Minor nicks and cuts stop bleeding, but I really like how my face feels tight and smooth after rubbing it over my face.  The bar is very small, and I used another reviewer&#x27;s advice to use a plastic table leg cup as a dish for it.  I would anticipate one bar should last many months with every day usage.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase, and I wish I had known about using an alum bar after shaving many years ago.  It feels great.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my boyfriend, who now uses this on his face after he shaves with his double edge safety razor. It does a great job closing up any nicks and prevents virtually all razorburn.</li>
            <li> Nothing worse than a bloody shave. And, this works the best at stopping seeps &amp; bleeds. Much better than the pencil type. A good product &amp; no sting or pain! Every time I use a new blade, even being careful, it seems there is some bleeding. This bar does what you&#x27;d expect!</li>
            <li> I bought it last year, and still have yet to see it reduce in size. Granted I don&#x27;t use that often unless I cut myself, but even so for less than five dollars it does what it is suppose to and last forever. I would happily choose this product again over any big name brand.</li>
            <li> Works great and makes for a pleasant shave. Overall very pleased with the product and I will be a repeat customer</li>
            <li> This is a very small bar--not like a bar of soap--but plenty for what it&#x27;s used for--stopping nicks from bleeding.</li>
            <li> I use a similar product from a different manufacturer for under arm deodorant. I didn&#x27;t know it could be used on the face after shaving. This product is excellent. It seals my face after shaving and stops the bleeding immediately when I accidentally cut myself shaving. I love this product!</li>
            <li> Disappointing to see the mold that the product was covered in. It looks like it was very old and not quality and new. I had to clean off all of the green mold before using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After i cleaned off the mold, i noticed the color of the block was yellow. Which tells me it&#x27;s been sitting around for 10-15 year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall just very disappointing.</li>
            <li> ok, but cheap alum, big hole in the middle, wears quickly. If you have the option, goto a local health food store and buy some natural deoderant. It&#x27;s the same stuff, but twice as much for 1/2 the price.</li>
            <li> As I found out the hard way, all  alum blocks are the same.&lt;br /&gt;Some alum blocks are branded with fancy names and packaging. Nice if you are going to show off the box around your neck for three times the price.&lt;br /&gt;The Ali Biyikli is enjoyable to use and and performs as well as alum block that I&#x27;ve used for much less money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit it. I was a little suspicious of the packaging and quality of this stuff -- especially when there are better looking products for two and three times the price. After using it, I can attest that alum is alum. I was not disappointed. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and I would recommend it to anyone; especially someone just getting started with DE shaving.</li>
            <li> Great After Shave it soothes your skin, closes pores and stops minor nicks, if it dries your skin you need to wash it off with cold water after few minutes and use regular after shave.  However,  for bigger cuts I would still use Styptic Pencil. It is not made to help with ingrown hair, or make you fly... BTW, if you can buy it in Turkey it cost only $3.00 in barber shop or pharmacy.</li>
            <li> Poor QC because mine disintegrated into a crumbly mess in a few of weeks. The alum is fine, the block just crumbled on me.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to do - stanch the bleeding - but without leaving that awkward looking white chalky residue that a styptic pencil does.</li>
            <li> Too rough on the skin after a few uses. Not cooling enough. Poor quality product.</li>
            <li> Does what it should - alum is alum. I had to scrape away some funky greenish stuff on the outside (from what I have read - this is due to a reaction from contact with certain minerals.) One edge was cut at an odd angle leaving the edge jagged. I think I will purchase a different brand next time with better quality control.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my man after buying him his first safety razor. He&#x27;s been shaving for several months now, and he&#x27;s said that this little bar is the greatest after shave he&#x27;s ever used. He says that it&#x27;s cooling, sometimes can sting a little after a super close shave, but he won&#x27;t use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that this is fairly small. It&#x27;s a little square bar that will fit in the palm of your hand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to have a simple, natural styptic solution that&#x27;s cheap. It&#x27;s made the learning curve with my safety razor less painful...literally.</li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;d buy a dollar or two more expensive. I bought this as a gift, and if you&#x27;re really pinching then go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple chunks broke off, and it&#x27;s not even worth it to try to save them. The edges are a bit rougher than my alum block, but it does the job just fine.</li>
            <li> This stuff works so well and very quickly to stop minor shaving nicks. Get one today and you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing it prevents any cuts from bleeding!</li>
            <li> Not much to say, other than this product is a great example of an alum bar.  Just apply to wet skin, post shave, and before any &amp;#34;aftershave&amp;#34; you use.  Closes the pores nicely, with a cooling sting (no pain).  This, however, is not a styptic pencil, so don&#x27;t expect it to fill that role.</li>
            <li> Product works as described. Would reccomend it. I can see why it is described as lasting almost forever. Only a touch from the block need be applied to stop shaving cut bleeding.</li>
            <li> Some days a really great wet shave still leaves your skin feeling a bit beaten up. The alum block is refreshing and does an excellent job of stopping any &amp;#34;weepers&amp;#34; or small nicks.</li>
            <li> Block of alum, does exactly what it should. I don&#x27;t usually nick myself badly enough for a pencil, so this little brick is more than sufficient.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product based on reviews. When it arrived it was something totally different then what the picture was. I received an item called \\&quot;icy cool alum\\&quot;. I tried to google the name, and even searched for it on amazon. Nothing!! Do not order from simply beautiful!! You will not get the product shown!</li>
            <li> I purchased six of these... three for myself and three to give away as gifts. The price was right and the performance of the product exceeded my expectations. No residues after the first few uses with and you can feel the sting and skin tighten during use. A refreshing addition to my shaving collection and I know each block will last a very long time. A great stocking stuffer for the men in your family at Christmas!</li>
            <li> If its a small little cut... put some cold water on your face, and cold water on the alum and then hold it against the cut. It should seal up right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deeper cuts... get a towel.</li>
            <li> Just started using an alum block but I&#x27;m a fan for life! This really makes your face feel smooth, relieves the skin from razor burn and it will stop the occasional nick from bleeding. I don&#x27;t even use after shave any more! Give it a try...you&#x27;ll be a fan for life too!</li>
            <li> I started getting into wet shaving about a year ago and wanted something cheap that would help close my pores/help irritation/stop bleeding. This fit the bill in all reguards. It also seems to do help prevent acne from what I&#x27;ve noticed, as it sanitizes and gets absorbed into the pores. It&#x27;s very cheap and seems to last quite a while, as I am still on the same bar that I bough summer of last year.  For just $4 it&#x27;s definitely worth it and lasts a long time. Be sure to dry it off after you use it to lengthen the life of the bar. It does a so-so job of stopping bleeding. Some it seals right off while other need an extra touch with my [[ASIN:B002HTI2TI Proraso Styptic Gel, 10 ml]]. You can really feel it closing your pores as it dries, you skin feels like it&#x27;s tightening like when you use a facial mask. It&#x27;s good for toning in this respect too. Sometimes at night if I just want to do a quick clean of my face or if I have a breakout I&#x27;ll wet the alum bar and rub it all over. It kind of gives a light stinging sensation as well, nothing really painful. Within a day or so any acne I had is cleared up and my face feels toned and clean. So what are you waiting for? Give it a shot and I can guarantee you&#x27;ll love it and never go back.</li>
            <li> Started shaving with a DE safety razor a couple months ago. Sometimes when I&#x27;m finished, I&#x27;ll have some tiny little nicks, nothing big. I&#x27;ll rub the damp alum block over my face and neck, my skin tightens up a bit, and nicks are taken care of. I have somewhat sensitive skin, and the alum seems to soothe rather than irritate. Great price!</li>
            <li> When I got mine the corners were broken but most of the block was still usable. While it was cheap to purchase, the sides started pitting unevenly, and instead of a rectangle, it is more of a trapezium (I just googled this). Aside from this, it works as an alum block should.</li>
