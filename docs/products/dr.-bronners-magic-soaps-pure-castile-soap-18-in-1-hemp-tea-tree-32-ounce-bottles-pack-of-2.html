            <li>I have been using this product for years and have always been satisfied.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love Bronner&#x27;s Liquid Castile Soap.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use a conditioner any more.  </li>
            <li>i really love it</li>
            <li>I love this tea tree soap.  </li>
            <li>Love the tingling</li>
            <li>I use this soap in many cleaning products that call for soap as an ingredient as opposed to using Dawn Dish Soap.  </li>
            <li>and I know it is safe for skin and around the house.</li>
            <li>He loves the fresh smell and that it kills just about everything!!</li>
            <li>Please don&#x27;t bring down the ratings of this wonderful product just because it smells the way it should- like tea tree!</li>
            <li>The Tea Tree oil smell is a bit strong, but I don&#x27;t mind it, and it washes off clean, so it&#x27;s not like you smell like the soap all day.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy when I shower.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Tea Tree Soap.</li>
            <li>-- it&#x27;s the usual excellent quality Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap.</li>
            <li>and I still use this to regularly clean my piercings.</li>
            <li>It washes clean</li>
            <li>my skin was clean instead of coated with a film.</li>
            <li>I prefer Lavender and the new Rose flavor because they&#x27;re girly, but really, any of them are better than this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it two stars instead of one because they actually use good ingredients.</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t it enough to have your values represented in the ingredients and fair trade affiliation?</li>
            <li>- Almond seems to be all-around favorite</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not necessarily so bad - I think it wears off, the smell, that is, quickly, but - well, it&#x27;s not the smell</li>
            <li>, Peppermint is super invigorating and</li>
            <li>Mild Baby is virtually odorless.  </li>
            <li>It easily rinses clean unlike most of the commercial soaps out there.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to anyone who wants a nice, natural soap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it as body and hand soap, shampoo, laundry detergent and stain remover, window cleaner, general household cleaner (a la Pine Sol), and there&#x27;s plenty more uses I haven&#x27;t tried.</li>
            <li>I loved Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap and I have enjoyed tea tree varieties of other personal care products -- this, however, smells like nothing as much as turpentine!</li>
            <li>Rinses off very clean and it&#x27;s a pure natural soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is super gentle and very concentrated!</li>
            <li>I use this currently to clean my new tattoo</li>
            <li>I love the tea tree for an anti-bacterial wash, laundry and most especially for teenage acne.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s similar to the Body Shop&#x27;s tea tree oil face care system) and I love it.  </li>
            <li>and I have a whole choice of fragences!</li>
            <li>The first time I washed my hair with this soap</li>
            <li>I was hooked on this from the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I also use it as shampoo occasionally and my hair and scalp feel very clean afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I starting using this as shampoo for around 1 year now, and have noticed a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>I used my bottle as a laundry stain remover (works great, btw) because I couldn&#x27;t bear to put it on my skin or have my house or dishes smelling like it, and thankfully my regular laundry soap killed the smell.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Dr. Bronner&#x27;s my whole life.</li>
            <li>Our house is so much cleaner and greener now.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell, and it cleans very well.</li>
            <li>I make most of my own cleaning solutions now using white vinegar, castile soap, Tea Tree Oil, and other essential oils.  </li>
            <li>I used to use Dr. Bronners&#x27; original liquid soap back in the Paleolithic era.</li>
            <li>If you can bare the smell, it is well worth it.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and leaves you feeling fresh and clean (which is important in a soap).</li>
            <li>and it actually leaves you clean and oil free after washing with it (unlike other soaps).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend getting another flavor</li>
            <li>What it does do is leave your hair soft, shiny, and very manageable.  </li>
            <li>Other scents available.</li>
            <li>Other than that, this stuff is fabulous.</li>
            <li>However, the previous reviewer was right - tea tree flavor smells exactly like turpentine.  </li>
            <li>Who says an old dog can&#x27;t learn new tricks.  </li>
            <li>Been using this soap for the last 9 months and have had much better cleaning and less skin irritations.  </li>
            <li>and it did help clear it up.</li>
            <li>I needed a soap that was chemical-free and natural so that I would not have an allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li>Even though I no longer have MCS, I continue to use this natural soap.    </li>
            <li>I use natural deodorants and have to reapply a couple of times a day</li>
            <li>My hair is as soft as it was when I was in my 30s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even my 5 year old son loves it.</li>
            <li>This soap is 100% natural.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a true soap - just oils and lye, with a little vitamin E and citric acid.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never go back to normal overpriced shampoo.</li>
            <li>Apparently I&#x27;d had heavily watered-down tea tree products in the past, and this stuff surprised me with how potent it smelled</li>
            <li>I use it as a disinfectant to clean the kitchen table by putting a couple drops on the table and wiping down with a wet wash cloth.  </li>
            <li>My hair had gotten dry and had lost a lot of it&#x27;s natural wave.  </li>

            <li> My hair had gotten dry and had lost a lot of it&#x27;s natural wave.  </li>
            <li> I hate the smell, but I LOVE this product, and getting two for the price of one is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I have very thin fine hair, and have struggled with hair loss since my early teens.</li>
            <li> Last but not least, the bottle, covered with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s All-one philosophy, is a conversation piece to say the least.       </li>
            <li> bottle for a total of $6 less ,on sale locally.  </li>
            <li> This soap has several other oils.  </li>
            <li> diluted - other reviews mention users skin got too dry, I think this is from not diluting the soap enough - and it lasts a very very long time.  </li>
            <li> bottle lasts a very long time.  </li>
            <li> Not a fan of using this to wash my body because it makes my skin a bit too dry.</li>
            <li> Also, it really does have (at least!)</li>
            <li> Excuse me, my ignorance was showing!!!</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner actually spent time in mental institutions!  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s concentrated, so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way with this soap</li>
            <li> I have been using Dr. Bonners for over 35 years now and will not use any other soap for bathing or shaving.  </li>
            <li> The smell is not great but it works well on old cookie sheets</li>
            <li> literally poured these down the sink and recycled the containers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It can be a little drying, but you&#x27;ll never feel cleaner</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d hate to know how much money they are they flushing down the toilet because of their nut job rants on the label.</li>
            <li> , tea tree stinks, but what it does, it does very well.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great soap but watch for better deals.  I just bought 2 of the same size bottle for a total of $6 less ,on sale locally.  Tried to come here to cancel that part of my order but I was too late.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this from Amazon but I love this product! My piercer recommended this soap to me instead of using Dial or commonly found anti-bacterial soap. This is super gentle and very concentrated! A little goes a long way. I use this currently to clean my new tattoo and I still use this to regularly clean my piercings. I hated the smell when I first used it but I got used to it after a while. This works great as a makeup brush cleanser too!!! Not a fan of using this to wash my body because it makes my skin a bit too dry.</li>
            <li> I have very thin fine hair, and have struggled with hair loss since my early teens. I starting using this as shampoo for around 1 year now, and have noticed a huge difference.  My hair doesn&#x27;t fall out while in the shower anymore, and is more manageable. If you can bare the smell, it is well worth it.  I&#x27;ll never go back to normal overpriced shampoo.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t bring down the ratings of this wonderful product just because it smells the way it should- like tea tree! I use it for washing hands and dishes.</li>
            <li> I have been using Dr. Bonners for over 35 years now and will not use any other soap for bathing or shaving.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Dr. Bronner&#x27;s my whole life. My mom loved the stuff. Most often the peppermint, but I love the tea tree for an anti-bacterial wash, laundry and most especially for teenage acne. I don&#x27;t recall tea tree from my teens but when my son started having break outs I had him start using the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s tea tree and it did help clear it up. Rinses off very clean and it&#x27;s a pure natural soap.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, tea tree stinks, but what it does, it does very well.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Tea Tree Oil soap when I was given a small bottle for piercing aftercare.  I love this stuff!  Not only did it speed up heal time on my piercings, I started using it as face wash on a regular basis (it&#x27;s similar to the Body Shop&#x27;s tea tree oil face care system) and I love it.  I also use it as shampoo occasionally and my hair and scalp feel very clean afterwards.  I also use it as  a body wash from time to time.  I love the anti-bacterial tea tree oil.  The soap needs to be diluted - other reviews mention users skin got too dry, I think this is from not diluting the soap enough - and it lasts a very very long time.  The Tea Tree oil smell is a bit strong, but I don&#x27;t mind it, and it washes off clean, so it&#x27;s not like you smell like the soap all day.  This is a really great product.  I&#x27;m stocking up on the Tea Tree Oil one and going to try the Lavender one as well.</li>
            <li> Smells good, does suds well. However it does leave a residue on the skin. Did the same when I cleaned bathroom sink and tub. Resulting in  a dirty film which formed on both after a day or two. Will finish what I have and not buy again.</li>
            <li> I love the way it disolves the dirt and I have a whole choice of fragences! I&#x27;ve use Dr. Bronners soaps for over 40 years and will continue to use them till I die.</li>
            <li> I had a problem with Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS).  I needed a soap that was chemical-free and natural so that I would not have an allergic reaction.  This is absolutely wonderful.  This helped me get through a Master Cleanser so that I could rid myself of the MCS.  Even though I no longer have MCS, I continue to use this natural soap.    Regarding the smell, Tea Tree has a pine smell.  This soap has several other oils.  Here are the ingredients as listed on the label:  Water, Saponified Organic Coconut and Organic Olive Oils (w/ Retained Glycerin), Organic Hemp Oil, Organic Jojoba Oil, Tea Tre Extract, Citric Acid, Vitamin E.</li>
            <li> This is the finest soap I&#x27;ve ever used.  A 32-oz. bottle lasts a very long time.  It&#x27;s very mild, yet the tea tree oil is does a wonderful job because of its antiseptic properties.  And best of all, I&#x27;m not bathing myself with animal fat!</li>
            <li> I use natural deodorants and have to reapply a couple of times a day but I still stink after a lot of activity. This soap has eliminated this issue for me. I have no b.o. even if I forget  to apply deodorant  in the morning.</li>
            <li> Tea Tree is one of our favorites.  Can&#x27;t ever go wrong with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps.  My husband loves to use this.  He loves the fresh smell and that it kills just about everything!! No more smelly feet!  Awesome.  Now he&#x27;ll want foot rubs.  Great!</li>
            <li> i been using this for years for shampoo, face and body. youre supposed to be able to do more with it but i havent been that adventurous yet.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and have always been satisfied. Other scents available. All are just as good and effective. A+. Great product.</li>
            <li> Although it seems expensive, this soap lasts forever. It washes clean so I don&#x27;t worry about how it smells upfront.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  I use it for body soap, shaving, washing my hair, etc.</li>
            <li> I hate the smell, but I LOVE this product, and getting two for the price of one is well worth it. The product works wonders on my curly hair and that&#x27;s all I use it for besides a deep cleanse of my body. So two thumbs up!!</li>
            <li> Dr Bronner&#x27;s makes a great product but - this one - smells - no, reeks - of Tea Tree Oil. That&#x27;s not necessarily so bad - I think it wears off, the smell, that is, quickly, but - well, it&#x27;s not the smell I enjoy when I shower. It&#x27;s a great, effective shampoo, but I think I&#x27;d rather go with one that has a more pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I love Bronner&#x27;s Liquid Castile Soap.  I use the peppermint for showers and washing my hair. It has a nice tingle to it and smells strong and invigorating.  I do not wash &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; areas with it....ladies I think you know what I mean.  I&#x27;m a senior with untreated salt and pepper hair. My hair had gotten dry and had lost a lot of it&#x27;s natural wave.  The first time I washed my hair with this soap I felt the difference.  I wash my hair with about a tablespoon of the castile soap.  I don&#x27;t use a conditioner any more.  I now have a spray bottle of white vinegar in the shower.  After I wash my hair I rinse well with warm water. Then I spray my hair generously with the vinegar and rinse it out. And no...it does NOT leave a vinegar smell in your hair.  What it does do is leave your hair soft, shiny, and very manageable.  My hair is as soft as it was when I was in my 30s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I use Tea Tree Castile Soap for just about everything else because of Tea Tree Oil properties.  I make most of my own cleaning solutions now using white vinegar, castile soap, Tea Tree Oil, and other essential oils.  Who says an old dog can&#x27;t learn new tricks.  Our house is so much cleaner and greener now.</li>
            <li> I used to use Dr. Bronners&#x27; original liquid soap back in the Paleolithic era. Since I like stuff with tea tree oil, I thought I&#x27;d try this stuff. I really like the smell, and it cleans very well. Unfortunately, I must wear reading glasses now to read Bronner&#x27;s rants while showering. Other than that, this stuff is fabulous.</li>
            <li> The soap works real good and it is what I would recommend to friends and family i really love it</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Tea Tree Soap. I think it is a great addition for people with acne prone skin. It is a quality product like his Eucalyptus version that I have used in the past. It easily rinses clean unlike most of the commercial soaps out there.</li>
            <li> I loved Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap and I have enjoyed tea tree varieties of other personal care products -- this, however, smells like nothing as much as turpentine! Paint thinner! It&#x27;s dreadful! What a disappointment!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stick with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s almond soap instead, it&#x27;s infinitely easier on the nose!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I literally poured these down the sink and recycled the containers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MEA CULPA!!! Apparently I&#x27;d had heavily watered-down tea tree products in the past, and this stuff surprised me with how potent it smelled -- it&#x27;s the usual excellent quality Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap. Excuse me, my ignorance was showing!!!</li>
            <li> I could not ask for a better quality product or price for something of its kind.  I wash everything with it.  From dishes to body and hair, it is wonderful.  Even my 5 year old son loves it.</li>
            <li> I love this tea tree soap.  A little goes a long way and leaves you feeling fresh and clean (which is important in a soap).</li>
            <li> No, our bodies do not need all the chemicals added to the usual bath soap I had&lt;br /&gt;been buying. I was hooked on this from the first time I used it. For once I felt as&lt;br /&gt;though my skin was clean instead of coated with a film.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it two stars instead of one because they actually use good ingredients. What a nut job this guy was personally! I don&#x27;t appreciate all the religious rants, which make no sense, on this product. Isn&#x27;t it enough to have your values represented in the ingredients and fair trade affiliation? I&#x27;m returning the product because I don&#x27;t want to support whack jobs like this and his family, who continue to keep the label as a memorial to Dr. Bronner. The only thing it&#x27;s a memorial to, is/are how crazy he and his family are/was. They would all do well to enroll in a business ethics 101 course. I&#x27;d hate to know how much money they are they flushing down the toilet because of their nut job rants on the label. Dr. Bronner actually spent time in mental institutions!  What a shame, I actually wanted to buy this product.  http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/dr-bronner-s-crazy-ass-magic-soap-labels-18606</li>
            <li> This soap is 100% natural. is soo good for acne control and clean foots after gym.</li>
            <li> First of all, Dr. Bronner&#x27;s is the best soap on the face of the planet.  It can be a little drying, but you&#x27;ll never feel cleaner and it&#x27;s a true soap - just oils and lye, with a little vitamin E and citric acid.  No foaming agents or perfumes and non-polluting.  It&#x27;s concentrated, so a little goes a long way. Also, it really does have (at least!) 18 uses. I&#x27;ve used it as body and hand soap, shampoo, laundry detergent and stain remover, window cleaner, general household cleaner (a la Pine Sol), and there&#x27;s plenty more uses I haven&#x27;t tried. Last but not least, the bottle, covered with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s All-one philosophy, is a conversation piece to say the least.       However, the previous reviewer was right - tea tree flavor smells exactly like turpentine.  I used my bottle as a laundry stain remover (works great, btw) because I couldn&#x27;t bear to put it on my skin or have my house or dishes smelling like it, and thankfully my regular laundry soap killed the smell.  I highly recommend getting another flavor - Almond seems to be all-around favorite, Peppermint is super invigorating and Mild Baby is virtually odorless.  I prefer Lavender and the new Rose flavor because they&#x27;re girly, but really, any of them are better than this.</li>
            <li> Works as well as was suggested on pinterest. The smell is not great but it works well on old cookie sheets</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronners is the best soap for my skin.  Love the tingling/clean feeling it gives me.  I also like the peppermint scent.  I would recommend to anyone who wants a nice, natural soap.</li>
            <li> Great product, much better than using hand soap, dilute it with water, 4 to 1 or so. Doesn&#x27;t leave any odor on skin.</li>
            <li> I use this soap in many cleaning products that call for soap as an ingredient as opposed to using Dawn Dish Soap.  Yes, the scent takes some getting used to, but that&#x27;s the way it&#x27;s supposed to smell!  I use it as a disinfectant to clean the kitchen table by putting a couple drops on the table and wiping down with a wet wash cloth.  I like using this for cleaning because I am confident that there aren&#x27;t any nasty, harmful chemical residues left behind.  I also dilute it with water for cloth diaper wipes solution with a washcloth or cut up baby receiving blankets instead of using (again) nasty, harmful, chemical laden store bought wipes.  My daughter has NEVER had a negative reaction to this product and I know it is safe for skin and around the house.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way with this soap and it actually leaves you clean and oil free after washing with it (unlike other soaps).</li>
            <li> We use this soap almost everywhere and it is really effective for bath and cleaning.  It can be used on the body or on surfaces.</li>
            <li> Been using this soap for the last 9 months and have had much better cleaning and less skin irritations.  Would recommend to others.</li>
