            <li>Leaves hair super soft and smells great</li>
            <li>feel of my hair after i washed this out was so smooth and tangle free.</li>
            <li>it is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>This is why I consider it a light protein.</li>
            <li>Those nappy edges are smooth without caking gel to the side of your head.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and absolutely transforms your hair in no time at all.</li>
            <li>I used this today for the first time and my hair looked much, much better after just one use.  </li>
            <li>Love love love this like how the way my hair feels and give it more body and moisture that us as black women need in our hair</li>
            <li>and it gets it done quick.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend and love this product.</li>
            <li>After washing my hair with L&#x27;Oreal Sulfate Free Evercreme Intense Nourishing shampoo, I applied this to my hair and covered it with a plastic cap.  </li>
            <li>I sat under a hooded dryer for thirty minutes, rinsed my hair, and applied the L&#x27;Oreal Sulfate Free Evercreme Intense Nourishing conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Almost fruity, fresh and invigorating.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>If you have dry and brittle relaxed hair do not hesitate in trying this masque out, it is amazing, and that&#x27;s coming from someonewho</li>
            <li>It protect my style during the hot weather</li>
            <li>I used this product for the first time today.</li>
            <li>For extensive breakage, the ORS hair mayonaisse might be better.</li>
            <li>After doing a 30 minute hot oil treatment with Jamaican castor oil</li>
            <li>I used it when transitioning to natural hair, and have been using it on fully chemical free hair as well.</li>
            <li>It is my most recommended deep treatment.</li>
            <li>I used this on my hair before I got this harsh chemical treatment done on my hair and when I was getting the treatment done, my stylist noticed that my hair were strong and healthy.</li>
            <li>In my regimen, I use it as a light protein based on the ingredients but it definitely feels more like a moisturizing deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of a product junkie, so upon seeing this product advetised in some popular magazine I quickly tracked it down to a local beauty supply store and SERIOUSLY overpaid for the product, but boy am I glad I tried this baby out.</li>
            <li>(Which I really didn&#x27;t want to do) or relax my new-growth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The entire Organic Root Stimulator line is just fantastic.</li>
            <li>After rising the masque out after deep conditionning overnight my hair felt like BUTTER, it was soft, tangle-free, and OMG I could not stop touching it.</li>
            <li>This product has given my hair new life!</li>
            <li>After washing this product out my hair was as smooth as butter and my edges were super slick and layed.</li>
            <li>I use it once every other week and my hairs still soft, silky and healthy after a month.</li>
            <li>In case my title hasn&#x27;t expressed the amount of amazingness that is in this product I will continue to show my unending love and admiration for this little product of genius-ness by ORS.</li>
            <li>how soft this made my hair feel the very moment I put it on my hair.</li>
            <li>It seems to work very well in conditioning my hair and making it soft along with the shampoo.</li>
            <li>and OMGOSH my hair is soooooo SOFT!</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair so soft and aids in detangling!</li>
            <li>It makes your hair incredibly soft and it smells devine.</li>
            <li>Hair feels like silk after usage, but there is no heavy build up or oily feeling.  </li>

            <li>My hair feels soft when I use it.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair soft shiny and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I use this product at least twice a month, sometimes more.</li>
            <li>I particularly like how this product appears to absorb into the strand rather than coat it because it doesn&#x27;t look like white once it&#x27;s applied.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s left it soft, silky in a way that I haven&#x27;t seen it for a long time.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, has a thick consistency, and a little bit goes a very long way.</li>
            <li>I know too much of a good thing can be bad.</li>

            <li> I know too much of a good thing can be bad.</li>
            <li> I would certainly be careful about using it as a purely moisturizing deep conditioner and also using a protein conditioner in the same sitting due to this warning on the label.</li>
            <li> I have yet to see the results in the long run (i have only used it twice).</li>
            <li> My hairs is a 3a-3b mix and with the strangely ends of relaxer can sometimes lack the needed moisture towards the middle of the month.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t dare let my hair dry without this product.  </li>
            <li> My hair has been so dry and tangled, matted and rough, and I was tempted to either cut it off</li>
            <li> Needless-to-say my hair was very dry from the almost daily harsh shampoos and heat abuse.</li>
            <li> Also, I would recommend this product if you are experiencing minimal breakage.</li>
            <li> you it is completely dried out from constant heat and chemical damage.</li>
            <li> It is as all the other reviewers said.</li>
            <li> I wonder if this is due to the possibility of overdosing on protein.</li>
            <li> I used this hair masque in a sample size just to try something different, I always deep condition for at least a hour...left this on for about 2 and washed my hair and COULD NOT BELIEVE MY HANDS!</li>
            <li> It holds the hair in place all day without using other products.  </li>
            <li> I of course gave my hair a little jolt of protein after such a heavy dose of moisture but the softness and bounce that we relaxed girls</li>
            <li> I mix a little grape seed oil and caster oil with it and apply it with a applicator brush.</li>
            <li> but now that I have found this product I am legitimately the happiest little transitioning girl on the planet.</li>
            <li> After I dried my hair</li>
            <li> I ordered this due to the hard water in my area, it&#x27;s very harsh on the hair.</li>
            <li> The smell is unbelievable out of this world.</li>
            <li> On the conditioner, it says to use no more than once weekly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s thick and creamy...</li>
            <li> Makes finger combing difficult and my hair didn&#x27;t few hydrated at all.</li>
            <li> This conditioning masque is very thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> (bad idea for black girls, I know).</li>
            <li> 6 months post relaxer (4b/4c) and its been so difficult trying to get my transitioning hair to cooperate with me.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Like some of the others here I received a sample of this product and I didn&#x27;t think it would work as well as it did.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 6 months post relaxer (4b/4c) and its been so difficult trying to get my transitioning hair to cooperate with me. My hair has been so dry and tangled, matted and rough, and I was tempted to either cut it off (Which I really didn&#x27;t want to do) or relax my new-growth.&lt;br /&gt;Luckily I found this product just in time.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m amazed my how soft this made my hair feel the very moment I put it on my hair. After I washed it out I could comb my hair with ease and it was so soft.&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying this for sure! Hopefully the formula has not changed because this is perfect!!!!</li>
            <li> Leaves hair super soft and smells great</li>
            <li> I just used a sample of this and OMGOSH my hair is soooooo SOFT! I keep touching it, I feel like I&#x27;m running my fingers through a baby&#x27;s hair. I&#x27;m sitting here air drying my hair and frankly I don&#x27;t want to put one thing in my hair it feels so perfect. I am buying the full sized product ASAP! FYI I have relaxed hair and I am about 6 wks post.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love, this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love love love this like how the way my hair feels and give it more body and moisture that us as black women need in our hair It protect my style during the hot weather I will continue to keep using this</li>
            <li> This conditioning masque is very thick and creamy. The smell is unbelievable out of this world. Almost fruity, fresh and invigorating.&lt;br /&gt;The feel of my hair after i washed this out was so smooth and tangle free.</li>
            <li> Absolute best conditioner!!</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t order this again it didn&#x27;t work for my hair !!</li>
            <li> Very good mask. Excellent for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> I tried a sample of this and it works wonderfully! It makes your hair incredibly soft and it smells devine. For something so affordable, it works wonders.</li>
            <li> This hair masque is amazing. It is very easy to use and absolutely transforms your hair in no time at all. Hair feels like silk after usage, but there is no heavy build up or oily feeling.  You also do not have to leave it on for hours. It does the job and it gets it done quick.  Smells great too! The hardest part will be trying not to use it too often!</li>
            <li> I used this product to deep condition my hair it is fantastic.  I am an African-American female with relaxed hair.  It smells wonderful (like avocado and something else), and the scent is really fresh.  After washing my hair with L&#x27;Oreal Sulfate Free Evercreme Intense Nourishing shampoo, I applied this to my hair and covered it with a plastic cap.  I sat under a hooded dryer for thirty minutes, rinsed my hair, and applied the L&#x27;Oreal Sulfate Free Evercreme Intense Nourishing conditioner.  When I touched my hair, it was SO soft, silky, shiny, and beautiful.  After I dried my hair (I put in rollers and sit under a hooded dryer), my hair was even softer.  It feels wonderful and this is definitely going to be my go to product from now on.  The entire Organic Root Stimulator line is just fantastic.</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time today. I exercise about 4-5 days a week and wash and blowdry my hair almost daily to get the sweat out (bad idea for black girls, I know). Needless-to-say my hair was very dry from the almost daily harsh shampoos and heat abuse. This product has given my hair new life! It&#x27;s left it soft, silky in a way that I haven&#x27;t seen it for a long time. It smells like heaven! My only question is, how often should I use this product? I know too much of a good thing can be bad.</li>
            <li> Excellent Conditioner!!!</li>
            <li> A pack of this cake in my perm today and after the first use my hair felt amazing. It feels SO moisturized and healthy. I will be buying more</li>
            <li> This product does a great job conditioning the hair. It makes your hair soft, shiny, and detangled.  It smells great. I recommend Organic Root Olive oil hair masque.</li>
            <li> It is as all the other reviewers said. It made my hair really soft, and it stopped or helped the problem that I&#x27;m having with hair breakage. I would purchase this product again. I mix a little grape seed oil and caster oil with it and apply it with a applicator brush. I simply love it. give it a try ladies!</li>
            <li> 2 stars b/c it smells great and it&#x27;s cheap.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s thick and creamy...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DOES NOTHING for my 4a natural hair.  Makes finger combing difficult and my hair didn&#x27;t few hydrated at all.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner! It leaves my hair so soft and aids in detangling! In my regimen, I use it as a light protein based on the ingredients but it definitely feels more like a moisturizing deep conditioner. On the conditioner, it says to use no more than once weekly. I wonder if this is due to the possibility of overdosing on protein. This is why I consider it a light protein. I would certainly be careful about using it as a purely moisturizing deep conditioner and also using a protein conditioner in the same sitting due to this warning on the label. Also, I would recommend this product if you are experiencing minimal breakage. For extensive breakage, the ORS hair mayonaisse might be better. Overall, great product! Smells nice, has a thick consistency, and a little bit goes a very long way. I particularly like how this product appears to absorb into the strand rather than coat it because it doesn&#x27;t look like white once it&#x27;s applied. LOVE!</li>
            <li> HAIR FEEL SILKLY AND HELP IT GROW</li>
            <li> I used this today for the first time and my hair looked much, much better after just one use.  I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I albsolutely loved this product, best deep conditioner I&#x27;ve used so far. I am mixed with very rought hair and I am about 14 weeks post perm. After doing a 30 minute hot oil treatment with Jamaican castor oil I put this all over my head and put a plastic cap over it for about 3 hours. Depending on the time I have I&#x27;ll let it sit in my hair anywhere from 30 mins to 6+ hours. After washing this product out my hair was as smooth as butter and my edges were super slick and layed. I love this deep conditioner and it smells so good! I was able to run my fingers through my hair without even taking a comb to it, and with the texture hair I have, that&#x27;s a miricale!! I highly recommend and love this product.</li>
            <li> I love to use this conditioner. It feels like butter for my hair. My hair feels soft when I use it. I have yet to see the results in the long run (i have only used it twice).</li>
            <li> I used this on my hair before I got this harsh chemical treatment done on my hair and when I was getting the treatment done, my stylist noticed that my hair were strong and healthy. My hair also came out shiny and glossy after the treatment was done. I use it once every other week and my hairs still soft, silky and healthy after a month.</li>
            <li> This is my second time using this productand it does what it is intended to do. It leaves your hair soft shiny and hydrated.I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Just great love the smell</li>
            <li> I use this product at least twice a month, sometimes more. Very great product for my texlax hair. I am on a hair journey and this is becoming one of my staple products</li>
            <li> I ordered this due to the hard water in my area, it&#x27;s very harsh on the hair. I&#x27;ve co-washed and let it sit for 30 mins using bag method and I didn&#x27;t see this do anything a regular conditioner wouldn&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li> Great product! I have been using this since my hair was chemically straightened. I used it when transitioning to natural hair, and have been using it on fully chemical free hair as well. It is my most recommended deep treatment.</li>
            <li> In case my title hasn&#x27;t expressed the amount of amazingness that is in this product I will continue to show my unending love and admiration for this little product of genius-ness by ORS. I have been transitioning now for hmm....7 months, yes girls I am all the way in this thing and quite frankly I am LOVING IT! but now that I have found this product I am legitimately the happiest little transitioning girl on the planet. My hairs is a 3a-3b mix and with the strangely ends of relaxer can sometimes lack the needed moisture towards the middle of the month. I used this hair masque in a sample size just to try something different, I always deep condition for at least a hour...left this on for about 2 and washed my hair and COULD NOT BELIEVE MY HANDS! I kept touching my hair...in awe, I had to look in the mirror to make sure IT WAS MY HAIR!! Ya&#x27;ll when I tell you that you need to try this product! I am not even joking! Get the sample pack if you don&#x27;t believe me...JUST GIVE IT A TRY! So great, I will be stocking up! MONTHY PROTEIN TREATMENT STAPLE!!! THANK YOU ORS!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;signed,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Transitioning Girl :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of a product junkie, so upon seeing this product advetised in some popular magazine I quickly tracked it down to a local beauty supply store and SERIOUSLY overpaid for the product, but boy am I glad I tried this baby out. This product is absolutely incredible, my hair has never felt so soft and moisturized and mind you it is completely dried out from constant heat and chemical damage. After rising the masque out after deep conditionning overnight my hair felt like BUTTER, it was soft, tangle-free, and OMG I could not stop touching it. I of course gave my hair a little jolt of protein after such a heavy dose of moisture but the softness and bounce that we relaxed girls like to see was definitely there after using this product. If you have dry and brittle relaxed hair do not hesitate in trying this masque out, it is amazing, and that&#x27;s coming from someonewho has used some of the most expensive products on the market.</li>
            <li> I had purchased their shampoo at another store, but saw this conditioner on Amazon. So I thought I would try this product, and I&#x27;m glad that I did. It seems to work very well in conditioning my hair and making it soft along with the shampoo. I think I will probably stick with this brand for a while as it seems to definitely work well together.</li>
            <li> Perfect product for ladies of color.  It holds the hair in place all day without using other products.  I don&#x27;t dare let my hair dry without this product.  In 50 years no product softens, smells great,  it is not greasy, and holds your hair where you put it. Those nappy edges are smooth without caking gel to the side of your head.  lol It does have a build up after three days so you will need to wash your hair every three days or so.  I have used everything on my hair that is on the shelves, and this one is by far the best product I have ever used.  I have not permed my hair in 11 months and I won&#x27;t.  My hair is beautifully full and healthy!!!</li>
