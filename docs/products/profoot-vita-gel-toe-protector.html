            <li>Just ordered 2 more!!</li>
            <li>excellent product....protects the top of my hammer toe until it heals.  </li>
            <li>I did a search and found these on Good ole  Amazon and now I have all I need and</li>
            <li>good to help with toes that lap over or have a corn or bunion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with these &amp; surprised at how good they work.  </li>
            <li>This product was the most comfortable and effective one I tried.</li>
            <li>My husband can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!  </li>
            <li>have worn them in the shower and in a PT pool (with shoes), and they stay on just fine.  </li>
            <li>fit well, comfortable.</li>
            <li>but this is easier, durable and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>The main problem with this product is that most people don&#x27;t know what symptoms it treats and what it&#x27;s called.</li>
            <li>but I guess you can cut them to your own personal size.</li>
            <li>easy to put on, long lasting protection and did a great job of protecting my toe by staying in place</li>
            <li>At first when you put them on it feels like you have something inside between your toes</li>
            <li>After injuring a toe, I tried many different products to protect it from the pain of rubbing against socks and shoes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not been able to find a quantity of these, locally.....</li>
            <li>Usually good gel toe protectors will last up from three  to six months, almost in a daily basis use.</li>
            <li>It protects a hammer toe very well.  </li>
            <li>Very overpriced.  </li>
            <li>These really work if you have corns .</li>
            <li>help so much that there are times I can go without them for awhile as they help heal by keeping the friction off the sore area.</li>
            <li>His hammer toe problem is gone when he wears the Gel Toe Protector (much better than the other types of toe protectors).  </li>
            <li>I was getting blisters on the top of my pinkie and big toe as well as callouses on the bottom of my big toes from my hiking boots.</li>
            <li>about three weeks later I went back to look for more, should have bought them all as there were none to be found,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been thru foot surgeries, but these little things help me more than the surgery ever did.  </li>
            <li>I have also worn them with sandals and they don&#x27;t tend to stay on very well with bare feet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I no longer have a scab or hard corn on top.  </li>
            <li>So far, I have used them 8 times already and they still work, they haven&#x27;t worn off or ripped yet.</li>
            <li>The first one I bought lasted 3 weeks but the second one only lasted 3 days.</li>
            <li>The gel is very soft and since it has a smaller inner diameter than my toe, it stretches and conforms to it.  </li>
            <li>The covers I found in the drug store are far too thick and heavy and created a while new set of foot pains, while this gel toe protector works smoothly and well.</li>

            <li> It does take up a little space and makes the shoe a little tight but makes up for being very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I cut off the closed end and cut the toe protectors in half, so they fit on my little toes and the slightly larger ones.  </li>
            <li> the price for a little  piece of silicone is rather high.</li>
            <li> They come in a large size(I have small toes)</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know if they would last long.</li>

            <li> the shelves seem to be empty of these every time  </li>
            <li> I did cut them a bit because they are a little long.</li>
            <li> Thicker than other manufacturer&#x27;s items, so not as elastic.  </li>
            <li> No more blisters on my LONG TOES.</li>
            <li> Product was damaged as the plastic package was kinked  - not worth the cost to return.</li>
            <li> Typically can get 4 tubes of these for $4 elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I wore the toe protectors to my soccer game yesterday for the first time, and when the game was over, I took off my socks and saw that the toe protectors were already ripped.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I wasted money on a product that only lasted me one game!</li>
            <li> This little thing was a miracle worker!</li>
            <li> I like it because they are really thick.</li>
            <li> Too bad the local drug store chains stopped carrying it.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product!  It protects a hammer toe very well.  I no longer have a scab or hard corn on top.  Will be having surgery on 2 toes @ the end of the month and this is a life saver!  Just ordered 2 more!!</li>
            <li> Thicker than other manufacturer&#x27;s items, so not as elastic.  I found the item to be too long.</li>
            <li> I was getting blisters on the top of my pinkie and big toe as well as callouses on the bottom of my big toes from my hiking boots. Haven&#x27;t had a blister or a callous since.  Remarkable product!</li>
            <li> excellent product....protects the top of my hammer toe until it heals.  The covers I found in the drug store are far too thick and heavy and created a while new set of foot pains, while this gel toe protector works smoothly and well.</li>
            <li> I wore the toe protectors to my soccer game yesterday for the first time, and when the game was over, I took off my socks and saw that the toe protectors were already ripped.  I can&#x27;t believe I wasted money on a product that only lasted me one game!</li>
            <li> I had an issue with both my toes next to the big toes, where the front would always rub with my shoe causing it to bruise, hurt and for my toe nails to fall off. These gel toe protectors are awesome! They don&#x27;t hurt or rub anymore. So far, I have used them 8 times already and they still work, they haven&#x27;t worn off or ripped yet. I did cut them a bit because they are a little long. At first when you put them on it feels like you have something inside between your toes but once you start walking or running it will feel like there&#x27;s nothing there.  I use them for working out. 40 min power walking, 25 min running, I do this 4 times a week. So I hope this review helps anyone who has issues with their toes when it comes to working out.</li>
            <li> This little thing was a miracle worker! Wished I had bought it sooner. Only down side is they don&#x27;t last long. The first one I bought lasted 3 weeks but the second one only lasted 3 days. So you need to buy plenty.</li>
            <li> The second time I wore this toe protector it split out. Very poor quality.  Very overpriced.  Would not recommend buying this&lt;br /&gt;to anyone.</li>
            <li> My husband can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!  His hammer toe problem is gone when he wears the Gel Toe Protector (much better than the other types of toe protectors).  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Would be a great product if it lasted. Used on my big toe and it split after 2 days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with these &amp; surprised at how good they work.  Have been trying all kinds of different ways to stop the pain &amp; these actually have worked for me.</li>
            <li> fit well, comfortable. No more blisters on my LONG TOES.</li>
            <li> The gel is very soft and since it has a smaller inner diameter than my toe, it stretches and conforms to it.  It does take up a little space and makes the shoe a little tight but makes up for being very comfortable.  I am using it to relieve pain because my middle toe nail is damaged and keeps rubbing against my sock and shoe.  I play a lot of soccer and basketball and the middle toe always hits the front of the shoe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I can accomplish the same effect by taping the end of my toe but this is easier, durable and comfortable.  I wished I had found this earlier before the damage has been done.  I recommend people to give this a try.  The main problem with this product is that most people don&#x27;t know what symptoms it treats and what it&#x27;s called.</li>
            <li> After injuring a toe, I tried many different products to protect it from the pain of rubbing against socks and shoes. This product was the most comfortable and effective one I tried. Too bad the local drug store chains stopped carrying it.</li>
            <li> ..and they hurt all the time.  I&#x27;ve been thru foot surgeries, but these little things help me more than the surgery ever did.  I cut off the closed end and cut the toe protectors in half, so they fit on my little toes and the slightly larger ones.  When you take your socks off,  they&#x27;ll follow the socks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have worn them in the shower and in a PT pool (with shoes), and they stay on just fine.  I have also worn them with sandals and they don&#x27;t tend to stay on very well with bare feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not been able to find a quantity of these, locally.....the shelves seem to be empty of these every time  I go looking...so buy a bunch!</li>
            <li> I like it because they are really thick. They come in a large size(I have small toes) but I guess you can cut them to your own personal size. I have only worn them twice so I don&#x27;t know if they would last long. Usually good gel toe protectors will last up from three  to six months, almost in a daily basis use.</li>
            <li> easy to put on, long lasting protection and did a great job of protecting my toe by staying in place</li>
            <li> Product was damaged as the plastic package was kinked  - not worth the cost to return. I&#x27;ve bought different versions of these over the last 15 years and they all work for hammer toes but the price for a little  piece of silicone is rather high. Typically can get 4 tubes of these for $4 elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Best thing for hammer toes.</li>
            <li> These really work if you have corns . Nothing works as well, not even going to the podiatrist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found these at a drug store last summer as a last resort, could not walk without pain, bought these and I was walking again.&lt;br /&gt;After they wore out about three weeks later I went back to look for more, should have bought them all as there were none to be found, anywhere!..I did a search and found these on Good ole  Amazon and now I have all I need and want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They help so much that there are times I can go without them for awhile as they help heal by keeping the friction off the sore area.</li>
            <li> Great help stopping my toe from having pain.</li>
            <li> good to help with toes that lap over or have a corn or bunion.</li>
