            <li>The Followills swear by these, but I have firsthand knowledge that the best vocal coaches advise NOT to use them as the menthol dries out the vocal chords.  </li>

            <li>It smelled good, and I use to sleep well.</li>
            <li>what really good medicine that works isn&#x27;t.  </li>

            <li>The reviews were good</li>
            <li>A great product and I am so glad that I can get them online.</li>
            <li>awesome product will order more, it truly smooth your vocal and like to use it every time I need it giving me good results.</li>
            <li>Refreshing and healing!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m able to sing again (yea!).</li>
            <li>or so before I begin singing and everything just opens up :) Buy them!</li>
            <li>I am so glad it was!</li>
            <li>These things are amazing, and they are effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To be honest I got it 3 days ago after I ordered it 2 weeks ago</li>
            <li>I always have it in handy.</li>
            <li>Amazingly effective.</li>
            <li>, I am giving an honest review and speaking the truth.</li>
            <li>Strong tasting but have good ingredients to do the job.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because I thought it would help my voice, since it gets raspy very easily</li>
            <li>Very strong, but works.</li>
            <li>I am very grateful to have discovered this product and plan to buy many more !!!  </li>
            <li>At first taste they honestly don&#x27;t taste that great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not 100% effective, but it&#x27;s the best such product there is.</li>
            <li>Wow i love it, vocalzone is excellent !!!</li>
            <li>The BEST remedy to help open up your head, clear your voice, and let you sing your BEST!</li>
            <li>They sure do taste strong, but they do work like a charm!</li>
            <li>They have a pleasant taste, neither too sweet nor too strong.  </li>
            <li>just bought more of these,...</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>and they worked better than any cough drops I had.</li>
            <li>I purchased it with some hesitation as many comments were complaining about the taste.  </li>
            <li>actually refreshing...</li>
            <li>They were okay.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic for singers and speakers.&lt;br /&gt;Great to have just before warm up and better the day after you&#x27;ve been belting out the tunes to recover your voice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are many that use this product</li>
            <li>I gave it a one star on top, because I had to put something in.</li>
            <li>If anyone would like to email me I&#x27;d gladly share the name of the spray and associated products.</li>
            <li>Now whenever I go for a show, I make sure I always have these with me.</li>
            <li>The best way I can describe them is like a Halls drop, but ten times for intensive.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve got a licorice taste to them, but it&#x27;s not too overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I do intend to re-order when I need more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bearable, but not my favorite.</li>
            <li>Maybe a cherry flavor? :)</li>
            <li>Work customer service phones many hours, plus do some singing.</li>
            <li>Planning to order more...</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m still convinced I&#x27;m better off having some Vocalzone around then</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t leave it in my mouth for more than five minutes without spitting it out.</li>
            <li>Our son is a singer and auditions for many things and sometimes his voice becomes hoarse and he tried these</li>
            <li>I love these.  </li>
            <li>My husband also uses them, and he likes the taste so I am sure i am just picky.  </li>
            <li>I love these.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many types of cough drops and throat sprays for this purpose, but nothing has worked as well as these lozenges.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried soooo many things for my allergies, and then I pop one of these 15 minutes</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>LOVE them.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m going on stage or giving a presentation or know that I&#x27;m going to be on the phone for a while, I always make sure to have these with me.</li>
            <li>It is a good product for the right person.</li>
            <li>Thanks BritishGoodies!!!!</li>
            <li>These are the best vocal lozenges I&#x27;ve used and will continue to buy them as long as I can get them.</li>
            <li>Sure don&#x27;t taste good, but these gems really helped me get through performances and keep my voice during  cs shifts.</li>
            <li>very cool sensation</li>
            <li>Great product that I recommend to anyone who needs to keep their voice clear.</li>
            <li>Not nasty tasting, very soothing &amp; are more effective than any cough drops.</li>
            <li>For sure these Vocalzone Throat Pastilles really work (for me)!!!</li>
            <li>Better off with some good old reliable Halls.</li>
            <li>Yes it is strong tasting,</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product and this company.</li>
            <li>Now I can hit the high notes, no problem, and they taste good too.  </li>
            <li>Love these throat things I had to sing for a special song</li>
            <li>Good for a short practice session but more endurance singing still requires more moisture- lukewarm pineapple juice works just as well</li>
            <li>There have been times where I was too hoarse to even speak, popped a vocalzone in, and I sang perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>So pony up and take the real medicine for your health (like these), and you&#x27;ll be all the better for it!</li>
            <li>It was important to me to avoid the necessity of clearing my throat repeatedly while talking, so that my client would not become distracted.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are great, especially for singers.  </li>
            <li>Every once in a while I skip pushing the cheap button, and take 3, and voila</li>
            <li>Effective, affordable and downright tasty, these lozenges are highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>These pastilles are great for the purpose: They work quickly, and as others have commented, have a cooling menthol effect that goes throughout the nasal passages (not a purely good thing, but it&#x27;s pleasant).</li>
            <li>I find it pretty refreshing</li>
            <li>That original product formulation has disappeared, it seems, so I have been looking for an &amp;#34;instant&amp;#34; throat-clearing product to replace it ever since.</li>
            <li>Seems to clean the vocal cords.</li>
            <li>They really are amazing, and are totally worth every penny.</li>
            <li>And I was also impressed that delivery from the U.K. was much faster than expected.</li>
            <li>It is not right or good to do these things!</li>
            <li>As a singer, having a clear head is one of the most valuable assets!  </li>
            <li>Really does heal the throat quickly!!</li>
            <li>As a singer, I take one of these right before I go out to sing!</li>
            <li>The good thing about it is that I was able to try it without having to buy a large amount initially.</li>
            <li>They sooth the throat and help my voice stay nice &amp; clear.  </li>
            <li>Soothing, penetrating and not too sweet.</li>
            <li>The benefits of proper rest and a good warmup can&#x27;t be beat</li>
            <li>This review it true and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad… not great… but not bad.</li>
            <li>I saw the package in a &amp;#34;backstage&amp;#34; video; had never heard of it, but thought I&#x27;d try it ... used it for singing last night, and was more than satisfied, for whatever reason.  </li>
            <li>I saw this in a U2 music video (can&#x27;t remember which one) and was so lucky to find it here.</li>
            <li>my singing and speaking a lot this has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li>took two of these and was able to hit all high notes</li>
            <li>This item shipped very very fast!</li>
            <li>It is important to be aware of the condition of voice and your limitations.</li>
            <li>Now I always make sure I take them before a live show.</li>
            <li>The new box arrived today in tip top shape.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely fantastic...what a find !!  </li>
            <li>thanks!!</li>
            <li>I used Vocalzones the first time after having an allergy attack about two hours before having to go on stage!  </li>
            <li>use this product along with drinking warm water and vocal warmups and my voice is ready to go especially really early Sunday mornings at 8 AM!</li>
            <li>The package arrived for Great Britain a little battered but the product was not damaged.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough nice things about them</li>
            <li>Much success to all who use their throat for a living.....</li>
            <li>It was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>and I was able to sing clearly and without hesitation.  </li>
            <li>And they clear up my sinuses too :)</li>
            <li>I Bought these Vocal zones because I&#x27;ve seen the works of them, great product, works extremely well, I will be buying these very soon again.</li>
            <li>Came super fast!</li>
            <li>ON TIME IN ORIGINAL BOX FAST MAIL .I</li>
            <li>They have a strong, medicinal taste -- again, not unpleasant but definitely not fruity or sweet.</li>
            <li>Most important, however, they clear and settle the throat/voice for speaking or singing purposes -- that means more resonance, less nasal or congested voicing.</li>
            <li>Super fast service</li>
            <li>It has a good flavor and there is not a sweet taste.  </li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>the taste is less strong it would be better..</li>
            <li>I was introduced to this product when I was in acting school many years ago.</li>
            <li>I sipped on hot tea with lemon and honey and let a vocal zone disolve repeatedly in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>Thanks !</li>
            <li>/&gt;Oddly they smell like weed when you first pop em out of the pack?</li>
            <li>I spray it before, and mostly during my performances, coupled with constant sips of water.</li>
            <li>While becoming vocally tired during the rehearsal period for my show, I was searching for a good,  reliable lozenge to soothe my throat.</li>
            <li>I get one just when I feel my throat funny or about to be sore.</li>
            <li>Really works!  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says it does and keeps your throat clear and sound for anything from speaking to singing.</li>
            <li>Mostly though, it only takes 1.  </li>
            <li>and I spent my own money to purchase these items therefore</li>
            <li>am really really praying and hoping that these people who are posting these lies and who might be paid to do it should STOP!</li>
            <li>Must help Caleb&#x27;s voice be raspier ;)</li>
            <li>Apart from always keeping hydrated, these certainly help producing a clear sound.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s pretty much all i had to say.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m more likely these days to be standing in front of a PowerPoint presentation than a Fender amplifier, the public-speaking help they lend I particularly appreciate.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and most definitely this seller!</li>
            <li>That kind of shot me down, because like most other performers I&#x27;ve talked with,all concurred that they kept a supply of mentholated products.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I got my voice back before I got the pills</li>
            <li>Here, the seller offers the identical product (totally fresh stock---no expired boxes) for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>It arrived before I even remember I purchased it---very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say much for the taste, though.</li>
            <li>I am not yet completely sold on this product, but I do think it is worth a try.  </li>
            <li>My son&#x27;s job has him talking hours straight.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!  </li>
            <li>They really work.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>and because it was especially marked for singing.</li>
            <li>These Vocalzone Throat Pieces work really well.</li>
            <li>and so very convenient to carry.</li>
            <li>It really helps.</li>
            <li>Really had hoped it would help my voice, but it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I clears my throat and helps me sing with a much clearer voice.</li>
            <li>Many times, the only way I can get through the day with a clear voice is because of my Vocalzones.  </li>
            <li>They kept my throat clear and soothed some of the soreness right away.</li>
            <li>any more so I decided on vocalzone due to the reviews.</li>
            <li>The other two and there is one more here that I cannot remember its name - that does not work either.</li>
            <li>I pop one of these in half an hour or so before a performance and my throat is clear and healthy sounding by the time I go on stage!</li>
            <li>The throat drops are strong and do wonders for my dry throat.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything spectacular for my throat which gets irritated by excessive talking or meds.</li>
            <li>I cannot live without these on gig nights!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly care for the taste.</li>
            <li>and I needed quite a few boxes quickly, and they had them!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it before and after singing...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>so I could breathe a little better</li>
            <li>I guess it helps if you have a raspy throat, but It didn&#x27;t fo much for m except clear up my sinus&#x27;</li>
            <li>I use one right before I&#x27;ll be doing a long presentation before a large group were my voice can become fatigued after awhile.</li>
            <li>The next night, day five, I was strong enough to both preach and sing.  </li>
            <li>I have to pop an altoid right after because I can only imagine what my breath smells like.</li>
            <li>Although I was skeptical at first, I can honestly say that Vocalzone helps my throat and sinuses get ready to sing and</li>
            <li>We live in Las Vegas...</li>
            <li>I am not a singer but suffer from dry throat and severe PND and this helps tremendously to keep my throat moist throughout the night.</li>
            <li>As a hypnotherapist, my voice would often become raspy after speaking for an hour at a time for multiple sessions, even at low volume and at a comfortable pitch.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love these throat pastilles and highly recommend the to anyone who sings or does public speaking on a regular basis, is a teacher or someone who lectures regularly.</li>
            <li>Since I was a very young...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s only in America where medicine is supposed to taste good, guess what, only the sugared down over chemicalized crap tastes good and sweet, but doesn&#x27;t work!  </li>
            <li>these things are epic!</li>
            <li>Epic product!</li>
            <li>great product, taste bad at first</li>
            <li>Small enough to just kind of keep it somewhere in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>I was able to sing a little after using these but not total help though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I still use it to clear my vocal chords.</li>
            <li>They really clear out your throat.</li>
            <li>They take about 10 minutes to clear you</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve taken 3 so far</li>
            <li>aid for speakers, actors, singers and everyone who needs to rely on having their voice ready when necessary.</li>
            <li>I must say that I was pleasantly surprised by this product...</li>
            <li>/&gt;As far as the taste?</li>
            <li>They smell kinda weird, but it really gets you ready to sing, especially if you don&#x27;t have a lot of time to warm up.  </li>
            <li>Nothing I&#x27;ve tried works better for me at least, than Vocalzone.  </li>
            <li>I use my voice professionally.</li>
            <li>I am a professional singer and these help keep my throat lubricated.&lt;br /&gt;Going to try and see if i can get them in bulk.</li>
            <li>she uses her voice professionally.</li>
            <li>I was unable to tell any difference after using this product although a good friend utilizes it and says it helps him as an Elvis Tribute Artist.</li>
            <li>No more effective than cough drops, but more expensive.</li>
            <li>I know I could go to the corner drugstore and get a whole bag of menthol-eucalyptus drops for half the price, but this stuff really does give the sensation of &amp;#34;de-gunking&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I carefully husband my stocks, and when my younger son asked what he could bring back from Cambridge, I said Vocalzones, because they aren&#x27;t available in Australia.    </li>
            <li>Lasts a very long time and really helps.</li>
            <li>I wish it was on the local store shelves, but glad that I can at least order through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>They are black and quite pungent but perhaps that&#x27;s what&#x27;s needed to get the right response.</li>
            <li>With Vocalzone, my productivity is up and my general vocal stamina has improved.  </li>
            <li>I sing daily and my voice has to be clear for the programs I do.</li>
            <li>These tablets are the only ones that instantly clear everything from your throat and around the vocal cords, drying up mucus and etc and gives me the clearest voice!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am a facilitator and you can actually feel them clearly mucus from your vocal cords.  </li>
            <li>I sing in a choir and they are a big help in keeping my throat clear.  </li>
            <li>it it keeps things open and clear without the syrup coating your throat like a cough drop.</li>
            <li>Definitely helps keep my voice clear and</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon in all that you do to support the world wide nation</li>
            <li>I was looking for something smaller like the old \\&quot;HELPS\\&quot; licorice lozenges that are no longer sold.  </li>
            <li>The taste was slightly off putting at first</li>
            <li>so you become less aware of your fatigue, but they don&#x27;t prevent you from wearing out your voice.</li>
            <li>As an historical interpreter at a museum and a professional storyteller, I have used Vocalzone for several years.  </li>
            <li>These are okay, not excellent.&lt;br /&gt;Taste is not good!</li>
            <li>No side effects noticed, no problems experiences, other than the problem that, until I found them on Amazon, I was forced to play the miser and suffer for a week or two until I was sure I needed them.  </li>
            <li>A lot of all-day seminars which really wear down one&#x27;s throat.  </li>
            <li>In 2006, I was in Cornwall, researching a book (still not written) when a distant relative who lives there introduced me to this product in a pub when I could barely drink my beer, thanks to a wretched cough that had followed me around Athens (where it developed), Kefallonia, assorted other Greek islands, Vienna and Britain.  </li>
            <li>They seem to be hard to impossible to find, so am very happy Amazon is selling them !!</li>
            <li>keeps my vocal cords loose and my throat clear...</li>
            <li>But it didn&#x27;t take very long to receive at all, and it was well worth waiting a few extra days for.</li>
            <li>These little nasties really help a sore throat.</li>
            <li>Taste is so bad that the results must be good.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> The Followills swear by these, but I have firsthand knowledge that the best vocal coaches advise NOT to use them as the menthol dries out the vocal chords.  </li>

            <li> Refreshing and healing!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m able to sing again (yea!).</li>
            <li> or so before I begin singing and everything just opens up :) Buy them!</li>
            <li> I am so glad it was!</li>
            <li> These things are amazing, and they are effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To be honest I got it 3 days ago after I ordered it 2 weeks ago</li>
            <li> I always have it in handy.</li>
            <li> Amazingly effective.</li>
            <li> , I am giving an honest review and speaking the truth.</li>
            <li> Strong tasting but have good ingredients to do the job.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because I thought it would help my voice, since it gets raspy very easily</li>
            <li> Very strong, but works.</li>
            <li> I am very grateful to have discovered this product and plan to buy many more !!!  </li>
            <li> At first taste they honestly don&#x27;t taste that great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not 100% effective, but it&#x27;s the best such product there is.</li>
            <li> Wow i love it, vocalzone is excellent !!!</li>
            <li> The BEST remedy to help open up your head, clear your voice, and let you sing your BEST!</li>
            <li> They sure do taste strong, but they do work like a charm!</li>
            <li> They have a pleasant taste, neither too sweet nor too strong.  </li>
            <li> just bought more of these,...</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> and they worked better than any cough drops I had.</li>
            <li> I purchased it with some hesitation as many comments were complaining about the taste.  </li>
            <li> actually refreshing...</li>
            <li> They were okay.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic for singers and speakers.&lt;br /&gt;Great to have just before warm up and better the day after you&#x27;ve been belting out the tunes to recover your voice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are many that use this product</li>
            <li> I gave it a one star on top, because I had to put something in.</li>
            <li> If anyone would like to email me I&#x27;d gladly share the name of the spray and associated products.</li>
            <li> Now whenever I go for a show, I make sure I always have these with me.</li>
            <li> The best way I can describe them is like a Halls drop, but ten times for intensive.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve got a licorice taste to them, but it&#x27;s not too overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I do intend to re-order when I need more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bearable, but not my favorite.</li>
            <li> Maybe a cherry flavor? :)</li>
            <li> Work customer service phones many hours, plus do some singing.</li>
            <li> Planning to order more...</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m still convinced I&#x27;m better off having some Vocalzone around then</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t leave it in my mouth for more than five minutes without spitting it out.</li>
            <li> Our son is a singer and auditions for many things and sometimes his voice becomes hoarse and he tried these</li>
            <li> I love these.  </li>
            <li> My husband also uses them, and he likes the taste so I am sure i am just picky.  </li>
            <li> I love these.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many types of cough drops and throat sprays for this purpose, but nothing has worked as well as these lozenges.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried soooo many things for my allergies, and then I pop one of these 15 minutes</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> LOVE them.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m going on stage or giving a presentation or know that I&#x27;m going to be on the phone for a while, I always make sure to have these with me.</li>
            <li> It is a good product for the right person.</li>
            <li> Thanks BritishGoodies!!!!</li>
            <li> These are the best vocal lozenges I&#x27;ve used and will continue to buy them as long as I can get them.</li>
            <li> Sure don&#x27;t taste good, but these gems really helped me get through performances and keep my voice during  cs shifts.</li>
            <li> very cool sensation</li>
            <li> Great product that I recommend to anyone who needs to keep their voice clear.</li>
            <li> Not nasty tasting, very soothing &amp; are more effective than any cough drops.</li>
            <li> For sure these Vocalzone Throat Pastilles really work (for me)!!!</li>
            <li> Better off with some good old reliable Halls.</li>
            <li> Yes it is strong tasting,</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this product and this company.</li>
            <li> Now I can hit the high notes, no problem, and they taste good too.  </li>
            <li> Love these throat things I had to sing for a special song</li>
            <li> Good for a short practice session but more endurance singing still requires more moisture- lukewarm pineapple juice works just as well</li>
            <li> There have been times where I was too hoarse to even speak, popped a vocalzone in, and I sang perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> So pony up and take the real medicine for your health (like these), and you&#x27;ll be all the better for it!</li>
            <li> It was important to me to avoid the necessity of clearing my throat repeatedly while talking, so that my client would not become distracted.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are great, especially for singers.  </li>
            <li> Every once in a while I skip pushing the cheap button, and take 3, and voila</li>
            <li> Effective, affordable and downright tasty, these lozenges are highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> These pastilles are great for the purpose: They work quickly, and as others have commented, have a cooling menthol effect that goes throughout the nasal passages (not a purely good thing, but it&#x27;s pleasant).</li>
            <li> I find it pretty refreshing</li>
            <li> That original product formulation has disappeared, it seems, so I have been looking for an &amp;#34;instant&amp;#34; throat-clearing product to replace it ever since.</li>
            <li> Seems to clean the vocal cords.</li>
            <li> They really are amazing, and are totally worth every penny.</li>
            <li> And I was also impressed that delivery from the U.K. was much faster than expected.</li>
            <li> It is not right or good to do these things!</li>
            <li> As a singer, having a clear head is one of the most valuable assets!  </li>
            <li> Really does heal the throat quickly!!</li>
            <li> As a singer, I take one of these right before I go out to sing!</li>
            <li> The good thing about it is that I was able to try it without having to buy a large amount initially.</li>
            <li> They sooth the throat and help my voice stay nice &amp; clear.  </li>
            <li> Soothing, penetrating and not too sweet.</li>
            <li> The benefits of proper rest and a good warmup can&#x27;t be beat</li>
            <li> This review it true and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad… not great… but not bad.</li>
            <li> I saw the package in a &amp;#34;backstage&amp;#34; video; had never heard of it, but thought I&#x27;d try it ... used it for singing last night, and was more than satisfied, for whatever reason.  </li>
            <li> I saw this in a U2 music video (can&#x27;t remember which one) and was so lucky to find it here.</li>
            <li> my singing and speaking a lot this has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li> took two of these and was able to hit all high notes</li>
            <li> This item shipped very very fast!</li>
            <li> It is important to be aware of the condition of voice and your limitations.</li>
            <li> Now I always make sure I take them before a live show.</li>
            <li> The new box arrived today in tip top shape.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic...what a find !!  </li>
            <li> thanks!!</li>
            <li> I used Vocalzones the first time after having an allergy attack about two hours before having to go on stage!  </li>
            <li> use this product along with drinking warm water and vocal warmups and my voice is ready to go especially really early Sunday mornings at 8 AM!</li>
            <li> The package arrived for Great Britain a little battered but the product was not damaged.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough nice things about them</li>
            <li> Much success to all who use their throat for a living.....</li>
            <li> It was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> and I was able to sing clearly and without hesitation.  </li>
            <li> And they clear up my sinuses too :)</li>
            <li> I Bought these Vocal zones because I&#x27;ve seen the works of them, great product, works extremely well, I will be buying these very soon again.</li>
            <li> Came super fast!</li>
            <li> ON TIME IN ORIGINAL BOX FAST MAIL .I</li>
            <li> They have a strong, medicinal taste -- again, not unpleasant but definitely not fruity or sweet.</li>
            <li> Most important, however, they clear and settle the throat/voice for speaking or singing purposes -- that means more resonance, less nasal or congested voicing.</li>
            <li> Super fast service</li>
            <li> It has a good flavor and there is not a sweet taste.  </li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> the taste is less strong it would be better..</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product when I was in acting school many years ago.</li>
            <li> I sipped on hot tea with lemon and honey and let a vocal zone disolve repeatedly in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Thanks !</li>
            <li> /&gt;Oddly they smell like weed when you first pop em out of the pack?</li>
            <li> I spray it before, and mostly during my performances, coupled with constant sips of water.</li>
            <li> While becoming vocally tired during the rehearsal period for my show, I was searching for a good,  reliable lozenge to soothe my throat.</li>
            <li> I get one just when I feel my throat funny or about to be sore.</li>
            <li> Really works!  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it does and keeps your throat clear and sound for anything from speaking to singing.</li>
            <li> Mostly though, it only takes 1.  </li>
            <li> and I spent my own money to purchase these items therefore</li>
            <li> am really really praying and hoping that these people who are posting these lies and who might be paid to do it should STOP!</li>
            <li> Must help Caleb&#x27;s voice be raspier ;)</li>
            <li> Apart from always keeping hydrated, these certainly help producing a clear sound.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s pretty much all i had to say.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m more likely these days to be standing in front of a PowerPoint presentation than a Fender amplifier, the public-speaking help they lend I particularly appreciate.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and most definitely this seller!</li>
            <li> That kind of shot me down, because like most other performers I&#x27;ve talked with,all concurred that they kept a supply of mentholated products.</li>
            <li> Fortunately I got my voice back before I got the pills</li>
            <li> Here, the seller offers the identical product (totally fresh stock---no expired boxes) for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> It arrived before I even remember I purchased it---very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say much for the taste, though.</li>
            <li> I am not yet completely sold on this product, but I do think it is worth a try.  </li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s job has him talking hours straight.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!  </li>
            <li> They really work.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> and because it was especially marked for singing.</li>
            <li> These Vocalzone Throat Pieces work really well.</li>
            <li> and so very convenient to carry.</li>
            <li> It really helps.</li>
            <li> Really had hoped it would help my voice, but it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I clears my throat and helps me sing with a much clearer voice.</li>
            <li> Many times, the only way I can get through the day with a clear voice is because of my Vocalzones.  </li>
            <li> They kept my throat clear and soothed some of the soreness right away.</li>
            <li> any more so I decided on vocalzone due to the reviews.</li>
            <li> The other two and there is one more here that I cannot remember its name - that does not work either.</li>
            <li> I pop one of these in half an hour or so before a performance and my throat is clear and healthy sounding by the time I go on stage!</li>
            <li> The throat drops are strong and do wonders for my dry throat.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything spectacular for my throat which gets irritated by excessive talking or meds.</li>
            <li> I cannot live without these on gig nights!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly care for the taste.</li>
            <li> and I needed quite a few boxes quickly, and they had them!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it before and after singing...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> so I could breathe a little better</li>
            <li> I guess it helps if you have a raspy throat, but It didn&#x27;t fo much for m except clear up my sinus&#x27;</li>
            <li> I use one right before I&#x27;ll be doing a long presentation before a large group were my voice can become fatigued after awhile.</li>
            <li> The next night, day five, I was strong enough to both preach and sing.  </li>
            <li> I have to pop an altoid right after because I can only imagine what my breath smells like.</li>
            <li> Although I was skeptical at first, I can honestly say that Vocalzone helps my throat and sinuses get ready to sing and</li>
            <li> We live in Las Vegas...</li>
            <li> I am not a singer but suffer from dry throat and severe PND and this helps tremendously to keep my throat moist throughout the night.</li>
            <li> As a hypnotherapist, my voice would often become raspy after speaking for an hour at a time for multiple sessions, even at low volume and at a comfortable pitch.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love these throat pastilles and highly recommend the to anyone who sings or does public speaking on a regular basis, is a teacher or someone who lectures regularly.</li>
            <li> Since I was a very young...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s only in America where medicine is supposed to taste good, guess what, only the sugared down over chemicalized crap tastes good and sweet, but doesn&#x27;t work!  </li>
            <li> these things are epic!</li>
            <li> Epic product!</li>
            <li> great product, taste bad at first</li>
            <li> Small enough to just kind of keep it somewhere in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> I was able to sing a little after using these but not total help though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still use it to clear my vocal chords.</li>
            <li> They really clear out your throat.</li>
            <li> They take about 10 minutes to clear you</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve taken 3 so far</li>
            <li> aid for speakers, actors, singers and everyone who needs to rely on having their voice ready when necessary.</li>
            <li> I must say that I was pleasantly surprised by this product...</li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as the taste?</li>
            <li> They smell kinda weird, but it really gets you ready to sing, especially if you don&#x27;t have a lot of time to warm up.  </li>
            <li> Nothing I&#x27;ve tried works better for me at least, than Vocalzone.  </li>
            <li> I use my voice professionally.</li>
            <li> I am a professional singer and these help keep my throat lubricated.&lt;br /&gt;Going to try and see if i can get them in bulk.</li>
            <li> she uses her voice professionally.</li>
            <li> I was unable to tell any difference after using this product although a good friend utilizes it and says it helps him as an Elvis Tribute Artist.</li>
            <li> No more effective than cough drops, but more expensive.</li>
            <li> I know I could go to the corner drugstore and get a whole bag of menthol-eucalyptus drops for half the price, but this stuff really does give the sensation of &amp;#34;de-gunking&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I carefully husband my stocks, and when my younger son asked what he could bring back from Cambridge, I said Vocalzones, because they aren&#x27;t available in Australia.    </li>
            <li> Lasts a very long time and really helps.</li>
            <li> I wish it was on the local store shelves, but glad that I can at least order through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> They are black and quite pungent but perhaps that&#x27;s what&#x27;s needed to get the right response.</li>
            <li> With Vocalzone, my productivity is up and my general vocal stamina has improved.  </li>
            <li> I sing daily and my voice has to be clear for the programs I do.</li>
            <li> These tablets are the only ones that instantly clear everything from your throat and around the vocal cords, drying up mucus and etc and gives me the clearest voice!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am a facilitator and you can actually feel them clearly mucus from your vocal cords.  </li>
            <li> I sing in a choir and they are a big help in keeping my throat clear.  </li>
            <li> it it keeps things open and clear without the syrup coating your throat like a cough drop.</li>
            <li> Definitely helps keep my voice clear and</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon in all that you do to support the world wide nation</li>
            <li> I was looking for something smaller like the old \\&quot;HELPS\\&quot; licorice lozenges that are no longer sold.  </li>
            <li> The taste was slightly off putting at first</li>
            <li> so you become less aware of your fatigue, but they don&#x27;t prevent you from wearing out your voice.</li>
            <li> As an historical interpreter at a museum and a professional storyteller, I have used Vocalzone for several years.  </li>
            <li> These are okay, not excellent.&lt;br /&gt;Taste is not good!</li>
            <li> No side effects noticed, no problems experiences, other than the problem that, until I found them on Amazon, I was forced to play the miser and suffer for a week or two until I was sure I needed them.  </li>
            <li> A lot of all-day seminars which really wear down one&#x27;s throat.  </li>
            <li> In 2006, I was in Cornwall, researching a book (still not written) when a distant relative who lives there introduced me to this product in a pub when I could barely drink my beer, thanks to a wretched cough that had followed me around Athens (where it developed), Kefallonia, assorted other Greek islands, Vienna and Britain.  </li>
            <li> They seem to be hard to impossible to find, so am very happy Amazon is selling them !!</li>
            <li> keeps my vocal cords loose and my throat clear...</li>
            <li> But it didn&#x27;t take very long to receive at all, and it was well worth waiting a few extra days for.</li>
            <li> These little nasties really help a sore throat.</li>
            <li> Taste is so bad that the results must be good.  </li>
            <li> The down side: they&#x27;re black, so make sure they&#x27;re not front &amp; center when you&#x27;re wide open.  </li>
            <li> and I find these lozenges to be very helpful, specially if you&#x27;re voice is a little tired.</li>
            <li> I think it helps voice, but it is not very good tasting, and its hot.</li>
            <li> it actually works and helped me big time toward the end of a long performance recently.  </li>
            <li> It is long lasting</li>
            <li> This truly is a life saver, especially when I have a long day of performing...</li>
            <li> I bought these during a winter when the forced hot air was blowing.</li>
            <li> I am Australian, but I travel quite a bit by air, and often seem to get a dry, persistent cough.  </li>
            <li> I am a pianist/singer and wanted to try some different products because my voice gets dry after a couple of sets.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased probably half a dozen boxes so far and will continue to purchase this product.  </li>
            <li> Extraordinary support for tired singing voice.  </li>
            <li> This year I figured I&#x27;d try something specifically for singers, and these little babies really did the trick - they worked so well that other people in the group who sing ALL the time kept mooching them off me.</li>
            <li> I write about science, so I am severely sceptical about herbal remedies and New Age junk (don&#x27;t eat the green crystals, they aren&#x27;t ripe), but this one works on dry, self-priming coughs.    </li>
            <li> Years ago, when I played in bands, we used little plastic squeeze bottles of Lavoris spray as a way to clear our throats for singing -- we wouldn&#x27;t think of going onstage to sing without our Lavoris.</li>
            <li> I ignored it for quite a long time.</li>
            <li> Well lets just say that I could have kicked myself for having waited that long to try it out.</li>
            <li> these are my go-to for long strenuous days in the vocal booth.</li>
            <li> These lozenges are wonderfully-soothing for the throat when speaking for long periods.  </li>
            <li> Anyone wishing to get these must prepare for a long time before they arrive.</li>
            <li> Just plain old slippery elm by itself was not working for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to mention the product, due to the ad for the product above.</li>
            <li> My band performs three-hour shows and other than an occasional sip of honey whiskey, VOCALZONE gets and keeps my vocals in the zone throughout.</li>
            <li> If I have a problem with hoarseness or dry mouth when I need to make a presentation, I just tuck one of these in the side of my cheek.</li>
            <li> dentist diagnosed me with dry mouth.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> How could you NOT live without these?</li>
            <li> They last a long time and I can sometimes keep a small piece in the back of my mouth to draw on throughout.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now purchased several boxes and pass them on to other performers in my group!</li>
            <li> I sing a lot and when I have a bit of irritation in my throat due to allergies or post nasal drip, these really help to keep me from clearing my throat and further irritating it.</li>
            <li> They help my throat deal with the pain, and keep it from getting to dry and hoarse!</li>
            <li> very dry and</li>
            <li> especially so when I&#x27;m feeling a little under the weather.</li>
            <li> the only one I got a little relief from -</li>
            <li> ; that you need if you&#x27;re afraid that your singing will sound raspy or phlegm-y.  </li>
            <li> Be careful or you could damage your voice.</li>
            <li> It faster than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Not much of a taste- which is a plus in my opinion</li>
            <li> One day, when I was desperate since I had a big show a few days later, and my voice was almost gone, I decided to give this a try, especially since I couldn&#x27;t even practice much...</li>
            <li> I do not find them to be unpleasant or strongly flavored myself.</li>
            <li> They have little taste, so they don&#x27;t detract from what you are eating (or drinking!), and my distant cousin told me that choristers (like her) just slip one at the back of their mouths when performing.  </li>
            <li> They taste a little weird, but not bad.  </li>
            <li> No matter the situation, a little soreness from speaking or a cold - these little power-houses will fix you right up and keep you clear.</li>
            <li> days (usually at the end of the week) where my voice was too fatigued to function properly.  </li>
            <li> it tastes sort of like a peppermint jujubee, and has similar consistency and is small.  </li>
            <li> and then the recipient will marvel at how well his voice has been restored and wish that Vocalzone would work on the other symptoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried sprays and other lozenges.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other solutions and</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are deceptively small but last and work.</li>
            <li> Very bitter and medicine-like.</li>
            <li> Menthol certainly has medicinal properties, especially when being down with a cold, or flu.</li>
            <li> I lose my voice when a cold occurs and this soothes really really well!!  </li>
            <li> So was hard to get voice back.</li>
            <li> I discovered these lozenges several years ago when I was on a choir trip in England and my voice went wonky during the flight over there.  </li>
            <li> the benefits behind it is what keeps your voice clear and your throat</li>
            <li> only complaint is that they are not sold in the USA</li>
            <li> Being a professional singer, its a challenge at times to sing when I&#x27;ve lost my voice, or if my voice is tired &amp; hoarse.</li>
            <li> I have tried Throat Coat, throat sprays, menthol candy, sour candy...</li>
            <li> saying they taste like black licorice or anise.</li>
            <li> THE MEDICINE IS COLOR BLACK ONE</li>
            <li> I sing with a group at Christmas, and since it&#x27;s the only time of year I do that, my voice needs some serious help making it through the season.</li>
            <li> less irritated.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing</li>
            <li> The box was crushed and the foil broken open with the pastilles exposed.  </li>
            <li> I ran a week long service and preached hard for 1 day and five nights.  </li>
            <li> (coincidentally, the first time i used them I had a cold).</li>
            <li> Whether it is allergies or a cold, when the least bit of congestion appears Vocalzone allows me to have full use of my voice.  </li>
            <li> They are also small enough to slip to the side in your mouth, where they can dissolve slowly and not interfere with your speech.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a vocalist I&#x27;m always looking for something that can help on those days when it&#x27;s a little rusty in the pipes.</li>
            <li> One week when my voice was raspy these little Vocalzone lozengenes got me through.</li>
            <li> This product allows you to continue to sing a little longer and opens up chest.  </li>
            <li> but it helps a little.</li>
            <li> I was not very confident that it would work, but it did.  </li>
            <li> A must if you sing or speak after a fatty or sugary meal.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a performer/singer and when I was seeing a voice therapist, it was heavily suggested that I stay away from any menthol, or alcohol based lozenges.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an Aloe Vera Gel based product for a few years.</li>
            <li> By fluke, someone at one of my shows gave this product, along with a few others, to me.</li>
            <li> but you get used to it after a few.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years and have found nothing else</li>
            <li> As I recall- delivery was less than a week!</li>
            <li> Lost my voice twice during late winter due to flu.</li>
            <li> NOT TRUE!</li>
            <li> Powerful relief for tired vocal chords, or when your throat is reacting to allergies or a cold.</li>
            <li> When your voice is getting tired and dry these will do the trick.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use to see if I can get past a three star review.</li>
            <li> I use it when my voice feels strained and it usually soothes my throat and helps recover quicker.</li>
            <li> Because they&#x27;re small, I can keep one in my mouth while singing.</li>
            <li> I usually need to use 2 of them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It helps moisture your throat but also seemed to help me avoid the excessive throat</li>
            <li> I like that they will stay in one place and not more around.</li>
            <li> It game me a slight relief from hoarse throat, about an hour or two.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product did help clear the mucus out of my throat somewhat and the taste wasn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Every person I&#x27;ve given some to has been ecstatic with the result - the only complaint comes if the loss of voice or raspiness is a symptom of a cold or flu</li>
            <li> Not thrilled with the taste, but I didn&#x27;t buy it for the taste.  </li>
            <li> but I slowly got used to its bitterness.</li>
            <li> was incredibly slow, which was problematic because I am used to two day shipping with Prime.  </li>
            <li> product if you are serious singer you will not mind the taste when it saves your performance.</li>
            <li> I never go into a performance or even a serious rehearsal without them.</li>
            <li> posted similar review for Throat Discs because I purchased these three items all at once hoping for a relief since I was suffering with my throat so badly.</li>
            <li> It has Myrrh in it which is not a good tasting mineral but</li>
            <li> I mean, my voice couldn&#x27;t get any worse, so</li>
            <li> Because I sing, sometimes I feel hoarse or have a tired voice.  </li>
            <li> However, sorry to say, I don&#x27;t like the taste of the lozenges, and they are too thick to stay in the mouth while speaking or singing.  </li>
            <li> Seriously you won&#x27;t regret trying this product!</li>
            <li> taste a little weird, but not too bad.  </li>
            <li> I could barely get through it they taste so nasty.</li>
            <li> : I have not tried them for a sore or infected throat, as I am rarely ill, but I don&#x27;t think that is their intended purpose -- although they may provide some relief in that case too.)</li>
            <li> I typically pay 15$ a box here in the States which is just insane.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews talking about the horrible taste, but I ignored it because I tried pretty awful tasting medicine in my life and endured it.</li>
            <li> So a friend of mine introduced me to the vocalzone pills and since I was really desperate</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give them 5 stars, but I wasn&#x27;t too crazy about the taste.</li>
            <li> Frankly I find the slippery elm lozenges much worse tasting !!  </li>
            <li> It helps, but not like the &amp;#34;Voice&amp;#34; from Sprouts, which is very expensive if you use it everytime you have a performance.</li>
            <li> The taste, not so bad.</li>
            <li> I did NOT find the taste bad at all...</li>
            <li> I am a singer who has a bad habit of smoking</li>
            <li> Bad:  </li>
            <li> Lets face it, about 90% of throat products are of a menthol and or alchohol base.</li>
            <li> BUT I&#x27;M REALLY HATE THE TASTE OF IT .</li>
            <li> AND THE TASTE IS AWFUL .</li>
            <li> Sort of like a terrible cough drop.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s burn my throat and the taste awful</li>
            <li> It tasted terrible!</li>
            <li> Amazingly awful taste.</li>
            <li> I started using these when I had a series of nasty sinus infections.</li>
            <li> And they taste terrible.  </li>
            <li> Stuff tastes nasty!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Vocalzone tastes really really horrible</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I do a lot of public speaking in my business.  A lot of all-day seminars which really wear down one&#x27;s throat.  Many times, the only way I can get through the day with a clear voice is because of my Vocalzones.  These things are amazing, and they are effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that Tom Jones is the official spokesperson for Vocalzones should tell you something.  I don&#x27;t match that man&#x27;s intensity, but for anyone who is a singer, speaker, or uses their voice for a living - these should be in your pocket.  No matter the situation, a little soreness from speaking or a cold - these little power-houses will fix you right up and keep you clear.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff if you are a singer!</li>
            <li> I discovered these lozenges several years ago when I was on a choir trip in England and my voice went wonky during the flight over there.  I have been using them sparingly ever since, for fear of running out.  Now I know that I can get them in this country, so the concern is over.  They are the best antidote to throat problems I ever used--way better than anything I tried before.</li>
            <li> To be honest I got it 3 days ago after I ordered it 2 weeks ago cause I&#x27;m a singer and I had lost my voice before of vocal abuse. So a friend of mine introduced me to the vocalzone pills and since I was really desperate I thought I would give it a try so I ordered 3 packets. Fortunately I got my voice back before I got the pills but I&#x27;ve taken 3 so far and I can feel it clearing everything inside my mouth(nose, throat etc) I find it pretty refreshing and I&#x27;m gonna still use them. I&#x27;ll post again if I ever get voiceless again and tell my experience with the pills.</li>
            <li> These things work miracles!  There have been a number of times that I have been doing voice-over work and my voice started to go out.  A producer offered me a Vocalzone.  I was not very confident that it would work, but it did.  It was AWESOME!  Within about 10 minutes, my voice felt stronger than it had before I started the session.  Great stuff.  I will always have some on hand when I know I will need to be speaking.</li>
            <li> Now I can hit the high notes, no problem, and they taste good too.  I recommend them for singers and speakers.</li>
            <li> I cannot live without these on gig nights!  They do everything they&#x27;re supposed to do!  I&#x27;ve seen complaints on the taste, but I don&#x27;t mind it one bit, they WORK!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly care for the taste. It doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything spectacular for my throat which gets irritated by excessive talking or meds.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Vocal Zone lozenges for about two years now.  I use the nights when I sing, about one per set.  They sooth the throat and help my voice stay nice &amp; clear.  Jeff King</li>
            <li> just bought more of these,...they are excellent.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product when I was in acting school many years ago. It was created for the operatic tenor, Enrico Caruso, and helped with actor&#x27;s laryngitis. I still use it to clear my vocal chords. It&#x27;s not 100% effective, but it&#x27;s the best such product there is.</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant to try this because of the price and because it is shipped from the UK.  But it didn&#x27;t take very long to receive at all, and it was well worth waiting a few extra days for. If I have a problem with hoarseness or dry mouth when I need to make a presentation, I just tuck one of these in the side of my cheek. Lasts a very long time and really helps. I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> A great product and I am so glad that I can get them online. I sing a lot and when I have a bit of irritation in my throat due to allergies or post nasal drip, these really help to keep me from clearing my throat and further irritating it. My vocal teacher recommended them and I use them as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of my singing friends do not like the flavor - saying they taste like black licorice or anise. I do not find them to be unpleasant or strongly flavored myself.</li>
            <li> while the taste is acquired, these pastilles work excellently. I&#x27;ve even used them for a recent chest cold/sore throat and they worked better than any cough drops I had. will def use again.</li>
            <li> I have been using Vocalzone for years; either bringing it from the UK or even specialty pharmacies in NYC. I typically pay 15$ a box here in the States which is just insane. Here, the seller offers the identical product (totally fresh stock---no expired boxes) for a fraction of the cost. It arrived before I even remember I purchased it---very fast shipping. I highly recommend this product and most definitely this seller!</li>
            <li> Effective, affordable and downright tasty, these lozenges are highly recommended.  I am a voice-over engineer.  In a given week, I narrate and master between 45 - 60 pages of copy and dialogue.  Before adding Vocalzone as part of my regimen, I would regularly schedule &amp;#34;recoup&amp;#34; days (usually at the end of the week) where my voice was too fatigued to function properly.  With Vocalzone, my productivity is up and my general vocal stamina has improved.  I can&#x27;t say enough nice things about them, I only wish that I can get them in domestic (USA) shops.</li>
            <li> Vocalzone is just what is needed to get your throat back in condition for singing! The taste, not so bad. This is a great product. The fact that I could purchase this from a seller in the states...BONUS!!!</li>
            <li> These lozenges are great for clearing the throat as well as soothing. Can&#x27;t say much for the taste, though. I use them before singing, and they do help.</li>
            <li> I Bought these Vocal zones because I&#x27;ve seen the works of them, great product, works extremely well, I will be buying these very soon again. You will not regret buying these. Thanks to Amazon in all that you do to support the world wide nation</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been singing for about 25 years and I find these lozenges to be very helpful, specially if you&#x27;re voice is a little tired.</li>
            <li> Years ago, when I played in bands, we used little plastic squeeze bottles of Lavoris spray as a way to clear our throats for singing -- we wouldn&#x27;t think of going onstage to sing without our Lavoris. That original product formulation has disappeared, it seems, so I have been looking for an &amp;#34;instant&amp;#34; throat-clearing product to replace it ever since. These pastilles are great for the purpose: They work quickly, and as others have commented, have a cooling menthol effect that goes throughout the nasal passages (not a purely good thing, but it&#x27;s pleasant). They have a strong, medicinal taste -- again, not unpleasant but definitely not fruity or sweet. Most important, however, they clear and settle the throat/voice for speaking or singing purposes -- that means more resonance, less nasal or congested voicing. Since I&#x27;m more likely these days to be standing in front of a PowerPoint presentation than a Fender amplifier, the public-speaking help they lend I particularly appreciate.</li>
            <li> This product did help clear the mucus out of my throat somewhat and the taste wasn&#x27;t bad. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> It just numbs your throat. Be careful or you could damage your voice. Use correctly, these can be great.</li>
            <li> I put this product to the test about a week ago.  I ran a week long service and preached hard for 1 day and five nights.  On the fourth day, I completed loss my voice.  I sipped on hot tea with lemon and honey and let a vocal zone disolve repeatedly in my mouth.  The next night, day five, I was strong enough to both preach and sing.  I am not yet completely sold on this product, but I do think it is worth a try.  I will continue to use to see if I can get past a three star review.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic...what a find !!  If you are a singer or speaker, this is the one !  I purchased it with some hesitation as many comments were complaining about the taste.  Now that I&#x27;ve tried it, all I can say is that if your only looking for a candy to suck on, go to supermarket and forget this.  However, if you want something that is sort of &amp;#34;medicinal tasting&amp;#34; that will actually  help your throat, try this.  I did NOT find the taste bad at all...actually refreshing...it tastes sort of like a peppermint jujubee, and has similar consistency and is small.  Frankly I find the slippery elm lozenges much worse tasting !!  I am very grateful to have discovered this product and plan to buy many more !!!  They seem to be hard to impossible to find, so am very happy Amazon is selling them !! Thanks !</li>
            <li> This is a very effective voice clarifier.  It is long lasting and I found it worked best when used with a spray.  A must if you sing or speak after a fatty or sugary meal.  Seems to clean the vocal cords.</li>
            <li> Good product. It is not a candy however. It works.</li>
            <li> My husband, an entertainer, loves Vocalzone.  We live in Las Vegas...very dry and Vocalzone keeps his throat moist.&lt;br /&gt;He never sings without them.</li>
            <li> They were okay.  I didn&#x27;t like the taste but I didn&#x27;t want them for the taste.  They opened up my sinuses temporarily but I didn&#x27;t get the throat soothing I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Great find from the UK.  Very fast shipping. My son&#x27;s job has him talking hours straight.  This has helped him from getting hoarse and losing his voice.</li>
            <li> Fantastic for singers and speakers.&lt;br /&gt;Great to have just before warm up and better the day after you&#x27;ve been belting out the tunes to recover your voice. does what is says on the packet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oddly they smell like weed when you first pop em out of the pack? no complaints mind just an observation :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side effects include singing awesomely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are many that use this product and it helps. I gave it a one star on top, because I had to put something in. I&#x27;m a performer/singer and when I was seeing a voice therapist, it was heavily suggested that I stay away from any menthol, or alcohol based lozenges. That kind of shot me down, because like most other performers I&#x27;ve talked with,all concurred that they kept a supply of mentholated products. Lets face it, about 90% of throat products are of a menthol and or alchohol base. Menthol certainly has medicinal properties, especially when being down with a cold, or flu. However, I only use these products externally. Since I was a very young...a LLONNGG time ago, my Mom use to rub Vicks on me. It smelled good, and I use to sleep well. To this day, I still use it. So menthol has it&#x27;s advantages. So, if there are any singers, lecturer&#x27;s, teachers reading this, perhaps when you get a minute or two, do some research on the effects of products that help or hinder throat use. I&#x27;ve been using an Aloe Vera Gel based product for a few years. I spray it before, and mostly during my performances, coupled with constant sips of water. It been working great. I&#x27;m not going to mention the product, due to the ad for the product above. If anyone would like to email me I&#x27;d gladly share the name of the spray and associated products. Much success to all who use their throat for a living.....Regards.....Frank JC  my email is frankjcosta@yahoo.com</li>
            <li> THE MEDICINE IS COLOR BLACK ONE AND THE TASTE IS AWFUL . IT&#x27;S COMES TO ME ON TIME IN ORIGINAL BOX FAST MAIL .I DON&#x27;T LIKE THE TASTE OF IT. IT&#x27;S JUST LIKE THE CANDY FOR THROAT SALES AT THE COUNTER OF THE STORES. I AM TAKING IT AS NEED NOW BUT I&#x27;M REALLY HATE THE TASTE OF IT .</li>
            <li> This is great. It has a good flavor and there is not a sweet taste.  I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> it smooths and lubricates your throat!</li>
            <li> I swear by this product!!  It has saved my voice so many times!!!  I highly recommend it before and after singing...</li>
            <li> As a vocalist I&#x27;m always looking for something that can help on those days when it&#x27;s a little rusty in the pipes. Vocalzone was recommended to me by someone who speaks regularly. At first taste they honestly don&#x27;t taste that great. But once they start working that improves. They kept my throat clear and soothed some of the soreness right away. I definitely will have some of these on the road with me!</li>
            <li> Seems to work!...&lt;br /&gt;An aid for speakers, actors, singers and everyone who needs to rely on having their voice ready when necessary.</li>
            <li> I have used the product before.  It works for me when I prepare to sing.  I would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> Being a professional singer, its a challenge at times to sing when I&#x27;ve lost my voice, or if my voice is tired &amp; hoarse. By fluke, someone at one of my shows gave this product, along with a few others, to me. I ignored it for quite a long time. One day, when I was desperate since I had a big show a few days later, and my voice was almost gone, I decided to give this a try, especially since I couldn&#x27;t even practice much...I mean, my voice couldn&#x27;t get any worse, so I decided to take the risk. Well lets just say that I could have kicked myself for having waited that long to try it out. It worked wonders!! Now whenever I go for a show, I make sure I always have these with me. Truly a lifesaver at times!</li>
            <li> I sing with a group at Christmas, and since it&#x27;s the only time of year I do that, my voice needs some serious help making it through the season. This year I figured I&#x27;d try something specifically for singers, and these little babies really did the trick - they worked so well that other people in the group who sing ALL the time kept mooching them off me. Needless to say, I ordered more for next year.  The beauty part? You can sing with them in your mouth!  The down side: they&#x27;re black, so make sure they&#x27;re not front &amp; center when you&#x27;re wide open.  Bottom line: if you sing or speak a lot and need some throat-soothing help, Vocalzone will get the job done.</li>
            <li> This item shipped very very fast! Got it 2 weeks before planned!!!! I am a singer who has a bad habit of smoking so i needed something to keep my voice at peak condition- BINGO!!! Vocalzone is awesome! Clears my throat so i can sing like a bird!!! Thanks BritishGoodies!!!! You guys rock!</li>
            <li> I think it helps voice, but it is not very good tasting, and its hot. however I never like anything uncimfortable, I WILL USE IT IF IT SOLVES a problem</li>
            <li> I am a teacher and I also sing at church. I use it when my voice feels strained and it usually soothes my throat and helps recover quicker.</li>
            <li> these things are epic! work wonders!</li>
            <li> I am Australian, but I travel quite a bit by air, and often seem to get a dry, persistent cough.  I write about science, so I am severely sceptical about herbal remedies and New Age junk (don&#x27;t eat the green crystals, they aren&#x27;t ripe), but this one works on dry, self-priming coughs.    In 2006, I was in Cornwall, researching a book (still not written) when a distant relative who lives there introduced me to this product in a pub when I could barely drink my beer, thanks to a wretched cough that had followed me around Athens (where it developed), Kefallonia, assorted other Greek islands, Vienna and Britain.  It worked, just like that.    They have little taste, so they don&#x27;t detract from what you are eating (or drinking!), and my distant cousin told me that choristers (like her) just slip one at the back of their mouths when performing.  I carefully husband my stocks, and when my younger son asked what he could bring back from Cambridge, I said Vocalzones, because they aren&#x27;t available in Australia.    No side effects noticed, no problems experiences, other than the problem that, until I found them on Amazon, I was forced to play the miser and suffer for a week or two until I was sure I needed them.  Bless you, Mr Amazon!</li>
            <li> While becoming vocally tired during the rehearsal period for my show, I was searching for a good,  reliable lozenge to soothe my throat. Just plain old slippery elm by itself was not working for me any more so I decided on vocalzone due to the reviews. It was definitely worth it. The taste was slightly off putting at first but I slowly got used to its bitterness. I always have it in handy.</li>
            <li> I am a pianist/singer and wanted to try some different products because my voice gets dry after a couple of sets.  I must say that I was pleasantly surprised by this product...it actually works and helped me big time toward the end of a long performance recently.  This does not come without a price, however....I will tell you that it tastes awful...horrible.  Sort of like a terrible cough drop.  But it does work and I will continue to use it when needed.</li>
            <li> I use these everytime I speak and the results are unmatched with anything else.  Highly recommended!  You can actually feel them working!</li>
            <li> As an historical interpreter at a museum and a professional storyteller, I have used Vocalzone for several years.  Whether it is allergies or a cold, when the least bit of congestion appears Vocalzone allows me to have full use of my voice.  Great product that I recommend to anyone who needs to keep their voice clear.</li>
            <li> Love these throat things I had to sing for a special song and my throat was out from worship took two of these and was able to hit all high notes</li>
            <li> So I am recovering from severe acid reflux, and these pills have been a miracle for me. They help my throat deal with the pain, and keep it from getting to dry and hoarse! They really are amazing, and are totally worth every penny. The best way I can describe them is like a Halls drop, but ten times for intensive. They&#x27;ve got a licorice taste to them, but it&#x27;s not too overwhelming. I totally recommend!</li>
            <li> These are NOT made to be the best tasting but they WORK. I had a sore throat one weekend and had to sing for several performances and this was what got me through. It has Myrrh in it which is not a good tasting mineral but the benefits behind it is what keeps your voice clear and your throat less irritated.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing product if you are serious singer you will not mind the taste when it saves your performance.</li>
            <li> I know I could go to the corner drugstore and get a whole bag of menthol-eucalyptus drops for half the price, but this stuff really does give the sensation of &amp;#34;de-gunking&amp;#34; that you need if you&#x27;re afraid that your singing will sound raspy or phlegm-y.  I saw the package in a &amp;#34;backstage&amp;#34; video; had never heard of it, but thought I&#x27;d try it ... used it for singing last night, and was more than satisfied, for whatever reason.  ---  I do intend to re-order when I need more. And I was also impressed that delivery from the U.K. was much faster than expected.</li>
            <li> I saw this in a U2 music video (can&#x27;t remember which one) and was so lucky to find it here. After my tonsillectomy recovery and getting back into singing...these were a blessing. I can do about 2 hours of rehearsal on one lozenge. Apart from always keeping hydrated, these certainly help producing a clear sound. I&#x27;d give them 5 stars, but I wasn&#x27;t too crazy about the taste. It&#x27;s bearable, but not my favorite. Maybe a cherry flavor? :)</li>
            <li> So grateful to have these again!  The package arrived for Great Britain a little battered but the product was not damaged.  It faster than I expected.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Lost my voice twice during late winter due to flu. Work customer service phones many hours, plus do some singing. So was hard to get voice back. Sure don&#x27;t taste good, but these gems really helped me get through performances and keep my voice during  cs shifts. Thank you Vocalzone! Planning to order more...</li>
            <li> These are required in my life.  I am a ventriloquist and so I can&#x27;t have a sore throat.  They are the best.</li>
            <li> I sing daily and my voice has to be clear for the programs I do. My daughter who is also a vocalist, gave me a box of Vocalzone for Christmas. One week when my voice was raspy these little Vocalzone lozengenes got me through. Soothing, penetrating and not too sweet. Because they&#x27;re small, I can keep one in my mouth while singing.</li>
            <li> I sing in a chorus and these help me keep my voice sounding great.&lt;br /&gt;They taste a little weird, but not too bad.  They stick to my gum under my upper lip and i just keep them there&lt;br /&gt;and let them melt away while i&#x27;m singing.</li>
            <li> Got these on recommendation.  Strong tasting but have good ingredients to do the job.  Got through a vocal rehearsal during hay fever season.  Looking forward to using them to get through some upcoming performances.</li>
            <li> greatest in the world</li>
            <li> I use these all the time.  When your voice is getting tired and dry these will do the trick.  They get you through the day if you use your voice a lot.</li>
            <li> Although I was skeptical at first, I can honestly say that Vocalzone helps my throat and sinuses get ready to sing and especially so when I&#x27;m feeling a little under the weather. The benefits of proper rest and a good warmup can&#x27;t be beat but I&#x27;m still convinced I&#x27;m better off having some Vocalzone around then not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the taste? It&#x27;s not bad… not great… but not bad.</li>
            <li> I have tried Throat Coat, throat sprays, menthol candy, sour candy... Etc. Nothing compares to VocalZones. There have been times where I was too hoarse to even speak, popped a vocalzone in, and I sang perfectly fine. Seriously you won&#x27;t regret trying this product! I tell all of my singer friends about them and pass them out regularly. Every singer that I have given one to cannot believe the clarity that it brings to their throat and voice. Epic product!</li>
            <li> Refreshing and healing! My throat feels great after I have one of these! I get one just when I feel my throat funny or about to be sore. They work! Thank you!</li>
            <li> This product is excellent and met my expectations fully.</li>
            <li> No more effective than cough drops, but more expensive. I won&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
            <li> I take one of these about 30 minutes prior to using the THROAT DISCS.</li>
            <li> They really work.&lt;br /&gt;My dentist diagnosed me with dry mouth.&lt;br /&gt;With my singing and speaking a lot this has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s burn my throat and the taste awful&lt;br /&gt;And make my voice the same.&lt;br /&gt;If the taste is less strong it would be better..</li>
            <li> awesome product will order more, it truly smooth your vocal and like to use it every time I need it giving me good results.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  I purchased because I was having problems with my voice fading in and out.  This product allows you to continue to sing a little longer and opens up chest.  Great product.</li>
            <li> As a singer, I take one of these right before I go out to sing! These tablets are the only ones that instantly clear everything from your throat and around the vocal cords, drying up mucus and etc and gives me the clearest voice!!&lt;br /&gt;I use this product along with drinking warm water and vocal warmups and my voice is ready to go especially really early Sunday mornings at 8 AM! I also use them after I sing to recoop! Awesome product!&lt;br /&gt;Definetly would buy from this person again!! Super fast service and I needed quite a few boxes quickly, and they had them!! thanks!!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product. Because I sing, sometimes I feel hoarse or have a tired voice.  This truly is a life saver, especially when I have a long day of performing...</li>
            <li> great product, taste bad at first but you get used to it after a few. very cool sensation</li>
            <li> These little nasties really help a sore throat. They are black and quite pungent but perhaps that&#x27;s what&#x27;s needed to get the right response. I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I thought it would help my voice, since it gets raspy very easily and because it was especially marked for singing. BIG NO NO. As soon as I put it in my mouth I thought I was going to throw up. It tasted terrible! I read the reviews talking about the horrible taste, but I ignored it because I tried pretty awful tasting medicine in my life and endured it. I couldn&#x27;t leave it in my mouth for more than five minutes without spitting it out. It helped with my voice, but in the end, I couldn&#x27;t take it.</li>
            <li> These really open up your pipes.  They smell kinda weird, but it really gets you ready to sing, especially if you don&#x27;t have a lot of time to warm up.  These are the best vocal lozenges I&#x27;ve used and will continue to buy them as long as I can get them.</li>
            <li> Amazingly effective. Amazingly awful taste. Lol</li>
            <li> Just what the doctor ordered</li>
            <li> I have been using these for years. they are excellent.Great that they are on Amazon so I don&#x27;t have to shlep through the city.</li>
            <li> I tried one. I could barely get through it they taste so nasty. After the torcher of trying it. I felt no relief or results.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product... Heard about these from a friend, decided to try for myself. Now I always make sure I take them before a live show. Each pastille lasts for about an hour, for me. Very good stuff guys (thumbs up)</li>
            <li> Works wonders when you have a cough!  Taste is so bad that the results must be good.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Really works!  Our son is a singer and auditions for many things and sometimes his voice becomes hoarse and he tried these and they do help!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered some respiratory ailments and subsequent long-standing cough over the last year.  Plus, I have hay fever, so sometimes, my throat just feels wrecked.  I pop one of these in my mouth and everything feels great and I&#x27;m able to sing again (yea!).</li>
            <li> These are terrific! I am a facilitator and you can actually feel them clearly mucus from your vocal cords.  I keep a box with me all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every person I&#x27;ve given some to has been ecstatic with the result - the only complaint comes if the loss of voice or raspiness is a symptom of a cold or flu and then the recipient will marvel at how well his voice has been restored and wish that Vocalzone would work on the other symptoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that they are not sold in the USA and so I have to plan well ahead all the time to keep them on hand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several products for helping with my vocal chords during my often demanding gigs.  I&#x27;ve tried sprays and other lozenges.  Nothing I&#x27;ve tried works better for me at least, than Vocalzone.  I wish it was on the local store shelves, but glad that I can at least order through Amazon.  I&#x27;ve purchased probably half a dozen boxes so far and will continue to purchase this product.  My band performs three-hour shows and other than an occasional sip of honey whiskey, VOCALZONE gets and keeps my vocals in the zone throughout.</li>
            <li> I started using these when I had a series of nasty sinus infections. My husband is a singer &amp; also likes them. Not nasty tasting, very soothing &amp; are more effective than any cough drops.</li>
            <li> I love these.  I sing in a choir and they are a big help in keeping my throat clear.  I usually need to use 2 of them.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I have been using Vocalzone since Meloids was discontinued.  Every singer or public speaker should know about and use this product</li>
            <li> My &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; lozenge. I use my voice professionally. Powerful relief for tired vocal chords, or when your throat is reacting to allergies or a cold. Clears your sinuses and your voice!</li>
            <li> a must have for the voice pro.  these are my go-to for long strenuous days in the vocal booth.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Came super fast!</li>
            <li> These are great for the voice if you are a singer.  I am not overly fond of the taste, but they work so well I use them anyway.  My husband also uses them, and he likes the taste so I am sure i am just picky.  They definitely perform as advertised.</li>
            <li> I love these.  A friend who is a singer suggested them.  I am not a singer but suffer from dry throat and severe PND and this helps tremendously to keep my throat moist throughout the night.</li>
            <li> As a singer, having a clear head is one of the most valuable assets!  I used Vocalzones the first time after having an allergy attack about two hours before having to go on stage!  My head and throat cleared within minutes and I was able to sing clearly and without hesitation.  Life savers!  I&#x27;ve now purchased several boxes and pass them on to other performers in my group!</li>
            <li> These lozenges are wonderfully-soothing for the throat when speaking for long periods.  As a hypnotherapist, my voice would often become raspy after speaking for an hour at a time for multiple sessions, even at low volume and at a comfortable pitch.  It was important to me to avoid the necessity of clearing my throat repeatedly while talking, so that my client would not become distracted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many types of cough drops and throat sprays for this purpose, but nothing has worked as well as these lozenges.  They have a pleasant taste, neither too sweet nor too strong.  They are also small enough to slip to the side in your mouth, where they can dissolve slowly and not interfere with your speech.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Note: I have not tried them for a sore or infected throat, as I am rarely ill, but I don&#x27;t think that is their intended purpose -- although they may provide some relief in that case too.)</li>
            <li> I tried this product but can see no improvement in my voice. And they taste terrible.  It is like sucking on a clot of dirt.  Better off with some good old reliable Halls.</li>
            <li> use this everytime i sing at church...wouldn&#x27;t catch me onstage without it :0) keeps my vocal cords loose and my throat clear...&lt;br /&gt;thank you vocalzone!</li>
            <li> I got this for all the speakers and singers on our staff.  We like the way it it keeps things open and clear without the syrup coating your throat like a cough drop.</li>
            <li> Really does heal the throat quickly!! I lose my voice when a cold occurs and this soothes really really well!!  will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Good for a short practice session but more endurance singing still requires more moisture- lukewarm pineapple juice works just as well</li>
            <li> I bought these for choir and they are just what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;It helps moisture your throat but also seemed to help me avoid the excessive throat clearing.&lt;br /&gt;I will order again. I definitely prefer these to cough drops!</li>
            <li> I was unable to tell any difference after using this product although a good friend utilizes it and says it helps him as an Elvis Tribute Artist.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Husband uses them as needed when he sings on church worship team.</li>
            <li> It helps, but not like the &amp;#34;Voice&amp;#34; from Sprouts, which is very expensive if you use it everytime you have a performance.</li>
            <li> Very strong, but works.</li>
            <li> These are great, especially for singers.  They taste a little weird, but not bad.  They really clear out your throat.</li>
            <li> I got these because Marla Mindelle recommended them in a broadway.com video and they are awesome. They don&#x27;t taste very good but they work like a charm. T&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are somewhat numbing so you become less aware of your fatigue, but they don&#x27;t prevent you from wearing out your voice. It is important to be aware of the condition of voice and your limitations. If want something soothing, these are great.</li>
            <li> These Vocalzone Throat Pieces work really well. Not much of a taste- which is a plus in my opinion and so very convenient to carry. I was impressed with the speed of delivery being that they are from the UK. As I recall- delivery was less than a week!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I am a professional singer and these help keep my throat lubricated.&lt;br /&gt;Going to try and see if i can get them in bulk.</li>
            <li> Timely shipping and Works great! Thank you</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it does and keeps your throat clear and sound for anything from speaking to singing.</li>
            <li> As an announcer, I can&#x27;t go without my Vocalzone!  Definitely helps keep my voice clear and my throat from getting that &#x27;burned out&#x27; feeling at the end of the event.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these throat pastilles and highly recommend the to anyone who sings or does public speaking on a regular basis, is a teacher or someone who lectures regularly. They sure do taste strong, but they do work like a charm! For sure these Vocalzone Throat Pastilles really work (for me)!!! and others who I&#x27;ve known who have tried them.  Every once in a while I skip pushing the cheap button, and take 3, and voila my throat is always cleared with three. As well, every once in a while it takes 2.  Mostly though, it only takes 1.  Yes it is strong tasting, what really good medicine that works isn&#x27;t.  FYI it&#x27;s only in America where medicine is supposed to taste good, guess what, only the sugared down over chemicalized crap tastes good and sweet, but doesn&#x27;t work!  So pony up and take the real medicine for your health (like these), and you&#x27;ll be all the better for it!</li>
            <li> Works well, taste is bearable.</li>
            <li> I bought Vocalzone through Amazon, and it arrived in a timely manner.  However, sorry to say, I don&#x27;t like the taste of the lozenges, and they are too thick to stay in the mouth while speaking or singing.  I was looking for something smaller like the old \\&quot;HELPS\\&quot; licorice lozenges that are no longer sold.  This is purely a personal response and you don&#x27;t need to publish it unless you think it advisable.  The good thing about it is that I was able to try it without having to buy a large amount initially.</li>
            <li> The BEST remedy to help open up your head, clear your voice, and let you sing your BEST! I&#x27;ve tried soooo many things for my allergies, and then I pop one of these 15 minutes or so before I begin singing and everything just opens up :) Buy them!</li>
            <li> Great thank you wonderful seller</li>
            <li> The Good:  It game me a slight relief from hoarse throat, about an hour or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:  Stuff tastes nasty! Very bitter and medicine-like. I have to pop an altoid right after because I can only imagine what my breath smells like.</li>
            <li> Wow i love it, vocalzone is excellent !!!</li>
            <li> I use one right before I&#x27;ll be doing a long presentation before a large group were my voice can become fatigued after awhile. They last a long time and I can sometimes keep a small piece in the back of my mouth to draw on throughout.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have been using this product for a few years and have found nothing else that comparison to it. I like that they will stay in one place and not more around. Being a buyer vocalist, these are reliable and work.</li>
            <li> These are great for your voice but they don&#x27;t taste very good.  I suck on a lozenger about thirty minutes to an hour before I have to sing and sometimes in the middle of rehearsal.  It really helps.</li>
            <li> When I received my order, the box and the pastilles were damaged.  The box was crushed and the foil broken open with the pastilles exposed.  I did not open the box when it came.  I had it for maybe a week when i opened the envelope and realized the damaged goods.  Upon contact with the seller, I received an immediate response from Nancy.  I provided her details and a photo.  She instructed me to dispose of the damaged product and immediately requested a replacement.  The new box arrived today in tip top shape.  The throat drops are strong and do wonders for my dry throat.  Thank you to Nancy and to DirectKart for custom service like it should be!  I strongly recommend this product and this company.</li>
            <li> Extraordinary support for tired singing voice.  Started singing with a women&#x27;s acapella chorus and at age 62, these pastilles help me keep up with the 30-somethings.  Small enough to just kind of keep it somewhere in your mouth.  For me the beneficial effect lasts maybe 20-30 minutes.  I&#x27;ve tried other solutions and Vocalzone works best for me.  LOVE them.</li>
            <li> As described.  Flavor is &amp;#34;unusual.&amp;#34;  Not to my liking, but it is medicine, not candy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t realize that this shipped directy from the UK - shipping was incredibly slow, which was problematic because I am used to two day shipping with Prime.  Also my sore throat was almost healed by the time I received the item.</li>
            <li> I have found these to be excellent!  I never go into a performance or even a serious rehearsal without them.</li>
            <li> Really had hoped it would help my voice, but it didn&#x27;t.  It is a good product for the right person.</li>
            <li> yep.... that&#x27;s pretty much all i had to say. They work well. And they clear up my sinuses too :)</li>
            <li> This product is one of the best if you make your living singing. Although it does take time to receive it (it is shipped overseas) I wouldn&#x27;t be without it!</li>
            <li> Only thing that works!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product for a vocalist.  We have some onstage at all times.  The best that we have tried.</li>
            <li> Vocalzone is a great product, and it works! I think I found my solution to my voice and throat issues here! I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> These are okay, not excellent.&lt;br /&gt;Taste is not good!</li>
            <li> How could you NOT live without these? If I&#x27;m going on stage or giving a presentation or know that I&#x27;m going to be on the phone for a while, I always make sure to have these with me.</li>
            <li> I guess it helps if you have a raspy throat, but It didn&#x27;t fo much for m except clear up my sinus&#x27; so I could breathe a little better (coincidentally, the first time i used them I had a cold).</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness... if there is anything I regret is THIS PURCHASE!  SIMPLY PUT... IT DOES NOT WORK!  posted similar review for Throat Discs because I purchased these three items all at once hoping for a relief since I was suffering with my throat so badly. I said if one does not work... then probably the others might work. I am not paid to do this and I spent my own money to purchase these items therefore, I am giving an honest review and speaking the truth. I am a Christian and even if I was offered money to lie... I would NOT DO IT! This review it true and HONEST!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did such extensive research and read only the Amazon Verified since everyone said read only those reviews since the others might be paid to lie. The reviews were good but IT&#x27;S ALL A LIE! NOT TRUE! Throat Discs DOES NOT WORK AND SINGERS SAVING GRACE DOES NOT WORK EITHER... the only one I got a little relief from - and I said a &amp;#34;little&amp;#34; is vocalzone. I think  these are only made in Europe since the two times I purchased, they were shipped from there. I was able to sing a little after using these but not total help though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vocalzone tastes really really horrible but it helps a little. Anyone wishing to get these must prepare for a long time before they arrive. Mine came in from Europe each times I purchased. The other two and there is one more here that I cannot remember its name - that does not work either. I will try to find it and post the name. Consumers must know the truth and then decide whether they still want to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really really praying and hoping that these people who are posting these lies and who might be paid to do it should STOP! It is not right or good to do these things! A lie is a lie and a SIN!!</li>
            <li> The Followills swear by these, but I have firsthand knowledge that the best vocal coaches advise NOT to use them as the menthol dries out the vocal chords.  Must help Caleb&#x27;s voice be raspier ;)</li>
            <li> Soothing but like a halls cough drop</li>
            <li> I bought these during a winter when the forced hot air was blowing. They get rid of that post-nasal drip sounding throat. If you have a meeting or a presentation coming up, or talk on the phone a lot they work well. They take about 10 minutes to clear you up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are deceptively small but last and work.</li>
            <li> Not thrilled with the taste, but I didn&#x27;t buy it for the taste.  Works immediately.</li>
            <li> so who am I to argue. she uses her voice professionally. I use my voice to talk.  IT WORKS. NUFF  SAID</li>
            <li> VocalZone was recommended to us by a bluegrass band at a festival recently. I am so glad it was! I never go on stage now without it. I clears my throat and helps me sing with a much clearer voice.</li>
            <li> The flavor took me by surprise, as did the smell, and the texture, and the color. But these aren&#x27;t taken for pleasure and they get the job done. I pop one of these in half an hour or so before a performance and my throat is clear and healthy sounding by the time I go on stage!</li>
