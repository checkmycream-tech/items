            <li>The water pressure on this is great</li>
            <li>Waterpik is really a great company.  </li>
            <li>It has proven to be very effective.  </li>
            <li>After finishing the exam, the dentist commented on how great I was doing with my brushing and flossing and to keep up the good work.</li>
            <li>This is a must have for you clean freaks out there!!!</li>
            <li>I bought it at the suggestion of my dental hygienist and Waterpik does have a good name.  </li>
            <li>Good pressure</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>When it arrived, I absolutely loved this model.  </li>
            <li>Loved my Waterpik, would have given it a 5</li>
            <li>The battery life is good.  </li>
            <li>Battery life seems good as well.</li>
            <li>Good build quality.</li>
            <li>The Waterpik Water Flosser appears to be overly engineered, and not in a good way.</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended the Showerpick and I am very glad he did.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with it,</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Great alternative to the original Waterpik!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>I love my showerpik!</li>
            <li>your dendtist will love you!</li>
            <li>It was excellent at first......</li>
            <li>this product is great, so easy and convenient</li>
            <li>Easy to install, just great.</li>
            <li>Using this device in the shower is a much more pleasant option for me than flossing</li>
            <li>Easy install and works great.</li>
            <li>Great product, easy to use,</li>
            <li>It was easy to install, and it works great when it works.</li>
            <li>Great pressure &amp; easy to fill.</li>
            <li>Also, this works amazingly as a flosser.  </li>
            <li>Kudos to Amazon customer service, they were amazing.</li>
            <li>and I liked it</li>
            <li>This was a really nice purchase.  </li>
            <li>Nice product</li>
            <li>I liked the “laser cutter” as some others have described it.  </li>
            <li>People who are not that handy or not used to tightening plastic components onto metal fittings may end up breaking the product.</li>
            <li>The Waterpik  Showerpik does a nice job when working, after a couple of months the on-off swtich began sticking, making it difficlut to turn off......</li>
            <li>Without the connector the thing has no value.&lt;br /&gt;The design and quality is according to the popular SBWOY standard:&amp;#34;Should Break Within One Year, so we can sell another one&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>, I felt that it had to be of some kind of quality level.</li>
            <li>Nice to use</li>
            <li>Being attached to the shower, there is no time limit and you can use warm water.</li>
            <li>I liked the design though.</li>
            <li>Also nice is</li>
            <li>My husband likes it, I was going to return it, because I don&#x27;t like warm water in my waterpik, so I will keep using the countertop model.</li>
            <li>A good concept, will buy if they come out with a better version someday.</li>
            <li>This is a spectacular product for people with a permanent retainer or braces.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to install it in a nice bathroom...be prepared.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>high perfect, out of reach of the munchkins&lt;</li>
            <li>For the most part, I&#x27;m very pleased with the Showerpik.  </li>
            <li>The exchange went perfectly and my new device seems to be working well.  </li>
            <li>and it is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It went into my shower unit very easily, has no leaks or issues of any sort.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was very impressed by the way they handled this and they completely redeemed themselves in my eyes!</li>
            <li>And if you use it consistently you&#x27;ll have your dental hygienist marveling at your beautiful gums and asking you how you manage it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There are 2 settings available and I have used the higher setting every time with excellent results.  </li>
            <li>This was so easy for my husband to install!  </li>
            <li>At first it worked great, after about a month the unit started leaking water after you turn it off.  </li>
            <li>While this may be true, it&#x27;s good to know that Waterpik hasn&#x27;t designed those products to be used in the shower, and if you damage one in the shower, you may not get warranty service for it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>easy to mount if you have a talent 4 that kind of thing .</li>
            <li>It worked beautifully a nice strong stream of water.</li>
            <li>Love this model as it has a nice strong stream.</li>
            <li>Wanted a water flosser for in shower use and thought Waterpik to be a reputable line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The battery powered one I use now is OK, but I have to keep refilling the tank.  </li>
            <li>After only a three month trial, I would say it works great!  </li>
            <li>top sister model.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did, and he found it fairly challenging.  </li>
            <li>I really do hope the manufacturer fixes this product because it could be great.</li>
            <li>After watching the YouTube video of Waterpik with mold in it, I decided I&#x27;m not going to use these any more.</li>
            <li>It needs more  pressure,  but better than nothing.  </li>
            <li>The instructions does tell you it requires to be recharged every week (or more often if used more than once per day).  </li>
            <li>My breath has never been better (according to my husband).  </li>
            <li>On top of this, the battery life is horrid.</li>
            <li>/&gt;**Update**&lt;br /&gt;Waterpik customer service and warranty were outstanding.</li>
            <li>As a family we spend way more than $70 per year on floss and toothbrushes so $35 per year over 2 years for a water flosser &#x27;ai</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite items.  </li>
            <li>Installation was a breeze and the plastic fitting is a non-issue.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please advise me as to how to get more power.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully this works better.</li>
            <li>How many times have we been told to turn off the faucet while brushing our teeth.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this item to help me take better care of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>it has turned me into a daily flosser, my dentist and hygenist will be happy!!!</li>
            <li>So, I took it off, inspected the plumbing tape and figured I needed more.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t want to lose more counter space to a bulky counter top Waterpik unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After two months though, it will stopped being able to turn off.  </li>
            <li>This water pick is the best because you do not have to deal with the inevitable &amp;#34;Water</li>
            <li>so i&#x27;d focus on that area more.</li>
            <li>Works great and a real convenience to floss in the shower.</li>
            <li>This is an outstanding product.  </li>
            <li>It still works and I do love it</li>
            <li>Great product works very well.</li>
            <li>LOL really.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>Awesome while it lasted but for the price I expect for it to last more than 11 months.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>This product would be much better if it a.)</li>
            <li>Get one for yourself and more for relatives.</li>
            <li>Magic.</li>
            <li>I love how convenient this is and</li>
            <li>Six months ago I was warned that two more teeth were borderline candidates (6mm pockets).  </li>
            <li>I have so many devices that need to be recharged</li>
            <li>we were really pleased how well it worked on getting our teeth</li>
            <li>I bought this showerpik to have a more convenient hydro flosser than the countertop type.</li>
            <li>I really love this.</li>
            <li>I think they could have put more time into the design.</li>
            <li>Love this device.</li>
            <li>Separately, I bought a counter top model (&amp; came with a travel model) from a warehouse store.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been able to replace them under warranty</li>
            <li>I hope the &amp;#34;Traveler&amp;#34; works better.</li>
            <li>I love this unit.</li>
            <li>All four of them have had the problem many others have mentioned where the water runs out the tip continuously even when the unit is shut off.  </li>
            <li>In my latest attempt for a warranty replacement, Waterpik is now offering me a counter-top unit (WP-100, Water Flosser Ultra) as a replacement.  </li>
            <li>Flossing with warm water feels like my teeth are getting cleaner and is very nice if you have sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>It also has a slow/ fast button, which is very nice.  </li>
            <li>The fitting is made of a very cheap plastic, that seems as though it would easily crack with the slightest over-tensioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, this product is not executed elegantly.</li>
            <li>Very powerful!  </li>
            <li>Had it for a couple of months.. works great.. very convenient and easy to use.. love that it is in the shower .Wash and pick</li>
            <li>as an avid tooth-brusher-in-the-shower, this thing fits in to my whole &#x27;dental routine&#x27; perfectly.</li>
            <li>Using this every day is much cheaper and much more pleasant than oral surgery.  :)</li>
            <li>Like others have said, the full srength setting is very strong - if you have a counter top model and can&#x27;t use setting 13 or 14 - you won&#x27;t be able to use the top setting on this.  </li>
            <li>Having a warm shower means warm pik water, which is actually nice on my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted, good price, speedy delivery.  </li>
            <li>Excited to see how it works!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was making a difference, it seemed too easy.</li>
            <li>Overall, I love the the way it works and it does an excellent job of keeping my teeth clean along the gumline</li>
            <li>Teeth have never felt so clean!  </li>
            <li>And what really impressed me is that once I diverted my shower head and attached this, there wasn&#x27;t a single leak!</li>
            <li>Installation is a breeze when connecting to a standard size shower head and battery life is very good.</li>
            <li>, the battery unit is so cheaply made that when I try to remove it from the charger, the bottom of the battery unit doesn&#x27;t move when I twist the top (doing this as it shows in the manual).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great idea to put this messy but effective tool in the shower!</li>
            <li>The ShowerBreeze&#x27;s tips are much more comfortable, as well.</li>
            <li>(2) charger indicator light does not go out when battery is fully charged (I&#x27;ve charged it for 24 hours and the light is still lit!)</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s working great.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, no mess on countertop, mirror, &amp; no reservoir to deal with.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, I was very happy with its performance.</li>
            <li>It was easy to install.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and install.</li>
            <li>Easy to install.</li>
            <li>For me, something like this needs to be easy to use.</li>
            <li>It was easy to install to my existing hand held shower.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to install, and works well.  </li>
            <li>Got the kids to use it as it was so easy for them to do.  </li>
            <li>Easy to install.</li>
            <li>Easy to install, works as promised.</li>
            <li>Easy to install, took about 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Fairly easy to attach to my Waterpik showerhead but no amount of tightening stops it from leaking.  </li>
            <li>but you get use to it - easy install</li>
            <li>But it was easy to hook up.</li>
            <li>I tend to recharge it every 2-3 days, just because it&#x27;s easy to do.  </li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s dentist recommended a waterpik and this one was easy to install and use...</li>
            <li>Was easy to install.&lt;br /&gt;using</li>
            <li>Was easy to install.  </li>
            <li>Easy install.</li>
            <li>Makes flossing convenient and easy to do.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll never forget to floss since it is just so easy to do while you&#x27;re in the shower.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to install.</li>
            <li>Some may find that the jet is too strong and stings gums.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-very strong water stream</li>
            <li>I had an older version  before and loved it for years, simpler but never wavered in its service.</li>
            <li>I was very happy with this purchase, using it on average 3-4 times a week.</li>
            <li>and I am pretty handy.  </li>
            <li>A fairly thorough search suggests that new ones must be purchased on through the Waterpik web site.</li>
            <li>Item installed and works fine.</li>
            <li>Very convenient to get done while in the shower, hot water is a great touch.</li>
            <li>While it worked it seemed to be doing a fine job.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recharged the battery; it seems to charge just fine.</li>
            <li>However, the product works fine once it was installed.</li>
            <li>I have periodontal gum disease so this unit is a huge blessing to me.</li>
            <li>(hope water flows more powerful).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy an all-metal diverter that doesn&#x27;t have a pivot joint if one were available.</li>
            <li>The unit itself is great and it has that quality feel similar to our Sonicare toothbrush</li>
            <li>This product was great in what it does but the unit is now not functioning only after 6 months of use.  </li>
            <li>Very convenient to have it inline with the warm water, and to use in the shower.</li>
            <li>but the third one worked great.</li>
            <li>It would be an improvement if a light told you when it was fully charged.</li>
            <li>My dental hygienist said that my teeth are fantastic (no cavities at 40)</li>
            <li>Now I simply enjoy the cascading water while cleaning my gums.  </li>
            <li>gave up.&lt;br /&gt;These are great tool but are not made to last.  </li>
            <li>I use it daily and the temp of water is always great.</li>
            <li>I’m hoping I just got two defective products and others enjoy theirs.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, it&#x27;s PLASTIC, light weight and my hand</li>
            <li>Liked it so much that I bought another one for my kids bathroom.  </li>
            <li>Both are fabulous.  </li>
            <li>Battery seems good so far.</li>
            <li>Like many of the other reviewers, I thought this would be a good idea from a reputable manufacturer.  </li>
            <li>It produces a very powerful water jet&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very powerful.</li>
            <li>Teeth feel silky smooth clean.  </li>
            <li>Been using this for a few months and love it because I gag easily and using this standing up in the shower and not worrying about where the water goes is great</li>
            <li>The installation kit was super easy to install though my rainfall showered got about 3 inches lower.  </li>
            <li>Love the device, fast easy to use, however, while you are flossing you are wasting water.  </li>
            <li>I went through three of these, the original purchase and two replacements.  </li>
            <li>These batteries should be able to hold a charge for a couple of weeks, but pretty soon you&#x27;ll be having to charge it every couple of days, and then every day.  </li>
            <li>The first sign that it has reached mid-life is when it stops holding a charge for more than a couple of days.  </li>
            <li>So far very pleased with water pik.</li>
            <li>Excited to see some results!&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li>I originally ordered the Waterpik in April 2014.</li>
            <li>No mess, handy, easily used every time we shower.</li>
            <li>It started out great the first day and then after the battery went down and had to be charged it never produced any kind of water pressure again.  </li>
            <li>but wouldn&#x27;t fit on my more modern shower head on a sliding bar.</li>
            <li>I followed all directions with installation, charging the battery, keeping the battery leads clean, etc.</li>
            <li>my teeth haven&#x27;t felt this clean without going to the dentist.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t clean my teeth, of course.  </li>
            <li>The endless supply of warm water and no mess in the bathroom made it an ideal choice for my daughter with braces.</li>
            <li>Always thought it would be great to have something like this installed, didn&#x27;t know waterpik made the showerpik until recently and bought it right away.  </li>
            <li>The settings switch stopped selecting the more mild setting after first month.</li>
            <li>The battery lasts a good long time and recharging is easy.</li>
            <li>Love using it in the shower and my teeth and gums are very thankful.</li>
            <li>Even from the beginning, we could get 2 full uses out of it.</li>
            <li>Has a good pulsating stream, but the battery only holds a charge for 2 or maybe 3 days.</li>
            <li>works good except (1) hose is too short and</li>
            <li>I wish it would be either full battery or just shut off.</li>
            <li>Also, you have to run the full shower to run the WaterPik.  </li>
            <li>Both were very easy to install, installation instructs are very clear.</li>
            <li>I tried another battery (A friend has one) and that wasn&#x27;t the problem, so I uninstalled it and you could tell that it was full of water by the squishing sound, then when I took the battery off and shook it and it leaked brown water, I knew something wasn&#x27;t right...</li>
            <li>I should have returned right away but just thought it would be ok since it worked the first time.</li>
            <li>It was attached easily and seems to work pretty well.  </li>
            <li>I love being able to clean my teeth in the shower without getting water every where - which would happen with a traditional waterpik!  </li>
            <li>The water pressure was fine at first</li>
            <li>Well, dropping this to one star - At first I thought I had a battery issue, but after checking with a volt meter I realized the batter was fine.</li>
            <li>One quick remedy is to take off the nozzle so that the water won&#x27;t spray across the room when you hang the device on its mount.</li>
            <li>all&lt;br /&gt;i bought the most expensive one i could find thinking it would be the best for my&lt;br /&gt;new bathroom remodel</li>
            <li>We use the regular waterpik on the sink most of the time, more pressure.  </li>
            <li>The battery dies EXTREMELY quickly.</li>
            <li>device is super convenient.  </li>
            <li>It would have gotten 3 stars if it weren&#x27;t for the quick replacement.</li>
            <li>Excited to have the product, and installation went without too many hitches for an old woman.  </li>
            <li>It is a great product when it works, but why the hell cant they make one that wont break down after 2 months??</li>
            <li>I only use this now, no flossing any more!</li>
            <li>this is my first day trying it!</li>
            <li>This thing works great and the lack of mess on counters, mirrors, etc.</li>
            <li>I ordered this before they first came out!  </li>
            <li>The battery life has FAR exceeded my expectations and I have found that even on the highest setting, the spray is very comfortable on my gums.  </li>
            <li>It has been great, we use it in the shower everyday.  </li>
            <li>and my shower head&#x27;s metal threads absolutely destroyed the cheap plastic threads.</li>
            <li>I contacted Waterpik for a free extension for the shower head I have and never received the extension and cannot move the shower head much.</li>
            <li>For all of my adult life, my dentist has been lecturing me on how I need to floss more.</li>
            <li>It isnt as powerful as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>Useful, and my dentist gave it the thumbs up.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth twice the price.</li>
            <li>but after two months it&#x27;s not as powerful as before</li>
            <li>I had the old waterpic for years, but this is hands down the best, I hit the shower, rinse with some mouthwash, floss, use this thing, which takes up no space in our fairly small bathroom, when I get out of the shower my mouth and gums feel great.  </li>
            <li>It did take a little getting used to, but I love it!!</li>
            <li>If you want to purchase be aware of the problem with the charge and return quickly and buy from a store where you can talk to a person.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s right in front of me right now and has a STEEL connector.</li>
            <li>Since using them, I see she was right.  </li>
            <li>When I shower I usually spend 2-3 minutes just enjoying the cascading warm water.  </li>
            <li>This product worked fine until it broke during the fifth month of normal use.</li>
            <li>You can get a great floss out of this and when you are done you can turn it around and clean your grout with it - Seriously.</li>
            <li>The hose is nice and long</li>
            <li>I would have gladly paid a little more for a metal connector, and will begrudgingly buy one separately if it is offered.</li>
            <li>I can really get a good deep clean with no mess</li>
            <li>The main factor is that it has made a significant difference in my oral health.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous customer service at Waterpik to send a new one immediately.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;here&#x27;s the funny part: i am going to buy another one right now.</li>
            <li>It only takes a short time and your teeth will feel great.</li>
            <li>Customer Service was very responsive both times and replaced the units quickly and promptly.</li>
            <li>This is an interesting product in that when it works I just love it, but I have had to have a unit replaced because it just stopped after a few weeks use.  </li>
            <li>It is very powerful and since I was a new waterpik user...</li>
            <li>Easy and no mess.  </li>
            <li>The only downside to this product is that it is very cheap looking.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately you can contact the company and they will send you a new battery, however that doesn&#x27;t fix the problem, it just makes the waterpik last two more weeks.</li>
            <li>First time using a waterpik water flosser and certainly did not disappointment.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Waterpik!</li>
            <li>First time user and the unit DOES NOT WORK.</li>
            <li>Remember to use YouTube video instruction and follow it exactly during installation.&lt;br /&gt;Too</li>
            <li>I bought mine directly from Waterpik, because amazon didn’t have them available when I wanted it.  </li>
            <li>First use of this cleaned my teeth</li>
            <li>First let me say that when working properly, this device is outstanding for gum health.  </li>
            <li>Water Pic is aware of the problem.  </li>
            <li>So, their customer service is outstanding, and I bumped this item&#x27;s rating back up to 4-stars.</li>
            <li>Not to mention that I could not prevent the connector from leaking (I did follow the instructions exactly) and that the connector looks like the cheapest plastic chrome in the universe.</li>
            <li>She did exactly that</li>
            <li>My wife tried this for the first time and I asked her what she thought.</li>
            <li>In the shower also means we consistently use it every day.</li>
            <li>Next, although you will be able to turn the power off when done with it, water continues to spray out until you are done taking a shower.</li>
            <li>The first one crapped out after 8 months of use.</li>
            <li>but it was leaking at first.</li>
            <li>so I added a moderate amount more: it still leaked.</li>
            <li>The ShowerBreeze has metal threads, installed with no leaks the first time, has infinite settings (it&#x27;s analog; uses a splitter valve), doesn&#x27;t require you to charge a battery</li>
            <li>The first time I used it it hurt a lot and my gums bled a lot.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The water pressure is a bit higher than I would like.  </li>
            <li>Love it, finally got my teenager to floss!</li>
            <li>So I purchased a more simple water flosser that you plug in by WaterPik &amp;</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t overtighten and they last many years.</li>
            <li>This is very convenient, but not as powerful as a countertop model.</li>
            <li>Much better than traditional flossing.  </li>
            <li>think the main problem with the battery is that it quickly looses its charge when it is not being used.  </li>
            <li>better alternative is the ShowerBreeze Water Jet Dental Irrigator, which requires no batteries, and uses a simple valve to operate.  </li>
            <li>and I also ordered the brushing accessory so this works a lot better than the counter-top or hand-held model.</li>
            <li>Be aware that it will also reduce the flow of your shower head since it mounts between it and the water supply.  </li>
            <li>it own conversation, but this is unlike any other they make.</li>
            <li>I received the Showerpik as a Christmas present last Christmas (about 9 months ago) and loved the thing from the start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My shower setup consists of good looking brushed steel and at the end I also have a hose and extra steel shower head.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up returning it, and Amazon was good enough to accept it back without question.</li>
            <li>So for quality of materials, it&#x27;s 50% too high and worth about $30-35.</li>
            <li>Definitely will clean your gums!</li>
            <li>But you should be aware that if you have a modern hand held shower head that is at the end of a flexible hose, and where the plumbing attachment fits close to the wall, you may need to hire a plumber.  </li>
            <li>I got this because I wanted to really use it in the shower, but it is pretty unreliable.</li>
            <li>The unit holder looks flimsy and I wonder how long it will last before breaking, but the Showerpik itself is a pretty good build.&lt;br</li>
            <li>What makes this a great alternative to the standard Waterpik is that there is an endless supply of water, doesn&#x27;t take up much space and</li>
            <li>It would have been nice to have a indicator built into the battery to give warning when you need to recharge, but I generally charge once a week anyway after daily use and have noticed no reduction in power.</li>
            <li>It was an easy enough fix, but something to consider before buying.</li>
            <li>simple and easy to recharge</li>
            <li>I previously had a Showerpik that I liked.</li>
            <li>Once I got the water out of it (it was full), I was able to get it running again for a few weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I would turn the switch to off, it would continue to spray, strong enough to shoot water across the bathroom if the attachment is still on.</li>
            <li>It is powerful on high, but it made a big difference in my oral hygiene in my mouth full of crowns.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much but</li>
            <li>Performs much better than expected</li>
            <li>Water flows through the line but only light air comes through the unit although fully charged and on the faster speed</li>
            <li>/&gt;It gets three stars because I really like this design and the performance when it works (and the customer service).  </li>
            <li>The water keeps on shooting out until the whole shower is turned off.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t mind this so much, because I just wanted the unit to work.  </li>
            <li>VERY moldy smell.</li>
            <li>Very convienent.</li>
            <li>very convenient, doesn&#x27;t take up space on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>to find out that the whole setup depends on a plastic connector-piece onto the existing plumbing.</li>
            <li>settings were the same no difference in motor sound or pressure.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see any listings for replacement batteries, so I&#x27;ll try to have the whole unit replaced.</li>
            <li>It makes a very bulky connection and lowers the height of your shower head.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this gadget.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this waterpik!</li>
            <li>The shower head sticks out an additional 2 inches or so, but that&#x27;s really nothing.  </li>
            <li>in mind though…if your Dentist wants you to use it 2-3 times a day, that&#x27;s A LOT of showers.</li>
            <li>Seems like for nearly $60, they should be made of stainless steel or standard water fitting materials...</li>
            <li>really wanted this to work, but</li>
            <li>I gave it one star because it really helped our gums when it did work.  </li>
            <li>Works very well and by doing in the shower you don&#x27;t have all the water spraying all over your bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to continue using this because I need it for gum problems, and there&#x27;s no question it really helps with those.</li>
            <li>The device is supposed to have two speeds - one slower, for more sensitive teeth, and one regular.  </li>
            <li>by far and away the cleanest my mouth/teeth have ever felt !!!</li>
            <li>The battery is removable, holds a charge for about a week, and works well right until the charge is completely lost&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li>Those other ones, where you have to keep refilling a tank, is completely comically inefficient.</li>
            <li>No more re-filling &amp; the shower water can be dialed into the most preferred temperature!</li>
            <li>My dentist measured my perio gaps 9 months ago and they have significantly improved while I regularly used this product on almost every tooth!!   </li>
            <li>Yesterday the dental hygienist who suggested this type of product was excited to find that those had healed to be only 4mm and that gum bleeding had also improved.  </li>
            <li>However, we have had four of them in our house, two original purchases and two warranty replacements, and all have not worked properly.  </li>
            <li>As mentioned by other reviewers, there are only two settings with one being really too powerful, but this isn&#x27;t a deal breaker for the low setting is fine for most needs.</li>
            <li>first one leaked at the connection to the shower, even when tightened as far as it would go without breaking it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m cool with only once at the end of my day.</li>
            <li>I struggled using the standard one over the sink due to the mess but this being designed for the shower is perfect.  </li>
            <li>My showerhead is near the ceiling, so that was the first problem.</li>
            <li>It extends the shower head out pretty far</li>
            <li>Battery seems to be needing a charge a little more often after 6 months of use, but otherwise really like it.</li>
            <li>However, I noticed a real difference in my gums when I stopped using it, so I bought a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When we couldn&#x27;t get it working, Waterpik mailed me a whole new unit.</li>
            <li>Sent me a whole new units.  </li>
            <li>Was really easy to install since it does not require any plumbers tape and minimal tools.</li>
            <li>I replaced an older version of the cordless waterpik with this model.  </li>
            <li>When used daily, any gum problems are quickly healed.  </li>
            <li>My wife loves it and so do I,  The only thing that would make it better is to have a way to hang the second tip to the device in the shower.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend using with older plumbing .</li>
            <li>If it lasts at least a year I&#x27;ll be satisfied and would probably get another because the shower attachment is worth it to me.</li>
            <li>I especially like the on/off button located in the handle and the pressure is adequate.  </li>
            <li>We have an older shower head that is not restricted for water pressure</li>
            <li>Seems to work decently.</li>
            <li>The two speeds are deceiving - the low &#x27;speed&#x27; is actually a higher pulse rate but lower pressure, whereas the high &#x27;speed&#x27; is a lower pulse rate but higher pressure.  </li>
            <li>It was convenient to be able to use in the shower where the splashing water wouldn&#x27;t make a mess.  </li>
            <li>It did a good job, but didn&#x27;t last long enough.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s high cost.</li>
            <li>and I would say the high setting on this showerpik is about a 5,6/10 on the one that plugs in.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Waterpik needs to do a little more RD before releasing their products</li>
            <li>I tried again with a little more again</li>
            <li>I am very glad I paid a little extra for the brand</li>
            <li>I found no mention of this anywhere, and there are more than a few reviews where people use cordless flossers in the shower and say they have no problem with it.</li>
            <li>I always start out with good intentions after a Dentist appoinment, trying to floss twice a day, but it never lasted long and after a few months I would reach the point I skipped flossing all together.  </li>
            <li>It worked good, not great.</li>
            <li>Not hard to install,</li>
            <li>I LOVE this thing but the battery doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>I like this product, but it sure didn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li>It only has 3 settings and the strongest setting is only fairly strong.</li>
            <li>That has not been a problem; possibly the design simply has a constriction to keep the pressure from being too strong.  </li>
            <li>We have both strengthened our gums quite a bit since using this product and its very convenient to have in the shower as to not mess all over the counter-top.</li>
            <li>For me this means I cannot place the unit back in its holder while I&#x27;m still using the shower, since the water would shoot right over the shower door and across the room.  </li>
            <li>No extra parts needed, just hooked right into the existing shower head.  </li>
            <li>so I bought a new one and charged it.  </li>
            <li>Emailed waterpick they are sending a new one.</li>
            <li>They sent me a new one with no objections.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s something I can live with though.</li>
            <li>I should just get a new one sent to me</li>
            <li>How did I live without this?</li>
            <li>we get a new replacement waterpik? or is their some part</li>
            <li>--might as well have bought the new item--for that price you would hope it comes with a new battery as well.</li>
            <li>so I wrote to them yesterday and this morning got an email saying that they were shipping me a new battery.  </li>
            <li>You have to buy a new charger, too, and the set costs $30 plus $6 shipping.</li>
            <li>They are sending me a new battery.</li>
            <li>I did have to buy some extra pieces from the hardware store to make it fit to our grohe shower unit as the water pipe comes out parallel to the wall and not out on an angle/perpendicular.  </li>
            <li>We had to create a custom pvc adapter to get the waterpik to fit which required several visits to our local hardware store, trial and error, and a lot of patience.</li>
            <li>I always use my &amp;#34;Waterpik,&amp;#34; but sometimes you need more water than what the little tank holds!</li>
            <li>So I figured I&#x27;d have to buy another one since I didn&#x27;t have the receipt, but I checked on here first to see if anyone else had a similar issue.</li>
            <li>If you have an issue contact support, you might be surprised!</li>
            <li>Each has had the same problems, and although Waterpik did replace them, and did acknowledge they were aware of these problems, it appears that they would rather just keep replacing them than bother to fix the issues.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure other brand would do the same</li>
            <li>I sent an email detailing the above problems, then I called to ask a question which, incidentally, some of you may be interested to hear</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a couple of problems; on the first unit it just stopped working and the second unit the switch would not stop the water from spraying.  </li>
            <li>Seems pretty fragile.  </li>
            <li>Me personally I like it - but also remember, you can get other heads for it which may reduce the power of the top setting.  </li>
            <li>The whole unit, including the handle, is a rather intrusive presence in your shower, with it&#x27;s large size and long hanging</li>
            <li>They responded quickly and simply sent me a new one without further question.</li>
            <li>So far, it has worked fine, but I&#x27;m concerned about how long it will last.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m hoping she will confirm positive result on next visit.</li>
            <li>Finally, this unit is supposed to be simple to install, and if you have an old fashioned shower head that sticks out of the wall at the end of an arm, then that is probably true.  </li>
            <li>No mess to think about!</li>
            <li>So, a little cheaply made but seems to be working well and holding up well.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the cheap plastic connector for this to attach to the pipe, so I did some plumbing and fixed that little problem.</li>
            <li>I really wish Waterpik would have spent a little more money on the connection components.  </li>
            <li>The fitting leaks like crazy, despite following the instructions to the letter.&lt;br /&gt;3.) The fitting is actually quite large and unwieldy.&lt;br /&gt;4.)</li>
            <li>For the experienced and non-experienced DIY-ers amongst you, you can always &amp;#34;go happy&amp;#34; with plastic dissolving crazy glue or even a blowtorch to melt it water-tight.</li>
            <li>Disappointing because when the product works, it is great.</li>
            <li>After nearly 20 years, no lectures.</li>
            <li>early to comment on battery performance.</li>
            <li>So far we have no complaints.  </li>
            <li>The unit just completely died after 4 months.</li>
            <li>decided to return the item per direct and buy a &amp;#34;ShowerBreeze oral care&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Completely unsatisfied with products lifespan.</li>
            <li>, that means it needs to be charged every day, i.e. 7 times a week -  a far cry from the 1 to 2 times stated in the product documentation).</li>
            <li>I would prefer to filter the water that I am directly putting against my gums.</li>
            <li>You want them in the shower hanging up near the device, with a cover over them.</li>
            <li>In that 8-month time, the battery progressively developed shorter run time between charges.</li>
            <li>Only downfall is that with all the hardware it needs it has made my shower head MUCH lower.</li>
            <li>but so far no problems.</li>
            <li>I was surprised the fittings were plastic, they were supposed to be metal</li>
            <li>but I think I must have been one of the early purchasers (I bought it in March 2013).  </li>
            <li>Now, the water never shuts off completely, and I have to remove the tip and just let the water drip</li>
            <li>I went to the dentist in early March for a cleaning</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had 3 or 4 of these and while they&#x27;ve always worked well for about 6 months, they have all had the switch problem where it won&#x27;t turn off and the battery not holding a charge and eventually it stops working completely.</li>
            <li>This hooks to your shower head, so the entire time you&#x27;re in the shower, as long as you&#x27;ve got battery, you&#x27;ve got full power for cleaning between your teeth without any interruptions to refill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>compared to regular Waterpiks is well worth the extra price.</li>
            <li>A good idea, but poorly executed!</li>
            <li>I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas, and he LOVED it, but he showed it to me yesterday and it had broken!</li>
            <li>I got lucky with smacking the product with my palm and got it working again - long enough to get it to shut off.  </li>
            <li>This particular Waterpik Showerpik only lasted two months before it stopped working completely.  </li>
            <li>no mess what so ever.</li>
            <li>no mess</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it works yet because I am currently charging the battery on the waterpik, but the spray from the shower coming into the tube seems to have decent pressure all by itself...</li>
            <li>I am a recently retired dental hygienist and I highly recommend a water irrigation device for almost everyone.  </li>
            <li>but I think its high quality and will last awhile.</li>
            <li>So far two new batteries and one entire unit replaced.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little large, but where it&#x27;s located doesn&#x27;t really matter or get in the way.  </li>
            <li>As others have said, it does bring the shower head out and down a couple of inches, but it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>always keep the cover on the jet tip because it breaks easily and replacements are hard to find.</li>
            <li>are more exposed than the other half.</li>
            <li>The batteries don&#x27;t last long (in terms of how many recharges they can take), they inevitably end up leaking constantly out of the top (whether they&#x27;re turned on or not), and the switch gets broken so the Water Flosser only works at one</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery drains quickly after a few uses or a week or so of non-use.  </li>
            <li>I have charged the battery and have no other options to return the unit or even get a replacement.  </li>
            <li>Only used it a few times so far, but it does the trick adequately.</li>
            <li>wish it had more than two speeds &amp; two ordinary tips, but those are small gripes for all the positive solutions it offered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All in all, the flosser works fine for what I bought it for - getting to small &#x27;pockets&#x27; along the teeth/gum line at the back of my mouth.  </li>
            <li>However in this case the product-engineers were a little too enthusiastic and went somewhat overboard.</li>
            <li>Never really had much pressure anyway</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t even ask for the old one back.</li>
            <li>The 2 speeds are easy to select (despite the other review) and they are different but not extreme (despite the other review).  </li>
            <li>I made a mess the first time I attempted to use it :</li>
            <li>You hardly notice the sound in the shower, but I think the internal pump is quieter anyway.</li>
            <li>One thing I find odd, the green light on the charger only tells you the battery is plugged in and the charger is plugged into a live outlet.</li>
            <li>This is the very first time in ten years that I have returned a product, usually I work my way around it or give it away.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no excuse for this, Waterpik.</li>
            <li>(Sounds crazy, but even powerful enough to clean grout.)  </li>
            <li>Using these things is pretty messy, (just like brushing your teeth), and for me at least, it only makes sense to do all this in the shower, so you can just rinse off right then and there.</li>
            <li>Brand new unit has the same problem I&#x27;ve seen other post.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Waterpik is really a great company.  </li>

            <li> After finishing the exam, the dentist commented on how great I was doing with my brushing and flossing and to keep up the good work.</li>
            <li> This is a must have for you clean freaks out there!!!</li>
            <li> I bought it at the suggestion of my dental hygienist and Waterpik does have a good name.  </li>
            <li> Good pressure</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> When it arrived, I absolutely loved this model.  </li>
            <li> Loved my Waterpik, would have given it a 5</li>
            <li> The battery life is good.  </li>
            <li> Battery life seems good as well.</li>
            <li> Good build quality.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik Water Flosser appears to be overly engineered, and not in a good way.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended the Showerpick and I am very glad he did.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with it,</li>

            <li> Great alternative to the original Waterpik!</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> I love my showerpik!</li>
            <li> your dendtist will love you!</li>
            <li> It was excellent at first......</li>
            <li> this product is great, so easy and convenient</li>
            <li> Easy to install, just great.</li>
            <li> Using this device in the shower is a much more pleasant option for me than flossing</li>
            <li> Easy install and works great.</li>
            <li> Great product, easy to use,</li>
            <li> It was easy to install, and it works great when it works.</li>
            <li> Great pressure &amp; easy to fill.</li>
            <li> Also, this works amazingly as a flosser.  </li>
            <li> Kudos to Amazon customer service, they were amazing.</li>
            <li> and I liked it</li>
            <li> This was a really nice purchase.  </li>
            <li> Nice product</li>
            <li> I liked the “laser cutter” as some others have described it.  </li>
            <li> People who are not that handy or not used to tightening plastic components onto metal fittings may end up breaking the product.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik  Showerpik does a nice job when working, after a couple of months the on-off swtich began sticking, making it difficlut to turn off......</li>
            <li> Without the connector the thing has no value.&lt;br /&gt;The design and quality is according to the popular SBWOY standard:&amp;#34;Should Break Within One Year, so we can sell another one&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> , I felt that it had to be of some kind of quality level.</li>
            <li> Nice to use</li>
            <li> Being attached to the shower, there is no time limit and you can use warm water.</li>
            <li> I liked the design though.</li>
            <li> Also nice is</li>
            <li> My husband likes it, I was going to return it, because I don&#x27;t like warm water in my waterpik, so I will keep using the countertop model.</li>
            <li> A good concept, will buy if they come out with a better version someday.</li>
            <li> This is a spectacular product for people with a permanent retainer or braces.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to install it in a nice bathroom...be prepared.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> high perfect, out of reach of the munchkins&lt;</li>
            <li> For the most part, I&#x27;m very pleased with the Showerpik.  </li>
            <li> The exchange went perfectly and my new device seems to be working well.  </li>
            <li> and it is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It went into my shower unit very easily, has no leaks or issues of any sort.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was very impressed by the way they handled this and they completely redeemed themselves in my eyes!</li>
            <li> And if you use it consistently you&#x27;ll have your dental hygienist marveling at your beautiful gums and asking you how you manage it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There are 2 settings available and I have used the higher setting every time with excellent results.  </li>
            <li> This was so easy for my husband to install!  </li>
            <li> At first it worked great, after about a month the unit started leaking water after you turn it off.  </li>
            <li> While this may be true, it&#x27;s good to know that Waterpik hasn&#x27;t designed those products to be used in the shower, and if you damage one in the shower, you may not get warranty service for it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> easy to mount if you have a talent 4 that kind of thing .</li>
            <li> It worked beautifully a nice strong stream of water.</li>
            <li> Love this model as it has a nice strong stream.</li>
            <li> Wanted a water flosser for in shower use and thought Waterpik to be a reputable line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The battery powered one I use now is OK, but I have to keep refilling the tank.  </li>
            <li> After only a three month trial, I would say it works great!  </li>
            <li> top sister model.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did, and he found it fairly challenging.  </li>
            <li> I really do hope the manufacturer fixes this product because it could be great.</li>
            <li> After watching the YouTube video of Waterpik with mold in it, I decided I&#x27;m not going to use these any more.</li>
            <li> It needs more  pressure,  but better than nothing.  </li>
            <li> The instructions does tell you it requires to be recharged every week (or more often if used more than once per day).  </li>
            <li> My breath has never been better (according to my husband).  </li>
            <li> On top of this, the battery life is horrid.</li>
            <li> /&gt;**Update**&lt;br /&gt;Waterpik customer service and warranty were outstanding.</li>
            <li> As a family we spend way more than $70 per year on floss and toothbrushes so $35 per year over 2 years for a water flosser &#x27;ai</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite items.  </li>
            <li> Installation was a breeze and the plastic fitting is a non-issue.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please advise me as to how to get more power.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully this works better.</li>
            <li> How many times have we been told to turn off the faucet while brushing our teeth.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this item to help me take better care of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> it has turned me into a daily flosser, my dentist and hygenist will be happy!!!</li>
            <li> So, I took it off, inspected the plumbing tape and figured I needed more.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want to lose more counter space to a bulky counter top Waterpik unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After two months though, it will stopped being able to turn off.  </li>
            <li> This water pick is the best because you do not have to deal with the inevitable &amp;#34;Water</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;d focus on that area more.</li>
            <li> Works great and a real convenience to floss in the shower.</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding product.  </li>
            <li> It still works and I do love it</li>
            <li> Great product works very well.</li>
            <li> LOL really.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li> Awesome while it lasted but for the price I expect for it to last more than 11 months.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> This product would be much better if it a.)</li>
            <li> Get one for yourself and more for relatives.</li>
            <li> Magic.</li>
            <li> I love how convenient this is and</li>
            <li> Six months ago I was warned that two more teeth were borderline candidates (6mm pockets).  </li>
            <li> I have so many devices that need to be recharged</li>
            <li> we were really pleased how well it worked on getting our teeth</li>
            <li> I bought this showerpik to have a more convenient hydro flosser than the countertop type.</li>
            <li> I really love this.</li>
            <li> I think they could have put more time into the design.</li>
            <li> Love this device.</li>
            <li> Separately, I bought a counter top model (&amp; came with a travel model) from a warehouse store.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been able to replace them under warranty</li>
            <li> I hope the &amp;#34;Traveler&amp;#34; works better.</li>
            <li> I love this unit.</li>
            <li> All four of them have had the problem many others have mentioned where the water runs out the tip continuously even when the unit is shut off.  </li>
            <li> In my latest attempt for a warranty replacement, Waterpik is now offering me a counter-top unit (WP-100, Water Flosser Ultra) as a replacement.  </li>
            <li> Flossing with warm water feels like my teeth are getting cleaner and is very nice if you have sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> It also has a slow/ fast button, which is very nice.  </li>
            <li> The fitting is made of a very cheap plastic, that seems as though it would easily crack with the slightest over-tensioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, this product is not executed elegantly.</li>
            <li> Very powerful!  </li>
            <li> Had it for a couple of months.. works great.. very convenient and easy to use.. love that it is in the shower .Wash and pick</li>
            <li> as an avid tooth-brusher-in-the-shower, this thing fits in to my whole &#x27;dental routine&#x27; perfectly.</li>
            <li> Using this every day is much cheaper and much more pleasant than oral surgery.  :)</li>
            <li> Like others have said, the full srength setting is very strong - if you have a counter top model and can&#x27;t use setting 13 or 14 - you won&#x27;t be able to use the top setting on this.  </li>
            <li> Having a warm shower means warm pik water, which is actually nice on my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted, good price, speedy delivery.  </li>
            <li> Excited to see how it works!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was making a difference, it seemed too easy.</li>
            <li> Overall, I love the the way it works and it does an excellent job of keeping my teeth clean along the gumline</li>
            <li> Teeth have never felt so clean!  </li>
            <li> And what really impressed me is that once I diverted my shower head and attached this, there wasn&#x27;t a single leak!</li>
            <li> Installation is a breeze when connecting to a standard size shower head and battery life is very good.</li>
            <li> , the battery unit is so cheaply made that when I try to remove it from the charger, the bottom of the battery unit doesn&#x27;t move when I twist the top (doing this as it shows in the manual).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great idea to put this messy but effective tool in the shower!</li>
            <li> The ShowerBreeze&#x27;s tips are much more comfortable, as well.</li>
            <li> (2) charger indicator light does not go out when battery is fully charged (I&#x27;ve charged it for 24 hours and the light is still lit!)</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s working great.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, no mess on countertop, mirror, &amp; no reservoir to deal with.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, I was very happy with its performance.</li>
            <li> It was easy to install.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and install.</li>
            <li> Easy to install.</li>
            <li> For me, something like this needs to be easy to use.</li>
            <li> It was easy to install to my existing hand held shower.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to install, and works well.  </li>
            <li> Got the kids to use it as it was so easy for them to do.  </li>
            <li> Easy to install.</li>
            <li> Easy to install, works as promised.</li>
            <li> Easy to install, took about 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Fairly easy to attach to my Waterpik showerhead but no amount of tightening stops it from leaking.  </li>
            <li> but you get use to it - easy install</li>
            <li> But it was easy to hook up.</li>
            <li> I tend to recharge it every 2-3 days, just because it&#x27;s easy to do.  </li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s dentist recommended a waterpik and this one was easy to install and use...</li>
            <li> Was easy to install.&lt;br /&gt;using</li>
            <li> Was easy to install.  </li>
            <li> Easy install.</li>
            <li> Makes flossing convenient and easy to do.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll never forget to floss since it is just so easy to do while you&#x27;re in the shower.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to install.</li>
            <li> Some may find that the jet is too strong and stings gums.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-very strong water stream</li>
            <li> I had an older version  before and loved it for years, simpler but never wavered in its service.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this purchase, using it on average 3-4 times a week.</li>
            <li> and I am pretty handy.  </li>
            <li> A fairly thorough search suggests that new ones must be purchased on through the Waterpik web site.</li>
            <li> Item installed and works fine.</li>
            <li> Very convenient to get done while in the shower, hot water is a great touch.</li>
            <li> While it worked it seemed to be doing a fine job.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recharged the battery; it seems to charge just fine.</li>
            <li> However, the product works fine once it was installed.</li>
            <li> I have periodontal gum disease so this unit is a huge blessing to me.</li>
            <li> (hope water flows more powerful).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy an all-metal diverter that doesn&#x27;t have a pivot joint if one were available.</li>
            <li> The unit itself is great and it has that quality feel similar to our Sonicare toothbrush</li>
            <li> This product was great in what it does but the unit is now not functioning only after 6 months of use.  </li>
            <li> Very convenient to have it inline with the warm water, and to use in the shower.</li>
            <li> but the third one worked great.</li>
            <li> It would be an improvement if a light told you when it was fully charged.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist said that my teeth are fantastic (no cavities at 40)</li>
            <li> Now I simply enjoy the cascading water while cleaning my gums.  </li>
            <li> gave up.&lt;br /&gt;These are great tool but are not made to last.  </li>
            <li> I use it daily and the temp of water is always great.</li>
            <li> I’m hoping I just got two defective products and others enjoy theirs.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, it&#x27;s PLASTIC, light weight and my hand</li>
            <li> Liked it so much that I bought another one for my kids bathroom.  </li>
            <li> Both are fabulous.  </li>
            <li> Battery seems good so far.</li>
            <li> Like many of the other reviewers, I thought this would be a good idea from a reputable manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> It produces a very powerful water jet&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very powerful.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel silky smooth clean.  </li>
            <li> Been using this for a few months and love it because I gag easily and using this standing up in the shower and not worrying about where the water goes is great</li>
            <li> The installation kit was super easy to install though my rainfall showered got about 3 inches lower.  </li>
            <li> Love the device, fast easy to use, however, while you are flossing you are wasting water.  </li>
            <li> I went through three of these, the original purchase and two replacements.  </li>
            <li> These batteries should be able to hold a charge for a couple of weeks, but pretty soon you&#x27;ll be having to charge it every couple of days, and then every day.  </li>
            <li> The first sign that it has reached mid-life is when it stops holding a charge for more than a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> So far very pleased with water pik.</li>
            <li> Excited to see some results!&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> I originally ordered the Waterpik in April 2014.</li>
            <li> No mess, handy, easily used every time we shower.</li>
            <li> It started out great the first day and then after the battery went down and had to be charged it never produced any kind of water pressure again.  </li>
            <li> but wouldn&#x27;t fit on my more modern shower head on a sliding bar.</li>
            <li> I followed all directions with installation, charging the battery, keeping the battery leads clean, etc.</li>
            <li> my teeth haven&#x27;t felt this clean without going to the dentist.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t clean my teeth, of course.  </li>
            <li> The endless supply of warm water and no mess in the bathroom made it an ideal choice for my daughter with braces.</li>
            <li> Always thought it would be great to have something like this installed, didn&#x27;t know waterpik made the showerpik until recently and bought it right away.  </li>
            <li> The settings switch stopped selecting the more mild setting after first month.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts a good long time and recharging is easy.</li>
            <li> Love using it in the shower and my teeth and gums are very thankful.</li>
            <li> Even from the beginning, we could get 2 full uses out of it.</li>
            <li> Has a good pulsating stream, but the battery only holds a charge for 2 or maybe 3 days.</li>
            <li> works good except (1) hose is too short and</li>
            <li> I wish it would be either full battery or just shut off.</li>
            <li> Also, you have to run the full shower to run the WaterPik.  </li>
            <li> Both were very easy to install, installation instructs are very clear.</li>
            <li> I tried another battery (A friend has one) and that wasn&#x27;t the problem, so I uninstalled it and you could tell that it was full of water by the squishing sound, then when I took the battery off and shook it and it leaked brown water, I knew something wasn&#x27;t right...</li>
            <li> I should have returned right away but just thought it would be ok since it worked the first time.</li>
            <li> It was attached easily and seems to work pretty well.  </li>
            <li> I love being able to clean my teeth in the shower without getting water every where - which would happen with a traditional waterpik!  </li>
            <li> The water pressure was fine at first</li>
            <li> Well, dropping this to one star - At first I thought I had a battery issue, but after checking with a volt meter I realized the batter was fine.</li>
            <li> One quick remedy is to take off the nozzle so that the water won&#x27;t spray across the room when you hang the device on its mount.</li>
            <li> all&lt;br /&gt;i bought the most expensive one i could find thinking it would be the best for my&lt;br /&gt;new bathroom remodel</li>
            <li> We use the regular waterpik on the sink most of the time, more pressure.  </li>
            <li> The battery dies EXTREMELY quickly.</li>
            <li> device is super convenient.  </li>
            <li> It would have gotten 3 stars if it weren&#x27;t for the quick replacement.</li>
            <li> Excited to have the product, and installation went without too many hitches for an old woman.  </li>
            <li> It is a great product when it works, but why the hell cant they make one that wont break down after 2 months??</li>
            <li> I only use this now, no flossing any more!</li>
            <li> this is my first day trying it!</li>
            <li> This thing works great and the lack of mess on counters, mirrors, etc.</li>
            <li> I ordered this before they first came out!  </li>
            <li> The battery life has FAR exceeded my expectations and I have found that even on the highest setting, the spray is very comfortable on my gums.  </li>
            <li> It has been great, we use it in the shower everyday.  </li>
            <li> and my shower head&#x27;s metal threads absolutely destroyed the cheap plastic threads.</li>
            <li> I contacted Waterpik for a free extension for the shower head I have and never received the extension and cannot move the shower head much.</li>
            <li> For all of my adult life, my dentist has been lecturing me on how I need to floss more.</li>
            <li> It isnt as powerful as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Useful, and my dentist gave it the thumbs up.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth twice the price.</li>
            <li> but after two months it&#x27;s not as powerful as before</li>
            <li> I had the old waterpic for years, but this is hands down the best, I hit the shower, rinse with some mouthwash, floss, use this thing, which takes up no space in our fairly small bathroom, when I get out of the shower my mouth and gums feel great.  </li>
            <li> It did take a little getting used to, but I love it!!</li>
            <li> If you want to purchase be aware of the problem with the charge and return quickly and buy from a store where you can talk to a person.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s right in front of me right now and has a STEEL connector.</li>
            <li> Since using them, I see she was right.  </li>
            <li> When I shower I usually spend 2-3 minutes just enjoying the cascading warm water.  </li>
            <li> This product worked fine until it broke during the fifth month of normal use.</li>
            <li> You can get a great floss out of this and when you are done you can turn it around and clean your grout with it - Seriously.</li>
            <li> The hose is nice and long</li>
            <li> I would have gladly paid a little more for a metal connector, and will begrudgingly buy one separately if it is offered.</li>
            <li> I can really get a good deep clean with no mess</li>
            <li> The main factor is that it has made a significant difference in my oral health.  </li>
            <li> Fabulous customer service at Waterpik to send a new one immediately.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;here&#x27;s the funny part: i am going to buy another one right now.</li>
            <li> It only takes a short time and your teeth will feel great.</li>
            <li> Customer Service was very responsive both times and replaced the units quickly and promptly.</li>
            <li> This is an interesting product in that when it works I just love it, but I have had to have a unit replaced because it just stopped after a few weeks use.  </li>
            <li> It is very powerful and since I was a new waterpik user...</li>
            <li> Easy and no mess.  </li>
            <li> The only downside to this product is that it is very cheap looking.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately you can contact the company and they will send you a new battery, however that doesn&#x27;t fix the problem, it just makes the waterpik last two more weeks.</li>
            <li> First time using a waterpik water flosser and certainly did not disappointment.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Waterpik!</li>
            <li> First time user and the unit DOES NOT WORK.</li>
            <li> Remember to use YouTube video instruction and follow it exactly during installation.&lt;br /&gt;Too</li>
            <li> I bought mine directly from Waterpik, because amazon didn’t have them available when I wanted it.  </li>
            <li> First use of this cleaned my teeth</li>
            <li> First let me say that when working properly, this device is outstanding for gum health.  </li>
            <li> Water Pic is aware of the problem.  </li>
            <li> So, their customer service is outstanding, and I bumped this item&#x27;s rating back up to 4-stars.</li>
            <li> Not to mention that I could not prevent the connector from leaking (I did follow the instructions exactly) and that the connector looks like the cheapest plastic chrome in the universe.</li>
            <li> She did exactly that</li>
            <li> My wife tried this for the first time and I asked her what she thought.</li>
            <li> In the shower also means we consistently use it every day.</li>
            <li> Next, although you will be able to turn the power off when done with it, water continues to spray out until you are done taking a shower.</li>
            <li> The first one crapped out after 8 months of use.</li>
            <li> but it was leaking at first.</li>
            <li> so I added a moderate amount more: it still leaked.</li>
            <li> The ShowerBreeze has metal threads, installed with no leaks the first time, has infinite settings (it&#x27;s analog; uses a splitter valve), doesn&#x27;t require you to charge a battery</li>
            <li> The first time I used it it hurt a lot and my gums bled a lot.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The water pressure is a bit higher than I would like.  </li>
            <li> Love it, finally got my teenager to floss!</li>
            <li> So I purchased a more simple water flosser that you plug in by WaterPik &amp;</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t overtighten and they last many years.</li>
            <li> This is very convenient, but not as powerful as a countertop model.</li>
            <li> Much better than traditional flossing.  </li>
            <li> think the main problem with the battery is that it quickly looses its charge when it is not being used.  </li>
            <li> better alternative is the ShowerBreeze Water Jet Dental Irrigator, which requires no batteries, and uses a simple valve to operate.  </li>
            <li> and I also ordered the brushing accessory so this works a lot better than the counter-top or hand-held model.</li>
            <li> Be aware that it will also reduce the flow of your shower head since it mounts between it and the water supply.  </li>
            <li> it own conversation, but this is unlike any other they make.</li>
            <li> I received the Showerpik as a Christmas present last Christmas (about 9 months ago) and loved the thing from the start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My shower setup consists of good looking brushed steel and at the end I also have a hose and extra steel shower head.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up returning it, and Amazon was good enough to accept it back without question.</li>
            <li> So for quality of materials, it&#x27;s 50% too high and worth about $30-35.</li>
            <li> Definitely will clean your gums!</li>
            <li> But you should be aware that if you have a modern hand held shower head that is at the end of a flexible hose, and where the plumbing attachment fits close to the wall, you may need to hire a plumber.  </li>
            <li> I got this because I wanted to really use it in the shower, but it is pretty unreliable.</li>
            <li> The unit holder looks flimsy and I wonder how long it will last before breaking, but the Showerpik itself is a pretty good build.&lt;br</li>
            <li> What makes this a great alternative to the standard Waterpik is that there is an endless supply of water, doesn&#x27;t take up much space and</li>
            <li> It would have been nice to have a indicator built into the battery to give warning when you need to recharge, but I generally charge once a week anyway after daily use and have noticed no reduction in power.</li>
            <li> It was an easy enough fix, but something to consider before buying.</li>
            <li> simple and easy to recharge</li>
            <li> I previously had a Showerpik that I liked.</li>
            <li> Once I got the water out of it (it was full), I was able to get it running again for a few weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I would turn the switch to off, it would continue to spray, strong enough to shoot water across the bathroom if the attachment is still on.</li>
            <li> It is powerful on high, but it made a big difference in my oral hygiene in my mouth full of crowns.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much but</li>
            <li> Performs much better than expected</li>
            <li> Water flows through the line but only light air comes through the unit although fully charged and on the faster speed</li>
            <li> /&gt;It gets three stars because I really like this design and the performance when it works (and the customer service).  </li>
            <li> The water keeps on shooting out until the whole shower is turned off.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t mind this so much, because I just wanted the unit to work.  </li>
            <li> VERY moldy smell.</li>
            <li> Very convienent.</li>
            <li> very convenient, doesn&#x27;t take up space on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> to find out that the whole setup depends on a plastic connector-piece onto the existing plumbing.</li>
            <li> settings were the same no difference in motor sound or pressure.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any listings for replacement batteries, so I&#x27;ll try to have the whole unit replaced.</li>
            <li> It makes a very bulky connection and lowers the height of your shower head.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this gadget.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this waterpik!</li>
            <li> The shower head sticks out an additional 2 inches or so, but that&#x27;s really nothing.  </li>
            <li> in mind though…if your Dentist wants you to use it 2-3 times a day, that&#x27;s A LOT of showers.</li>
            <li> Seems like for nearly $60, they should be made of stainless steel or standard water fitting materials...</li>
            <li> really wanted this to work, but</li>
            <li> I gave it one star because it really helped our gums when it did work.  </li>
            <li> Works very well and by doing in the shower you don&#x27;t have all the water spraying all over your bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to continue using this because I need it for gum problems, and there&#x27;s no question it really helps with those.</li>
            <li> The device is supposed to have two speeds - one slower, for more sensitive teeth, and one regular.  </li>
            <li> by far and away the cleanest my mouth/teeth have ever felt !!!</li>
            <li> The battery is removable, holds a charge for about a week, and works well right until the charge is completely lost&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> Those other ones, where you have to keep refilling a tank, is completely comically inefficient.</li>
            <li> No more re-filling &amp; the shower water can be dialed into the most preferred temperature!</li>
            <li> My dentist measured my perio gaps 9 months ago and they have significantly improved while I regularly used this product on almost every tooth!!   </li>
            <li> Yesterday the dental hygienist who suggested this type of product was excited to find that those had healed to be only 4mm and that gum bleeding had also improved.  </li>
            <li> However, we have had four of them in our house, two original purchases and two warranty replacements, and all have not worked properly.  </li>
            <li> As mentioned by other reviewers, there are only two settings with one being really too powerful, but this isn&#x27;t a deal breaker for the low setting is fine for most needs.</li>
            <li> first one leaked at the connection to the shower, even when tightened as far as it would go without breaking it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m cool with only once at the end of my day.</li>
            <li> I struggled using the standard one over the sink due to the mess but this being designed for the shower is perfect.  </li>
            <li> My showerhead is near the ceiling, so that was the first problem.</li>
            <li> It extends the shower head out pretty far</li>
            <li> Battery seems to be needing a charge a little more often after 6 months of use, but otherwise really like it.</li>
            <li> However, I noticed a real difference in my gums when I stopped using it, so I bought a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When we couldn&#x27;t get it working, Waterpik mailed me a whole new unit.</li>
            <li> Sent me a whole new units.  </li>
            <li> Was really easy to install since it does not require any plumbers tape and minimal tools.</li>
            <li> I replaced an older version of the cordless waterpik with this model.  </li>
            <li> When used daily, any gum problems are quickly healed.  </li>
            <li> My wife loves it and so do I,  The only thing that would make it better is to have a way to hang the second tip to the device in the shower.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend using with older plumbing .</li>
            <li> If it lasts at least a year I&#x27;ll be satisfied and would probably get another because the shower attachment is worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I especially like the on/off button located in the handle and the pressure is adequate.  </li>
            <li> We have an older shower head that is not restricted for water pressure</li>
            <li> Seems to work decently.</li>
            <li> The two speeds are deceiving - the low &#x27;speed&#x27; is actually a higher pulse rate but lower pressure, whereas the high &#x27;speed&#x27; is a lower pulse rate but higher pressure.  </li>
            <li> It was convenient to be able to use in the shower where the splashing water wouldn&#x27;t make a mess.  </li>
            <li> It did a good job, but didn&#x27;t last long enough.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s high cost.</li>
            <li> and I would say the high setting on this showerpik is about a 5,6/10 on the one that plugs in.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Waterpik needs to do a little more RD before releasing their products</li>
            <li> I tried again with a little more again</li>
            <li> I am very glad I paid a little extra for the brand</li>
            <li> I found no mention of this anywhere, and there are more than a few reviews where people use cordless flossers in the shower and say they have no problem with it.</li>
            <li> I always start out with good intentions after a Dentist appoinment, trying to floss twice a day, but it never lasted long and after a few months I would reach the point I skipped flossing all together.  </li>
            <li> It worked good, not great.</li>
            <li> Not hard to install,</li>
            <li> I LOVE this thing but the battery doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I like this product, but it sure didn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> It only has 3 settings and the strongest setting is only fairly strong.</li>
            <li> That has not been a problem; possibly the design simply has a constriction to keep the pressure from being too strong.  </li>
            <li> We have both strengthened our gums quite a bit since using this product and its very convenient to have in the shower as to not mess all over the counter-top.</li>
            <li> For me this means I cannot place the unit back in its holder while I&#x27;m still using the shower, since the water would shoot right over the shower door and across the room.  </li>
            <li> No extra parts needed, just hooked right into the existing shower head.  </li>
            <li> so I bought a new one and charged it.  </li>
            <li> Emailed waterpick they are sending a new one.</li>
            <li> They sent me a new one with no objections.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s something I can live with though.</li>
            <li> I should just get a new one sent to me</li>
            <li> How did I live without this?</li>
            <li> we get a new replacement waterpik? or is their some part</li>
            <li> --might as well have bought the new item--for that price you would hope it comes with a new battery as well.</li>
            <li> so I wrote to them yesterday and this morning got an email saying that they were shipping me a new battery.  </li>
            <li> You have to buy a new charger, too, and the set costs $30 plus $6 shipping.</li>
            <li> They are sending me a new battery.</li>
            <li> I did have to buy some extra pieces from the hardware store to make it fit to our grohe shower unit as the water pipe comes out parallel to the wall and not out on an angle/perpendicular.  </li>
            <li> We had to create a custom pvc adapter to get the waterpik to fit which required several visits to our local hardware store, trial and error, and a lot of patience.</li>
            <li> I always use my &amp;#34;Waterpik,&amp;#34; but sometimes you need more water than what the little tank holds!</li>
            <li> So I figured I&#x27;d have to buy another one since I didn&#x27;t have the receipt, but I checked on here first to see if anyone else had a similar issue.</li>
            <li> If you have an issue contact support, you might be surprised!</li>
            <li> Each has had the same problems, and although Waterpik did replace them, and did acknowledge they were aware of these problems, it appears that they would rather just keep replacing them than bother to fix the issues.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure other brand would do the same</li>
            <li> I sent an email detailing the above problems, then I called to ask a question which, incidentally, some of you may be interested to hear</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a couple of problems; on the first unit it just stopped working and the second unit the switch would not stop the water from spraying.  </li>
            <li> Seems pretty fragile.  </li>
            <li> Me personally I like it - but also remember, you can get other heads for it which may reduce the power of the top setting.  </li>
            <li> The whole unit, including the handle, is a rather intrusive presence in your shower, with it&#x27;s large size and long hanging</li>
            <li> They responded quickly and simply sent me a new one without further question.</li>
            <li> So far, it has worked fine, but I&#x27;m concerned about how long it will last.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m hoping she will confirm positive result on next visit.</li>
            <li> Finally, this unit is supposed to be simple to install, and if you have an old fashioned shower head that sticks out of the wall at the end of an arm, then that is probably true.  </li>
            <li> No mess to think about!</li>
            <li> So, a little cheaply made but seems to be working well and holding up well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the cheap plastic connector for this to attach to the pipe, so I did some plumbing and fixed that little problem.</li>
            <li> I really wish Waterpik would have spent a little more money on the connection components.  </li>
            <li> The fitting leaks like crazy, despite following the instructions to the letter.&lt;br /&gt;3.) The fitting is actually quite large and unwieldy.&lt;br /&gt;4.)</li>
            <li> For the experienced and non-experienced DIY-ers amongst you, you can always &amp;#34;go happy&amp;#34; with plastic dissolving crazy glue or even a blowtorch to melt it water-tight.</li>
            <li> Disappointing because when the product works, it is great.</li>
            <li> After nearly 20 years, no lectures.</li>
            <li> early to comment on battery performance.</li>
            <li> So far we have no complaints.  </li>
            <li> The unit just completely died after 4 months.</li>
            <li> decided to return the item per direct and buy a &amp;#34;ShowerBreeze oral care&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Completely unsatisfied with products lifespan.</li>
            <li> , that means it needs to be charged every day, i.e. 7 times a week -  a far cry from the 1 to 2 times stated in the product documentation).</li>
            <li> I would prefer to filter the water that I am directly putting against my gums.</li>
            <li> You want them in the shower hanging up near the device, with a cover over them.</li>
            <li> In that 8-month time, the battery progressively developed shorter run time between charges.</li>
            <li> Only downfall is that with all the hardware it needs it has made my shower head MUCH lower.</li>
            <li> but so far no problems.</li>
            <li> I was surprised the fittings were plastic, they were supposed to be metal</li>
            <li> but I think I must have been one of the early purchasers (I bought it in March 2013).  </li>
            <li> Now, the water never shuts off completely, and I have to remove the tip and just let the water drip</li>
            <li> I went to the dentist in early March for a cleaning</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had 3 or 4 of these and while they&#x27;ve always worked well for about 6 months, they have all had the switch problem where it won&#x27;t turn off and the battery not holding a charge and eventually it stops working completely.</li>
            <li> This hooks to your shower head, so the entire time you&#x27;re in the shower, as long as you&#x27;ve got battery, you&#x27;ve got full power for cleaning between your teeth without any interruptions to refill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> compared to regular Waterpiks is well worth the extra price.</li>
            <li> A good idea, but poorly executed!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas, and he LOVED it, but he showed it to me yesterday and it had broken!</li>
            <li> I got lucky with smacking the product with my palm and got it working again - long enough to get it to shut off.  </li>
            <li> This particular Waterpik Showerpik only lasted two months before it stopped working completely.  </li>
            <li> no mess what so ever.</li>
            <li> no mess</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it works yet because I am currently charging the battery on the waterpik, but the spray from the shower coming into the tube seems to have decent pressure all by itself...</li>
            <li> I am a recently retired dental hygienist and I highly recommend a water irrigation device for almost everyone.  </li>
            <li> but I think its high quality and will last awhile.</li>
            <li> So far two new batteries and one entire unit replaced.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little large, but where it&#x27;s located doesn&#x27;t really matter or get in the way.  </li>
            <li> As others have said, it does bring the shower head out and down a couple of inches, but it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> always keep the cover on the jet tip because it breaks easily and replacements are hard to find.</li>
            <li> are more exposed than the other half.</li>
            <li> The batteries don&#x27;t last long (in terms of how many recharges they can take), they inevitably end up leaking constantly out of the top (whether they&#x27;re turned on or not), and the switch gets broken so the Water Flosser only works at one</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery drains quickly after a few uses or a week or so of non-use.  </li>
            <li> I have charged the battery and have no other options to return the unit or even get a replacement.  </li>
            <li> Only used it a few times so far, but it does the trick adequately.</li>
            <li> wish it had more than two speeds &amp; two ordinary tips, but those are small gripes for all the positive solutions it offered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All in all, the flosser works fine for what I bought it for - getting to small &#x27;pockets&#x27; along the teeth/gum line at the back of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> However in this case the product-engineers were a little too enthusiastic and went somewhat overboard.</li>
            <li> Never really had much pressure anyway</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t even ask for the old one back.</li>
            <li> The 2 speeds are easy to select (despite the other review) and they are different but not extreme (despite the other review).  </li>
            <li> I made a mess the first time I attempted to use it :</li>
            <li> You hardly notice the sound in the shower, but I think the internal pump is quieter anyway.</li>
            <li> One thing I find odd, the green light on the charger only tells you the battery is plugged in and the charger is plugged into a live outlet.</li>
            <li> This is the very first time in ten years that I have returned a product, usually I work my way around it or give it away.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no excuse for this, Waterpik.</li>
            <li> (Sounds crazy, but even powerful enough to clean grout.)  </li>
            <li> Using these things is pretty messy, (just like brushing your teeth), and for me at least, it only makes sense to do all this in the shower, so you can just rinse off right then and there.</li>
            <li> Brand new unit has the same problem I&#x27;ve seen other post.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a couple of months it started to spray water out of the nozzle when the shower was on but the unit was off, this got the bathroom a little but wet even with the protective cap on since it would spray through the vent hole if you didn&#x27;t line it up just right.</li>
            <li> Based on other similar reviews, I would guess that the battery life is about 6-7 months until it completely dies.</li>
            <li> (I have noticed less maximum pressure now in my shower head, but I&#x27;d installed a new shower head at the same time which also could have</li>
            <li> The design of this product is just not up to actual real world use and fails within 6 weeks consistently.  </li>
            <li> However, the battery only lasts for two and a half showers for me and, after I charge it, I frequently forget about putting it back.  </li>
            <li> Back of the toilet, on the shower floor?</li>
            <li> I highly recommend to anyone that needs to floss but is having trouble developing the habit.</li>
            <li> I will last 5-7 days, depending on how long you floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but you had to fill it up at least twice each use because the reservoir isn&#x27;t large enough.</li>
            <li> (price has come down a little) in 2013, almost exactly two years ago to the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a major reduction, but it is noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Battery don&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> Easy to install but a bit difficult to tighten so that it does not leak.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d occasionally hit a soar spot that made it clear I was missing it</li>
            <li> Super frustrating.  </li>
            <li> Another reviewer had mentioned one of the settings as &amp;#34;gum cutting laser,&amp;#34; and while hilarious and not far from the truth, your gums do adjust after constant use.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had to return it because it didn&#x27;t fit my showerhead correctly.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have installed one of these a long time ago.</li>
            <li> It functions as advertised and I expect that to continue as long as the connector holds up.</li>
            <li> As a result, the ceiling above my shower gets wet when I turn on the water in my shower unless  I remember to hold the thing in my hand.  </li>
            <li> So, either I have to get out of the shower dripping wet, or wait til next time.  </li>
            <li> The box was stained and had obviously been wet.</li>
            <li> Several of the items in the box were in already opened plastic bags and were wet.</li>
            <li> The instruction book was stained and obviously had been wet.</li>
            <li> so I had to call their 800 number--on hold a LONG time.</li>
            <li> this thing is such a game changer in dental hygiene, I think I am willing to trade $2 a month for it - no problem</li>
            <li> Though the company seems ready to endlessly replace them, I&#x27;m not ok with that as a solution.  </li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, the connector to the shower head will NOT go on properly and leaks.</li>
            <li> Whether the replacement will last another year remains to be seen, but even if it dies after a year I won&#x27;t feel so bad about spending more money to replace it.</li>
            <li> In any event, after only a few months this unit starting leaking from the attachment connection.</li>
            <li> when the battery goes out, it just starts to slowly dribble and slowly loses strength, so you&#x27;re not sure if it&#x27;s dying, or just becoming more lame.</li>
            <li> The lifespan of this product was less than 6 months and there is only a 30 day return policy.  </li>
            <li> The box was taped shut because it had obviously been previously opened.</li>
            <li> I re installed it several times but you cannot get it to attach symmetrically so half of the threads</li>
            <li> Stopped working less then a year later.  </li>
            <li> Only negative is the battery, the battery is suppose to last 2 weeks but needs to be charged each day after use by my wife and I.</li>
            <li> The battery has lasted several uses between my wife and I, I noticed some people saying they would use it a few times and have to recharge, I haven&#x27;t had this issue.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like it, it is not What i expected.</li>
            <li> worried about the plastic fittings, but was careful and no problems installing.</li>
            <li> I installed it in the shower and weeks later, when it ran out of power, realized the charger had been misplaced.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and my last dentist visit</li>
            <li> I bought mine in August last year and a few months ago</li>
            <li> Like most other bad reviews, the battery will not recharge after 2 months.</li>
            <li> Obviously there is something wrong with this particular item and it will not hold a charge.</li>
            <li> Shower model is not very powerful &amp; needs to recharge about every week.  </li>
            <li> This product improves my life enough, that if mine breaks down in a few months.</li>
            <li> I have to remember to charge the battery once a week, but other than that I have had no issues.  </li>
            <li> or it would spray ceiling of shower endlessly.</li>
            <li> In addition the unit is extremely noisy - was not expecting</li>
            <li> I actually revived one of mine by drilling two small holes (1/16) in the body.  </li>
            <li> It is recommended by one of the other product reviewers.</li>
            <li> You want to keep the soap and other bathroom elements off them when not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> In my case this moved the shower head lower (due to the angle of the pipe coming out of the wall) and forward.  </li>
            <li> The other problem I have with the unit is that it sometimes continues to spray after I&#x27;ve taken my finger off the on button.  </li>
            <li> usually occurs when the battery may be getting low.  </li>
            <li> It is so convenient to just spend a few extra moments in the shower each day and avoid the mess and clutter of the countertop model.  </li>
            <li> Works just like any other Waterpik I have ever used except in the shower.</li>
            <li> It includes a hair trimmer and endless shavers over the years.  </li>
            <li> However, if there is a trend for these units to go bad after a few months of use then Waterpik should reengineer the product or take better steps for quality control at the manufacturing level.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this item, and I&#x27;ve seen at least one other similar review, so</li>
            <li> My dentist gave me a hard time for not flossing enough and my gums were bleeding.  </li>
            <li> My dental hygienist hardly had any scraping to do at my recent appointment</li>
            <li> Nowadays the standards are just as low, but for a crazy HIGH price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> only negative is that the diverter is plastic.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint that I have is the battery life.  </li>
            <li> If one of my kids were to drop the hose with steel showerhead, it is very likely that the impact will immediately snap or at least crack the connector.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> So water gets between the connection and ruins the battery.</li>
            <li> The old shower head is brass, so it is a heavy one, and I&#x27;m afraid the Showerpik will break with the stress and weight of the old head.</li>
            <li> it is not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Therefore I am forced to give it the lowest rating possible.</li>
            <li> The plastic diverter ends up hanging all the way down with the weight.  </li>
            <li> Toggling the switch up and down would stop it, though.</li>
            <li> Heaven knows what happened to the other 2 because we gave them as gifts!  </li>
            <li> There is an internal failure in the unit.</li>
            <li> It installed in less than 1/2 an hour.  </li>
            <li> and I have charged the section three times overnight each time and it still is not adequate water force.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If things look weird, turn the unit around and use the female end for the male pipe coming out of your wall for the shower head.  </li>
            <li> Lasted less than a year.</li>
            <li> Less than 24 hours to react.  </li>
            <li> then battery stops all together,  not worth the trouble,  </li>
            <li> I thought it would help me &amp;#34;floss&amp;#34; more and it would be less messy in the shower, but the experience was very unpleasant.</li>
            <li> The water is always the right temp, there is nothing bad other forgetting to leave the battery on the charger.  </li>
            <li> thats a little over $2 a month.</li>
            <li> When calling the help line there was little help to be found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it was a little cramped in a stall shower</li>
            <li> I could bump it on my hand and get it going, but after a few weeks of that it permanently stopped.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste you your money.</li>
            <li> Trouble getting it hooked up to shower head.</li>
            <li> I use the ShowerPic everyday while I&#x27;m in the shower.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely dead.</li>
            <li> have no complaints about this product, but one should know that it adds a few inches to the length of the pipe coming to your shower head,  </li>
            <li> Had it a few months</li>
            <li> Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s already dead.  </li>
            <li> held shower will destroy this thing in a day or two.</li>
            <li> Works for a few months</li>
            <li> and he uses it everyday</li>
            <li> Threw it away after a few months.  </li>
            <li> Flosser takes a few times to get used to.  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had trouble installing it</li>
            <li> There is no light to tell when it needs recharging.  </li>
            <li> I then use it for a few times and it peters out again.  </li>
            <li> It extends the shower head out a few inches</li>
            <li> a waterpik is a bit messy, so having it in the shower is great.&lt;br /&gt;Hard</li>
            <li> The connector piece appears to be made of some kind of plastic that is painted silver which looks terrible in a nicer bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Additionally, two of them have failed completely where the motor doesn&#x27;t run at all</li>
            <li> going dead, it wouldn&#x27;t fully turn off.  </li>
            <li> I contacted Waterpic, and after a few weeks they sent a broken adapter in a yellow envelope.</li>
            <li> The battery holds a pathetic charge, and as of right now, despite multiple tries at turning it on and off to close the water valve, water still comes through.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does start to slow down as the battery wears down, so we now know when it needs to be recharged.</li>
            <li> Quick update: (5/14/2014)</li>
            <li> No fancy stuff that can easily fail (batteries and battery-chargers, pressure regulators and what not).The pressure is regulated by a simple manual-valve in the steel connector, no batteries to charge or other gimmicks.</li>
            <li> I had to get the first one replaced due to two flaws:  (1) the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge, and (2) the water won&#x27;t shut off.  </li>
            <li> However, it is not easily installed, and the quality is just not there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Less mess!!</li>
            <li> Next time I will buy the less expensive non battery operated flosser ---no muss, no fuss.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It was not possible to install my water filter (to filter our chlorine which is bad for skin/scalp) and this product at the same shower line.  </li>
            <li> Battery pack lasts at least a week to one and one half weeks before needing to be re-charged.  </li>
            <li> I give it TWO THUMBS DOWN!!</li>
            <li> This saves time and has an endless supply of water!!!</li>
            <li> It is a motor running a small piston type pump.  </li>
            <li> I am two weeks past the return they allow and am stuck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had company visiting off and on this past month and tonight I went on line to return  </li>
            <li> I have been through three of these in the past couple of years.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have had the problems described above.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;6 weeks later that unit failed.  </li>
            <li> if you have a small shower or are taller than me, this may be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure why it needs a battery and a pump, house water pressure should of been sufficient.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 66 and have crowded teeth that make regular flossing difficult.  </li>
            <li> My periodontist had done two small surgeries, including a bone graft, to save teeth affected by gum problems.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why the showerhead extender needs to be so bulky.</li>
            <li> , that usually I had a lot of plaque on my rear teeth but that this time I had almost none.</li>
            <li> Had to remove it and now joins the graveyard of other poor quality Waterpik items.</li>
            <li> This has negatively affected my online ordering experience.</li>
            <li> at least a</li>
            <li> After paying what I payed for it, I would expect that it would work for at least a year.  </li>
            <li> It is insane that this is the piece they chose to manufacture cheaply.</li>
            <li> Duh.</li>
            <li> I wholeheartedly recommend this product (at least after one week of use).</li>
            <li> If I had one complaint it would be that the fittings that attach to the shower are plastic ...</li>
            <li> However, in the sixth month, it broke and wouldn&#x27;t turn off, so I contacted Waterpik online and filed a complaint.</li>
            <li> My complaint is that the battery died.    </li>
            <li> My shower head cut through the threads like butter during installation and now I have a slow leak.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as if the washer is missing but worse.</li>
            <li> I really hate to give this one star because when it worked, it worked very well.  </li>
            <li> I was completely disappointed with the previous cordless model, but this one is vastly improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife is not very happy that I am using this in the shower, she says the particles I am washing out of my teeth are going on the shower floor, so every time I use this device she has to brush and sanitize the shower floor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Was very anxious to receive this product, looked out for it every day since ordering.</li>
            <li> Six months in and the battery is completely dead and unit is worthless junk to now be uninstalled from shower at further hassle to me.</li>
            <li> so I think that is a serious problem.  </li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dentist, I have a lot of crowns and it is almost impossible to properly floss.</li>
            <li> The shower we wanted to install this in did not have a typical connection which made it difficult to install.</li>
            <li> So, before you scream about the Showerpik breaking and giving it a bad review, consider this: Waterpik has terrific customer service.</li>
            <li> It is relatively weak.</li>
            <li> that is their poor solution.  </li>
            <li> The slider has a real hard time getting into one of the settings (I can&#x27;t remember which).</li>
            <li> Eventually, I was unable to shut off the water supply, which means even when the shut off the motor and removed the battery, there was a thin stream of water shooting out.  </li>
            <li> After that it failed to hold a charge.</li>
            <li> NOT impressed.  </li>
            <li> As others are reporting, they fail after about six months.  </li>
            <li> so I don’t recommend blindly drilling holes.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind reviewing but find it difficult to come up with 15 words</li>
            <li> eventually the on-off switch failed altogether.</li>
            <li> Within 1 month the unit failed to operate any longer.  </li>
            <li> Amazon replaced it.&lt;br /&gt;Within 1 month that unit failed.  </li>
            <li> (I thought this was really weird about the Showerpik), and doesn&#x27;t have a gaudy shiny silver plastic piece you have to install.</li>
            <li> It is terrible for lasting longer than two weeks.</li>
            <li> The defective one which the replaced, the battery lost it&#x27;s charge and failed recharge.</li>
            <li> Have used it every morning in the shower without fail.  </li>
            <li> To me, that shows that the company is admitting that the WP-480 is hopelessly flawed.</li>
            <li> Wrong.  </li>
            <li> a lot of maintenance if you want it to work well and switch is very poorly made.</li>
            <li> I bought a counter-type Waterpik &amp; hated the noise, the mess, the hassle of refilling &amp; warming water each time (and the loss of countertop space to an unattractive item).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very dumb and disappointing.</li>
            <li> #34;Too bad, you get what you purchased.&amp;#34; I asked for any type of solution because i may have a defective product or the wrong type of product etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m even afraid to look at it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to install it.  </li>
            <li> So frustrating!!  </li>
            <li> Very expensive for an oral irrigator.  </li>
            <li> The design is terrible, the plastic parts are shoddy and prone to leak, the battery gave out after a month--</li>
            <li> This way, you also have the option of using the reservoir for mixing solutions and medicated washes/rinses, etc., which is impossible with this unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d read the bad reviews before ordering.</li>
            <li> nt all that bad.</li>
            <li> The coupling is made out of plastic bad design.</li>
            <li> Bad engineering.</li>
            <li> Bad news is, August of the 2014</li>
            <li> Too bad...</li>
            <li> By itself that would not be a reason for a bad recommendation.  </li>
            <li> painful to start</li>
            <li> Boo:(</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m extremely disappointed caused it cost me a lot to purchase and ship.</li>
            <li> Already!!! :(</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> this was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> There are two speed settings: worthless trickle &amp; gum-cutting laser.</li>
            <li> I have the base unit, but didn&#x27;t like having to fill the container, and sometimes wanted to floss longer than the water supply provided.  </li>
            <li> Also (I hate this)</li>
            <li> VERY FRUSTRATED!</li>
            <li> have to agree with others, the quality is terrible.</li>
            <li> IT IS THE WORST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER BOUGHT!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awful.  </li>
            <li> Their online customer support form was awful</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this 6 months ago after my last dental appointment.  For all of my adult life, my dentist has been lecturing me on how I need to floss more. I always start out with good intentions after a Dentist appoinment, trying to floss twice a day, but it never lasted long and after a few months I would reach the point I skipped flossing all together.  After my last appointment, I saw an ad for this and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  It was easy to install. Only took me about 10 minutes. I have to remember to charge the battery once a week, but other than that I have had no issues.  I added this to my morning shower routine (it only takes a minute). I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was making a difference, it seemed too easy. After using it every morning for 6 months, I went in for my 6 month check up yesterday.  After finishing the exam, the dentist commented on how great I was doing with my brushing and flossing and to keep up the good work. Finally! After nearly 20 years, no lectures. Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I started with a WP-360 and I liked it but you had to fill it up at least twice each use because the reservoir isn&#x27;t large enough. I received the Showerpik as a Christmas present last Christmas (about 9 months ago) and loved the thing from the start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple of months it started to spray water out of the nozzle when the shower was on but the unit was off, this got the bathroom a little but wet even with the protective cap on since it would spray through the vent hole if you didn&#x27;t line it up just right. Months went by and it seemed to get weaker then about 2 weeks ago it quit totally. I tried another battery (A friend has one) and that wasn&#x27;t the problem, so I uninstalled it and you could tell that it was full of water by the squishing sound, then when I took the battery off and shook it and it leaked brown water, I knew something wasn&#x27;t right... So I figured I&#x27;d have to buy another one since I didn&#x27;t have the receipt, but I checked on here first to see if anyone else had a similar issue. I came across a post that said even though they didn&#x27;t have a receipt they went to the Waterpik website and used the online support form. It asked for my personal info and the serial number of the unit. I didn&#x27;t expect much but two days later I received an email telling me a replacement was already in the mail and I could expect it in 7-10 business days. Imagine my surprise when it showed up in the mail the following day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very impressed by the way they handled this and they completely redeemed themselves in my eyes! If you have an issue contact support, you might be surprised!</li>
            <li> This item was recommended by my dentist and worked great for three months.  After that it failed to hold a charge. Very disappointing. I wish I&#x27;d read the bad reviews before ordering.</li>
            <li> No mess, handy, easily used every time we shower. Great alternative to the original Waterpik!</li>
            <li> The battery quit working after 1 month of use.  My boyfriend had been saving this for a gift so the time to return this on amazon has expired.  Now we&#x27;re stuck with a non-working water pik. Boo:(</li>
            <li> This pick has been great.  It was attached easily and seems to work pretty well.  The battery has lasted several uses between my wife and I, I noticed some people saying they would use it a few times and have to recharge, I haven&#x27;t had this issue.  One thing to note, you don&#x27;t NEED plumbers tape to attach this, but I recommend you get some and use it.  It&#x27;s $2 and works wonders.</li>
            <li> Performs much better than expected</li>
            <li> The settings switch stopped selecting the more mild setting after first month. Unit could not be turned off after second month and leaked water whenever shower was on so pick had to be out or it would spray ceiling of shower endlessly. Six months in and the battery is completely dead and unit is worthless junk to now be uninstalled from shower at further hassle to me. Thanks Waterpik! You suck.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The product itself was great (WHEN IT WORKED )...The product lost all pressure.  I&#x27;ve charged the battery fully and there is no blockage or visible damage.  It just quit working.  The lifespan of this product was less than 6 months and there is only a 30 day return policy.  NOT impressed.  Why sell a product if you can only guarantee it working for 30 days!  VERY FRUSTRATED!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and install. Love using it in the shower and my teeth and gums are very thankful. Only problem was after installing, it lowered my shower head by about 2 inches.</li>
            <li> First time user and the unit DOES NOT WORK. Water flows through the line but only light air comes through the unit although fully charged and on the faster speed (hope water flows more powerful).  I charged it for 24 hrs before use as recommended. In addition the unit is extremely noisy - was not expecting that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was very anxious to receive this product, looked out for it every day since ordering. Now I&#x27;m extremely disappointed caused it cost me a lot to purchase and ship. I also purchased a ProFloss water flosser (which was a lot cheaper) for use by my sink and it works with no problems. Wanted a water flosser for in shower use and thought Waterpik to be a reputable line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Must say, I order stuff online a lot but have never gotten a faulty product. This has negatively affected my online ordering experience.</li>
            <li> Unit broke within 2 weeks of using it. Other than that, I was very happy with its performance. Trying to contact manufacturer to get it replaced.</li>
            <li> Item installed and works fine. Remember to use YouTube video instruction and follow it exactly during installation.&lt;br /&gt;Too early to comment on battery performance.</li>
            <li> This was a really nice purchase.  Recharge rate is once every 4-5days with 2 using.  Teeth feel silky smooth clean.  So far we have no complaints.  Haven&#x27;t seen my hygienist since I began using this product so I&#x27;m hoping she will confirm positive result on next visit.</li>
            <li> Nice product but wouldn&#x27;t fit on my more modern shower head on a sliding bar. No alternative was offered by manufacturer. Mounted it in guest bathroom.</li>
            <li> I finally gave up!  I’ve had one of these for about 1.5 years.  As others are reporting, they fail after about six months.  I bought mine directly from Waterpik, because amazon didn’t have them available when I wanted it.  I went through three of these, the original purchase and two replacements.  I have to say the Waterpik customer service was excellent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On two of them the switch failed, and in the latest one it just stopped running.  I could bump it on my hand and get it going, but after a few weeks of that it permanently stopped.  I opened one up to see how it was made.  I have to say I’m impressed with the design and seeming quality.  It is a motor running a small piston type pump.  There are seals and o-rings making it look like a lot of effort went into this design.  However, what I’ve found in all of mine is that they leak internally and fill up with water.  I actually revived one of mine by drilling two small holes (1/16) in the body.  Once I had taken one of them apart I knew where to drill so I don’t recommend blindly drilling holes.  Once I got the water out of it (it was full), I was able to get it running again for a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets three stars because I really like this design and the performance when it works (and the customer service).  The battery life was about a week for me.  It is powerful on high, but it made a big difference in my oral hygiene in my mouth full of crowns.  I liked the “laser cutter” as some others have described it.  The battery powered one I use now is OK, but I have to keep refilling the tank.  I hope Waterpik fixes this, because I want it back!</li>
            <li> easy to mount if you have a talent 4 that kind of thing . by far and away the cleanest my mouth/teeth have ever felt !!!</li>
            <li> Easy to install but a bit difficult to tighten so that it does not leak.  I would prefer metal fittings over plastic.</li>
            <li> Do not purchase from Amazon. I am two weeks past the return they allow and am stuck. After purchasing I charged as the directions said to. It worked beautifully a nice strong stream of water. Shortly though the charge wore off, did again and again and again. I should have returned right away but just thought it would be ok since it worked the first time. I bought it at the suggestion of my dental hygienist and Waterpik does have a good name.  Obviously there is something wrong with this particular item and it will not hold a charge. I&#x27;ve had company visiting off and on this past month and tonight I went on line to return  but Amazon will not allow me to. If you want to purchase be aware of the problem with the charge and return quickly and buy from a store where you can talk to a person.</li>
            <li> As a person who doesn&#x27;t like to floss (read: never floss), I got this and have joined the ranks of people who floss every day. First use of this cleaned my teeth like I had just visited the dentist. I didn&#x27;t like the cheap plastic connector for this to attach to the pipe, so I did some plumbing and fixed that little problem. You never have to worry about filling up a water tank with this thing, and the water is always the perfect temperature. But the biggest plus about this water flosser is the pulsating power! You can get a great floss out of this and when you are done you can turn it around and clean your grout with it - Seriously. The battery lasts a good long time and recharging is easy. If you wanna shower floss, with power; check this gem out.</li>
            <li> I replaced an older version of the cordless waterpik with this model.  I was completely disappointed with the previous cordless model, but this one is vastly improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It&#x27;s hooked up to the shower, so it never runs out of water!&lt;br /&gt;2) The battery is removable, holds a charge for about a week, and works well right until the charge is completely lost&lt;br /&gt;3) It produces a very powerful water jet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is that the diverter is plastic.  So far, it has worked fine, but I&#x27;m concerned about how long it will last.  Also, I have a hand-held shower head hanging off it and it doesn&#x27;t stay up.  The plastic diverter ends up hanging all the way down with the weight.  I&#x27;d buy an all-metal diverter that doesn&#x27;t have a pivot joint if one were available.</li>
            <li> Brand new unit has the same problem I&#x27;ve seen other post. Water flows through the tube to the handheld unit but nothing comes out of the pick. You can hear the pump working but no water at all.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the battery unit is so cheaply made that when I try to remove it from the charger, the bottom of the battery unit doesn&#x27;t move when I twist the top (doing this as it shows in the manual). This causes the bottom of hte battery, the battery inside, and wiring to be left in the charger while the &amp;#34;shell&amp;#34; comes  off.&lt;br /&gt;I have to agree with others, the quality is terrible.</li>
            <li> Once installed the product works great.  I really wish Waterpik would have spent a little more money on the connection components.  The unit itself is great and it has that quality feel similar to our Sonicare toothbrush but that is where the quality ends.  The unit attaches to a plastic tube; to a plastic connecter; to a plastic joint; to a plastic bearing that screws onto you existing shower head pipe.  People who are not that handy or not used to tightening plastic components onto metal fittings may end up breaking the product. Expect several leaky install attempts.</li>
            <li> It died after 3 months of us.  Only two of us in household and we used it in the morning.  Thought it would have lasted about a year or so.  After only a three month trial, I would say it works great!  Would I purchase another one...  Yes but from someplace close to home so that I could take it back if it died in that short period of time.</li>
            <li> Worked well for a week or two then stopped.  I figured it was the battery so I bought a new one and charged it.  Still didn&#x27;t work.  Called for a warranty repair and Waterpik company was great.  They offered me the choice of another Showerpik or an upgrade.  I chose the upgrade.  They sent me an upgrade product and told me to just toss the Showerpik.  They must be having problems with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great customer service though.  I would buy from them again.</li>
            <li> Ive gone through 2 of these because they stop working after 2 months.  So frustrating!!  It is a great product when it works, but why the hell cant they make one that wont break down after 2 months??</li>
            <li> This took 5 minutes to install and operates almodt identical to it&#x27;s sink top sister model.&lt;br /&gt;The best part is that you never seem to &#x27;run out of time&#x27; or &#x27;forget to use&#x27; when its righr there.&lt;br /&gt;Battery is excellent.  Two of us have been using it for almost a month (26 days) and it&#x27;s on its initial charge.</li>
            <li> What a great idea! I always use my &amp;#34;Waterpik,&amp;#34; but sometimes you need more water than what the little tank holds! This saves time and has an endless supply of water!!!</li>
            <li> First let me say that when working properly, this device is outstanding for gum health.  When used daily, any gum problems are quickly healed.  And if you use it consistently you&#x27;ll have your dental hygienist marveling at your beautiful gums and asking you how you manage it.  If I was rating it for this alone, I would give the device five stars.  However, my low rating is because the ShowerPik has several problems that the manufacturer can&#x27;t seem to be bothered to fix.  I have been through three of these in the past couple of years.  Each has had the same problems, and although Waterpik did replace them, and did acknowledge they were aware of these problems, it appears that they would rather just keep replacing them than bother to fix the issues.  The issues are:  1.  The rechargeable battery starts losing its ability to hold a charge within a couple of months of use.  These batteries should be able to hold a charge for a couple of weeks, but pretty soon you&#x27;ll be having to charge it every couple of days, and then every day.  Water Pic is aware of the problem.  2.  The device is supposed to have two speeds - one slower, for more sensitive teeth, and one regular.  The speeds are changed via a switch on the unit.  This switch has not worked on any of the three devices I&#x27;ve had,  There is no difference when switching the speed; it always seems to be on &amp;#34;regular.&amp;#34;  3.  The same switch also is used to turn the Pic on and off.  All three of my units have had the same problem, which is when the unit is switched off, the motor turns off, but the water does not.  The water keeps on shooting out until the whole shower is turned off.  For me this means I cannot place the unit back in its holder while I&#x27;m still using the shower, since the water would shoot right over the shower door and across the room.  Finally, this unit is supposed to be simple to install, and if you have an old fashioned shower head that sticks out of the wall at the end of an arm, then that is probably true.  But you should be aware that if you have a modern hand held shower head that is at the end of a flexible hose, and where the plumbing attachment fits close to the wall, you may need to hire a plumber.  I did, and he found it fairly challenging.  It took him about 45 minutes and cost me about $100.  I didn&#x27;t mind this so much, because I just wanted the unit to work.  Unfortunately I have had the problems described above.  I hope that somebody over there at Water Pic cares enough to read these reviews, and that the one star will get their attention.  It&#x27;s sad when a company has a product that so many people could benefit from, but just doesn&#x27;t seem to care enough to fix basic problems.  My third ShowerPik is dying as I write this.  I really do hope the manufacturer fixes this product because it could be great.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a few months and love it because I gag easily and using this standing up in the shower and not worrying about where the water goes is great</li>
            <li> This is awesome, but mine started to leak after about a year. It wouldn&#x27;t stop shooting water out of the top, so all during my shower there would be this weird extra stream of water.  However, I noticed a real difference in my gums when I stopped using it, so I bought a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated 4/19/16: Moldy smelling. VERY moldy smell. After watching the YouTube video of Waterpik with mold in it, I decided I&#x27;m not going to use these any more.</li>
            <li> It needs more  pressure,  but better than nothing.  I don&#x27;t mind reviewing but find it difficult to come up with 15 words</li>
            <li> Great product for the cost. Very convenient to get done while in the shower, hot water is a great touch.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik  Showerpik does a nice job when working, after a couple of months the on-off swtich began sticking, making it difficlut to turn off......eventually the on-off switch failed altogether.</li>
            <li> Had it for a couple of months.. works great.. very convenient and easy to use.. love that it is in the shower .Wash and pick</li>
            <li> Easy to install. Couldn&#x27;t imagine using sinktop model. Very convienent. For me, something like this needs to be easy to use.</li>
            <li> Worked great for about a month and then quit. Returned to Amazon no problem.</li>
            <li> Garbage lasted for two recharge.Don&#x27;t waste you your money.</li>
            <li> While it worked it seemed to be doing a fine job.  The rechargeable battery didn&#x27;t last a year.</li>
            <li> First time using a waterpik water flosser and certainly did not disappointment.  Always thought it would be great to have something like this installed, didn&#x27;t know waterpik made the showerpik until recently and bought it right away.  Works perfectly! The only complaint that I have is the battery life.  After 1 week of use we noticed a drop in water pressure.  The instructions does tell you it requires to be recharged every week (or more often if used more than once per day).  It would help if there&#x27;s some sort of battery indicating but there isn&#x27;t. This is why I give it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> It isnt as powerful as I thought it would be. Trouble getting it hooked up to shower head. Charge is needed weekly.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have installed one of these a long time ago. It installed in less than 1/2 an hour.  I use the ShowerPic everyday while I&#x27;m in the shower.  It only takes a short time and your teeth will feel great.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised and does what is needed.  My wife loves it and so do I,  The only thing that would make it better is to have a way to hang the second tip to the device in the shower.</li>
            <li> This was so easy for my husband to install!  No extra parts needed, just hooked right into the existing shower head.  Also, this works amazingly as a flosser.  My breath has never been better (according to my husband).  I only use this now, no flossing any more!</li>
            <li> very convenient, doesn&#x27;t take up space on the bathroom counter. It&#x27;s already set up with the shower so no prep is needed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great idea to put this messy but effective tool in the shower! The only draw back would be it&#x27;s high cost. I&#x27;m sure other brand would do the same but we went with the brand name because we didn&#x27;t want to futz about. Some may find that the jet is too strong and stings gums. You get use to it for the quality of the cleaning.</li>
            <li> What makes this a great alternative to the standard Waterpik is that there is an endless supply of water, doesn&#x27;t take up much space and it&#x27;s great not having to worry about accidentally soaking the bathroom mirror. As mentioned by other reviewers, there are only two settings with one being really too powerful, but this isn&#x27;t a deal breaker for the low setting is fine for most needs. Installation is a breeze when connecting to a standard size shower head and battery life is very good. It would have been nice to have a indicator built into the battery to give warning when you need to recharge, but I generally charge once a week anyway after daily use and have noticed no reduction in power. The unit holder looks flimsy and I wonder how long it will last before breaking, but the Showerpik itself is a pretty good build.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;After only a year, the pik constantly streams water when the shower is switched on. Had to remove it and now joins the graveyard of other poor quality Waterpik items.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended the Showerpick and I am very glad he did. I am very satisfied with it,</li>
            <li> This item is really great.  It was easy to install to my existing hand held shower.  Battery pack lasts at least a week to one and one half weeks before needing to be re-charged.  I am planning on getting another one for my children&#x27;s shower.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this purchase, using it on average 3-4 times a week. I purchased this on December 17, 2013 and by April 15, 2014 it no longer worked. It&#x27;s completely dead. I&#x27;ve recharged the battery; it seems to charge just fine. The unit just completely died after 4 months. I don&#x27;t recommend this item, and I&#x27;ve seen at least one other similar review, so I know this isn&#x27;t isolated.  ---------------------------  Quick update: (5/14/2014) I used Waterpik&#x27;s customer service website ([...]) and received a response within a day. Via email, the CSR had me try a couple of different things to see if we could get it working again. When we couldn&#x27;t get it working, Waterpik mailed me a whole new unit. So, their customer service is outstanding, and I bumped this item&#x27;s rating back up to 4-stars.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Come to find out that the whole setup depends on a plastic connector-piece onto the existing plumbing. My shower setup consists of good looking brushed steel and at the end I also have a hose and extra steel shower head. This all is hanging off the plastic connector piece that came with the setup. I&#x27;m even afraid to look at it. I cought myself whispering and tippy-toeing around it. If one of my kids were to drop the hose with steel showerhead, it is very likely that the impact will immediately snap or at least crack the connector.&lt;br /&gt;Therefore I am forced to give it the lowest rating possible. Without the connector the thing has no value.&lt;br /&gt;The design and quality is according to the popular SBWOY standard:&amp;#34;Should Break Within One Year, so we can sell another one&amp;#34;. However in this case the product-engineers were a little too enthusiastic and went somewhat overboard. In my setup with steel pipes it probably won&#x27;t last a week. Not to mention that I could not prevent the connector from leaking (I did follow the instructions exactly) and that the connector looks like the cheapest plastic chrome in the universe. For the experienced and non-experienced DIY-ers amongst you, you can always &amp;#34;go happy&amp;#34; with plastic dissolving crazy glue or even a blowtorch to melt it water-tight. Myself how-ever, I feel that this falls outside my box of expectations, and don&#x27;t like the looks of a plastic blob above my head. Allready a decade ago the market was getting flooded with low quality products (SBWOY-standard) for a low price. Nowadays the standards are just as low, but for a crazy HIGH price.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to return the item per direct and buy a &amp;#34;ShowerBreeze oral care&amp;#34;. It is recommended by one of the other product reviewers. It&#x27;s right in front of me right now and has a STEEL connector. It truly strikes me because of it&#x27;s simplicity. No fancy stuff that can easily fail (batteries and battery-chargers, pressure regulators and what not).The pressure is regulated by a simple manual-valve in the steel connector, no batteries to charge or other gimmicks. The ShowerBreeze is designed according to the KISS standard:&amp;#34;Keep It Simple,...Silly!&amp;#34; and comes for almost a third of the price and probably lasts at least a decade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy a lot of stuff online because my time is scarce. This is the very first time in ten years that I have returned a product, usually I work my way around it or give it away. Returning a product takes time too. I had heard of the product name before and looking at the price, I felt that it had to be of some kind of quality level. Well... I truly got fooled by the companies marketeers, and will avoid any future products with this brand-name.</li>
            <li> This product was great in what it does but the unit is now not functioning only after 6 months of use.  At first it worked great, after about a month the unit started leaking water after you turn it off.  After about 4 months after the leak while it was working one day the unit will not turn on.  I have charged the battery and have no other options to return the unit or even get a replacement.  After paying what I payed for it, I would expect that it would work for at least a year.  Completely unsatisfied with products lifespan.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended it because of impending gum issues.  It was easy to install, and works well.  It&#x27;s a little large, but where it&#x27;s located doesn&#x27;t really matter or get in the way.  Very convenient to have it inline with the warm water, and to use in the shower.</li>
            <li> I have not yet attempted to contact Waterpik warranty, but I intend to shortly. In any event, after only a few months this unit starting leaking from the attachment connection. When I would turn the switch to off, it would continue to spray, strong enough to shoot water across the bathroom if the attachment is still on. Toggling the switch up and down would stop it, though. I put up with this for a couple of months, after which it just sprays all the time while the water is on. It&#x27;s not an issue of the connection with the shower head or anything like that. There is an internal failure in the unit. On top of this, the battery life is horrid. Even from the beginning, we could get 2 full uses out of it. It would lose juice in the middle of the third use (since there were two people using it, that means it needs to be charged every day, i.e. 7 times a week -  a far cry from the 1 to 2 times stated in the product documentation). I would not buy this product again and do not recommend it. If you want to use a power flosser in the shower, buy a regular waterproof one and just carry it with you into the shower. This way, you also have the option of using the reservoir for mixing solutions and medicated washes/rinses, etc., which is impossible with this unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update**&lt;br /&gt;Waterpik customer service and warranty were outstanding. I sent an email detailing the above problems, then I called to ask a question which, incidentally, some of you may be interested to hear so I&#x27;ll mention it as a tangent. Waterpik&#x27;s official statement is that the cordless flossers should not be used in the shower. I found no mention of this anywhere, and there are more than a few reviews where people use cordless flossers in the shower and say they have no problem with it. While this may be true, it&#x27;s good to know that Waterpik hasn&#x27;t designed those products to be used in the shower, and if you damage one in the shower, you may not get warranty service for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the point, when I called with my question I mentioned my warranty claim. The agent looked up my claim with just my email address and in seconds told me they would send me an advance replacement and that she would personally see it was taken care of the same day. She did exactly that and my replacement was shipped the same day using expedited shipping. I should receive it tomorrow. Whether the replacement will last another year remains to be seen, but even if it dies after a year I won&#x27;t feel so bad about spending more money to replace it. As a family we spend way more than $70 per year on floss and toothbrushes so $35 per year over 2 years for a water flosser &#x27;aint all that bad.</li>
            <li> Great concept. This is the second one I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first one leaked at the connection to the shower, even when tightened as far as it would go without breaking it. The coupling is made out of plastic bad design. The second one only had one setting that worked.&lt;br /&gt;Both settings were the same no difference in motor sound or pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waterpik needs to do a little more RD before releasing their products</li>
            <li> Ok. So I bought this (price has come down a little) in 2013, almost exactly two years ago to the day. I think today, after some warning signs, it finally died on me. The battery holds a pathetic charge, and as of right now, despite multiple tries at turning it on and off to close the water valve, water still comes through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;here&#x27;s the funny part: i am going to buy another one right now. if one lasts 2 years, and costs $50, we&#x27;re look at $25 per year &amp;#34;usage fees&amp;#34; as another way to think about it. thats a little over $2 a month. this thing is such a game changer in dental hygiene, I think I am willing to trade $2 a month for it - no problem&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t know about Waterpik&#x27;s, thats it own conversation, but this is unlike any other they make. Those other ones, where you have to keep refilling a tank, is completely comically inefficient. This hooks to your shower head, so the entire time you&#x27;re in the shower, as long as you&#x27;ve got battery, you&#x27;ve got full power for cleaning between your teeth without any interruptions to refill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also as an avid tooth-brusher-in-the-shower, this thing fits in to my whole &#x27;dental routine&#x27; perfectly. Using these things is pretty messy, (just like brushing your teeth), and for me at least, it only makes sense to do all this in the shower, so you can just rinse off right then and there.</li>
            <li> The shiny plastic piece that connects to the shower head was a big mistake. My shower head cut through the threads like butter during installation and now I have a slow leak. I would have gladly paid a little more for a metal connector, and will begrudgingly buy one separately if it is offered. It is insane that this is the piece they chose to manufacture cheaply. Very dumb and disappointing. No complaints at all about the unit itself. It functions as advertised and I expect that to continue as long as the connector holds up.</li>
            <li> Works great for people who always forget to floss like me. I would like to keep my teeth so I am always reminded while in the shower and it is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> For those of us with gum problems this item is the ticket.</li>
            <li> Works great! Comes with two piks. My wife tried this for the first time and I asked her what she thought. She said, &amp;#34;tastes like blood&amp;#34;. I told her, &amp;#34;then it&#x27;s working!&amp;#34;. We have both strengthened our gums quite a bit since using this product and its very convenient to have in the shower as to not mess all over the counter-top. In the shower also means we consistently use it every day. Having a warm shower means warm pik water, which is actually nice on my sensitive teeth. I recommend this product for anyone wanting to up their gum health.</li>
            <li> Makes your mouth tickle. Good pressure</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite items.  I love being able to clean my teeth in the shower without getting water every where - which would happen with a traditional waterpik!  This is a must have for you clean freaks out there!!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t imagine using this outside of the shower. Works perfectly in the shower.  Battery seems to be needing a charge a little more often after 6 months of use, but otherwise really like it.</li>
            <li> Installation was a breeze and the plastic fitting is a non-issue. I agree with all those who said that the device works great, until it dies! The first sign that it has reached mid-life is when it stops holding a charge for more than a couple of days.  Next, although you will be able to turn the power off when done with it, water continues to spray out until you are done taking a shower. One quick remedy is to take off the nozzle so that the water won&#x27;t spray across the room when you hang the device on its mount. Based on other similar reviews, I would guess that the battery life is about 6-7 months until it completely dies. I bought mine in Sept 2013 and it died April 2014. What I want to know is did the device die or was it just the battery?  I don&#x27;t see any listings for replacement batteries, so I&#x27;ll try to have the whole unit replaced.</li>
            <li> Nice to use but you cannot shut off the water flow.  It makes a very bulky connection and lowers the height of your shower head.  The weight of the unit ended up breaking off our water supply pipe in the wall.  I don&#x27;t recommend using with older plumbing .</li>
            <li> Excited to have the product, and installation went without too many hitches for an old woman.  The water pressure was fine at first and I have charged the section three times overnight each time and it still is not adequate water force.&lt;br /&gt;Please advise me as to how to get more power.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Had to send it back twice but the third one worked great.</li>
            <li> I had the old waterpic for years, but this is hands down the best, I hit the shower, rinse with some mouthwash, floss, use this thing, which takes up no space in our fairly small bathroom, when I get out of the shower my mouth and gums feel great.  The water is always the right temp, there is nothing bad other forgetting to leave the battery on the charger.  Good product.</li>
            <li> Works well but quit in just two weeks.. Emailed waterpick they are sending a new one. Hopefully this works better.</li>
            <li> Love the device, fast easy to use, however, while you are flossing you are wasting water.  How many times have we been told to turn off the faucet while brushing our teeth.  Well, here you are standing under the shower and it has to run while you are flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second there should be a water filter as well. I would prefer to filter the water that I am directly putting against my gums. I filter the water I drink. And actually the showerhead has a built in water filter, however, the way the connector is made you can only add a shower head. This could be an ADD on, it could a be an inline filter attached between the hose and shower connector.  Maybe package them together with the following suggestion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirdly. It comes with two flossing devices, where do you store them between uses?  Back of the toilet, on the shower floor? You want them in the shower hanging up near the device, with a cover over them. No hanging device comes with.  You want to keep the soap and other bathroom elements off them when not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give it 5 stars, however, I see the above mentioned issues as ones which need to be addressed.</li>
            <li> The first one crapped out after 8 months of use. They sent me a new one with no objections. In that 8-month time, the battery progressively developed shorter run time between charges. One thing I find odd, the green light on the charger only tells you the battery is plugged in and the charger is plugged into a live outlet. It would be an improvement if a light told you when it was fully charged.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist said that my teeth are fantastic (no cavities at 40) but my gum are eroding faster than the arctic ice.  Flossing is not an option as I just can&#x27;t seem to get into the habit so I saw this beauty and thought I would give it a try.  I have used about 10 times since installing it (2-3 minutes per use) and the battery is still holding its initial charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 2 settings available and I have used the higher setting every time with excellent results.  The installation kit was super easy to install though my rainfall showered got about 3 inches lower.  When I shower I usually spend 2-3 minutes just enjoying the cascading warm water.  Now I simply enjoy the cascading water while cleaning my gums.  Great product and I highly recommend to anyone that needs to floss but is having trouble developing the habit.</li>
            <li> It has been great, we use it in the shower everyday.  I did have to buy some extra pieces from the hardware store to make it fit to our grohe shower unit as the water pipe comes out parallel to the wall and not out on an angle/perpendicular.  It was an easy enough fix, but something to consider before buying.</li>
            <li> Used four times and the battery ran low. Itworked one time after 2nd charging then quit. It was leaking a rust colored liquid out of the bottom and now it just hangs in the shower since I have already tossed out the packaging. Junk</li>
            <li> Stopped working after a week. Water intrusion. Lol. You would think they would design a device intended for use in the shower to be waterproof. Duh.</li>
            <li> I had to get the first one replaced due to two flaws:  (1) the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge, and (2) the water won&#x27;t shut off.  The replacement does not have the battery problem, but still has the no-shut-off problem.  As a result, the ceiling above my shower gets wet when I turn on the water in my shower unless  I remember to hold the thing in my hand.  It&#x27;s not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item to help me take better care of my teeth.  When it arrived, I absolutely loved this model.  Within 1 month the unit failed to operate any longer.  Amazon replaced it.&lt;br /&gt;Within 1 month that unit failed.  Waterpik replaced it.&lt;br /&gt;6 weeks later that unit failed.  Waterpik replaced it.&lt;br /&gt;6 weeks later, that unit failed.&lt;br /&gt;I gave up.&lt;br /&gt;These are great tool but are not made to last.  Though the company seems ready to endlessly replace them, I&#x27;m not ok with that as a solution.  The design of this product is just not up to actual real world use and fails within 6 weeks consistently.  Do not buy this product.  Learn to floss.</li>
            <li> this product is great, so easy and convenient it has turned me into a daily flosser, my dentist and hygenist will be happy!!!</li>
            <li> Got the kids to use it as it was so easy for them to do.  Easy to install, just great.</li>
            <li> I love this! I keep it in the shower and with the diverter thing, it helps you get that water force to help get a great floss.  The shower is the perfect place to waterpik too!</li>
            <li> There are two speed settings: worthless trickle &amp; gum-cutting laser. The slider has a real hard time getting into one of the settings (I can&#x27;t remember which). I had issues installing it. I had it working but it was leaking at first. So, I took it off, inspected the plumbing tape and figured I needed more. I didn&#x27;t want to overdo it so I added a moderate amount more: it still leaked. I tried again with a little more again and my shower head&#x27;s metal threads absolutely destroyed the cheap plastic threads. I took it off, threw it in the box, and purchased a ShowerBreeze Oral Irrigation system. The ShowerBreeze has metal threads, installed with no leaks the first time, has infinite settings (it&#x27;s analog; uses a splitter valve), doesn&#x27;t require you to charge a battery (I thought this was really weird about the Showerpik), and doesn&#x27;t have a gaudy shiny silver plastic piece you have to install. The ShowerBreeze&#x27;s tips are much more comfortable, as well.</li>
            <li> Installed both the shower head and showerpik. Both were very easy to install, installation instructs are very clear. Shower head is excellent. Showerpik seems to work well, the proof will be when I have my next hygienist exam/cleaning. Only negative is the battery, the battery is suppose to last 2 weeks but needs to be charged each day after use by my wife and I.</li>
            <li> I love my showerpik! It works great and it&#x27;s convenient to have in the shower. Only downfall is that with all the hardware it needs it has made my shower head MUCH lower. It&#x27;s something I can live with though.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUT THE WATER PIK 480 IT IS THE WORST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER BOUGHT! The battry polls rust the switch doesn&#x27;t work I want my money back!</li>
            <li> Easy to install. Dentist saw improvement</li>
            <li> So far very pleased with water pik. I use it daily and the temp of water is always great. Hopefully the dentist sees a difference in pockets.on gums. Once a week I set it in charger to recharge. I was a bit worried about the materials used to hook between shower head and water pik (plastic) but so far no problems.</li>
            <li> I installed this product one month ago.  Installation took twenty minutes and should be simple enough for anybody with basic handyman skills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit seems to be well made and is working as intended.  Using this device in the shower is a much more pleasant option for me than flossing and I didn&#x27;t want to lose more counter space to a bulky counter top Waterpik unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no complaints about this product, but one should know that it adds a few inches to the length of the pipe coming to your shower head,  In my case this moved the shower head lower (due to the angle of the pipe coming out of the wall) and forward.  It&#x27;s no big deal because my shower is big enough and I&#x27;m only 5&#x27;10, but if you have a small shower or are taller than me, this may be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviews here state that their unit started developing problems after 6 months of use.  This product improves my life enough, that if mine breaks down in a few months. . . I&#x27;ll buy another.</li>
            <li> Easy to install, works as promised. The endless supply of warm water and no mess in the bathroom made it an ideal choice for my daughter with braces.</li>
            <li> Had it a few months and I use it since it is conveniently in the shower and also not taking up a ton of counter space. Has a good pulsating stream, but the battery only holds a charge for 2 or maybe 3 days. Not hard to install, but I never could get it to thread quite correctly where it didn&#x27;t drip some, and I was surprised the fittings were plastic, they were supposed to be metal I thought. So, a little cheaply made but seems to be working well and holding up well. If it lasts at least a year I&#x27;ll be satisfied and would probably get another because the shower attachment is worth it to me.</li>
            <li> works good except (1) hose is too short and (2) charger indicator light does not go out when battery is fully charged (I&#x27;ve charged it for 24 hours and the light is still lit!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awful.  No power at all.  It started out great the first day and then after the battery went down and had to be charged it never produced any kind of water pressure again.  Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I am very glad I paid a little extra for the brand name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros&lt;br /&gt;-great build quality&lt;br /&gt;-very strong water stream&lt;br /&gt;-battery lasts about a week. simple and easy to recharge&lt;br /&gt;-easy install&lt;br /&gt;-hangs up high perfect, out of reach of the munchkins&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons&lt;br /&gt;-I wish the attachment that screws into the pipe was metal and not plastic.</li>
            <li> It is great for cleaning your teeth. It is terrible for lasting longer than two weeks. The problem with this product is that there is no rubber seal between the battery and the pik. So water gets between the connection and ruins the battery. Fortunately you can contact the company and they will send you a new battery, however that doesn&#x27;t fix the problem, it just makes the waterpik last two more weeks. I would recommend looking somewhere else for a waterpik.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this gadget. I thought it would help me &amp;#34;floss&amp;#34; more and it would be less messy in the shower, but the experience was very unpleasant. Also it lowers the shower head quite a bit.</li>
            <li> Very powerful!  This is a great product, no mess on countertop, mirror, &amp; no reservoir to deal with.  Easy to install, took about 10 minutes.  It has a plastic cap for the tip so you don&#x27;t get soap on the tip.  It also has a slow/ fast button, which is very nice.  I highly recommend this waterpik!</li>
            <li> Useful, and my dentist gave it the thumbs up.  After two months though, it will stopped being able to turn off.  The on/off switch has no affect, and gets water all over the ceiling.  It only stops spurting water when I turn the shower off.</li>
            <li> This water pick is the best because you do not have to deal with the inevitable &amp;#34;Water Pick splash fest&amp;#34; on your mirror and sink.  It did not change my water pressure at all.  The shower head sticks out an additional 2 inches or so, but that&#x27;s really nothing.  The hose is nice and long so I can pretend its a microphone and rock out after it cleans my teeth.  It also doubles as a watergun.  A great way to surprise my girlfriend when she is in the bathroom while I&#x27;m in the shower.  Changed my life.</li>
            <li> I bought a counter-type Waterpik &amp; hated the noise, the mess, the hassle of refilling &amp; warming water each time (and the loss of countertop space to an unattractive item).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Showerpik solves all these issues. I hooked it up with only a pair of pliers (took 15mins), used it tonight for the 1st time. You hardly notice the sound in the shower, but I think the internal pump is quieter anyway. No mess to think about! No more re-filling &amp; the shower water can be dialed into the most preferred temperature! Takes up no space &amp; is not a bother in the shower at all. The mount is out of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it had more than two speeds &amp; two ordinary tips, but those are small gripes for all the positive solutions it offered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind though…if your Dentist wants you to use it 2-3 times a day, that&#x27;s A LOT of showers. I&#x27;m cool with only once at the end of my day.</li>
            <li> Fairly easy to attach to my Waterpik showerhead but no amount of tightening stops it from leaking.  The instructions says to prevent this try rubbing soap around the connection.  I think they have had this problem and that is their poor solution.  Bad engineering. Next time I will buy the less expensive non battery operated flosser ---no muss, no fuss.  Hint--always keep the cover on the jet tip because it breaks easily and replacements are hard to find.</li>
            <li> This thing works great!  No issues whatsoever.</li>
            <li> after a month the switch had to be switched off and on several times to get it to shut off&lt;br /&gt;off the water flow and about another month later the switch would not work at all&lt;br /&gt;i bought the most expensive one i could find thinking it would be the best for my&lt;br /&gt;new bathroom remodel&lt;br /&gt;piece of garbage</li>
            <li> For the most part, I&#x27;m very pleased with the Showerpik.  The concept is excellent but I think I must have been one of the early purchasers (I bought it in March 2013).  Overall, I love the the way it works and it does an excellent job of keeping my teeth clean along the gumline (my dental hygenist said she noticed a difference when I began using it).  I&#x27;ve had a couple of problems; on the first unit it just stopped working and the second unit the switch would not stop the water from spraying.  Customer Service was very responsive both times and replaced the units quickly and promptly.</li>
            <li> I installed this in my steam shower and it&#x27;s a great addition.  I can sit and have a steam while cleaning my teeth.  My dentist gave me a hard time for not flossing enough and my gums were bleeding.  The first time I used it it hurt a lot and my gums bled a lot.  As my gum health improved, It felt great.  I&#x27;d occasionally hit a soar spot that made it clear I was missing it so i&#x27;d focus on that area more. I went back to the dentist 3 months later to follow up and he said my gums looked great and that I had &amp;#34;found the answer&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I followed the instructions and charged the battery for 24 hours before using it, the battery lasts a week before needing to recharge over night.  Being attached to the shower, there is no time limit and you can use warm water.</li>
            <li> painful to start but you get use to it - easy install</li>
            <li> I am a recently retired dental hygienist and I highly recommend a water irrigation device for almost everyone.  The convenience of a shower pic is terrific.  This product has two speeds and works well.  I especially like the on/off button located in the handle and the pressure is adequate.  However, the battery only lasts for two and a half showers for me and, after I charge it, I frequently forget about putting it back.  So, either I have to get out of the shower dripping wet, or wait til next time.  The other problem I have with the unit is that it sometimes continues to spray after I&#x27;ve taken my finger off the on button.  I&#x27;ve gotten hit in the eye on two occasions.&lt;br /&gt;This usually occurs when the battery may be getting low.  It doesn&#x27;t happen often enough to get used to it so I think that is a serious problem.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product until they fix these issues.</li>
            <li> Loved my Waterpik, would have given it a 5 but i didn&#x27;t care for the plastic fixture/parts. Plus it should have come with plumber&#x27;s tape.</li>
            <li> Some issues....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The water pressure is a bit higher than I would like.  If I point the spray at my hand the spray can hurt.  Hence this could be used as a weapon should a shower intruder get too close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was not possible to install my water filter (to filter our chlorine which is bad for skin/scalp) and this product at the same shower line.  When calling the help line there was little help to be found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found a 3 way line thing-ee which allows the shower line to go to the waterpick and the shower at the same time.</li>
            <li> Best amazon purchase all year. I have periodontal gum disease so this unit is a huge blessing to me. I struggled using the standard one over the sink due to the mess but this being designed for the shower is perfect.  I can really get a good deep clean with no mess</li>
            <li> we ordered 3 of these....on 1 the switch broke.  They replaced it .  The defective one which the replaced, the battery lost it&#x27;s charge and failed recharge. Heaven knows what happened to the other 2 because we gave them as gifts!  A good idea, but poorly executed!</li>
            <li> Works great and a real convenience to floss in the shower.</li>
            <li> This was NOT advertised as a refurbished item. Who would buy a used dental device? That&#x27;s what I got. The box was stained and had obviously been wet. The box was taped shut because it had obviously been previously opened. Several of the items in the box were in already opened plastic bags and were wet. The instruction book was stained and obviously had been wet. I should just get a new one sent to me but no, now I have to take time out of my day to return this, after which, I will have to wash my hands.</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding product.  My dentist measured my perio gaps 9 months ago and they have significantly improved while I regularly used this product on almost every tooth!!   Don&#x27;t be afraid to install it.  Just unscrew your shower head and screw this one one following the instructions.  If things look weird, turn the unit around and use the female end for the male pipe coming out of your wall for the shower head.  Its plastic, but I think its high quality and will last awhile.</li>
            <li> Love it, finally got my teenager to floss! Less mess!!</li>
            <li> My hygienist recommended this brand for my shower. Unfortunately, I had to return it because it didn&#x27;t fit my showerhead correctly. It seemed like a great idea for convenience, but I should have taken some measurements before hand. I liked the design though. So I purchased a more simple water flosser that you plug in by WaterPik &amp; this is my first day trying it! Excited to see some results!&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> This product worked fine until it broke during the fifth month of normal use. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Just purchased shortly before Christmas and it&#x27;s already dead.  Never really had much pressure anyway but I wanted an option to use a waterpik in my shower so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about splashing water everywhere.  Would not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I originally ordered the Waterpik in April 2014. Three months later the motor just stopped working. I followed all directions with installation, charging the battery, keeping the battery leads clean, etc. I contacted Amazon and they replaced the product promptly. Kudos to Amazon customer service, they were amazing. Bad news is, August of the 2014 my replacement stopped working again. Same thing, the motor just dies. Works 100% one day, 0% the next. There is no water damage on the battery terminal, no indication whatsoever of why it stops, it just stops. Disappointing because when the product works, it is great. I’m hoping I just got two defective products and others enjoy theirs.</li>
            <li> Very powerful. Convenient.</li>
            <li> After only a couples months use the water will not stop squirting out of the waterpik even though I it&#x27;s turned off.  The water will only stop once you turn the shower off.  It still works and I do love it, I just wish I could figure out why the water continues to spray even though I&#x27;ve turned it off.  It&#x27;s just a pit of a pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great results from the dentist though and I wouldn&#x27;t go a day without using it.  Also nice is you don&#x27;t see all the junk falling out of your mouth into the sink!</li>
            <li> Great product works very well.</li>
            <li> I give it TWO THUMBS DOWN!! a lot of maintenance if you want it to work well and switch is very poorly made.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas, and he LOVED it, but he showed it to me yesterday and it had broken! Already!!! :(</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, the connector to the shower head will NOT go on properly and leaks. I re installed it several times but you cannot get it to attach symmetrically so half of the threads are more exposed than the other half. It&#x27;s as if the washer is missing but worse. Furthermore, it&#x27;s PLASTIC, light weight and my hand held shower will destroy this thing in a day or two. PLUS the entire mechanism goes flying around all over the place and the water pic keeps falling out of it&#x27;s holder. LOL really. I&#x27;m going with the Shower Breeze.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like it, it is not What i expected.</li>
            <li> Worked awesome for 3-4 weeks and then died.  Fabulous customer service at Waterpik to send a new one immediately.  Hoping this one doesn&#x27;t die.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  Seems pretty fragile.  Cuts the flow a bit coming out of the shower head.  The flossing flow doesn&#x27;t seem to have enough pressure.  We use the regular waterpik on the sink most of the time, more pressure.  We have an older shower head that is not restricted for water pressure (my wife likes the water to &#x27;blast&#x27; on her).  The old shower head is brass, so it is a heavy one, and I&#x27;m afraid the Showerpik will break with the stress and weight of the old head.</li>
            <li> Works for a few months then battery stops all together,  not worth the trouble,  now i need to return another one.</li>
            <li> I like the design and I like how it&#x27;s supposed to work.  I bought one of these on March 2015 and it worked well up until this month (Aug 2015) so I had almost 5 months of use before it sprung a leak and stopped pulsating at any setting.  I&#x27;ll have to pursue a claim with Waterpik for an exchange as the seller here on Amazon (Alfatronix) cannot do anything for me after 30 days.  Another reviewer had mentioned one of the settings as &amp;#34;gum cutting laser,&amp;#34; and while hilarious and not far from the truth, your gums do adjust after constant use.  This is an excellent product when it works as designed.  However, if there is a trend for these units to go bad after a few months of use then Waterpik should reengineer the product or take better steps for quality control at the manufacturing level.</li>
            <li> Lasted less than a year. Awesome while it lasted but for the price I expect for it to last more than 11 months.</li>
            <li> Want to buy one for my spouse</li>
            <li> Easy install and works great. To folks concerned about the plastic pipe fittings, that&#x27;s what 90% of shower heads, etc. come with these days. Sign of the times. Just don&#x27;t overtighten and they last many years. This thing works great and the lack of mess on counters, mirrors, etc. compared to regular Waterpiks is well worth the extra price. I wholeheartedly recommend this product (at least after one week of use).</li>
            <li> My husband likes it, I was going to return it, because I don&#x27;t like warm water in my waterpik, so I will keep using the countertop model.</li>
            <li> I bought this a couple months ago and use it daily. My dental hygienist hardly had any scraping to do at my recent appointment and I have moved my cleaning appointments from every six months to once a year.&lt;br /&gt;It went into my shower unit very easily, has no leaks or issues of any sort. I notice that the price has dropped since I bought mine.But that&#x27;s ok. It&#x27;s worth twice the price. Happy Birthday to me.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this thing but the battery doesn&#x27;t last very long. I&#x27;m now looking into getting a second battery to put into rotation.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s working great. We&#x27;ve only had it a month or so. But it was easy to hook up. My boyfriend loves it. I couldn&#x27;t get him to floss so I got him this and he uses it everyday</li>
            <li> Have had this for 6 weeks now and I can&#x27;t imagine how anyone would use a countertop Waterpik anymore.  It is so convenient to just spend a few extra moments in the shower each day and avoid the mess and clutter of the countertop model.  Flossing with warm water feels like my teeth are getting cleaner and is very nice if you have sensitive teeth.  As others have said, it does bring the shower head out and down a couple of inches, but it is worth it.  No problems with installation.  Do wish there was a convenient way to keep both tips in the shower at all times for both of us.</li>
            <li> If there was an option lower than 1 star, it would not be low enough!! Do not purchase this product! I received this product and it did NOT install properly. Come to find out, there is an adapter you need to install this product into your shower...this adapter is NOT included! I contacted Waterpic, and after a few weeks they sent a broken adapter in a yellow envelope. I told them i would like to have a replacement sent out and they said &amp;#34;Too bad, you get what you purchased.&amp;#34; I asked for any type of solution because i may have a defective product or the wrong type of product etc. I was told i was being ignored and should go elsewhere. Do not buy! Save your time and money. it is not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it about three weeks. Great product, easy to use, no mess what so ever. Would recomend it.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Best way to floss EVER!</li>
            <li> Like most other bad reviews, the battery will not recharge after 2 months.</li>
            <li> This is an interesting product in that when it works I just love it, but I have had to have a unit replaced because it just stopped after a few weeks use.  The exchange went perfectly and my new device seems to be working well.  Only time will tell.</li>
            <li> Battery don&#x27;t last very long.  Like a day so it always has to be on the charger.  Not sure why it needs a battery and a pump, house water pressure should of been sufficient.  Makes a lot of noise, pulses a lot not even flow.  Threw it away after a few months.  A good concept, will buy if they come out with a better version someday.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading all the reviews. It was easy to install, and it works great when it works. The 2 speeds are easy to select (despite the other review) and they are different but not extreme (despite the other review).  Both speeds work and neither speed hurt my gums.  I use it daily, which is why I purchased this model of flosser.  I have the base unit, but didn&#x27;t like having to fill the container, and sometimes wanted to floss longer than the water supply provided.  So, this was the perfect answer.  The battery life is good.  I tend to recharge it every 2-3 days, just because it&#x27;s easy to do.  I will last 5-7 days, depending on how long you floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, why didn&#x27;t I give it 5 stars, and what is the &amp;#34;but&amp;#34;? After about 2-3 months the shut off switch started malfunctioning, and it took several attempts to shut off both the motor and the water supply.  Eventually, I was unable to shut off the water supply, which means even when the shut off the motor and removed the battery, there was a thin stream of water shooting out.  Now, the water never shuts off completely, and I have to remove the tip and just let the water drip or I have a stream of water shooting at me or the walls or ceiling.  I haven&#x27;t yet contracted Waterpik, but will update this review when I do.  Has anyone else experienced this problem?</li>
            <li> Great when it&#x27;s working. So far two new batteries and one entire unit replaced.</li>
            <li> best way to water pik your teath! no mess no fuss. stays charged for weeks. always within reach. your dendtist will love you!</li>
            <li> It is relatively weak. It only has 3 settings and the strongest setting is only fairly strong. I also have the sink-top model and I would say the high setting on this showerpik is about a 5,6/10 on the one that plugs in. Also, the battery only lasts maybe 2-3 uses in the shower. I got this because I wanted to really use it in the shower, but it is pretty unreliable. Also (I hate this) when the battery goes out, it just starts to slowly dribble and slowly loses strength, so you&#x27;re not sure if it&#x27;s dying, or just becoming more lame. I wish it would be either full battery or just shut off.</li>
            <li> Initially took some time and maneuvering to install in my shower as I already have a fogless mirror hooked up to the shower pipe.  Had to work around a couple of leaks but got them under control.  Even with mirror installed, still have enough clearance with shower head.  Flosser takes a few times to get used to.  The two speeds are deceiving - the low &#x27;speed&#x27; is actually a higher pulse rate but lower pressure, whereas the high &#x27;speed&#x27; is a lower pulse rate but higher pressure.  After a couple of weeks of use have noticed that it takes a couple of attempts to shut off water flow sometimes (pulse stops but water keeps flowing), but another on/off switch movement shuts it off.  I charge the battery every 4-5 days which has been sufficient.  All in all, the flosser works fine for what I bought it for - getting to small &#x27;pockets&#x27; along the teeth/gum line at the back of my mouth.  I don&#x27;t know anyone would do this at the sink without spraying water all over everywhere.</li>
            <li> My wife Likes it .....she&#x27;s been using it for about a month.</li>
            <li> This is very convenient, but not as powerful as a countertop model. Now I find that the water stream never fully shuts off (even though the pulsing can be turned off). So there is a constant stream of water emerging from the device whenever the shower is on.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I thought it would be a time-saver to water-pik in the shower. However, it is not easily installed, and the quality is just not there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) My showerhead is near the ceiling, so that was the first problem. The nozzle of the water-pik was jamming up against the ceiling.&lt;br /&gt;2.) The fitting leaks like crazy, despite following the instructions to the letter.&lt;br /&gt;3.) The fitting is actually quite large and unwieldy.&lt;br /&gt;4.) The whole unit, including the handle, is a rather intrusive presence in your shower, with it&#x27;s large size and long hanging cord.&lt;br /&gt;5.) The fitting is made of a very cheap plastic, that seems as though it would easily crack with the slightest over-tensioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, this product is not executed elegantly. This product would be much better if it a.) was made of metal; b.) had a retractable cord, c.) the fittings were not as big; d.) The handle was smaller, and; e.) the handle was mountable elsewhere in the shower, rather than on the shower head itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up returning it, and Amazon was good enough to accept it back without question.</li>
            <li> Works just like any other Waterpik I have ever used except in the shower. Was really easy to install since it does not require any plumbers tape and minimal tools. Battery life seems good as well. I have not had to recharge the battery yet and have had and used the device now for over 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> The battery dies EXTREMELY quickly. Like... one shower. So be prepared to constantly be putting this thing on the charger.</li>
            <li> How did I live without this? Get one for yourself and more for relatives. Magic.</li>
            <li> I love how convenient this is and my teeth haven&#x27;t felt this clean without going to the dentist. This is a spectacular product for people with a permanent retainer or braces.</li>
            <li> The main factor is that it has made a significant difference in my oral health.  I&#x27;m 66 and have crowded teeth that make regular flossing difficult.  My periodontist had done two small surgeries, including a bone graft, to save teeth affected by gum problems.  Six months ago I was warned that two more teeth were borderline candidates (6mm pockets).  Yesterday the dental hygienist who suggested this type of product was excited to find that those had healed to be only 4mm and that gum bleeding had also improved.  Until yesterday I was a skeptic and delayed writing a review.  Using this every day is much cheaper and much more pleasant than oral surgery.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d wondered about the water pressure in a home system where I&#x27;ve set my pressure switch for the pump to have the pressure range between 20 and 45 pounds per sq. in.  That has not been a problem; possibly the design simply has a constriction to keep the pressure from being too strong.  (I have noticed less maximum pressure now in my shower head, but I&#x27;d installed a new shower head at the same time which also could have an effect.)&lt;br /&gt;Battery life for me (one user) is about a week;  I just put in the charger every Sunday morning.&lt;br /&gt;I worried about the plastic fittings, but was careful and no problems installing.</li>
            <li> I previously had a Showerpik that I liked. I couldn&#x27;t find the same model when I went to the website, so I got this model. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone, and I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> And what really impressed me is that once I diverted my shower head and attached this, there wasn&#x27;t a single leak! I don&#x27;t know how it works yet because I am currently charging the battery on the waterpik, but the spray from the shower coming into the tube seems to have decent pressure all by itself... Excited to see how it works! If I had one complaint it would be that the fittings that attach to the shower are plastic ... Seems like for nearly $60, they should be made of stainless steel or standard water fitting materials... So for quality of materials, it&#x27;s 50% too high and worth about $30-35.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended I get this.  It has proven to be very effective.  The battery life has FAR exceeded my expectations and I have found that even on the highest setting, the spray is very comfortable on my gums.  It did take a little getting used to, but I love it!!</li>
            <li> Teeth have never felt so clean!  Much better than traditional flossing.  Have used it every morning in the shower without fail.  (Sounds crazy, but even powerful enough to clean grout.)  Don&#x27;t start it before you put it in your mouth or it will feel like needles driving into your skin :D  Easy and no mess.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Like others have said, the full srength setting is very strong - if you have a counter top model and can&#x27;t use setting 13 or 14 - you won&#x27;t be able to use the top setting on this.  Me personally I like it - but also remember, you can get other heads for it which may reduce the power of the top setting.  Well, dropping this to one star - At first I thought I had a battery issue, but after checking with a volt meter I realized the batter was fine. Smacked the device with my palm and it started working again.  - Then is stopped...  But then it wouldn&#x27;t shut off. So despite the water turned off, the remaining pressure kept a constant stream tricking out of the end.  I got lucky with smacking the product with my palm and got it working again - long enough to get it to shut off.  I like this product, but it sure didn&#x27;t last very long.  Now it doesn&#x27;t work at all.  Replaced with an oralbreeze.  Too bad...</li>
            <li> Only used it a few times so far, but it does the trick adequately. I had an older version  before and loved it for years, simpler but never wavered in its service. This one is nicer looking. A shower flosser simplifies the activity</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t screw into shower heead.  Super frustrating.  Returned it for the Waterpik ultra countertop.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s dentist recommended a waterpik and this one was easy to install and use...</li>
            <li> Stopped working less then a year later.  They sent me a replacement battery.  That wasn&#x27;t the problem.  Sent me a whole new units.  It&#x27;s stopped working now as well.</li>
            <li> It worked for three days . I  would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this before they first came out!  I have stopped using it and I am soon going to uninstall it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had trouble installing it and I am pretty handy.  It extends the shower head out pretty far so I had devise another arrangement than the one I had. By itself that would not be a reason for a bad recommendation.  The battery problem, though, is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery drains quickly after a few uses or a week or so of non-use.  There is no light to tell when it needs recharging.  Another part of the problem is that after the shower is running warm water, one has to have the water pic on for a while for the cold water to run out of the hose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the battery drains I can&#x27;t clean my teeth, of course.  I should recharge it and replace it the next morning but I sometimes forget by the time I get through my morning routine.  So I often go two days or so without using it.  Then when I do replace the battery after recharging, I find I am out of the habit and forget to use it for a day or two.  I then use it for a few times and it peters out again.  This repeats and I find myself forgetting about it days in a row.  Eventually I found myself recharging it and then when I remembered to use it a week or so later, the battery pooped out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another way of putting this is the battery problem has taught me to leave it out of my shower routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the main problem with the battery is that it quickly looses its charge when it is not being used.  I have so many devices that need to be recharged I can’t count them.  It includes a hair trimmer and endless shavers over the years.  I have never had such a problem with the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, BTW, it works well.  But I have given up on it.  I couldn’t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very happy with product</li>
            <li> It was excellent at first......we were really pleased how well it worked on getting our teeth clean.&lt;br /&gt;After about two months it started to leak (control switch doesn&#x27;t turn water off from Pic completely.&lt;br /&gt;Now it is leaking quite a big....we have to lay it on its side on our soap rack and it just runs out the top.&lt;br /&gt;Can we get a new replacement waterpik? or is their some part they can send us?</li>
            <li> I bought this showerpik to have a more convenient hydro flosser than the countertop type. It worked good, not great. It extends the shower head out a few inches so it was a little cramped in a stall shower but I got used to it. There is no battery charge indicator to know when it needs to be charged, it just stops working. This particular Waterpik Showerpik only lasted two months before it stopped working completely.  For the $65 or so I paid for it this was very disappointing. Of course, the return policy is only 30 days through Amazon. Now I need to try to return it with the manufacturer. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Was easy to install.&lt;br /&gt;using a waterpik is a bit messy, so having it in the shower is great.&lt;br /&gt;Hard to see, but it does have a rechargeable battery so that you get&lt;br /&gt;the &amp;#34;pulse&amp;#34; activity.</li>
            <li> this was recommended to me from my dentist , ordered it on a Tuesday received the following Friday hooked it up on Saturday works great I really love this.</li>
            <li> The mounting to shower pipe and to the shower head have a lot to be desired. I think they could have put more time into the design. I contacted Waterpik for a free extension for the shower head I have and never received the extension and cannot move the shower head much. This is part of the design problem of the mounting hardware. The battery doesn&#x27;t last a week if you use it daily</li>
            <li> Works great.  Was easy to install.  Liked it so much that I bought another one for my kids bathroom.  Miss having it with me when I travel.</li>
            <li> Easy install. Good build quality.</li>
            <li> Started off working well but after two months it&#x27;s not as powerful as before</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through 3 of these.  The batteries don&#x27;t last long (in terms of how many recharges they can take), they inevitably end up leaking constantly out of the top (whether they&#x27;re turned on or not), and the switch gets broken so the Water Flosser only works at one setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted this to work, but it&#x27;s simply not robustly designed or long-lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A better alternative is the ShowerBreeze Water Jet Dental Irrigator, which requires no batteries, and uses a simple valve to operate.  The Waterpik Water Flosser appears to be overly engineered, and not in a good way.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dentist, I have a lot of crowns and it is almost impossible to properly floss. The battery has great life. I installed it in the shower and weeks later, when it ran out of power, realized the charger had been misplaced. When I attempted to order the charger on Waterpik&#x27;s online store it was not there. Their online customer support form was awful, numerous questions I could not answer, like date purchased, where and serial number. The form would not let me send it without four or five questions I could not answer so I had to call their 800 number--on hold a LONG time. When I got through I found out the charger costs $38--might as well have bought the new item--for that price you would hope it comes with a new battery as well. My wife is not very happy that I am using this in the shower, she says the particles I am washing out of my teeth are going on the shower floor, so every time I use this device she has to brush and sanitize the shower floor. The water pressure on this is great and I also ordered the brushing accessory so this works a lot better than the counter-top or hand-held model.</li>
            <li> Love this device. Makes flossing convenient and easy to do. Would recommend this product for anyone thinking of getting a water floss-er. I use it everyday and my last dentist visit I got away with flying colors.</li>
            <li> Waterpik is really a great company.  I bought mine in August last year and a few months ago the battery stopped holding its charge so I wrote to them yesterday and this morning got an email saying that they were shipping me a new battery.  Less than 24 hours to react.  Love this model as it has a nice strong stream.</li>
            <li> Works well. I&#x27;m not sure why the showerhead extender needs to be so bulky. It&#x27;s going to drop your showerhead by about 2 inches so if you are tall that might be an issue for you. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;6&amp;#34; so it&#x27;s not a big deal, but I can see that if you are 6&#x27;6&amp;#34; or so this might be an issue for you.</li>
            <li> Lasted a year before the battery refused to recharge.  Very expensive for an oral irrigator.  When I looked at reviews I found this to be a known issue.  I haven&#x27;t tried to contact Water Pik to see about a replacement.</li>
            <li> I got this for us for Christmas. My husband installed it in minutes. I went to the dentist in early March for a cleaning and I asked the dental assistant about the condition of my gums and teeth. She said that they were excellent, that usually I had a lot of plaque on my rear teeth but that this time I had almost none. I&#x27;d had my teeth cleaned last in October before I got this appliance, and the only thing I did differently between cleanings was to start using this every time I shower, which is usually daily. It does start to slow down as the battery wears down, so we now know when it needs to be recharged. Both my husband and I are using it almost daily, and we&#x27;ve only had to recharge it once in 3 months of use, after the initial charging. It works well, we&#x27;ve had no problems with it. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> The only downside to this product is that it is very cheap looking.  If you&#x27;re going to install it in a nice bathroom...be prepared.  The connector piece appears to be made of some kind of plastic that is painted silver which looks terrible in a nicer bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device is super convenient.  You&#x27;ll never forget to floss since it is just so easy to do while you&#x27;re in the shower.  It is very powerful and since I was a new waterpik user...I made a mess the first time I attempted to use it :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge seems to hold for weeks at a time.</li>
            <li> Hygienist recommended I start using a WaterPik.  Since using them, I see she was right.  Even after brushing &amp; flossing, I get particles out almost every use.&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned about the &amp;#34;over-spray&amp;#34; so bought this model (need not have worried, over-spray is not an issue).  Shower model is not very powerful &amp; needs to recharge about every week.  Also, you have to run the full shower to run the WaterPik.  Separately, I bought a counter top model (&amp; came with a travel model) from a warehouse store.  Both are fabulous.  Great pressure &amp; easy to fill.</li>
            <li> Using a water pik wasn&#x27;t possible for me given my tiny bathroom until I learned about this version of the product. It was easy to install. Using it every time I shower has made a measurable (by my dentist) improvement in the condition of my gums. Plus having it in the shower just makes sense because you don&#x27;t care where all the dribble goes. So I think everybody should have one.</li>
            <li> Seems to work decently. pressure can vary based on position in your mouth. Battery seems good so far.</li>
            <li> Just got off the phone with Waterpik. They are not going to sell these anymore and are offering a &amp;#34;Traveler&amp;#34; model WF03 as a replacement under the warranty. I&#x27;ve had 3 or 4 of these and while they&#x27;ve always worked well for about 6 months, they have all had the switch problem where it won&#x27;t turn off and the battery not holding a charge and eventually it stops working completely. I&#x27;ve always been able to replace them under warranty so it was no big deal to get another and it would work well for awhile. I gave it one star because it really helped our gums when it did work.  I hope the &amp;#34;Traveler&amp;#34; works better.</li>
            <li> Nothing like taking a shower and cleaning your teeth at the same time. I love this unit. However, in the sixth month, it broke and wouldn&#x27;t turn off, so I contacted Waterpik online and filed a complaint. They responded quickly and simply sent me a new one without further question. They didn&#x27;t even ask for the old one back. It was that simple. It would have gotten 3 stars if it weren&#x27;t for the quick replacement. So, before you scream about the Showerpik breaking and giving it a bad review, consider this: Waterpik has terrific customer service.</li>
            <li> Works very well and by doing in the shower you don&#x27;t have all the water spraying all over your bathroom counter. Definitely will clean your gums!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted, good price, speedy delivery.  Now let&#x27;s see if my dentist will get off my back about not flossing enough.</li>
            <li> The shower we wanted to install this in did not have a typical connection which made it difficult to install. We had to create a custom pvc adapter to get the waterpik to fit which required several visits to our local hardware store, trial and error, and a lot of patience. However, the product works fine once it was installed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to continue using this because I need it for gum problems, and there&#x27;s no question it really helps with those. But the battery is disgraceful and Waterpik should be ashamed of themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine lasted for 5 months. A fairly thorough search suggests that new ones must be purchased on through the Waterpik web site. You have to buy a new charger, too, and the set costs $30 plus $6 shipping. There&#x27;s no excuse for this, Waterpik. We&#x27;re your customers, not sheep to be shorn.</li>
            <li> The Waterpic works well when it works. My complaint is that the battery died.    Update:  I called Waterpik and to my surprise it is under warranty for two years. They are sending me a new battery. I want to thank Constance from the customer service department.</li>
            <li> I really hate to give this one star because when it worked, it worked very well.  However, we have had four of them in our house, two original purchases and two warranty replacements, and all have not worked properly.  All four of them have had the problem many others have mentioned where the water runs out the tip continuously even when the unit is shut off.  Additionally, two of them have failed completely where the motor doesn&#x27;t run at all (we have swapped around battery packs to verify that it&#x27;s not the battery).  In my latest attempt for a warranty replacement, Waterpik is now offering me a counter-top unit (WP-100, Water Flosser Ultra) as a replacement.  To me, that shows that the company is admitting that the WP-480 is hopelessly flawed.</li>
            <li> I bought this about 18 months ago and it just died this weekend.  Won&#x27;t turn on, no response.  It was convenient to be able to use in the shower where the splashing water wouldn&#x27;t make a mess.  It did a good job, but didn&#x27;t last long enough.  Be aware that it will also reduce the flow of your shower head since it mounts between it and the water supply.  It&#x27;s not a major reduction, but it is noticeable.  It needed to be charged about every 3 days and a couple months prior to it going dead, it wouldn&#x27;t fully turn off.  The pump would be off, but water would still squirt out of it from the water pressure.</li>
            <li> Like many of the other reviewers, I thought this would be a good idea from a reputable manufacturer.  Wrong.  The design is terrible, the plastic parts are shoddy and prone to leak, the battery gave out after a month--would not hold a charge, and there is no cutoff valve so you have to leave the shower running while using the Flosser.  I didn&#x27;t want a pik/flosser sitting on my bathroom counter, but I am having to rethink that position.  Don&#x27;t buy this piece of junk.</li>
