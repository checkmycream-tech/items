            <li>For me, since I dislike the &amp;#34;gel crunch,&amp;#34; I get the best results by mixing a bit of this gel with a bit of conditioner in my hands, then raking it through my hair thoroughly.</li>

            <li>My sister and I have used this hair gel for MANY years.</li>
            <li>I cannot praise this hair gel enough and this is a great deal!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite gel for my curls.</li>
            <li>my favorite part of this gel is that it won&#x27;t leave any residue on my hands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sticky like most gels are.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend</li>
            <li>So glad I could get it in a 3 pack.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this gel.</li>
            <li>I love the smell as well.  </li>
            <li>But nonetheless better harden under control then</li>
            <li>Just crunchy enough to hold the perfect curl all day.</li>
            <li>Plus, it smells pretty good too.</li>
            <li>This gel holds hair pretty good</li>
            <li>it smells good and holds my curl really well!  </li>
            <li>It is cheap and works pretty good in humidity.</li>
            <li>This product allows us to manage our hair and be able to enjoy our locks.</li>
            <li>Nice and fresh and leaves your hair shiny .</li>
            <li>strong gel, discrete smell</li>
            <li>like if your hair starts to fall down :D</li>
            <li>HE gel works well on my fine, krinkly har.</li>
            <li>Great hold without the white residue.</li>
            <li>There is no sticky&lt;br /&gt;Smooth and convenient comfortable to use</li>
            <li>Cheap and gets the job</li>
            <li>Not only does it hold well, but it is a great bargain and</li>
            <li>This product is super easy to spread through your hair without having it clump in spots.</li>
            <li>Works great all day long.</li>
            <li>If you follow the curly girl method it is curly girl friendly.  </li>
            <li>and yet rinses clean</li>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s best when I can go to bed with my hair wet (with a microfiber towel over my pillow), but I can also blow dry with a diffuser with pretty good results.</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite gel for my super curly hair.</li>
            <li>Drys quickly.</li>
            <li>Perhaps more for a high school kid wanting a &amp;#34;boyz in the hood&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li>Curly hair simply cannot be cut like straight hair, so no product will work for you if you don&#x27;t have a good cut.</li>
            <li>am using this product is liked, but I ordered online because recently not sold in the neighborhood of the store&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;(I have high density fine to medium hair that is elbow length, does not like proteins or oils)</li>
            <li>This gel is great for my super thick curly hair.</li>
            <li>I love being able to buy it in bulk on Amazon and save a few dollars.</li>
            <li>I use this gel a lot to give my very straight hair the \\&quot;scrunched\\&quot; look.</li>
            <li>This gel smells so pretty and holds my flyways done even after my running today..</li>
            <li>Definitely will buy more.</li>
            <li>I envisioned applying it and putting hair in rollers and the result would make curl last better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many products for my crazy curly hair and this by far is the best.</li>
            <li>then it might work, however a head ponytail will definitely have fly aways and loose hairs</li>
            <li>Best gel ever, the only one that holds down my natural curl frizz.</li>
            <li>Fragrance is positive too.  </li>
            <li>This is the only hair gel I&#x27;ve used for years because it&#x27;s light, not terribly sticky, and yet keeps my hair in a relatively natural-looking condition.</li>
            <li>so if I&#x27;m going out in the evening I&#x27;ll re-apply but no big deal to me - works better than many other brands and types I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite product for keeping my curly hair under control in both summer humidity and winter&#x27;s dry air.</li>
            <li>It is truly strong hold for short hair.</li>
            <li>, if you don&#x27;t you WILL have to in the morning because your hair will be jacked up and the WAX is too strong to restyle with what&#x27;s left haha.</li>
            <li>I had been wanting to try this product since I have very unruly hair and need something that works to help keep it straight for me.</li>
            <li>haha get it?</li>
            <li>Really gives some body.</li>
            <li>and my father has very shirt hair.</li>
            <li>There is really nothing I do not like about this gel</li>
            <li>I recommend not using so much because your hair will turn into a pack of ramen noodles</li>
            <li>I receive many compliments on my hair whether I am wearing it up or down.</li>
            <li>Works great for me, I&#x27;m a 31 year old guy with very thick hair</li>
            <li>This is a decent price for the product and the purpose of the product.</li>
            <li>This is the only gel I&#x27;ve been able to find that actually has an all day hold.</li>
            <li>I have just changed hair styles so won&#x27;t use it now, but would highly recommend it</li>
            <li>and my hair is JUST long enough to get into a full head ponytail just around the top back portion of my head.</li>
            <li>but there are others I like a little better.</li>
            <li>this product works a little bit more than what I needed it for.</li>
            <li>This gel helps my curls and waves really stay strong with very very little friz even in very high dew points (</li>
            <li>when it drys and you comb the hairyou get a natural look.</li>
            <li>It does NOT contain proteins for those of you who are protein sensitive.</li>
            <li>: If you&#x27;re really struggling with your naturally curly hair, I also highly recommend finding someone who can give you a dry cut, preferably someone who is trained in the Diva curl technique.  </li>
            <li>I have blonde, fine, long, VERY curly natural hair and so far this is the ONLY product that actually helps hold and define my curls.</li>
            <li>It is the right product for my family and will last the entire year.</li>
            <li>I use it for volume, and unlike many other, more expensive gels, it does the job without drying my hair out or flaking.</li>
            <li>although when the dew points get VERY high my hair does fall flat some).  </li>
            <li>and this helps me style it easily and lasts at least through the work day.</li>
            <li>on and dries clear (no white residue/</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve found that keeps my hair curly, bouncy and soft.</li>
            <li>I have tried eco styler, but I got annoyed with it because it turns White and clumpy with most conditioners.</li>
            <li>I have a full head of hair and this does not hold my hair like I want it, if you have thick hair, and you&#x27;re going to be using it for styling</li>
            <li>The only hair gel that works really well for my extremely curly hair!</li>
            <li>loose wild and un tamable</li>

            <li> I have blonde, fine, long, VERY curly natural hair and so far this is the ONLY product that actually helps hold and define my curls.</li>
            <li> It is the right product for my family and will last the entire year.</li>
            <li> I use it for volume, and unlike many other, more expensive gels, it does the job without drying my hair out or flaking.</li>
            <li> although when the dew points get VERY high my hair does fall flat some).  </li>
            <li> and this helps me style it easily and lasts at least through the work day.</li>
            <li> on and dries clear (no white residue/</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve found that keeps my hair curly, bouncy and soft.</li>
            <li> I have tried eco styler, but I got annoyed with it because it turns White and clumpy with most conditioners.</li>
            <li> I have a full head of hair and this does not hold my hair like I want it, if you have thick hair, and you&#x27;re going to be using it for styling</li>
            <li> The only hair gel that works really well for my extremely curly hair!</li>
            <li> loose wild and un tamable</li>
            <li> My brother in law suggested this to me as he has long hair like mine, only a mohawk though.</li>
            <li> I usually use KCCC but it is too pricey, this is a decent substitute.</li>
            <li> You will have to scrunch your hair once it is dry to get the crunch to go away, but only once dry not before.</li>
            <li> We both have extremely curly and frizzy hair (very similar to Julia Roberts).</li>
            <li> I have very long hair, my sister has shoulder length</li>
            <li> I follow the Diva curl method of using sulfate-free shampoo/conditioner (I use Nature&#x27;s Gate), then while my hair is still wet, I scrunch my hair with this gel.</li>
            <li> Also uses a comb and hairspray to style on wet hair.</li>
            <li> and I have natural curly thick hair that I needed to contain with all this humidity.</li>
            <li> My hair is VERY THICK, meaning the volume of my hair is high.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> no-shampoo routine, so a silicone-free gel that holds well but doesn&#x27;t weigh down my curls,</li>
            <li> Down......</li>
            <li> Down.....</li>
            <li> I then do a baptismal rinse, flip my head upside down and scrunch out some of the water with my hands, and then plop in a t-shirt.</li>
            <li> (I always apply leave in conditioner before applying gel).&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I tried a few other gels, but they had the effectiveness of using water as a styler.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it dries out or flakes a little</li>
            <li> so curly it looked shorter and my hair is a little longer</li>
            <li> cast is easily broken with a little oil or nut butter (such as shea)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves a little stiff, but after I shake it out, I like the way it looks.</li>
            <li> but I guess that can&#x27;t be a bad thing right?</li>
            <li> Hair felt stiff.</li>
            <li> It held my curls all day without being stiff or not touchable.</li>
            <li> However it does make your hair partially hard, but that&#x27;s how it stays in place, and it is not fun to sleep in, so you&#x27;d have to wash it out at the end of the night</li>
            <li> and it also made my hair too hard a few times.</li>
            <li> No harmful chemical and can use it everyday!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I had been wanting to try this product since I have very unruly hair and need something that works to help keep it straight for me. The price was incredible for a  3 pack</li>
            <li> I used to use Nexxus which costs about $10.  When my local store stopped carrying it, I found this.  Texture and flexibility on par with Nexxus.  Fragrance is positive too.  Just FYI, not all Herbal Essences are the same.  Not a big fan of the organic one which feels like olive oil.  This one is a winner though!</li>
            <li> This gel smells so pretty and holds my flyways done even after my running today.. Has great hold..... I would definitely recommend ! Amazing gel</li>
            <li> This is the only hair gel I&#x27;ve used for years because it&#x27;s light, not terribly sticky, and yet keeps my hair in a relatively natural-looking condition. So nice to see it sold by the three-pack.</li>
            <li> strong gel, discrete smell, the hair stays put</li>
            <li> Great hold, great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it daily, for my curly hair, and I&#x27;m on the \\&quot;Curly Girl\\&quot; [[ASIN:076115678X Curly Girl: The Handbook]] no-shampoo routine, so a silicone-free gel that holds well but doesn&#x27;t weigh down my curls, and yet rinses clean was necessary. This solves all those issues, and is a bargain!</li>
            <li> Im in love with this. Amazing price and it holds hair great snd smells yummy.</li>
            <li> This is a decent price for the product and the purpose of the product.</li>
            <li> Best gel ever, the only one that holds down my natural curl frizz. And you can&#x27;t beat the amazon price!</li>
            <li> This is the only gel I&#x27;ve been able to find that actually has an all day hold. I recommend this to anyone who uses gel to scrunch their hair, it holds very strongly.</li>
            <li> I found this made my hair greasy.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite product for keeping my curly hair under control in both summer humidity and winter&#x27;s dry air.</li>
            <li> This is a god product used in the correct format.....I use it to hold hair in place during various conditions.....when it drys and you comb the hairyou get a natural look. I have used it fofr sometime and it works for me.</li>
            <li> Love this gel. Works great all day long.</li>
            <li> My sister introduced me to this product and I have used it for a couple years.  It is a great product, holding the hair in place and I didn&#x27;t have to use curling devices at all.  I have just changed hair styles so won&#x27;t use it now, but would highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I got tired of the foam products and started using the gel.  A little goes a long way!  One of these tubes, at low cost, will last me over 6 months.</li>
            <li> got this for my girlfriend and she loves it. all day hold. does not flake.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband.  He loves the extra hold that it has.  Also loves that it&#x27;s not sticky.  Definitely will buy more.</li>
            <li> Works great for me, I&#x27;m a 31 year old guy with very thick hair and this helps me style it easily and lasts at least through the work day. Sometimes it dries out or flakes a little so if I&#x27;m going out in the evening I&#x27;ll re-apply but no big deal to me - works better than many other brands and types I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have blonde, fine, long, VERY curly natural hair and so far this is the ONLY product that actually helps hold and define my curls. I follow the Diva curl method of using sulfate-free shampoo/conditioner (I use Nature&#x27;s Gate), then while my hair is still wet, I scrunch my hair with this gel. (I just keep it in the shower and do it before I even get out.) For me, it&#x27;s best when I can go to bed with my hair wet (with a microfiber towel over my pillow), but I can also blow dry with a diffuser with pretty good results. The hair is a bit &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; when it dries, but I just scrunch my hands through my hair to break this up. For the price, I have not found anything that compares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: If you&#x27;re really struggling with your naturally curly hair, I also highly recommend finding someone who can give you a dry cut, preferably someone who is trained in the Diva curl technique.  Curly hair simply cannot be cut like straight hair, so no product will work for you if you don&#x27;t have a good cut.</li>
            <li> This is great gel if you have curly hair and are doing the no silicone thing.  I have used it for years and years.  It is cheap and works pretty good in humidity.</li>
            <li> This gel is great. I use it for volume, and unlike many other, more expensive gels, it does the job without drying my hair out or flaking. It works just as well on day two.</li>
            <li> Perhaps more for a high school kid wanting a &amp;#34;boyz in the hood&amp;#34; look. the product is probably OK and I just didn&#x27;t know what I was buying. I envisioned applying it and putting hair in rollers and the result would make curl last better. Hair felt stiff.</li>
            <li> Nothing Better To Say Than Amazing! I Use This Product Every Day &amp; It Never Let&#x27;s Me Down......haha get it? Down.....like if your hair starts to fall down :D</li>
            <li> Seller offered a good price on this product.  HE gel works well on my fine, krinkly har.</li>
            <li> Review by the husband. I have been growing my hair for 6 months+ now and my hair is JUST long enough to get into a full head ponytail just around the top back portion of my head. My hair is VERY THICK, meaning the volume of my hair is high. So this gel does NOT hold my hair all day. My brother in law suggested this to me as he has long hair like mine, only a mohawk though. I have a full head of hair and this does not hold my hair like I want it, if you have thick hair, and you&#x27;re going to be using it for styling then it might work, however a head ponytail will definitely have fly aways and loose hairs and you will have to reapply, if you&#x27;re looking for something that describe what I am looking for, the one thing I found to work great is a WAX, I use a BedHead brand WAX and that will keep your hair in place ALL DAY. However it does make your hair partially hard, but that&#x27;s how it stays in place, and it is not fun to sleep in, so you&#x27;d have to wash it out at the end of the night, if you don&#x27;t you WILL have to in the morning because your hair will be jacked up and the WAX is too strong to restyle with what&#x27;s left haha.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT. My sister and I have used this hair gel for MANY years. We both have extremely curly and frizzy hair (very similar to Julia Roberts). This product allows us to manage our hair and be able to enjoy our locks. I receive many compliments on my hair whether I am wearing it up or down. I cannot praise this hair gel enough and this is a great deal!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite gel for my curls. I do the curly girl method (no silicones, no sulfates), and this is the best inexpensive, readily-available gel that I&#x27;ve found. For me, since I dislike the &amp;#34;gel crunch,&amp;#34; I get the best results by mixing a bit of this gel with a bit of conditioner in my hands, then raking it through my hair thoroughly. I then do a baptismal rinse, flip my head upside down and scrunch out some of the water with my hands, and then plop in a t-shirt.</li>
            <li> I use this gel a lot to give my very straight hair the \\&quot;scrunched\\&quot; look. It has great hold and isn&#x27;t too sticky. Plus, it smells pretty good too. I love being able to buy it in bulk on Amazon and save a few dollars.</li>
            <li> The only hair gel that works really well for my extremely curly hair! So glad they still make it!</li>
            <li> This gel holds hair pretty good but there are others I like a little better.</li>
            <li> Great for fine hair.  Really gives some body.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and the hold on this gel!! And the price was amazing! !!!!! My father and sister also use this gel. I have very long hair, my sister has shoulder length and my father has very shirt hair. my favorite part of this gel is that it won&#x27;t leave any residue on my hands. It&#x27;s not sticky like most gels are.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend it to all! (:</li>
            <li> Great hold without the white residue.</li>
            <li> The package came in on time and included all that was ordered.  It is the right product for my family and will last the entire year.</li>
            <li> There is no sticky&lt;br /&gt;Smooth and convenient comfortable to use&lt;br /&gt;I am using this product is liked, but I ordered online because recently not sold in the neighborhood of the store&lt;br /&gt;Happy is at a great shopping in three sets&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Bought the gel for someone who has been using it on a daily basis to style hair. It is truly strong hold for short hair. It does not leave white traces when it dries, which is a plus,</li>
            <li> Son adores this stuff.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite gel for my super curly hair. It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve found that keeps my hair curly, bouncy and soft. No sticky gel feeling and no frizz. So glad I could get it in a 3 pack.</li>
            <li> thsi gel work awesome hold sup and i have thick hair</li>
            <li> Great product that works great and the scent is nice!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this hair gel. Gets hard and not sticky. Stays all day. Also uses a comb and hairspray to style on wet hair. Drys quickly. Cheap and gets the job done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stephanie Sefcik</li>
            <li> I am a naturalista. I have tried eco styler, but I got annoyed with it because it turns White and clumpy with most conditioners. (I always apply leave in conditioner before applying gel).&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I tried a few other gels, but they had the effectiveness of using water as a styler. #fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros of this gel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sticky&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Distributes Evenly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goes on and dries clear (no white residue/clumping)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great definition&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice hold&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gel cast is easily broken with a little oil or nut butter (such as shea)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of hair, so one tube only lasts TWO uses. I wash my hair once weekly, so that means I use two tubes monthly.</li>
            <li> This gel definitely holds my curly hair well.  Leaves a little stiff, but after I shake it out, I like the way it looks.</li>
            <li> This product is super easy to spread through your hair without having it clump in spots. Once in your hair it is easy to style and it has great staying power!</li>
            <li> this is my favorite gel of all time!  it smells good and holds my curl really well!  I can&#x27;t always find it in stores so this is super nice to be able to buy in 3 packs online!</li>
            <li> Good capture.  Hard to find in the &amp;#34;drug&amp;#34; stores currently.</li>
            <li> This smells really good and is not as sticky as others have been that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this gel. If you follow the curly girl method it is curly girl friendly.  It does contain polyquarterniums so if your hair cannot handle them you probably do not want this gel.  It does NOT contain proteins for those of you who are protein sensitive. This gel helps my curls and waves really stay strong with very very little friz even in very high dew points (although when the dew points get VERY high my hair does fall flat some).  You will have to scrunch your hair once it is dry to get the crunch to go away, but only once dry not before. I love the smell as well.  There is really nothing I do not like about this gel and I do consider it one of my holy grail hair products.&lt;br /&gt;(I have high density fine to medium hair that is elbow length, does not like proteins or oils)</li>
            <li> this product works a little bit more than what I needed it for. but I guess that can&#x27;t be a bad thing right? It smells great works amazingly well and I have natural curly thick hair that I needed to contain with all this humidity. I used to use just the regular Herbal Essences moose and curl gel that wasn&#x27;t that maximum hold. But to get 3 for a great low price is insanely awesome. I recommend not using so much because your hair will turn into a pack of ramen noodles lol. I gave it 4 stars because for some reason it made my hair so curly it looked shorter and my hair is a little longer and it also made my hair too hard a few times. But nonetheless better harden under control then loose wild and un tamable</li>
            <li> This gel is great for my super thick curly hair. I usually use KCCC but it is too pricey, this is a decent substitute.</li>
            <li> Soooooooo thick. Makes my hair totally crunchy.</li>
            <li> I love this gel! Not only does it hold well, but it is a great bargain and honestly my very favorite aspect is that it smells AMAZING! It reminds me of being a teenager and I love that! I will definitely be repurchasing when I run out in the future! I love Herbal Essence products and this one is probably my very favorite! Love!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and it works awesome!</li>
            <li> I had not tried Herbal Essence gel before just mousse and I am so happy with this. I think it was a great price for the quantity and the scent is amazing . Nice and fresh and leaves your hair shiny . It held my curls all day without being stiff or not touchable.</li>
            <li> Best Herbal Gel! No harmful chemical and can use it everyday!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many products for my crazy curly hair and this by far is the best. Just crunchy enough to hold the perfect curl all day.</li>
            <li> I found this to work great and it lives up to it&#x27;s advertising.  Great price too.  I would recommend it.</li>
