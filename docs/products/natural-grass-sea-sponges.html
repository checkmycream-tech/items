            <li>Even though it is a cut sponge the shape is nice and rounded.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied and feel my shower time has become a bit more luxurious.</li>
            <li>It came in about a month ago, and I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li>My daughter (8)</li>
            <li>/&gt;bye~:)</li>
            <li>This is absolutely my most favorite sponge I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>Makes me feel sexy.</li>
            <li>Like a sexy, sexy man.</li>
            <li>And it creates a nice rich lather from bar soap and liquid soap alike.  </li>
            <li>I think that&#x27;s pretty good longevity for a sponge.    </li>
            <li>you so much happy new year&lt;</li>
            <li>they all have their own individual character which just made me happy.</li>
            <li>It has a great, soft texture.</li>
            <li>This \\&quot;grass\\&quot; sponge seemed a bit scratchy at first but upon break-in became pretty near perfect for me and has stayed that way for over a year.</li>
            <li>I had been using cheap synthetic sponges from Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li>This Grass sea sponge is really really soft on the skin, very pleased.  </li>
            <li>water/soap well (I use Dr. Bronners) and seems to get me clean</li>
            <li>Nice looking sponge but not as soft as I had hoped for</li>
            <li>They replied quickly and sent me a replacement.  </li>
            <li>I prefer a little rougher texture than this, but it&#x27;s still a nice bath item--doesn&#x27;t smell, is all natural, and feels good.</li>
            <li>a picture is worth a thousand words, so a video must be worth a million.</li>
            <li>all right.</li>
            <li>The size (5-6 inches) seems about right.    </li>
            <li>It would be ok for using on the face, but not sturdy enough to use as a sponge for the body.</li>
            <li>One fell apart the first week</li>
            <li>At first the wool sponge was my favorite, but after a couple of weeks of use that became very soft -- too soft.</li>
            <li>Most sponges I&#x27;ve bought in the past are more open celled, and consequently can tear easily.  </li>
            <li>This natural sponge is so-far lasting nicely and rinses out much easier.</li>
            <li>The real test will be what condition it&#x27;s in after another couple of months.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a natural bath sponge to use with my bath oil and that&#x27;s exactly what I got.</li>
            <li>One was fine; the other had a couple large tunnels thru the sponge and it fell apart within 2 weeks of use.  </li>
            <li>As long as it holds up well, I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
            <li>mo23TLGKL82BHYM]]The guidelines do not allow me to describe the seller experience; that can only be done in the Amazon feedback; which I certainly did.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something soft, buy this sponge.    </li>
            <li>but then they also go by \\&quot;Natural Bath &amp; Body Shop\\&quot; elsewhere.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice firm texture; not too soft and not too rough.  </li>
            <li>I really like this one, but next time I might try one a little softer or larger, just to switch it up.</li>

            <li> I ordered 2 5-6&amp;#34; sea sponges.  One was fine; the other had a couple large tunnels thru the sponge and it fell apart within 2 weeks of use.  I emailed the vendor.  They replied quickly and sent me a replacement.  I will order from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted a sea sponge for the longest time so I finally ordered this one. It came in about a month ago, and I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using it. It has a great, soft texture. Unfortunately I hadn&#x27;t put much thought into its upkeep, and I noticed some mold spots on it recently. After the fact, I did some research about taking care of your sponge by soaking it periodically in hydrogen peroxide and water, or tea tree oil and water to ward off bacteria...oh well, now I&#x27;ll know for next time.</li>
            <li> If you want anything close to a loofah, don&#x27;t buy this sponge. If you&#x27;re looking for something soft, buy this sponge.    I prefer a little rougher texture than this, but it&#x27;s still a nice bath item--doesn&#x27;t smell, is all natural, and feels good.</li>
            <li> Update:  Now that I have had this sponge for several months it is totally splitting everywhere and falling apart.  I don&#x27;t know if it is my specific sponge or if this being a \\&quot;grass\\&quot; sponge meaning it is turning back to individual pieces of grass but I don&#x27;t know if I can recommend this anymore.  Rather frustrating when you pay so much for a sponge that has such a short life.  This Grass sea sponge is really really soft on the skin, very pleased.  The only reason I have not given this 5 stars as it seems to want to split as a section.  I assume it will shortly tear off giving me a smaller sponge than purchased.  Until then, this is a really nice bath sponge.</li>
            <li> Very good sponge, holds water/soap well (I use Dr. Bronners) and seems to get me clean all right. It&#x27;s not as \\&quot;rough\\&quot; as I would like, so it only earns 4 stars but I&#x27;m still very satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This sponge basically fell apart after using it once. It would be ok for using on the face, but not sturdy enough to use as a sponge for the body.</li>
            <li> Just received yesterday, but am very pleased with this sponge. It is dense and sufficiently soft when wet.  Most sponges I&#x27;ve bought in the past are more open celled, and consequently can tear easily.  This sponge looks sort of like coral. The size is perfect. As long as it holds up well, I&#x27;ll be back for more. Well priced for this quality sponge.</li>
            <li> I bought 6 - 5 for gifts and 1 for me. they all have their own individual character which just made me happy. My daughter (8) and I use it and just love it! (Haven&#x27;t given as gifts yet.) We will be sad when it wears beyond use.</li>
            <li> I have had this sponge almost a year and a half and it has just now had a piece fall off. I think that&#x27;s pretty good longevity for a sponge.    The size (5-6 inches) seems about right.    When I bought this I also bought two other sponges along with it -- a \\&quot;wool\\&quot; sponge and a \\&quot;silk\\&quot; sponge (both natural sea sponges). At first the wool sponge was my favorite, but after a couple of weeks of use that became very soft -- too soft. This \\&quot;grass\\&quot; sponge seemed a bit scratchy at first but upon break-in became pretty near perfect for me and has stayed that way for over a year. The silk sponge was irregular in shape and overpriced from the start.</li>
            <li> Purchased two sponges.  One fell apart the first week and I threw it away.  The other one is starting to tear.  I think the quality is poor.  You get what you pay for.  Probably because the sponge is relatively coarse and does not absorb water well, during use it begins to tear and after about a week or two you have to toss it out.</li>
            <li> It lathers up well. But it is not very soft, and the one I got was lumpy with a doughnut hole in the middle.</li>
            <li> I had been using cheap synthetic sponges from Wal-Mart. They weren&#x27;t too bad but didn&#x27;t last very long and it was really hard to rinse out all of the soap when finished showering. This natural sponge is so-far lasting nicely and rinses out much easier. The real test will be what condition it&#x27;s in after another couple of months. If I could change anything about it I would like it to be a bit less soft when it&#x27;s lathered up.</li>
            <li> Still too small and too soft to be my bath sponge. Still, it looks great as a decoration in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo23TLGKL82BHYM]]The guidelines do not allow me to describe the seller experience; that can only be done in the Amazon feedback; which I certainly did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope if the company do not correct their failings that they will be booted from selling any products on Amazon.  I wish I could post their emails to me.  They use two different names.  On Amazon they list themselves as \\&quot;Spa Plus\\&quot; but then they also go by \\&quot;Natural Bath &amp; Body Shop\\&quot; elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponge they are selling is not the one pictured.  I have uploaded a video.  Like they say... a picture is worth a thousand words, so a video must be worth a million.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just glad to buy the good stuff at a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you so much happy new year&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bye~:)</li>
