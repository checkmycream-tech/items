            <li>the colour after use it is orange orange orange!I use the air gun (its perfect for home use)but with Siennasol tan liquid.</li>
            <li>, I think it takes some practice to perfect your technique.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with it...</li>

            <li>this is a great product.</li>
            <li>The tan liquid that comes with it isnt great</li>
            <li>so I just use the airbrush liquid from ocean and it workd great.</li>
            <li>I bought the Ocean Medium tanning solution to use in it and the Ocean solution is great.  </li>
            <li>and the results are so great that my friends have asked me to spray tan then for upcoming weddings and events.</li>
            <li>Anyways, This machine works great</li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE</li>

            <li>Great product (used with Ocean Medium spray) while it works.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>i am SO happy i bought this...</li>
            <li>Worked great until the it one day just died and wouldn&#x27;t charge or spray at all....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still working great</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>which does NOT smell good.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s good for beginners because it&#x27;s so fair</li>
            <li>I loved the Air Gun</li>
            <li>This product is realy good.</li>
            <li>and I got a good even tan...</li>
            <li>The gun workd really nice and does a good job.</li>
            <li>Make sure you exfoliate!</li>
            <li>Better idea - Buy a spray bottle!</li>
            <li>It is a very light spray, which is good for building color to get the results you desire.</li>
            <li>This tanning gun is amazing.</li>
            <li>it wasnt amazing lets just say that .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>The glowFusion gun is amazing.</li>
            <li>You get to do this in the privacy of your own home.</li>
            <li>and it kind of feels like its going to stop working soon.</li>
            <li>I used my own solution, so I can&#x27;t give a review on the solution that comes with it.</li>
            <li>- Spray during nap time (an even spray is best accomplished when still)    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve decided to invest the money in a real HVLP spray tan gun ( found an awesome one of ebay for $150) and am looking forward to giving that try.</li>
            <li>I liked the charging it up idea and being portable</li>
            <li>really liked this product and it did work for me for months although went to use it and</li>
            <li>I really loved this when I first got it, it applied great</li>
            <li>The product worked great, I was cleaning out the nozzle after each use and had very good results, until I tried to use it for the third time.</li>
            <li>It sprays evenly and with the tinted spray I use very easy to see where you are putting it.  </li>
            <li>I love not having to go into Target and purchase self-tanner products (which I think is kind of embarrassing) every week.</li>
            <li>Must say this item is pretty great.</li>
            <li>I have very light skin and all I noticed was the smell and no color.</li>
            <li>Seriously, I love this thing.</li>
            <li>I love the cocoa smell of the tanning solution and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin smelling funky afterwards.  </li>
            <li>is I bend over like I&#x27;m touching my toes and then with one hand spray the mist in a side to side motion.</li>
            <li>Saves me tons of money :-)</li>
            <li>It worked ok</li>
            <li>That gives you much more even coverage than the gun</li>
            <li>like it sputters and sprays more of dots than a continuous mist .</li>
            <li>i made sure it was charged and</li>
            <li>it stopped working after one use, so i simply put the ocean solution in a spray bottle and used latex gloves to rub it in and it worked perfectly</li>
            <li>I love that you can just recharge it and not worry about buying batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Spend a bit more and get something nicer.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off buying those spray cans at Walgreens or CVS.</li>
            <li>(Not the most in-depth</li>
            <li>for a more even tan.</li>
            <li>(Important!</li>
            <li>as most products do if they are not hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li>Love love love them.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Make sure to charge fully before using.</li>
            <li>OKAY.</li>
            <li>Have used for two years or so and love the tan.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with the spray tanner and would buy another if mine breaks!</li>
            <li>Ended up just using a spray bottle which worked 10 X better btw.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the solution it came with</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell great but very easy to use and no mess!  </li>
            <li>I was soooooo excited to get my own air gun</li>
            <li>Like we said, after more trail and error, we think we&#x27;ve figured out a pretty good system.</li>
            <li>Other then that its a great way to have a nice glow without going to a tanning bed!</li>
            <li>I have to say I loved this gun at first.</li>
            <li>Save your money until you have enough to buy a good thing for a fair price...</li>
            <li>I read a lot of reviews which stated this fact and its very true.</li>
            <li>I used Ocean tanning spray (which is amazing and worth every penny)</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the light mist that comes from the gun.</li>
            <li>the gun is awesome because you can use any other solution with it.</li>
            <li>-The solution may not be the best idea for your face if you have allergies to other beauty products.</li>
            <li>I bought this looking for an easy out to going to a tanning salon/buying self-tanning products every week.</li>
            <li>Basically, it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>You can feel where the mist lands, so overlapping is quite easy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy</li>
            <li>The gun is easy to use and sprays in a mist.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so easy to do</li>
            <li>I was happy to get a good product for a good price, but I was proved wrong again</li>
            <li>the mist is so fine that it doesn&#x27;t allow the solution to streak.  </li>
            <li>On your torso, chest and face, the side to side motion works best, while again slightly overlapping.  </li>
            <li>As for now, I&#x27;ll stick with L&#x27;oreal self-tanner spray which does a perfectly fine job.</li>
            <li>did fine with it</li>
            <li>My hopes were that it would spray a fine mist on my body, so I would not have to rub it in.  </li>
            <li>The battery would not hold a charge and the nozzle became clogged and sprayed huge blotches all over my skin.</li>
            <li>This air gun is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I do like the light mist of the gun.</li>
            <li>(if you read enough reviews you&#x27;ll see this isn&#x27;t an uncommon problem).</li>
            <li>I was looking for a cheap option to save money from going to a salon.</li>
            <li>A friend of mine had this same airbrushing gun, and she told me great things about it</li>
            <li>but there&#x27;s a lot of important information.)  </li>
            <li>I paid cheap</li>
            <li>I got cheap...</li>
            <li>/&gt;If directions are followed tan looks great and lasts, especially if maintained using a tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I used the ocean tanning solution with this, and I think the solution itself was good because I have a friend that does professional spray tans and her machine</li>
            <li>I bought this thinking it would be a quick and easy spray tan gun.</li>
            <li>The mist is so light and cool, it almost tickles.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>might be better though for your first time application)</li>
            <li>I was so excited to recieve it in the mail and have have nothing but a pain.</li>
            <li>I was really excited about this</li>
            <li>This is definitely worth the money!  </li>
            <li>away.they said that you must clean it every time you use it</li>
            <li>Maybe I didn&#x27;t use it right though!</li>
            <li>The gun is easy to use and produces a fine mist that is very consistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My husband is even jealous that I&#x27;m darker than him and wants me to use it on him.  :-)</li>
            <li>the good think is that you can buy another cable for only 5 dollars.</li>
            <li>Love the color of my skin and would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>We have been through just about every kind of spray tan you can imagine, and this one by far, takes the cake.     </li>
            <li>At the last minute we changed our routine to an Oompa Loompa song-and-dance number and the judges LOVED it.</li>
            <li>Save your money and buy the real deal :)</li>
            <li>All in all its pretty good for the price, and so far it was worth it.</li>
            <li>First of all, it does spray the solution out in a even fine mist</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if I find a different solution to put in the gun I will like it a lot more.</li>
            <li>Now that the winter months are over and it&#x27;s time to bare some more skin I have to admit I would not be comfortable in a bathing suit or shorts with this tan gun as it does not cover evenly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be looking for a more high powered gun with a more professional result.</li>
            <li>You have to learn to use - don&#x27;t spray too close, use even strokes, clean with hot water after every use.</li>
            <li>Its such a shame because the mist that does come out is nice and evenly distributed but the tanning solution it comes with does not do anything.</li>
            <li>but I feel its worth it to just buy another one.</li>
            <li>Also, the battery dies pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I have owned it for 3 months now and clean it after every use and it sill works like new!!</li>
            <li>It basically never worked properly right from the start.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this product is pretty amazing for the price, and pays for itself after only a couple applications at home over going to the tanning booth.</li>
            <li>The gun is okay, it does have an extremely light mist so that it will dry evenly.</li>
            <li>First, the batteries stop holding a charge right away</li>
            <li>Since the gun had such great reviews, I figured I would purchase it then use a different solution in it!  </li>
            <li>From what I can tell, the gun itself work very very well.</li>
            <li>The GlowFusion Solution is very yellow and very, very light.</li>
            <li>well I hardly ever did that although it was when I did clean it really good that it stopped working</li>
            <li>First off, it&#x27;s about $30.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s pretty close to the price you would pay if you went to a Mystic Tan in a salon.</li>
            <li>First I want to say that I don&#x27;t have any interest with the GlowFusion company....</li>
            <li>Also, when you do order it I guess there are two shades of color which I wasn&#x27;t aware when I bought it.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I never got that opportunity to practice because the gun stopped working after one use (pulls air into chamber, doesn&#x27;t spray tanner).</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re willing to take your chances-</li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s exactly what it looked like for me.</li>
            <li>First .</li>
            <li>so i had to rub it in which completly deafested the purpose of buying the gun in the first place</li>
            <li>First I have to say you can not use the lotion that comes with this machine.</li>
            <li>I was pretty much buying it for the gun, which you can&#x27;t beat!</li>
            <li>First, they try to scare us with all this talk about melanoma (and I know all about melanoma).</li>
            <li>We used too much bronzer, both of us turned out orange!</li>
            <li>First, dump the tanning spray immediately.</li>
            <li>Also, the gun doesn&#x27;t work consistently and often times not at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have done my entire body or I just retouch with this gun most the time.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the purshase while it last (about a month)</li>
            <li>This was the biggest waste of money, it doesn&#x27;t spray good at all.  </li>
            <li>The gun works really really well and seems pretty durable.</li>
            <li>The gun doesn&#x27;t do a good job at atomizing the liquid into small particles to spray.</li>
            <li>Right out of the other side of their mouth, they tell us that Max needs more vitamin D.     </li>
            <li>Happy Mommy totally recommends this product, here are a few tips we&#x27;ve picked up along the way:   - Exfoliate, exfoliate, and exfoliate some more (not easy but way worth it)!   </li>
            <li>The mist is so fine that that there are no streaks, and I&#x27;ve only had one blotch on my ankle, which was no biggie.</li>
            <li>It works very well, very sheer light mist</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very please with the results and ease of use.  </li>
            <li>Its better than i expected it to be.</li>
            <li>I would much rather it smell like a self-tanner instead of whatever they used to try and mask the smell.</li>
            <li>But you don&#x27;t really even need it.  </li>
            <li>and it is much cheaper.</li>
            <li>really i had to stop .     </li>
            <li>the gun doesnt really work with that</li>
            <li>The spray stream is very even.</li>
            <li>This will ensure those areas do not soak up too much of the solution.</li>
            <li>but with this, it was very spotty, the spray does not \\&quot;mist\\</li>
            <li>So no I don&#x27;t really recommend this, but lesson learned</li>
            <li>We bought this to get ready for the Sunburst Pageant.</li>
            <li>know matter how much I sprayed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also really noisy.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really give a lot of color</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than salon</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really thought it would be something like an aerosol can of spray tanner.</li>
            <li>How I do my own upper back</li>
            <li>gun is far from amazing after trying other DIY guns.</li>
            <li>Okay, now I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other self tanners out there</li>
            <li>If you are interested in purchasing this product, it would behoove you to read reviews on various sites (other than amazon); it appears this product is defective more times than not!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to return it due to Amazon&#x27;s return policy for &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; items</li>
            <li>and then as I was starting to clean it</li>
            <li>but once it sets in the odor is pretty light in comparison to other spray tans I&#x27;ve had done.  </li>
            <li>Also, a great tip is to add some thick lotion or vaseline on your feet, ankles, knees, elbows, and hands as these areas have thicker skin and will soak up the tanner too much - I would suggest spraying these areas about 10-12 inches away and briefly.  </li>
            <li>So no need for a high priced machine when this one will do the trick...</li>
            <li>highly recommended</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it for anyone with pale skin because you&#x27;d see the flaws more on someone with lighter skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this gun last year but didn&#x27;t really decide to start using it much until a month or two ago.  </li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t sound like a big deal until you are trying to spray tan every inch of your body alone (including you back).</li>
            <li>Now, if you spray too close to your skin it will most likely start to drip and that&#x27;s probably where other people are getting streaky results.  </li>
            <li>like it&#x27;s supposed to, It only really lasts about 4 days!   </li>
            <li>Our first experience was just before the FA Southern Elite,and boy did we have a heck of a time.</li>
            <li>If you know how to airbrush properly this is a VERY affordable gun!</li>
            <li>For anyone new to spray tanning, who just wants to have some color on their skin ( esp the upper body area) I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disapointed with AirGlow.</li>
            <li>On my lower back, I position the gun a certain way facing my body so that my thumb is on the trigger</li>
            <li>My tan looks natural and it lasts me about 1.5 weeks to 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>So, in conclusion, so far I&#x27;ve been using this system for about two weeks now</li>
            <li>My tan is a natural brown bronze color, not orangy at all.  </li>
            <li>, I think I&#x27;m going to invest in a professional spray system now.</li>
            <li>if u use a heat protector on ur hair the spray bottles they come in work just as well since u have to rub the product from the glowfusion in any ways just use an old spray bottle and rub it in.</li>
            <li>I buy the ocean professional spray</li>
            <li>Not a lot of solution in the kit and the solution will not give you a full dark tan.</li>
            <li>And for how strong the scent is it really provided a weak color.</li>
            <li>Gives a deep tan that looks realistic.  </li>
            <li>No other way to explain it.</li>
            <li>Apparently, they don&#x27;t do returns on this.</li>
            <li>(No long term redness, my face was clear the next day.)    </li>
            <li>mayb get a real spray gun like some other reviews have suggested .</li>
            <li>I read several reviews, and the reviews on the air gun were great, while the reviews on the included solution were bad.  </li>
            <li>The solution it comes with is a very light tint and smells pretty bad too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After owning this gun for almost a year..  </li>
            <li>Unless you are super flexible, you will probably need help getting to the hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li>but after the first use i knew it was a big waste of money.</li>
            <li>, maybe it won&#x27;t- then enjoy it (or at least the one use you&#x27;ll get out of it)!</li>
            <li>not that far and when I picked it up I heard loose pieces moving all around inside.  </li>

            <li> This gun is AWESOME.</li>
            <li> This tanning air gun is great!  </li>
            <li> the colour after use it is orange orange orange!I use the air gun (its perfect for home use)but with Siennasol tan liquid.</li>
            <li> , I think it takes some practice to perfect your technique.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with it...</li>
            <li> I havent used the solution that came with, but i bought the ocean one and is also realy good!!</li>
            <li> Its great because you can re charge the gun!</li>
            <li> The gun is awesome however</li>
            <li> i can always have an awesome tan</li>
            <li> I used it for about a year on and off- just on myself, my sister and best friends.</li>
            <li> this gun is amazing!!</li>
            <li> The color is very fair, but it does show up.</li>
            <li> this is a great product.</li>
            <li> The tan liquid that comes with it isnt great</li>
            <li> so I just use the airbrush liquid from ocean and it workd great.</li>
            <li> I bought the Ocean Medium tanning solution to use in it and the Ocean solution is great.  </li>
            <li> and the results are so great that my friends have asked me to spray tan then for upcoming weddings and events.</li>
            <li> Anyways, This machine works great</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE</li>
            <li> over all u will save money and b happy</li>
            <li> Great product (used with Ocean Medium spray) while it works.  </li>
            <li> I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> i am SO happy i bought this...</li>
            <li> Worked great until the it one day just died and wouldn&#x27;t charge or spray at all....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still working great</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> which does NOT smell good.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s good for beginners because it&#x27;s so fair</li>
            <li> I loved the Air Gun</li>
            <li> This product is realy good.</li>
            <li> and I got a good even tan...</li>
            <li> The gun workd really nice and does a good job.</li>
            <li> Make sure you exfoliate!</li>
            <li> Better idea - Buy a spray bottle!</li>
            <li> It is a very light spray, which is good for building color to get the results you desire.</li>
            <li> This tanning gun is amazing.</li>
            <li> it wasnt amazing lets just say that .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> The glowFusion gun is amazing.</li>
            <li> You get to do this in the privacy of your own home.</li>
            <li> and it kind of feels like its going to stop working soon.</li>
            <li> I used my own solution, so I can&#x27;t give a review on the solution that comes with it.</li>
            <li> - Spray during nap time (an even spray is best accomplished when still)    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve decided to invest the money in a real HVLP spray tan gun ( found an awesome one of ebay for $150) and am looking forward to giving that try.</li>
            <li> I liked the charging it up idea and being portable</li>
            <li> really liked this product and it did work for me for months although went to use it and</li>
            <li> I really loved this when I first got it, it applied great</li>
            <li> The product worked great, I was cleaning out the nozzle after each use and had very good results, until I tried to use it for the third time.</li>
            <li> It sprays evenly and with the tinted spray I use very easy to see where you are putting it.  </li>
            <li> I love not having to go into Target and purchase self-tanner products (which I think is kind of embarrassing) every week.</li>
            <li> Must say this item is pretty great.</li>
            <li> I have very light skin and all I noticed was the smell and no color.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I love this thing.</li>
            <li> I love the cocoa smell of the tanning solution and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin smelling funky afterwards.  </li>
            <li> is I bend over like I&#x27;m touching my toes and then with one hand spray the mist in a side to side motion.</li>
            <li> Saves me tons of money :-)</li>
            <li> It worked ok</li>
            <li> That gives you much more even coverage than the gun</li>
            <li> like it sputters and sprays more of dots than a continuous mist .</li>
            <li> i made sure it was charged and</li>
            <li> it stopped working after one use, so i simply put the ocean solution in a spray bottle and used latex gloves to rub it in and it worked perfectly</li>
            <li> I love that you can just recharge it and not worry about buying batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Spend a bit more and get something nicer.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off buying those spray cans at Walgreens or CVS.</li>
            <li> (Not the most in-depth</li>
            <li> for a more even tan.</li>
            <li> (Important!</li>
            <li> as most products do if they are not hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li> Love love love them.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Make sure to charge fully before using.</li>
            <li> OKAY.</li>
            <li> Have used for two years or so and love the tan.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with the spray tanner and would buy another if mine breaks!</li>
            <li> Ended up just using a spray bottle which worked 10 X better btw.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the solution it came with</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell great but very easy to use and no mess!  </li>
            <li> I was soooooo excited to get my own air gun</li>
            <li> Like we said, after more trail and error, we think we&#x27;ve figured out a pretty good system.</li>
            <li> Other then that its a great way to have a nice glow without going to a tanning bed!</li>
            <li> I have to say I loved this gun at first.</li>
            <li> Save your money until you have enough to buy a good thing for a fair price...</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews which stated this fact and its very true.</li>
            <li> I used Ocean tanning spray (which is amazing and worth every penny)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the light mist that comes from the gun.</li>
            <li> the gun is awesome because you can use any other solution with it.</li>
            <li> -The solution may not be the best idea for your face if you have allergies to other beauty products.</li>
            <li> I bought this looking for an easy out to going to a tanning salon/buying self-tanning products every week.</li>
            <li> Basically, it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> You can feel where the mist lands, so overlapping is quite easy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy</li>
            <li> The gun is easy to use and sprays in a mist.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so easy to do</li>
            <li> I was happy to get a good product for a good price, but I was proved wrong again</li>
            <li> the mist is so fine that it doesn&#x27;t allow the solution to streak.  </li>
            <li> On your torso, chest and face, the side to side motion works best, while again slightly overlapping.  </li>
            <li> As for now, I&#x27;ll stick with L&#x27;oreal self-tanner spray which does a perfectly fine job.</li>
            <li> did fine with it</li>
            <li> My hopes were that it would spray a fine mist on my body, so I would not have to rub it in.  </li>
            <li> The battery would not hold a charge and the nozzle became clogged and sprayed huge blotches all over my skin.</li>
            <li> This air gun is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I do like the light mist of the gun.</li>
            <li> (if you read enough reviews you&#x27;ll see this isn&#x27;t an uncommon problem).</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cheap option to save money from going to a salon.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine had this same airbrushing gun, and she told me great things about it</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s a lot of important information.)  </li>
            <li> I paid cheap</li>
            <li> I got cheap...</li>
            <li> /&gt;If directions are followed tan looks great and lasts, especially if maintained using a tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I used the ocean tanning solution with this, and I think the solution itself was good because I have a friend that does professional spray tans and her machine</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would be a quick and easy spray tan gun.</li>
            <li> The mist is so light and cool, it almost tickles.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> might be better though for your first time application)</li>
            <li> I was so excited to recieve it in the mail and have have nothing but a pain.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this</li>
            <li> This is definitely worth the money!  </li>
            <li> away.they said that you must clean it every time you use it</li>
            <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t use it right though!</li>
            <li> The gun is easy to use and produces a fine mist that is very consistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband is even jealous that I&#x27;m darker than him and wants me to use it on him.  :-)</li>
            <li> the good think is that you can buy another cable for only 5 dollars.</li>
            <li> Love the color of my skin and would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> We have been through just about every kind of spray tan you can imagine, and this one by far, takes the cake.     </li>
            <li> At the last minute we changed our routine to an Oompa Loompa song-and-dance number and the judges LOVED it.</li>
            <li> Save your money and buy the real deal :)</li>
            <li> All in all its pretty good for the price, and so far it was worth it.</li>
            <li> First of all, it does spray the solution out in a even fine mist</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure if I find a different solution to put in the gun I will like it a lot more.</li>
            <li> Now that the winter months are over and it&#x27;s time to bare some more skin I have to admit I would not be comfortable in a bathing suit or shorts with this tan gun as it does not cover evenly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be looking for a more high powered gun with a more professional result.</li>
            <li> You have to learn to use - don&#x27;t spray too close, use even strokes, clean with hot water after every use.</li>
            <li> Its such a shame because the mist that does come out is nice and evenly distributed but the tanning solution it comes with does not do anything.</li>
            <li> but I feel its worth it to just buy another one.</li>
            <li> Also, the battery dies pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I have owned it for 3 months now and clean it after every use and it sill works like new!!</li>
            <li> It basically never worked properly right from the start.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this product is pretty amazing for the price, and pays for itself after only a couple applications at home over going to the tanning booth.</li>
            <li> The gun is okay, it does have an extremely light mist so that it will dry evenly.</li>
            <li> First, the batteries stop holding a charge right away</li>
            <li> Since the gun had such great reviews, I figured I would purchase it then use a different solution in it!  </li>
            <li> From what I can tell, the gun itself work very very well.</li>
            <li> The GlowFusion Solution is very yellow and very, very light.</li>
            <li> well I hardly ever did that although it was when I did clean it really good that it stopped working</li>
            <li> First off, it&#x27;s about $30.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s pretty close to the price you would pay if you went to a Mystic Tan in a salon.</li>
            <li> First I want to say that I don&#x27;t have any interest with the GlowFusion company....</li>
            <li> Also, when you do order it I guess there are two shades of color which I wasn&#x27;t aware when I bought it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I never got that opportunity to practice because the gun stopped working after one use (pulls air into chamber, doesn&#x27;t spray tanner).</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re willing to take your chances-</li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s exactly what it looked like for me.</li>
            <li> First .</li>
            <li> so i had to rub it in which completly deafested the purpose of buying the gun in the first place</li>
            <li> First I have to say you can not use the lotion that comes with this machine.</li>
            <li> I was pretty much buying it for the gun, which you can&#x27;t beat!</li>
            <li> First, they try to scare us with all this talk about melanoma (and I know all about melanoma).</li>
            <li> We used too much bronzer, both of us turned out orange!</li>
            <li> First, dump the tanning spray immediately.</li>
            <li> Also, the gun doesn&#x27;t work consistently and often times not at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have done my entire body or I just retouch with this gun most the time.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the purshase while it last (about a month)</li>
            <li> This was the biggest waste of money, it doesn&#x27;t spray good at all.  </li>
            <li> The gun works really really well and seems pretty durable.</li>
            <li> The gun doesn&#x27;t do a good job at atomizing the liquid into small particles to spray.</li>
            <li> Right out of the other side of their mouth, they tell us that Max needs more vitamin D.     </li>
            <li> Happy Mommy totally recommends this product, here are a few tips we&#x27;ve picked up along the way:   - Exfoliate, exfoliate, and exfoliate some more (not easy but way worth it)!   </li>
            <li> The mist is so fine that that there are no streaks, and I&#x27;ve only had one blotch on my ankle, which was no biggie.</li>
            <li> It works very well, very sheer light mist</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very please with the results and ease of use.  </li>
            <li> Its better than i expected it to be.</li>
            <li> I would much rather it smell like a self-tanner instead of whatever they used to try and mask the smell.</li>
            <li> But you don&#x27;t really even need it.  </li>
            <li> and it is much cheaper.</li>
            <li> really i had to stop .     </li>
            <li> the gun doesnt really work with that</li>
            <li> The spray stream is very even.</li>
            <li> This will ensure those areas do not soak up too much of the solution.</li>
            <li> but with this, it was very spotty, the spray does not \\&quot;mist\\</li>
            <li> So no I don&#x27;t really recommend this, but lesson learned</li>
            <li> We bought this to get ready for the Sunburst Pageant.</li>
            <li> know matter how much I sprayed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also really noisy.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really give a lot of color</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than salon</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really thought it would be something like an aerosol can of spray tanner.</li>
            <li> How I do my own upper back</li>
            <li> gun is far from amazing after trying other DIY guns.</li>
            <li> Okay, now I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other self tanners out there</li>
            <li> If you are interested in purchasing this product, it would behoove you to read reviews on various sites (other than amazon); it appears this product is defective more times than not!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to return it due to Amazon&#x27;s return policy for &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; items</li>
            <li> and then as I was starting to clean it</li>
            <li> but once it sets in the odor is pretty light in comparison to other spray tans I&#x27;ve had done.  </li>
            <li> Also, a great tip is to add some thick lotion or vaseline on your feet, ankles, knees, elbows, and hands as these areas have thicker skin and will soak up the tanner too much - I would suggest spraying these areas about 10-12 inches away and briefly.  </li>
            <li> So no need for a high priced machine when this one will do the trick...</li>
            <li> highly recommended</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it for anyone with pale skin because you&#x27;d see the flaws more on someone with lighter skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this gun last year but didn&#x27;t really decide to start using it much until a month or two ago.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t sound like a big deal until you are trying to spray tan every inch of your body alone (including you back).</li>
            <li> Now, if you spray too close to your skin it will most likely start to drip and that&#x27;s probably where other people are getting streaky results.  </li>
            <li> like it&#x27;s supposed to, It only really lasts about 4 days!   </li>
            <li> Our first experience was just before the FA Southern Elite,and boy did we have a heck of a time.</li>
            <li> If you know how to airbrush properly this is a VERY affordable gun!</li>
            <li> For anyone new to spray tanning, who just wants to have some color on their skin ( esp the upper body area) I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disapointed with AirGlow.</li>
            <li> On my lower back, I position the gun a certain way facing my body so that my thumb is on the trigger</li>
            <li> My tan looks natural and it lasts me about 1.5 weeks to 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> So, in conclusion, so far I&#x27;ve been using this system for about two weeks now</li>
            <li> My tan is a natural brown bronze color, not orangy at all.  </li>
            <li> , I think I&#x27;m going to invest in a professional spray system now.</li>
            <li> if u use a heat protector on ur hair the spray bottles they come in work just as well since u have to rub the product from the glowfusion in any ways just use an old spray bottle and rub it in.</li>
            <li> I buy the ocean professional spray</li>
            <li> Not a lot of solution in the kit and the solution will not give you a full dark tan.</li>
            <li> And for how strong the scent is it really provided a weak color.</li>
            <li> Gives a deep tan that looks realistic.  </li>
            <li> No other way to explain it.</li>
            <li> Apparently, they don&#x27;t do returns on this.</li>
            <li> (No long term redness, my face was clear the next day.)    </li>
            <li> mayb get a real spray gun like some other reviews have suggested .</li>
            <li> I read several reviews, and the reviews on the air gun were great, while the reviews on the included solution were bad.  </li>
            <li> The solution it comes with is a very light tint and smells pretty bad too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After owning this gun for almost a year..  </li>
            <li> Unless you are super flexible, you will probably need help getting to the hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> but after the first use i knew it was a big waste of money.</li>
            <li> , maybe it won&#x27;t- then enjoy it (or at least the one use you&#x27;ll get out of it)!</li>
            <li> not that far and when I picked it up I heard loose pieces moving all around inside.  </li>
            <li> I used as much as I could possibly stand to and had very little results.</li>
            <li> so I knew it would be worth the investment if I was seriously considering self tanning at home.</li>
            <li> so all you really need is the Ocean tanning solution and one of the sponge paint brushes and a small spray bottle.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pale, but the solution that came with this product didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> If only I had found those other reviews prior to ordering...</li>
            <li> The key is to spray the mist about 6-8 inches away just as the directions state, and you want to start in sections and work your way up slowly, i.e. knees down first, then thighs, then torso, etc.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, The motor seems to be cheap and starts bogging down after a few months and has a hard time creating a siphon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This spray actually made my face itch and get a little red...</li>
            <li> It blows air both ways instead of absorbing the liquid :/ definitely not worth the money.</li>
            <li> The gun uses a vacuum type suction and once the orings break down the vacuum seal is broken and the whole gun needs replaced.</li>
            <li> It gets clogged super easy and has the worst spray out I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> Dry skin effects finished look!)  </li>
            <li> This little gun not only saved me money ( a lot of money!)</li>
            <li> On top of that, the Glow Fusion solution smells so bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also such a waste of time/gas/money going to the salon.</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s not really any visible damage.</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit rough</li>
            <li> Read the directions carefully.</li>
            <li> It seems to spray a bit harder.</li>
            <li> -So be careful around hands, feet, elbows...   </li>
            <li> If I tan myself with my spray tan machine one day, the next few days I can touch up with this gun.</li>
            <li> but the gun broke within a few uses and only sprays air.</li>
            <li> such a squirmy little fella&#x27;!  </li>
            <li> I ended up using the solution half and half with the Ocean DHA Medium Solution because I found that to be way too dark and way too red.</li>
            <li> I will be keeping the gun and just using other sunless liquid products in it.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews I decided to skip the solution that came with it and used Ocean solution instead.</li>
            <li> I accidentally dropped my gun on the floor the other night</li>
            <li> and the other reviews are correct .</li>
            <li> A little piece of plastic had come from inside of the gun and jammed the trigger.</li>
            <li> this whole  system sucks seriously don&#x27;t be fooled</li>
            <li> This gun is not useful.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> This will be probably going down the drain when I get home tonight.</li>
            <li> you can not tip the gun at all like on its side or upside down .</li>
            <li> I ordered a spray gun and it will not spray unless plugged in and turned upside down.</li>
            <li> and i don&#x27;t have to pay for it every other week!</li>
            <li> On your legs and arms you want to spray in an Up &amp; Down motion, slightly overlapping.</li>
            <li> Secondly, you cannot turn the gun upside down which makes it very hard if you are spraying yourself.  </li>
            <li> Also, while spraying you want to slightly overlap to prevent missing spots.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews about this product not working, so I was a little worried.</li>
            <li> and it was just a little bump...</li>
            <li> You may want to rub a little lotion on your ankles, feet, knees, elbows and hands, before you spray.</li>
            <li> I bought this spray tanner in January 2015 and wanted to wait a little while before reviewing it.</li>
            <li> Plus, it dripped little droplets all over me.</li>
            <li> all of the directions carefully!!!</li>
            <li> So, just a few moments ago, I was going to tan and</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> twice a week as opposed to everyday, ect.)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with this product</li>
            <li> -Moisturize in the days AFTER use so that your spray tan doesn&#x27;t begin to &#x27;crack&#x27; or fade unevenly.   </li>
            <li> I wasted money on this.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> We have been looking for something other than the parlor for a few months now... had to switch from the bed to the booth once Max started walking, even with that it&#x27;s hard to keep him still;</li>
            <li> and it makes it extremely dificult to get hard to reach places .     </li>
            <li> Make our little bronze Adonis shine!</li>
            <li> but I used it with another tan product because I have read reviews in the product&#x27;s site and most girls said that the product was awful</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned three of these gun in the past 2 years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> not sure</li>
            <li> 1st the mist goes every where  2nd the mist has to be rubbed in because the u can see dots every where  sooo ill share my secrete</li>
            <li> It comes out in an aerosol but just way to small to know where it&#x27;s going.</li>
            <li> so not sure what happened</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed- a complete waste of $40</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed- a complete waste of $40</li>
            <li> I bought the Ocean tanning solution that was recommended in some other reviews and have not tried the original formula that came with the gun, so I cannot testify as to whether or not it smells bad, looks bad ect.</li>
            <li> So you may want to use a lotion that is specifically for delicate skin on your face if this is an issue with you.</li>
            <li> I got this in spite of all the negative reviews</li>
            <li> but too late before it shipped out.</li>
            <li> its too thick for the gun .</li>
            <li> I would end up spending $10 a week on that alone, and they are gross, streaky and the sprayers get clogged up, or they just flat out smell terrible.</li>
            <li> Too bad it only worked for approx 10</li>
            <li> I think the Ocean solution is too thick for this spray gun because it sputtered out everywhere, and I had to rub it in (always wearing gloves of course!).  </li>
            <li> If you get bad results, you&#x27;re obviously doing something wrong.</li>
            <li> Perhaps even worse, I&#x27;ve tried contacting GlowFusion to see if there&#x27;s any way to rememdy the situation</li>
            <li> Had a frustrating time getting this thing to work.  </li>
            <li> So I am not happy with the gun for the reason I purchased it.</li>
            <li> it sucks--it smells terrible and is very light(this</li>
            <li> The only real disappointment was that the solution that comes with the kit is definitely for a &#x27;beginner&#x27; who doesn&#x27;t already have a base tan.</li>
            <li> The solution that comes with this gun does smell HORRIBLE, and I usually do not mind sunless tanner odors.  </li>
            <li> It gave me absolutely NO color which is very disappointing.</li>
            <li> The stench is awful, it made me cough and sneeze like no other.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t spend your money!!!!!!!this work veryyy slow!!</li>
            <li> After looking every where online for a spray tanning machine that wasn&#x27;t very expensive, I found this one and despite the negative reviews I went for it.</li>
            <li> Its almost like getting a very weak mist with some rain drops thrown in there.</li>
            <li> once they start to degrade, the gun becomes useless.</li>
            <li> which is a complete waist of time and the smell is soo bad its sickening .</li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really sorry</li>
            <li> Wrong again.</li>
            <li> but what a disappointment it turned out to be.</li>
            <li> i was so mad</li>
            <li> mean while, I&#x27;l save your time not telling you about my awful experience with that thing...</li>
            <li> Glow fusion brand tanning solution smells bad.</li>
            <li> The gun has really disappointed me though.  </li>
            <li> anyone who gives this crap 5 stars is affiliated with the company in some way.</li>
            <li> I hate the day that I had to throw it</li>
            <li> This product is horrible!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend sprayed me and I couldn&#x27;t stop coughing, I couldn&#x27;t breath it was awful!</li>
            <li> but it is horrible.</li>
            <li> , it smells awful</li>
            <li> However, the tanning solution it comes with is awful!!</li>
            <li> the solution it came with is awful .</li>
            <li> its awful</li>
            <li> STINKS!!!</li>
            <li> It splatters when it sprays - leaks horribly - the solution is horrible.</li>
            <li> When being sprayed the smell is awful</li>
            <li> The solution it came with was awful, buy something else.</li>
            <li> Figured at worst it could do my face.</li>
            <li> I was so disgusted although I am going to buy another.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this looking for an easy out to going to a tanning salon/buying self-tanning products every week. This air gun is fantastic. First off, it&#x27;s about $30. What have you got to lose? That&#x27;s pretty close to the price you would pay if you went to a Mystic Tan in a salon. I love not having to go into Target and purchase self-tanner products (which I think is kind of embarrassing) every week. I would end up spending $10 a week on that alone, and they are gross, streaky and the sprayers get clogged up, or they just flat out smell terrible. It&#x27;s also such a waste of time/gas/money going to the salon. You get to do this in the privacy of your own home. This gun is AWESOME. The mist is so light and cool, it almost tickles. The back is a challenge to get, but by bending over, you can feel the spray and tell where it&#x27;s going. The mist is so fine that that there are no streaks, and I&#x27;ve only had one blotch on my ankle, which was no biggie. Seriously, I love this thing. The only thing I can complain about is the solution it comes with. The color is very fair, but it does show up. And it smells like chocolate wine... which does NOT smell good. I guess it&#x27;s good for beginners because it&#x27;s so fair that you can accidentally \\&quot;linger\\&quot; in a spot and there&#x27;s not really any visible damage. I&#x27;m waiting for my Ocean 8.5 solution that everyone is talking about. Hopefully I&#x27;ll achieve a darker color than what comes with the gun. Basically, it&#x27;s easy to use. If you get bad results, you&#x27;re obviously doing something wrong.</li>
            <li> The spray gun works well, the solution is worthles. Dont buy this product without buying some solution too! But still for the price you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> I read some reviews about this product not working, so I was a little worried. I received it yesterday and it seems to work, it sprays out the tanning solution but it does seem like its not a constant mist at times and it kind of feels like its going to stop working soon. Its such a shame because the mist that does come out is nice and evenly distributed but the tanning solution it comes with does not do anything. I have very light skin and all I noticed was the smell and no color. I bought the Oceans self tanner for the gun so hopefully its still working buy the time I receive it! All in all its pretty good for the price, and so far it was worth it.</li>
            <li> First I want to say that I don&#x27;t have any interest with the GlowFusion company....I&#x27;ve just done alot of research on how to properly apply self tanner by viewing videos on YouTube, etc.  Okay, now I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other self tanners out there and I always turn out orangy and/or streaky.  This tanning air gun is great!  I love the cocoa smell of the tanning solution and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin smelling funky afterwards.  My tan looks natural and it lasts me about 1.5 weeks to 2 weeks.  No problems with streakiness here....the mist is so fine that it doesn&#x27;t allow the solution to streak.  Now, if you spray too close to your skin it will most likely start to drip and that&#x27;s probably where other people are getting streaky results.  The key is to spray the mist about 6-8 inches away just as the directions state, and you want to start in sections and work your way up slowly, i.e. knees down first, then thighs, then torso, etc.  Also, while spraying you want to slightly overlap to prevent missing spots. On your legs and arms you want to spray in an Up &amp; Down motion, slightly overlapping. On your torso, chest and face, the side to side motion works best, while again slightly overlapping.  Also, a great tip is to add some thick lotion or vaseline on your feet, ankles, knees, elbows, and hands as these areas have thicker skin and will soak up the tanner too much - I would suggest spraying these areas about 10-12 inches away and briefly.  How I do my own upper back is I bend over like I&#x27;m touching my toes and then with one hand spray the mist in a side to side motion. On my lower back, I position the gun a certain way facing my body so that my thumb is on the trigger and I spray side to side.  You can feel where the mist lands, so overlapping is quite easy.  So, in conclusion, so far I&#x27;ve been using this system for about two weeks now and I&#x27;m very please with the results and ease of use.  My tan is a natural brown bronze color, not orangy at all.  My husband is even jealous that I&#x27;m darker than him and wants me to use it on him.  :-)</li>
            <li> this is a great product. The gun workd really nice and does a good job. The tan liquid that comes with it isnt great so I just use the airbrush liquid from ocean and it workd great. Saves me tons of money :-)</li>
            <li> This product is horrible! It&#x27;s not the gun, it is the actual liquid. My boyfriend sprayed me and I couldn&#x27;t stop coughing, I couldn&#x27;t breath it was awful! The smell is so gross, is smells like whiskey. I don&#x27;t know what is in this solution but it is horrible. It gave me absolutely NO color which is very disappointing. I do like the light mist of the gun. I will be keeping the gun and just using other sunless liquid products in it. But bye bye glow fusion! This will be probably going down the drain when I get home tonight. Also, when you do order it I guess there are two shades of color which I wasn&#x27;t aware when I bought it.</li>
            <li> I loved the Air Gun but I used it with another tan product because I have read reviews in the product&#x27;s site and most girls said that the product was awful, it smells awful (its true)and the colour after use it is orange orange orange!I use the air gun (its perfect for home use)but with Siennasol tan liquid. Also the cable of the air gun after one use didns&#x27;t work again(too bad)but the good think is that you can buy another cable for only 5 dollars.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift, used it once. After reading other reviews I decided to skip the solution that came with it and used Ocean solution instead. It worked ok, I think it takes some practice to perfect your technique. Unfortunately, I never got that opportunity to practice because the gun stopped working after one use (pulls air into chamber, doesn&#x27;t spray tanner). Perhaps even worse, I&#x27;ve tried contacting GlowFusion to see if there&#x27;s any way to rememdy the situation (if you read enough reviews you&#x27;ll see this isn&#x27;t an uncommon problem). They never bothered to reply. So if you&#x27;re willing to take your chances- maybe it&#x27;ll work, maybe it won&#x27;t- then enjoy it (or at least the one use you&#x27;ll get out of it)!</li>
            <li> I really like this product! I&#x27;m very happy with it... The smell is a bit rough but it&#x27;s worth it! I also don&#x27;t feel like the tan lasts up to 2 weeks like it&#x27;s supposed to, It only really lasts about 4 days!   Other then that its a great way to have a nice glow without going to a tanning bed!</li>
            <li> This tanning gun is amazing. Its better than i expected it to be. I Recommend buying OCEAN tanning solution along with this kit. The solution it comes with is a very light tint and smells pretty bad too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After owning this gun for almost a year..  the only problem that I ran into is the battery stopped hold a charge. I have to plug in the gun to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gun is far from amazing after trying other DIY guns. I&#x27;ve owned three of these gun in the past 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; First, the batteries stop holding a charge right away so you have to have it plugged in all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, The motor seems to be cheap and starts bogging down after a few months and has a hard time creating a siphon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, The orings and seals don&#x27;t last at all. once they start to degrade, the gun becomes useless. The gun uses a vacuum type suction and once the orings break down the vacuum seal is broken and the whole gun needs replaced.</li>
            <li> The gun is okay, it does have an extremely light mist so that it will dry evenly. However, the tanning solution it comes with is awful!! I used as much as I could possibly stand to and had very little results. The stench is awful, it made me cough and sneeze like no other. I would much rather it smell like a self-tanner instead of whatever they used to try and mask the smell. I&#x27;m sure if I find a different solution to put in the gun I will like it a lot more. As for now, I&#x27;ll stick with L&#x27;oreal self-tanner spray which does a perfectly fine job.</li>
            <li> I bought this gun last year but didn&#x27;t really decide to start using it much until a month or two ago.  I bought the Ocean Medium tanning solution to use in it and the Ocean solution is great.  Gives a deep tan that looks realistic.  The gun has really disappointed me though.  First of all, it does spray the solution out in a even fine mist but sometimes it sputters which causes you to have to rub or sponge the solution in.  Secondly, you cannot turn the gun upside down which makes it very hard if you are spraying yourself.  I accidentally dropped my gun on the floor the other night and it was just a little bump...not that far and when I picked it up I heard loose pieces moving all around inside.  I tried it and it was still working.  So, just a few moments ago, I was going to tan and when I let go of the button, it would not stop spraying.  Tanning solution was going everywhere and I had to hold it towards the sink and try to get it to stop and I couldn&#x27;t.  I hit it, banged it and I finally got it to stop spraying.  A little piece of plastic had come from inside of the gun and jammed the trigger. I pulled that out and that seemed to solve the problem and it let me get finished and then as I was starting to clean it, it just totally stopped working.  I can&#x27;t believe it just stopped working.  But you don&#x27;t really even need it.  I had to use a sponge to rub in the solution anyway so all you really need is the Ocean tanning solution and one of the sponge paint brushes and a small spray bottle.  Just spray it on you with the bottle and then use the sponge to rub it in.  That gives you much more even coverage than the gun and it is much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cheap option to save money from going to a salon. This gun is not useful. It&#x27;s streaky, point blank. That&#x27;s the last thing you want when you&#x27;re spray tanning. You don&#x27;t want to look like you&#x27;ve used an at home spray gun and that&#x27;s exactly what it looked like for me. I&#x27;ll be looking for a more high powered gun with a more professional result.</li>
            <li> First . the solution it came with is awful . it does not give you any color what so ever . which is a complete waist of time and the smell is soo bad its sickening . really i had to stop .     I bought the ocean spray to spray with it . and the other reviews are correct . its too thick for the gun . like it sputters and sprays more of dots than a continuous mist . you can not tip the gun at all like on its side or upside down . like it will leak and the solution will get everywhere . its awful and it makes it extremely dificult to get hard to reach places .     i dont know if i would recommend this . it wasnt amazing lets just say that . mayb get a real spray gun like some other reviews have suggested . i might return mine not sure</li>
            <li> I was soooooo excited to get my own air gun but after the first use i knew it was a big waste of money. the stuff it comes with doesnt work so i bought the ocean spray tan stuff and the gun doesnt really work with that either it just sputters it everywhere so i had to rub it in which completly deafested the purpose of buying the gun in the first place, i tried to over look that tho so oneday my friend came over and i was going to spray tan her with the glow fusion air gun and guess what happens it stoped working completly i was so mad i made sure it was charged and everything but nope it stopped working after one use, so i simply put the ocean solution in a spray bottle and used latex gloves to rub it in and it worked perfectly this whole  system sucks seriously don&#x27;t be fooled</li>
            <li> A friend of mine had this same airbrushing gun, and she told me great things about it so I knew it would be worth the investment if I was seriously considering self tanning at home. The gun is easy to use and produces a fine mist that is very consistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: you can use any spray tanning solution  you want in it. The spray stream is very even. The compartment holds enough for multiple full-body tanning sessions so you aren&#x27;t constantly refilling. I love that you can just recharge it and not worry about buying batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: You can&#x27;t turn the gun upside-down and you have to try and keep it upright at all times. This doesn&#x27;t sound like a big deal until you are trying to spray tan every inch of your body alone (including you back). Unless you are super flexible, you will probably need help getting to the hard to reach areas. My fiance helps me out so it&#x27;s not big deal, but if you are trying to do this solo, you are probably going to need practice with some of the areas on your backside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product is pretty amazing for the price, and pays for itself after only a couple applications at home over going to the tanning booth. It&#x27;s so easy and the results are so great that my friends have asked me to spray tan then for upcoming weddings and events.</li>
            <li> After looking every where online for a spray tanning machine that wasn&#x27;t very expensive, I found this one and despite the negative reviews I went for it. First I have to say you can not use the lotion that comes with this machine. IT STINKS!!! and doesn&#x27;t work at all!!!! I used Ocean tanning spray (which is amazing and worth every penny) I charged the GlowFusion gun and followed directions.. Make sure you exfoliate! Anyways, This machine works great never have any problem with it at all. It sprays evenly and with the tinted spray I use very easy to see where you are putting it.  So no need for a high priced machine when this one will do the trick... I have owned it for 3 months now and clean it after every use and it sill works like new!! GREAT PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE</li>
            <li> This product is realy good. I havent used the solution that came with, but i bought the ocean one and is also realy good!!</li>
            <li> From what I can tell, the gun itself work very very well. I absolutely love the light mist that comes from the gun. It is a very light spray, which is good for building color to get the results you desire. I used my own solution, so I can&#x27;t give a review on the solution that comes with it. I was pretty much buying it for the gun, which you can&#x27;t beat! ONE SIDE NOTE: You may want to rub a little lotion on your ankles, feet, knees, elbows and hands, before you spray. This will ensure those areas do not soak up too much of the solution.</li>
            <li> This thing is just meh... I used the ocean tanning solution with this, and I think the solution itself was good because I have a friend that does professional spray tans and her machine did fine with it and I got a good even tan... but with this, it was very spotty, the spray does not \\&quot;mist\\&quot; it feels like I&#x27;m using just a regular spray bottle with solution in it, I could get a regular spray bottle for a $1. So no I don&#x27;t really recommend this, but lesson learned, I think I&#x27;m going to invest in a professional spray system now.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell great but very easy to use and no mess!  Love the color of my skin and would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of the reviews on the gun.  It works very well, very sheer light mist so it works well for sunless tanning solution.  I haven&#x27;t tried the solution yet, I used another brand I had left over.  Its great because you can re charge the gun!</li>
            <li> We bought this to get ready for the Sunburst Pageant. We have been through just about every kind of spray tan you can imagine, and this one by far, takes the cake.     We have been looking for something other than the parlor for a few months now... had to switch from the bed to the booth once Max started walking, even with that it&#x27;s hard to keep him still; such a squirmy little fella&#x27;!  I just don&#x27;t understand those doctors. First, they try to scare us with all this talk about melanoma (and I know all about melanoma). Right out of the other side of their mouth, they tell us that Max needs more vitamin D.     Anyway, we started trying the spray tan and after A LOT of trail and error, we found the Fusion Beauty GlowFusion AirGlow product.      Our first experience was just before the FA Southern Elite,and boy did we have a heck of a time. We used too much bronzer, both of us turned out orange! At the last minute we changed our routine to an Oompa Loompa song-and-dance number and the judges LOVED it. That&#x27;s pageant life for you; you WORK WHAT YOU GOT, WORK IT BABY!      Like we said, after more trail and error, we think we&#x27;ve figured out a pretty good system. Happy Mommy totally recommends this product, here are a few tips we&#x27;ve picked up along the way:   - Exfoliate, exfoliate, and exfoliate some more (not easy but way worth it)!   - Spray during nap time (an even spray is best accomplished when still)    - No outside play for 24 hours after (sweat causes streaks)     We have the international Prince and Princess pageant coming up... COME ON FUSION BEAUTY GLOWFUSION AIRGLOW.... Make our little bronze Adonis shine!</li>
            <li> 1st the mist goes every where  2nd the mist has to be rubbed in because the u can see dots every where  sooo ill share my secrete if u use a heat protector on ur hair the spray bottles they come in work just as well since u have to rub the product from the glowfusion in any ways just use an old spray bottle and rub it in. I buy the ocean professional spray the 20$ pint lasted me 2 years and i aplicate about 2xs a week give or take. just be carefull using this product on ur face. over all u will save money and b happy</li>
            <li> Great product (used with Ocean Medium spray) while it works.  Too bad it only worked for approx 10 uses before sputtering out and breaking.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Spend the extra $20-$40 for a product that will last.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Not only does the gun not work but the company will not refund your money-they will only replace the product.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend bought me this airbrush gun for Christmas and I have been using it for about 4 months now. I have to say I loved this gun at first. I used to spend tons of money on drug store self tanners and occasionally spoil myself with an airbrush tan at a salon. This little gun not only saved me money ( a lot of money!) but time as well ( driving to the salon, only have to use it once or twice a week as opposed to everyday, ect.) I bought the Ocean tanning solution that was recommended in some other reviews and have not tried the original formula that came with the gun, so I cannot testify as to whether or not it smells bad, looks bad ect. Now that the winter months are over and it&#x27;s time to bare some more skin I have to admit I would not be comfortable in a bathing suit or shorts with this tan gun as it does not cover evenly. I think with a lot of practice ( and perhaps I am using the wrong tanning solution for this type of machine) it might look better. I don&#x27;t have the patience.Like I said I have been using it for 4 months, I have also watched countless videos on youtube about application and I am still dissatisfied with the end result of the tan. I&#x27;ve decided to invest the money in a real HVLP spray tan gun ( found an awesome one of ebay for $150) and am looking forward to giving that try. For anyone new to spray tanning, who just wants to have some color on their skin ( esp the upper body area) I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disapointed with AirGlow. If you are a spray tan regular you will not like it. Save your money and buy the real deal :)</li>
            <li> This was the biggest waste of money, it doesn&#x27;t spray good at all.  Don&#x27;t waste your time with this product</li>
            <li> used once, very leaky and then the tip must have gotten clogged and never worked again, waste of money..dont buy</li>
            <li> DONT WAIST YOUR MONEY. It splatters when it sprays - leaks horribly - the solution is horrible. Better idea - Buy a spray bottle!</li>
            <li> The gun is awesome however the solution it came with did not show up on my skin know matter how much I sprayed. I will be purchasing a different solution for the air glow gun. The gun is easy to use and sprays in a mist. I am happy with my purchase. Read the directions carefully.</li>
            <li> First, dump the tanning spray immediately. You will regret putting this on your body. Smells like buring wood or something. Also, the gun doesn&#x27;t work consistently and often times not at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spend a bit more and get something nicer.</li>
            <li> Had a frustrating time getting this thing to work.  However, I discovered that if you don&#x27;t put the tiny plugs back in after adding tanner, it will work.  Will NOT work if you replug those holes.</li>
            <li> This product does NOT work! I am extremely disappointed- a complete waste of $40+! If you are interested in purchasing this product, it would behoove you to read reviews on various sites (other than amazon); it appears this product is defective more times than not! If only I had found those other reviews prior to ordering...</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would be a quick and easy spray tan gun. It gets clogged super easy and has the worst spray out I&#x27;ve seen. The thing doesn&#x27;t stream it squirts. On top of that, the Glow Fusion solution smells so bad. It didn&#x27;t spray evenly and I regret not testing it out before buying in on line. It&#x27;s also really noisy. You&#x27;re better off buying those spray cans at Walgreens or CVS.</li>
            <li> I really loved this when I first got it, it applied great but after not even having it for a month it stopped sucking up the tanning solution. I wasn&#x27;t able to return it due to Amazon&#x27;s return policy for &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; items but I contacted the buyer and they returned my money. I would have rated this air brush tanning gun 4 stars if It hadn&#x27;t stopped working. Basically you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I read several reviews, and the reviews on the air gun were great, while the reviews on the included solution were bad.  The solution that comes with this gun does smell HORRIBLE, and I usually do not mind sunless tanner odors.  Since the gun had such great reviews, I figured I would purchase it then use a different solution in it!  I was wrong.  I wanted to use the Ocean Sunless Airbrush Tanning 8.5% Solution I ordered from Amazon in this gun.  My hopes were that it would spray a fine mist on my body, so I would not have to rub it in.  I think the Ocean solution is too thick for this spray gun because it sputtered out everywhere, and I had to rub it in (always wearing gloves of course!).  So I am not happy with the gun for the reason I purchased it.</li>
            <li> this gun is amazing!! the solution that comes with it sucks--it smells terrible and is very light(this might be better though for your first time application) the gun is awesome because you can use any other solution with it. i am SO happy i bought this...i can always have an awesome tan and i don&#x27;t have to pay for it every other week! highly recommended</li>
            <li> Easy to use. I prefer to keep it plugged in. It seems to spray a bit harder. I bought the Ocean Tanning Solution on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Must say this item is pretty great. The gun works really really well and seems pretty durable. It&#x27;s soooooo convenient. Things to keep in mind:  -Read all of the directions carefully!!! (Not the most in-depth but there&#x27;s a lot of important information.)  -Exfoliate and shave hair (from legs, etc.) for a more even tan. (Important! Dry skin effects finished look!)  -So be careful around hands, feet, elbows...   -All tanning solutions will have an odor. So open a window or turn on a fan if you cant tan outside. When being sprayed the smell is awful but once it sets in the odor is pretty light in comparison to other spray tans I&#x27;ve had done.  -Moisturize in the days AFTER use so that your spray tan doesn&#x27;t begin to &#x27;crack&#x27; or fade unevenly.   -The solution may not be the best idea for your face if you have allergies to other beauty products. This spray actually made my face itch and get a little red... as most products do if they are not hypoallergenic. So you may want to use a lotion that is specifically for delicate skin on your face if this is an issue with you. (No long term redness, my face was clear the next day.)    Negatives? Not a lot of solution in the kit and the solution will not give you a full dark tan. The only real disappointment was that the solution that comes with the kit is definitely for a &#x27;beginner&#x27; who doesn&#x27;t already have a base tan. I read a lot of reviews which stated this fact and its very true. I ordered a darker tanning solution that is compatible with the spray gun to make up for this. I&#x27;ll still be saving a TON of money doing this at home... and it&#x27;s so easy to do that I didn&#x27;t mind having to get the darker solution.</li>
            <li> I ordered a spray gun and it will not spray unless plugged in and turned upside down. I was so excited to recieve it in the mail and have have nothing but a pain.</li>
            <li> I was happy to get a good product for a good price, but I was proved wrong again, it&#x27;s just another example that what you pay it&#x27;s what you get...I paid cheap I got cheap... don&#x27;t buy it! Save your money until you have enough to buy a good thing for a fair price... mean while, I&#x27;l save your time not telling you about my awful experience with that thing...</li>
            <li> i have airbrush makeuP, a couple at home tan machines and a couple of these glow fusion guns! Love love love them. I have done my entire body or I just retouch with this gun most the time. If I tan myself with my spray tan machine one day, the next few days I can touch up with this gun. It&#x27;s amazing. I love it. This brand is stronger than the gun that looks just like this but is white instead. The glowFusion gun is amazing. Tans your face in seconds and you can add whatever solution you want. Glow fusion brand tanning solution smells bad. But I use Norvell brand inside this gun and it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> If you know how to airbrush properly this is a VERY affordable gun! Make sure to charge fully before using. The solution it came with was awful, buy something else. I used it for about a year on and off- just on myself, my sister and best friends. Worked great until the it one day just died and wouldn&#x27;t charge or spray at all....but for the price shrug what can you expect. I would even buy it again for $30!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really sorry I wasted money on this. It basically never worked properly right from the start. I was really excited about this but what a disappointment it turned out to be.</li>
            <li> The gun is...OKAY. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it for anyone with pale skin because you&#x27;d see the flaws more on someone with lighter skin. The gun doesn&#x27;t do a good job at atomizing the liquid into small particles to spray. Some of the flecks of liquid being sprayed at you are chunkier than others. Its almost like getting a very weak mist with some rain drops thrown in there. The GlowFusion Solution is very yellow and very, very light. It doesn&#x27;t really give a lot of color just makes you look glowy. And for how strong the scent is it really provided a weak color. I ended up using the solution half and half with the Ocean DHA Medium Solution because I found that to be way too dark and way too red. You could make this kit work if you&#x27;ve already purchased it but I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it had I known it performed the way it did. Also, the battery dies pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Have used for two years or so and love the tan. Have separate solution I bought, ocean brand I think. On my second gun but each was 30, and so was solution. Much cheaper than salon tans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If directions are followed tan looks great and lasts, especially if maintained using a tinted moisturizer. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought this spray tanner in January 2015 and wanted to wait a little while before reviewing it. I was nervous about it being a waste of money, since a lot of the other reviews were negative, but I love this machine! You have to learn to use - don&#x27;t spray too close, use even strokes, clean with hot water after every use. It&#x27;s still working great (now it&#x27;s May 2015) and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product! I did end up buying the Ocean Tanning Solution for a deeper color. I&#x27;m very pale, but the solution that came with this product didn&#x27;t do much. Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with the spray tanner and would buy another if mine breaks! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I got this in spite of all the negative reviews so i have no one to blame but myself. I actually changed my mind about it though but too late before it shipped out. Apparently, they don&#x27;t do returns on this. Gee I wonder why?? I liked the charging it up idea and being portable so i just had to have it. I really thought it would be something like an aerosol can of spray tanner. It comes out in an aerosol but just way to small to know where it&#x27;s going. It would take all day to do your body. I just ended up being streaky. Plus, it dripped little droplets all over me. Figured at worst it could do my face. Wrong again. Ended up just using a spray bottle which worked 10 X better btw. Threw it in the trash today where it belongs. Btw. anyone who gives this crap 5 stars is affiliated with the company in some way. No other way to explain it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the solution it came with but the gun broke within a few uses and only sprays air. It spits when it sprayed as well. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> It didnt spray well! Then I never used it again. Maybe I didn&#x27;t use it right though! Maybe I needed a different spray product.</li>
            <li> This is definitely worth the money!  You can put any liquid tanning solution.  The only thing that I don&#x27;t like it that you have to charge it up before each use, so no last minute tanning.  I do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The product worked great, I was cleaning out the nozzle after each use and had very good results, until I tried to use it for the third time. The battery would not hold a charge and the nozzle became clogged and sprayed huge blotches all over my skin. I stopped using it, cleaned it out, and put it back on the charger. Left if charging overnight and tried to use it the next night but the same things happened again. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> This product does NOT work! I am extremely disappointed- a complete waste of $40+! don&#x27;t spend your money!!!!!!!this work veryyy slow!!</li>
            <li> Leaked all over my hand!</li>
            <li> really liked this product and it did work for me for months although went to use it and the solution just ran out I was so disgusted although I am going to buy another. I spray tan all the time and just used this to do touch ups and also sprayed my face with it so not sure what happened but I feel its worth it to just buy another one. I hate the day that I had to throw it away.they said that you must clean it every time you use it well I hardly ever did that although it was when I did clean it really good that it stopped working</li>
            <li> Terrible quality. Not enough power to work at all.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the purshase while it last (about a month) only used it about 5 times.. Put it away for fall and when I tried to used it again it didn&#x27;t work! It blows air both ways instead of absorbing the liquid :/ definitely not worth the money.</li>
