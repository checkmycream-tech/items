            <li>Good quality and  </li>

            <li>The hair is very static and as you rub through it the hair frizzes all over almost like plastic barbie hair.</li>
            <li>The hair is nice and cap was good too</li>
            <li>The length of the wig was perfect and the bangs were just right.</li>
            <li>While this is the first wig I have ever ordered, I can honestly say that I am very impressed.</li>
            <li>so it felt like my own hair and was breatheable.  </li>
            <li>Obviously it is not human hair, but it is very attractive and lies very nice on the face.</li>
            <li>The price was amazing and the item was good for a quick fix if you need to look good for a night or two.  </li>
            <li>More like it was made for a doll rather than a person.</li>
            <li>The curls are more like waves and there aren&#x27;t any layers in it.</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>All and all I was pretry satisfied with my purchase.</li>

            <li>This wig was ok</li>
            <li>It good it look exactly likebthe picturee.</li>
            <li>It fit</li>
            <li>I love my new wig!!!</li>
            <li>but it very pretty and sheds allot through and tangles easy</li>
            <li>The wig wasn&#x27;t as curly and full as the picture.</li>
            <li>The item was the true expectation of the picture.</li>
            <li>it just need a quick wig to pop on.</li>
            <li>If the wig gets moist from sweat or rain it will ruin quickly.  </li>
            <li>This hair is not human, very cheap looking and would not buy again!</li>
            <li>but well worth the wait.m</li>
            <li>It doesnt do a decent job hiding the cao and the material is too shiny and cheap.</li>
            <li>Also you maMay have to cut the bang a little, but all and all shipping was free &amp; fast, and the wig looks good</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this wig, the only problem I had was it tangled so easy when the wind blew, other than that I love it</li>
            <li>This wig is so pretty, it&#x27;s a wavy/curl pattern</li>
            <li>You could make it work if you dulled out the shine and maybe stitch an extra layer or two of hair into the cap to give it more volume.</li>
            <li>it was way too much shine...</li>
            <li>did not look real...</li>
            <li>d wasn&#x27;t much assistance in stopping it from sliding off.  </li>
            <li>very well put together.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>Not only did the wig arrive very timely (2 weeks for standard international), but it were a very nice quality.</li>
            <li>Very well done, very natural.</li>
            <li>Like the other two wigs, this one is fantastic too.</li>
            <li>My hair and this wig are actually about the same length and styled very similarly, so it is really fun to see what my hair would look like in a different color.</li>
            <li>Other than this, I don&#x27;t know what else to say, just that I would very much recommend this wig and this supplier.</li>
            <li>The bangs may be a bit long for some people, but they were basically the same length as my real bangs.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s long and very soft.</li>

            <li> Very black, Very Shiny.</li>
            <li> The other thing I like about the wig is that it was made on a net</li>
            <li> My bad I just bought it because it was cheap and had to see for myself</li>
            <li> This is all wrong cap is too small hair gets tangled and matted fast.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of my money....</li>
            <li> but the cap was small there</li>
            <li> I mean what do you expect for 10.00, a few wears is all you are going to get from it ...</li>
            <li> But the no combs will make it hard to keep on without an hat or band.</li>
            <li> Poor quality hair.</li>
            <li> Not worth buying!!!!!</li>
            <li> The bangs look really fake, I wish I could get a refund</li>
            <li> I was expecting the wig to look like the photo, sadly it looked way too fake.</li>
            <li> False advertising!</li>
            <li> In fact, it was very thin and the curls were tangled.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s very thin, it is lacking color and hair to cover up the wig cap.</li>

            <li> The wig wasn&#x27;t as curly and full as the picture. In fact, it was very thin and the curls were tangled. Since it&#x27;s very thin, it is lacking color and hair to cover up the wig cap. It doesnt do a decent job hiding the cao and the material is too shiny and cheap.</li>
            <li> The bangs look really fake, I wish I could get a refund but I don&#x27;t have the money to ship it back..</li>
            <li> Looks very lovely except I never received mine.</li>
            <li> This wig is so pretty, it&#x27;s a wavy/curl pattern it&#x27;s long and very soft. I would definitely purchase this hair again.</li>
            <li> This hair is not human, very cheap looking and would not buy again! I have not wore it and will not, it&#x27;s in the garbage where is belongs lol My bad I just bought it because it was cheap and had to see for myself, it&#x27;s nothing like the picture at all... Trust me if you wear human hair you know the difference. The hair is very static and as you rub through it the hair frizzes all over almost like plastic barbie hair. Not worth buying!!!!!</li>
            <li> Not human. Disapointed.</li>
            <li> The wig is definitely human hair. But the no combs will make it hard to keep on without an hat or band. Also you maMay have to cut the bang a little, but all and all shipping was free &amp; fast, and the wig looks good no tangles</li>
            <li> It was a waste of my money.... it was way too much shine... did not look real... so I will be buying more expensive from a different site because the images here are a fraud...</li>
            <li> I was expecting the wig to look like the photo, sadly it looked way too fake. More like it was made for a doll rather than a person. The bangs were cut too short and did not have the rounded, bumped edges like the model does in this photo. The curls are more like waves and there aren&#x27;t any layers in it. You could make it work if you dulled out the shine and maybe stitch an extra layer or two of hair into the cap to give it more volume. It also looks good with a beanie or a baseball cap.</li>
            <li> I love my new wig!!! Took a while..but well worth the wait.m</li>
            <li> While this is the first wig I have ever ordered, I can honestly say that I am very impressed. Not only did the wig arrive very timely (2 weeks for standard international), but it were a very nice quality. Obviously it is not human hair, but it is very attractive and lies very nice on the face. My hair and this wig are actually about the same length and styled very similarly, so it is really fun to see what my hair would look like in a different color. On another note, this wig came out of the bag wearable. The bangs may be a bit long for some people, but they were basically the same length as my real bangs. Other than this, I don&#x27;t know what else to say, just that I would very much recommend this wig and this supplier.</li>
            <li> It good it look exactly likebthe picturee.</li>
            <li> The hair is nice and cap was good too but it was too shiny and even after washing it was still to shiny but it very pretty and sheds allot through and tangles easy but ita great for if your doing cosplay it just need a quick wig to pop on.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this wig, the only problem I had was it tangled so easy when the wind blew, other than that I love it</li>
            <li> I wanted to give this zero stars. This is all wrong cap is too small hair gets tangled and matted fast. Save your money</li>
            <li> Same as pictured. Love</li>
            <li> I thought it was human hair but it is not.  It fit okay but the cap was small thered wasn&#x27;t much assistance in stopping it from sliding off.  The price was amazing and the item was good for a quick fix if you need to look good for a night or two.  If the wig gets moist from sweat or rain it will ruin quickly.  The style of the wing was very nice.  The length of the wig was perfect and the bangs were just right. It does need a comb in the front though.  The other thing I like about the wig is that it was made on a net so it felt like my own hair and was breatheable.  All and all I was pretry satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> False advertising! Please Dont do it! I gave it to my daughter to play with. Poor quality hair. Totally!</li>
            <li> The item was the true expectation of the picture. Good quality and  very well put together.&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied with product.</li>
            <li> Very black, Very Shiny. It is a nice wig!</li>
            <li> Like the other two wigs, this one is fantastic too. Very well done, very natural. I like it a lot! Congrats Cool2day!</li>
            <li> This wig was ok I mean what do you expect for 10.00, a few wears is all you are going to get from it ...but this not a lacefront wig as stated trust me</li>
