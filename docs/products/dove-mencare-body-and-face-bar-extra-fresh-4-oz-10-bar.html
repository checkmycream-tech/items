            <li>and I would have in a brick and mortar store, but it was sure convenient just to throw this in with another order.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nothing notable.</li>
            <li>IT is cheap and effective.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brand of soap for the past 2 years - i think its a great soap for men - smells great and works fine.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use when I took a bath.</li>
            <li>Smells good wish their ingredients were more natural</li>
            <li>Dove extra fresh men&#x27;s bar soap is the best smelling soap I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s favorite soap, delivered right to my door!</li>
            <li>My favorite soap, price not bad.</li>
            <li>This soap is fine</li>
            <li>Also, it works fine for washing hair as well...</li>
            <li>So because my super picky husband loves it of course it is 5 stars!</li>
            <li>It seems to lather really well and has a nice scent.</li>
            <li>Manly smell but not too powerful or overwhelming.</li>
            <li>What a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>Sort of goes on smooth  </li>
            <li>Keeps my skin smooth and me from being stinky.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have twenty words to say, it is soap, it cleans and smells nice.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really have twenty words to say, it is soap, it cleans and smells nice.</li>
            <li>Light fragrance.</li>
            <li>Being just good enough is okay too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lather is good, its a *refreshing* soap,but IF youre not into Irish Spring (scent) types of soaps I dont see you liking this!</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>and I love the fresh clean scent.  </li>
            <li>I love the fresh smell, and it leaves me feeling clean.</li>
            <li>Seems to be a nice bar of soap, decent lather, etc.</li>
            <li>the feeling you after using this is pretty refreshing,</li>
            <li>Cannot beat the clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel clean.</li>
            <li>I feel like a clean virgin after using Dove Soap to cleanse my body with.</li>
            <li>I Have Used several Dove Products and so far the best soap ou</li>
            <li>This one seems to be the best so far besides Irish with Aloe.</li>
            <li>Has a fresh scent that&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li>My husband has very sensitive skin, so we are cautious what kind of soap he uses for his body.  </li>
            <li>The soap is great, smells good and seems to last a little longer than most soaps.</li>
            <li>If we talk about the products of the company Dove, the first thing I want to mention their great quality and unerring knowledge of what is needed to potential buyers.</li>
            <li>The Dove Extra Fresh, is non-irritating, gets out stubborn grease, paint, and dirt, and has a pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>but I find soap doesn&#x27;t really affect my skin nearly as much as using cooler water and a good lotion (I use VaniCream which I think is stellar)...</li>
            <li>Clean and fresh scent.</li>
            <li>Leaves me feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Always feel fresh and clean afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Always feel fresh and clean afterwards</li>
            <li>Love the fresh sent smell gives your face body,  thankfully for economic price.&lt;br /&gt;From  </li>
            <li>The scent in this is mild, and the soap itself is mild, and so it does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>Husband who is super picky loves this soap.</li>
            <li>This is a great way to get a product I like and for less than it costs in the store.</li>
            <li>Good soap for dry skin.</li>
            <li>I love this product as it is great smelling and long lasting.</li>
            <li>I believe they have 4 or 5 different kinds, so we are testing each kind.  </li>
            <li>So far, he likes the green the best.  </li>
            <li>Favorite bar of soap by far...</li>
            <li>but this is worth it.</li>
            <li>but I prefer not to smell like a floral arrangement fresh out of the shower and every time I use those damned hotel soaps my girlfriend points in my direction and says &amp;#34;you smell like me!&amp;#34; which I would prefer to avoid).</li>
            <li>I would say it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>like fresh smell after use</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price I paid</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice enough that it doesn&#x27;t dry out his skin and strong enough to make him smell great.</li>
            <li>I prefer the &#x27;deep clean&#x27; soap - I just think it works and feels better.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to any man who wants to eventually be clean.</li>
            <li>I order different color soap bars for my family (PINK) for the wife  (blue) for my son  (Green/tan) for me.&lt;br /&gt;all of them excellent products, I love all of them.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much hair to begin with, and I do not have any special hair care needs, so something that removes oil</li>
            <li>I use this soap exclusively as it works, it is gentle on the skin and has a very mild very pleasing scent.  </li>
            <li>The bar and packaging are slightly more masculine, with the bar being shaped differently and spelling more &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Hardly extra fresh smelling, more like a bathroom disinfectane smell.</li>
            <li>price/usage ratio.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t really get an excess amount of uses with 1 bar, so for me old spice better in terms of that.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I needed to add a purchase to get the free Amazon shipping and the cost per bar is better than normal store price and quality is the same</li>
            <li>the scent is fine and subtle and it does a good job lathering</li>
            <li>It does not create any skin dryness and is very gentle on face too.</li>
            <li>and I will still have 3 more left, so</li>
            <li>All natural, chemical free soap.</li>
            <li>The Dove products for men seem to be top quality all the way and are the only bath products I use.  </li>
            <li>They are mild and do the job they were created to do.&lt;br /&gt;I am sold on Dove products for men and particularly this soap.</li>
            <li>I like to try various products and then settle down with the best of all them, although I still like to keep trying new things for comparison purposes.</li>
            <li>I really like the scent firstly then the fact that it has moisturizer in the soap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great, but I&#x27;ve dropped a star only due to</li>
            <li>He is very particular on which brand</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin smooth and not dry.  </li>
            <li>the only soaps which bother my skin are ones with stronger chemicals and strong scents.</li>
            <li>this soap does it all cleans (very well) without drying out your skin.</li>
            <li>The delivery is convenient but if you are patient you can find much cheaper at Target and Walmart with coupons</li>
            <li>Dove Men+Care Extra Face soap is the best I have used among men&#x27;s soap products last few years.</li>
            <li>so if you need something extra to get your free shipping</li>
            <li>Men will enjoy using it in their daily clwan up session...</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not too much moisturizer either, so</li>
            <li>I usually have a trail of a dozen or so beautiful women following the trail of my scent as I walk around the mall.  </li>
            <li>must mean it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>If you are at all familiar with other flavors of Dove soap, this is just more of the same.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this soap (in other scents too) like 10-15 times now, Love it.</li>
            <li>He is a mechanic and it&#x27;s the only thing besides gojo that leaves him feeling clean after work.</li>
            <li>Nice soap, but it does not last very long.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that it tends to use up quickly.  </li>
            <li>love taking a shower with this after some heavy lifting and intense cardio at the gym!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will have to look into buying it at my local super market</li>
            <li>This smells fresh and does not dry my husbands skin out.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I just think the price is to high</li>
            <li>This soap isn&#x27;t bad, the odor isn&#x27;t overpowering, it&#x27;s just not the best (in my opinion).</li>
            <li>Doesn’t leave my skin dry but feeling clean</li>
            <li>there is the Extra Fresh pack.</li>
            <li>these are good but not great.</li>
            <li>He had been using pink Dove or white Dove soap, but I ordered this for him because it seemed more &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>strong smell and don&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li>Finally a manly smelling soap that is baby gentle for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than at big box stores.</li>
            <li>he has sensitive skin and has never been irritated by these.</li>
            <li>It is too perfumy for me, too much like Irish Spring.  </li>
            <li>Masculine Fragrance&lt;br /&gt;Must</li>
            <li>Decent price, compared to the Bullseye store here locally.  </li>
            <li>My wife bought this recently and I have to say that it does seem to be better than the usual soap that I use.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin dry and very itchy.</li>
            <li>While I prefer the lava-esque Deep Clean version, it is not available for Subscribe and Save.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s been using unscented Dove for years because he has such sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>but my husband and I were not very fond of the smell of this particular one.</li>
            <li>No dry skin in the winter time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have never been a huge fan of bar soad due to the messy factor of them &amp;#34;melting&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>He uses it on his face and body and refuses to use any other soap so he highly suggests it.</li>
            <li>I generally do not buy products like this and just use whatever soap is there generally.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product and doesn&#x27;t go bad</li>

            <li> I love the smell, and it gets the firefighter grime off of him with no problem without drying out his skin.</li>

            <li> love the smell ...</li>
            <li> just hope it would run more longer.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Better than body wash.</li>
            <li> and I would have in a brick and mortar store, but it was sure convenient just to throw this in with another order.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nothing notable.</li>
            <li> IT is cheap and effective.</li>
            <li> I am not going to write an elaborate review of this soap.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite soap...</li>

            <li> Nice and fresh scent, but not to girly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand of soap for the past 2 years - i think its a great soap for men - smells great and works fine.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use when I took a bath.</li>
            <li> Smells good wish their ingredients were more natural</li>
            <li> Dove extra fresh men&#x27;s bar soap is the best smelling soap I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite soap, delivered right to my door!</li>
            <li> My favorite soap, price not bad.</li>
            <li> This soap is fine</li>
            <li> Also, it works fine for washing hair as well...</li>
            <li> So because my super picky husband loves it of course it is 5 stars!</li>
            <li> It seems to lather really well and has a nice scent.</li>
            <li> Manly smell but not too powerful or overwhelming.</li>
            <li> What a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> Sort of goes on smooth  </li>
            <li> Keeps my skin smooth and me from being stinky.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have twenty words to say, it is soap, it cleans and smells nice.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really have twenty words to say, it is soap, it cleans and smells nice.</li>
            <li> Light fragrance.</li>
            <li> Being just good enough is okay too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lather is good, its a *refreshing* soap,but IF youre not into Irish Spring (scent) types of soaps I dont see you liking this!</li>
            <li> so far so good.</li>
            <li> and I love the fresh clean scent.  </li>
            <li> I love the fresh smell, and it leaves me feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a nice bar of soap, decent lather, etc.</li>
            <li> the feeling you after using this is pretty refreshing,</li>
            <li> Cannot beat the clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel clean.</li>
            <li> I feel like a clean virgin after using Dove Soap to cleanse my body with.</li>
            <li> I Have Used several Dove Products and so far the best soap ou</li>
            <li> This one seems to be the best so far besides Irish with Aloe.</li>
            <li> Has a fresh scent that&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li> My husband has very sensitive skin, so we are cautious what kind of soap he uses for his body.  </li>
            <li> The soap is great, smells good and seems to last a little longer than most soaps.</li>
            <li> If we talk about the products of the company Dove, the first thing I want to mention their great quality and unerring knowledge of what is needed to potential buyers.</li>
            <li> The Dove Extra Fresh, is non-irritating, gets out stubborn grease, paint, and dirt, and has a pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li> but I find soap doesn&#x27;t really affect my skin nearly as much as using cooler water and a good lotion (I use VaniCream which I think is stellar)...</li>
            <li> Clean and fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Leaves me feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Always feel fresh and clean afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Always feel fresh and clean afterwards</li>
            <li> Love the fresh sent smell gives your face body,  thankfully for economic price.&lt;br /&gt;From  </li>
            <li> The scent in this is mild, and the soap itself is mild, and so it does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Husband who is super picky loves this soap.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to get a product I like and for less than it costs in the store.</li>
            <li> Good soap for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product as it is great smelling and long lasting.</li>
            <li> I believe they have 4 or 5 different kinds, so we are testing each kind.  </li>
            <li> So far, he likes the green the best.  </li>
            <li> Favorite bar of soap by far...</li>
            <li> but this is worth it.</li>
            <li> but I prefer not to smell like a floral arrangement fresh out of the shower and every time I use those damned hotel soaps my girlfriend points in my direction and says &amp;#34;you smell like me!&amp;#34; which I would prefer to avoid).</li>
            <li> I would say it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> like fresh smell after use</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price I paid</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice enough that it doesn&#x27;t dry out his skin and strong enough to make him smell great.</li>
            <li> I prefer the &#x27;deep clean&#x27; soap - I just think it works and feels better.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to any man who wants to eventually be clean.</li>
            <li> I order different color soap bars for my family (PINK) for the wife  (blue) for my son  (Green/tan) for me.&lt;br /&gt;all of them excellent products, I love all of them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much hair to begin with, and I do not have any special hair care needs, so something that removes oil</li>
            <li> I use this soap exclusively as it works, it is gentle on the skin and has a very mild very pleasing scent.  </li>
            <li> The bar and packaging are slightly more masculine, with the bar being shaped differently and spelling more &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Hardly extra fresh smelling, more like a bathroom disinfectane smell.</li>
            <li> price/usage ratio.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t really get an excess amount of uses with 1 bar, so for me old spice better in terms of that.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I needed to add a purchase to get the free Amazon shipping and the cost per bar is better than normal store price and quality is the same</li>
            <li> the scent is fine and subtle and it does a good job lathering</li>
            <li> It does not create any skin dryness and is very gentle on face too.</li>
            <li> and I will still have 3 more left, so</li>
            <li> All natural, chemical free soap.</li>
            <li> The Dove products for men seem to be top quality all the way and are the only bath products I use.  </li>
            <li> They are mild and do the job they were created to do.&lt;br /&gt;I am sold on Dove products for men and particularly this soap.</li>
            <li> I like to try various products and then settle down with the best of all them, although I still like to keep trying new things for comparison purposes.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent firstly then the fact that it has moisturizer in the soap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, but I&#x27;ve dropped a star only due to</li>
            <li> He is very particular on which brand</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin smooth and not dry.  </li>
            <li> the only soaps which bother my skin are ones with stronger chemicals and strong scents.</li>
            <li> this soap does it all cleans (very well) without drying out your skin.</li>
            <li> The delivery is convenient but if you are patient you can find much cheaper at Target and Walmart with coupons</li>
            <li> Dove Men+Care Extra Face soap is the best I have used among men&#x27;s soap products last few years.</li>
            <li> so if you need something extra to get your free shipping</li>
            <li> Men will enjoy using it in their daily clwan up session...</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not too much moisturizer either, so</li>
            <li> I usually have a trail of a dozen or so beautiful women following the trail of my scent as I walk around the mall.  </li>
            <li> must mean it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> If you are at all familiar with other flavors of Dove soap, this is just more of the same.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this soap (in other scents too) like 10-15 times now, Love it.</li>
            <li> He is a mechanic and it&#x27;s the only thing besides gojo that leaves him feeling clean after work.</li>
            <li> Nice soap, but it does not last very long.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that it tends to use up quickly.  </li>
            <li> love taking a shower with this after some heavy lifting and intense cardio at the gym!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will have to look into buying it at my local super market</li>
            <li> This smells fresh and does not dry my husbands skin out.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I just think the price is to high</li>
            <li> This soap isn&#x27;t bad, the odor isn&#x27;t overpowering, it&#x27;s just not the best (in my opinion).</li>
            <li> Doesn’t leave my skin dry but feeling clean</li>
            <li> there is the Extra Fresh pack.</li>
            <li> these are good but not great.</li>
            <li> He had been using pink Dove or white Dove soap, but I ordered this for him because it seemed more &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> strong smell and don&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> Finally a manly smelling soap that is baby gentle for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than at big box stores.</li>
            <li> he has sensitive skin and has never been irritated by these.</li>
            <li> It is too perfumy for me, too much like Irish Spring.  </li>
            <li> Masculine Fragrance&lt;br /&gt;Must</li>
            <li> Decent price, compared to the Bullseye store here locally.  </li>
            <li> My wife bought this recently and I have to say that it does seem to be better than the usual soap that I use.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin dry and very itchy.</li>
            <li> While I prefer the lava-esque Deep Clean version, it is not available for Subscribe and Save.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been using unscented Dove for years because he has such sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> but my husband and I were not very fond of the smell of this particular one.</li>
            <li> No dry skin in the winter time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have never been a huge fan of bar soad due to the messy factor of them &amp;#34;melting&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> He uses it on his face and body and refuses to use any other soap so he highly suggests it.</li>
            <li> I generally do not buy products like this and just use whatever soap is there generally.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product and doesn&#x27;t go bad</li>
            <li> Smells good, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin too bad, relatively affordable.</li>
            <li> feel like one bar of this soap will last as long as one tube of the body wash</li>
            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> The bad:DOES NOT LAST LONG</li>
            <li> Bar doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like irish spring, etc.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell which gives a weird, cheap scent.</li>
            <li> I switched back to this bar after years of using the other.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products in this line but the deodorant is the only thing that comes close.</li>
            <li> It removes oil and odor, it doesn&#x27;t dry out skin, and while the scent is pleasing, it doesn&#x27;t smell all girly</li>
            <li> Also seems to help with my dry skin during the winter.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> It makes my skin less dry.</li>
            <li> I started getting skin irritations from using other bar soaps (body wash is for sissies)</li>
            <li> continue to order these and may try some other odors</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these over any other soap brands but I also won&#x27;t decry it</li>
            <li> I usually use the yellow Dial bars, but was looking for a softer alternative and this fits for me.</li>
            <li> My son has to wash his hands a lot due to his job.  </li>
            <li> next thing i hear him laughing hard</li>
            <li> No more dry skin with this bar soap.</li>
            <li> I hate that tight skin feeling that most soaps give you.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to give this a try to replace liquid body wash which I typically use.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday to wash my face.</li>
            <li> Believe me, this is something that we need in everyday life.</li>
            <li> Melts away in just a few days of use.</li>
            <li> My husband, who is in his 50&#x27;s, was using just plain ole soap - I think Zest - on his face.  </li>
            <li> No more keeping two bars in the shower</li>
            <li> I have never liked soap that leave a greasy feeling on the skin.  </li>
            <li> Not a good value in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I was using the body wash in this scent and just got tired of paying the premium for liquid soap.</li>
            <li> I guess he got tired of my flowers and lavender and &#x27;girl&#x27; soaps.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> I can never go wrong with using this.</li>
            <li> He can&#x27;t use anything else now because he says it leaves a weird film on his skin that this just doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed in that.  </li>
            <li> Made my body and shower smell terrible.</li>
            <li> With doubt one of the worst soaps I have ever used.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Smells great!  Cannot beat the clean feeling.  Decent price, compared to the Bullseye store here locally.  Nice clean scent.</li>
            <li> Dove products are a staple in our household! Although this is a &#x27;mens&#x27; soap, the fragrance and feel of it is great!</li>
            <li> No more dry skin with this bar soap. I have been using only this for several years and I won&#x27;t change.</li>
            <li> I have never liked soap that leave a greasy feeling on the skin.  If you are like me, you won&#x27;t like it either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you like that feeling, go for it.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend complains that she doesn&#x27;t like it because it smells like &amp;#34;man soap.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That must mean it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> This soap is fine but my husband and I were not very fond of the smell of this particular one. He likes the Dove soap but not this specific scent.</li>

            <li> Excellent body and face bar; lightly scented, not overpowering, gentle on the face, fair price, higly recommend.</li>

            <li> My husband loves the soap.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent firstly then the fact that it has moisturizer in the soap. No more keeping two bars in the shower this soap does it all cleans (very well) without drying out your skin. Thank you Dove for making a line of products for men.</li>
            <li> Not impressed. Bar doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long. Value compared to liquid body wash is equivalent.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I will be buying more in the future.&lt;br /&gt;This product is part of my subscribe and save order.</li>
            <li> Hubby loves this soap.</li>
            <li> I generally do not buy products like this and just use whatever soap is there generally. My wife bought this recently and I have to say that it does seem to be better than the usual soap that I use. It somehow makes me feel more refreshed if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> Smell like a flower and great product!  I loved it.</li>
            <li> Husband loves the scent and of this soap. Much cheaper than at big box stores.</li>
            <li> I started getting skin irritations from using other bar soaps (body wash is for sissies) so I switched to this.  While I prefer the lava-esque Deep Clean version, it is not available for Subscribe and Save.  The Dove Extra Fresh, is non-irritating, gets out stubborn grease, paint, and dirt, and has a pleasant scent.  I would recommend this to any man who wants to eventually be clean.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this soap</li>
            <li> My husband, who is in his 50&#x27;s, was using just plain ole soap - I think Zest - on his face.  He shaves his head so whatever he uses for his body, he just uses for his face too.  Men... :)  I gave his this soap to try just for his face and he loves it!  I believe they have 4 or 5 different kinds, so we are testing each kind.  So far, he likes the green the best.  I also got him the Dove Mens moisturizer which he also likes.  It took me a while to get him to try it, but he uses it every night now.</li>
            <li> Subscribed to this so I didn&#x27;t have to buy at the grocery store and so we wouldn&#x27;t run out.  Smells awesome.  Cant beat the savings with Amazon SUbscribe and save either.  Anything dove is always a winner!</li>
            <li> Use this every morning when I shower. Love the fragrance. Leaves me feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> This is no bargain and I can get a 6-pack of this for the same price at a local department/grocery store.</li>
            <li> My son and husband like this.</li>
            <li> Hubby loves this stuff. Favorite bar of soap by far...he has sensitive skin and has never been irritated by these. Smells good too!</li>
            <li> Great soap for mens. I loved the smell.</li>
            <li> My husband likes this.  He&#x27;s been using unscented Dove for years because he has such sensitive skin.  He&#x27;s had no reaction to this product and it smells very nice and fresh</li>
            <li> Finally a manly smelling soap that is baby gentle for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> This works fine and smells good. Very good price with &#x27;subscribe and save&#x27; I recommend, will buy more, and I hope this helps.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to get a product I like and for less than it costs in the store.</li>
            <li> I love this product as it is great smelling and long lasting. The delivery is convenient but if you are patient you can find much cheaper at Target and Walmart with coupons</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand of soap for the past 2 years - i think its a great soap for men - smells great and works fine. I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Love the product, I just prefer the body wash.....  I wish they would of had a larger quantity of the product....</li>
            <li> I was using the body wash in this scent and just got tired of paying the premium for liquid soap. I switched back to this bar after years of using the other. It seems to lather really well and has a nice scent. I can tell it does have a moisturizer in it  ( you can feel it when you rinse off) and it seems to do a good job. No dry skin in the winter time.&lt;br /&gt;I feel like one bar of this soap will last as long as one tube of the body wash and I will still have 3 more left, so for the price this is a steal. I have never been a huge fan of bar soad due to the messy factor of them &amp;#34;melting&amp;#34; twords the end of their life span but this is worth it.</li>
            <li> This is good because it is Dove.  It is too perfumy for me, too much like Irish Spring.  I prefer a manly scent, or no scent at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smell good, but it melt so quick</li>
            <li> If you are at all familiar with other flavors of Dove soap, this is just more of the same. The bar and packaging are slightly more masculine, with the bar being shaped differently and spelling more &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;. The reason for taking off a star was that it smelled almost like cleaning supplies of some sort. Not too impressed, but I can live with it.</li>
            <li> Dove really makes the best products.  This has a nice scent and does not irritate the skin.</li>
            <li> bought it as a gift!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product and others made by Dove for men.</li>
            <li> Made my body and shower smell terrible.</li>
            <li> My husband loves these man bars of soap.  Manly smell but not too powerful or overwhelming. I guess he got tired of my flowers and lavender and &#x27;girl&#x27; soaps.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It makes your skin very smooth with no soap residue.</li>
            <li> Best soap on the market.</li>
            <li> I prefer the &#x27;deep clean&#x27; soap - I just think it works and feels better. This soap isn&#x27;t bad, the odor isn&#x27;t overpowering, it&#x27;s just not the best (in my opinion).</li>
            <li> I like this soap.  It has a good smell and great lather.  The only drawback is that it tends to use up quickly.  Almost seems like it is a softer compound.  Nice soap, but it does not last very long.</li>
            <li> Ordered these for my son&lt;br /&gt;Nice pleasant odor. Order these on subscribe and save&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to order these and may try some other odors</li>
            <li> This is the only soap my husband will use. I love the smell, and it gets the firefighter grime off of him with no problem without drying out his skin.</li>
            <li> One of the most off smelling soaps I have ever tried. Hardly extra fresh smelling, more like a bathroom disinfectane smell. Now I undre</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel clean. I feel like a clean virgin after using Dove Soap to cleanse my body with. What a fantastic product. The smell is so good. I feel my skin being moisturized more effectively than dedicated moisturizers.</li>
            <li> moisturizes, but is a bit too fragrant.</li>
            <li> My fiance loves this soap. Great smell!</li>
            <li> Smells good and makes you clean.  Basically all you can ask for in a bar of soap.  I also use this for shaving, and it produces a good lather.</li>
            <li> Using a bar is so much more efficient than using body wash in my opinion. This one smells good.</li>
            <li> This soap is fantastic, smells great works great, rinses clean fast and is just awesome at lasting longer than most!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for the great price, but when my husband remarked on it, I knew it was a great product. Really nice scent. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> love this soap ... love the smell ... just hope it would run more longer.&lt;br /&gt;best soap for men o</li>
            <li> 3 men in this house and this is our soap. No complaints from anyone. Long-lasting for a bar of its size.</li>
            <li> strong smell and don&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> I like this Dove Men Bar.  It makes my skin less dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, but I&#x27;ve dropped a star only due to price/usage ratio.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t really get an excess amount of uses with 1 bar, so for me old spice better in terms of that.&lt;br /&gt;But the feeling you after using this is pretty refreshing, love taking a shower with this after some heavy lifting and intense cardio at the gym!&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy this again? It&#x27;s a maybe, if there&#x27;s a sale on these, sure.</li>
            <li> Great quality, and smells good</li>
            <li> Seems to be a nice bar of soap, decent lather, etc. Sort of goes on smooth  shall i say</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good bar of soap I use it everyday to wash my face. I just think the price is to high I will have to look into buying it at my local super market</li>
            <li> I like this soap in the sense that I think it is a good fit for men. It removes oil and odor, it doesn&#x27;t dry out skin, and while the scent is pleasing, it doesn&#x27;t smell all girly (I know...kinda third grade but I prefer not to smell like a floral arrangement fresh out of the shower and every time I use those damned hotel soaps my girlfriend points in my direction and says &amp;#34;you smell like me!&amp;#34; which I would prefer to avoid). It&#x27;s also not overpriced...I cannot buy into the $6/bar of the body soap given you wash it off 10 seconds after you put it on. I have very dry skin but I find soap doesn&#x27;t really affect my skin nearly as much as using cooler water and a good lotion (I use VaniCream which I think is stellar)...the only soaps which bother my skin are ones with stronger chemicals and strong scents. The scent in this is mild, and the soap itself is mild, and so it does not irritate my skin. Also, it works fine for washing hair as well...I don&#x27;t have much hair to begin with, and I do not have any special hair care needs, so something that removes oil is all I require and this works for that too...your mileage may vary.</li>
            <li> Caught this on a lightning deal which made it too good to pass up. Keeps my skin smooth and me from being stinky.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have twenty words to say, it is soap, it cleans and smells nice. Better than body wash.</li>
            <li> Not inpressed. I don&#x27;t like the smell which gives a weird, cheap scent.</li>
            <li> These smell so good I usually have a trail of a dozen or so beautiful women following the trail of my scent as I walk around the mall.  Recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:P</li>
            <li> Paid just about the same price on Amazon and I would have in a brick and mortar store, but it was sure convenient just to throw this in with another order.  The soap is great, smells good and seems to last a little longer than most soaps. Also seems to help with my dry skin during the winter. I would say it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> All natural, chemical free soap. It smells good also!</li>
            <li> Like all of Dove&#x27;s Men+ line these are good but not great. the scent is fine and subtle and it does a good job lathering but it&#x27;s nothing notable. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these over any other soap brands but I also won&#x27;t decry it so there&#x27;s that. Being just good enough is okay too.</li>
            <li> With doubt one of the worst soaps I have ever used. Using the name Dove is an insult to the brand. Leaves my skin dry and very itchy. Never buy again</li>
            <li> IT is cheap and effective. It is easy to use when I took a bath.</li>
            <li> like fresh smell after use</li>
            <li> This men&#x27;s soap is one of 3 Dove soaps made for Men that I know about.  I use this soap exclusively as it works, it is gentle on the skin and has a very mild very pleasing scent.  The Dove products for men seem to be top quality all the way and are the only bath products I use.  They don&#x27;t cause problems, rashes or anything like that.  They are mild and do the job they were created to do.&lt;br /&gt;I am sold on Dove products for men and particularly this soap.</li>
            <li> Smells good, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin too bad, relatively affordable. I have purchased this soap (in other scents too) like 10-15 times now, Love it.</li>
            <li> I am not going to write an elaborate review of this soap. What I will say is being its constructed of moisturizer it goes quick!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its basically a cousin of Irish spring in the scent department. The moisturizer sets it apart,but because of that the bar will dissolve quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lather is good, its a *refreshing* soap,but IF youre not into Irish Spring (scent) types of soaps I dont see you liking this! Hey but you never know?</li>
            <li> My man loves this and I love the fresh clean scent.  We will buy this over and over again.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite soap...I love the fresh smell, and it leaves me feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Dove Men+Care Extra Face soap is the best I have used among men&#x27;s soap products last few years. I like to try various products and then settle down with the best of all them, although I still like to keep trying new things for comparison purposes. I think what helps Dove Men+Care make an awesome soap is that it claims to contain 1/4th moisturizing cream. It does not create any skin dryness and is very gentle on face too. I will keep buying Dove+Men as I think Unilever makes extremely good men&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> I wanted to give this a try to replace liquid body wash which I typically use.  The soap lathers easily and smells good.  I don&#x27;t know what else you would want to know about it.</li>
            <li> Nice and fresh scent, but not to girly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally I subscribed to get that 15% discount, monthly.</li>
            <li> Love the scent. Smells great!</li>
            <li> Husband who is super picky loves this soap. So because my super picky husband loves it of course it is 5 stars!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really have twenty words to say, it is soap, it cleans and smells nice. Better than body wash.</li>
            <li> I order different color soap bars for my family (PINK) for the wife  (blue) for my son  (Green/tan) for me.&lt;br /&gt;all of them excellent products, I love all of them.</li>
            <li> Great soap. Definitely worth the price I paid</li>
            <li> Good Product - Rich in Foam, Masculine Fragrance&lt;br /&gt;Must have for Men</li>
            <li> My Favorite Soap.  Its always great smelling and works nicely.  Switched from using Anti-bacterial to using this.&lt;br /&gt;Since I stopped using the Anti-Bacterial,  breakouts that I was having stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a lot of research into the Overuse of Antibacterial Soaps and Hand washes,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoid Antibacterial Soap.  If you are buying this for a Husband or Boyfriend-  He will love this soap.</li>
            <li> This smells fresh and does not dry my husbands skin out. He uses it on his face and body and refuses to use any other soap so he highly suggests it.</li>
            <li> Love this soap. Great scent and perfect for my skin</li>
            <li> smells awesome gets you clean. buy it.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite soap, delivered right to my door! No having to search for it. He is very particular on which brand I get so this makes my life thatucj easier!</li>
            <li> My favorite bar soap.  Always feel fresh and clean afterwards.  I can never go wrong with using this.</li>
            <li> Got this for my sons - This is  good for your body and your face.  Dove always makes great products.</li>
            <li> Good clean smell. It does the job.</li>
            <li> so far so good. using S &amp; S keeps the price low. will buy it again until find a more perfect one.</li>
            <li> I Have Used several Dove Products and so far the best soap ou there is the Extra Fresh pack. It has an amazing smell. Simply pleasant.</li>
            <li> Smells good wish their ingredients were more natural</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have lasting order</li>
            <li> Good soap for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Great smelling soap! Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like irish spring, etc.</li>
            <li> Great soap works great on your skin</li>
            <li> Husband loves this stuff!  Smells very nice without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> Really great soap. I was using Irish Spring before and it was drying out my skin. This doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> My favorite soap, price not bad.</li>
            <li> Love this soap. Light fragrance. Long lasting.</li>
            <li> I love Dove Soap for Men.  It leaves my skin smooth and not dry.  I hate that tight skin feeling that most soaps give you.  Not this stuff!</li>
            <li> We like it...  Always feel fresh and clean afterwards and I love the smell of the soap.</li>
            <li> Fiance approved! My fiance loves this soap and uses it exclusively. It&#x27;s nice enough that it doesn&#x27;t dry out his skin and strong enough to make him smell great.</li>
            <li> It lathers up and does the job</li>
            <li> very good item and very good price</li>
            <li> I needed to add a purchase to get the free Amazon shipping and the cost per bar is better than normal store price and quality is the same so I ordered the soap as an &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s a good product and doesn&#x27;t go bad so if you need something extra to get your free shipping it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li> Husband absolutely love this. He is a mechanic and it&#x27;s the only thing besides gojo that leaves him feeling clean after work.</li>
            <li> This a great product. Very clean smelling.  Men will enjoy using it in their daily clwan up session...</li>
            <li> If we talk about the products of the company Dove, the first thing I want to mention their great quality and unerring knowledge of what is needed to potential buyers. Any products of this company has a global status. This award was well deserved, because manufacturers care about the taste and health of consumers. And of course, this soap designed for care of face and body, contains vitamins and pleasant aroma. Believe me, this is something that we need in everyday life.</li>
            <li> The good: smells good, easy on you skin. The bad:DOES NOT LAST LONG AT ALL. Melts away in just a few days of use. Not a good value in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Has a fresh scent that&#x27;s not too strong. There&#x27;s not too much moisturizer either, so my pores don&#x27;t clog. I usually use the yellow Dial bars, but was looking for a softer alternative and this fits for me.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my boyfriend since he only uses this one.I did not tell him that i&#x27;m buying them online  so when he saw a package at our door step when he came home from work and thought it must be something i have ordered and then i told him open up and next thing i hear him laughing hard (we were on the phone) that i ordered his favorite bar online. Lol. Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite soap! Smells great and seems to clean him up just fine.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite soap. He can&#x27;t use anything else now because he says it leaves a weird film on his skin that this just doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> My son has to wash his hands a lot due to his job.  He had been using pink Dove or white Dove soap, but I ordered this for him because it seemed more &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;.  This actually dries his skin out and makes his hands feel chapped.  Really disappointed in that.  The rest of us like it okay.  It just doesn&#x27;t work for the purpose I needed it to.</li>
            <li> My husband has very sensitive skin, so we are cautious what kind of soap he uses for his body.  This one seems to be the best so far besides Irish with Aloe.</li>
            <li> Dove extra fresh men&#x27;s bar soap is the best smelling soap I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve tried other products in this line but the deodorant is the only thing that comes close.</li>
    </ol>
