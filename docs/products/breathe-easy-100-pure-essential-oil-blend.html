            <li> Breathe Easy essential oil has a wonderful aromatic scent that helps both my allergies and asthma symptoms. I use it in my office and my bedroom to help alleviate breathing problems during times of stress or other respiratory concerns. I especially love the clean and therapeutic scent this essential oil adds to my rooms. I can also add more eucalyptus or tea tree oil without upsetting the effect of the base oil. Wonderful oil.</li>
            <li> Great smell, really helps to clear up nasal congestion</li>
            <li> Smells like Vicks vapor rub! I mix this with love and peppermint and it smells A*mazing</li>
            <li> Works great.  But remember, some people open these oils and dilute them.  So if you get one and it doesn&#x27;t work,  probably been diluted.</li>
            <li> I bought this Breath easy essential oil from Plantlife. I bought it to help me with my breathing since I have been fighting allergies. I really like this oil and wish I had bought more than one bottle.</li>
            <li> I use this on my horse when her allergies are bad it stops her cough and lets her breath better</li>
            <li> This blend is very helpful to me as a congestive heart failure patient. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Use it in a defuser for my grandson who goes to day care &amp; constantly has a stuffy nose.  The price is good.</li>
            <li> It was last year when I first discovered great buys for aromatherapy and skin care products at heavily discounted prices at TJ Maxx stores.  I never made purchases at that store before and I also was not familiar with the Plantlife brand.  But once I discovered this line of essential oils, I became addicted.  Every time I see a new blend, I want to try it.  When I teach yoga I love to use Energy Blend during morning classes so students can perk up.  For my evening classes, I use Relax blend.  I came across Breathe Easy blend and bought it right away.  First of all it is a winter season in Chicago, so it is nice to inhale strong, fresh scent that will clear out the breathing.  Also I use it in the office.  If I hear colleague sneezing or caughing, I apply a little bit of oil on the palms of my hands and inhale deeply.  It helps me &amp;#34;recalibrate&amp;#34; my mind and make it sharper and it also helps breathing because the cube space is suddenly not as stuffy as it was prior to inhaling the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fantastic brand and the oils are worth every penny.</li>
            <li> DING DONG DANG DO I LOVE THIS!  I have Vasomotor Rhinitus and this has been my best friend!  I strongly suggest it and am gonna rock it through the season!</li>
            <li> But the typo on the label makes me question the validity of the company. Because I was an English major. Change your label!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Don&#x27;t think I could live without it.  I wake up in the night stuffy, and just put a little of this on, and I fall right back to sleep with a clear unstuffy nose.</li>
            <li> This products is everything it purports to be.</li>
            <li> AMAZING!! I had a stuffy nose and put in my diffuser before bed! GREAT! Clear when I woke up!</li>
            <li> Okay, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. It didn&#x27;t make me breathe any easier, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
