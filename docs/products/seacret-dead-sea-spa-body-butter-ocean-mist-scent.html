            <li>Love the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I mostly use it on my hands and feet.</li>
            <li>BUTTER GREAT FOR MASSAGING INTO THE SKIN AND DAILY USE</li>
            <li>The cream goes on light and smooth.</li>
            <li>It has a good smell and keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for anyone with dry skin or a skin condition like psoriasis.  </li>
            <li>Very soft, stay on skin nice, I don&#x27;t any problem, I like it</li>
            <li>The lotion is a good buy comparing the store 4.2 oz bottle to the 3.4 squeeze bottle in the set.&lt;br /&gt;The spray is larger but a mist not a perfume/cologne.</li>
            <li>was a good buy, I chose this as my birthday present from my son &amp; husband.</li>
            <li>Now we have plenty savings left for a good dinner out as well...</li>
            <li>.Cream feels buttery with a mild fragrance.</li>
            <li>Super absorbant without the sticky or greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>, I use this on my 4 and 5 year old kids and they love it, it is great for when they get dried out skin</li>
            <li>Smells clean and fresh and makes my skin buttery soft.</li>
            <li>I have used this ever since I first found the product about 5 years ago.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and half the price of what it costs directly from Seacret.</li>
            <li>I love the scent, very light and natural and not overly heavy or oily; absorbs well into skin to remoisture what has been lost.</li>
            <li>This is the second go round with this product, we are so happy Amazon carries it.</li>
            <li>My husband brought this product in the mall and he really likes it.  </li>
            <li>have other fragrances and love variety.</li>
            <li>I have used this in the past and love it.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels soft after application.</li>
            <li>Product arrived in an unsealed jar with a lid that was old and scratched up.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t want to spend too much on any single choice.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product especially to those who have a dry skin.</li>
            <li>Expensive, but this is one that delivers (certainly for me) and is worth that extra $$</li>

            <li> this is the best of all of seacret........I can&#x27;t get enough of it.......it heals skin too by the way overnight.......for real.......the scent is incredible and I LOVE THIS BODY BUTTER GREAT FOR MASSAGING INTO THE SKIN AND DAILY USE IS EVERN BETTER FOR THE SKIN, I use this on my 4 and 5 year old kids and they love it, it is great for when they get dried out skin and my son has eczema , and this helps keep it under control for him. I LOVE THIS FOR MY BODY IT IS AWESOME please try it you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> this is a seacret - but a well hidden one. I have always had dry skin but greasy oily heavy moisturizers weren&#x27;t the solution not to mention my sensativities to heavy perfumes and chemicals. Not a problem here. I love the scent, very light and natural and not overly heavy or oily; absorbs well into skin to remoisture what has been lost. Expensive, but this is one that delivers (certainly for me) and is worth that extra $$</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer.  I have used this ever since I first found the product about 5 years ago.  It is my favorite,</li>
            <li> awesome item.  Paid big money for last batch of same items on vacation in Portugal. Wife loves this stuff and at a great price.</li>
            <li> My husband brought this product in the mall and he really likes it.  This is the second go round with this product, we are so happy Amazon carries it.</li>
            <li> .Cream feels buttery with a mild fragrance. My skin feels soft after application.</li>
            <li> They changed the formula and it is much more fragrant. Too perfumie for my husband and it bothers my sinuses.</li>
            <li> This is a superior product.  The cream goes on light and smooth. You get the best benefit if you combine the sea salt along with the cream.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in an unsealed jar with a lid that was old and scratched up.  It looked like the product was used and was rancid.  Not sure where Spain March gets their product but shame on them for selling this defective used stuff.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance.  This is one of the very few lotions that my body will tolerate.  I will continue to use it until the Powers That Be add something where my skin rejects.  Manufactures are always doing that to me.</li>
            <li> And I am just grumpy enough I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it except for price and ease of access by Amazon. Their sales people in the mall are horrible, they hound you, are pushy, and gives a new definition to the used car salespeople of old...........</li>
            <li> Great! Just like the Mall.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love this stuff. We use it daily and we no longer waste our money on any other skin care product. Seacret is the best in our opinion.</li>
            <li> Very soft, stay on skin nice, I don&#x27;t any problem, I like it and I recommend to my co worker.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for anyone with dry skin or a skin condition like psoriasis.  Smells great and half the price of what it costs directly from Seacret. I got 2 for the price of one. Certaily recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past and love it.  Softens skin without leaving a greasy coating.  Definitely recoommend it.</li>
            <li> My mother in law was going to pay big bucks at a mall kiosk for this stuff. Daughter in law and Amazon save her $$$$$$$$$</li>
            <li> Have had it before. good product  I have recommended it to friends, will probably order again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Best body butter ever! Super absorbant without the sticky or greasy feeling. Smells clean and fresh and makes my skin buttery soft. I mostly use it on my hands and feet. A little goes a long way too. I hope Seacret doesn&#x27;t discontinue this body butter. It&#x27;s really hard to find.</li>
            <li> https://www.seacretdirect.com/sashaeut/en&lt;br /&gt;Save even more !!!!! 50-60% off use link above!!!!!</li>
            <li> It has a good smell and keeps my skin soft.I highly recommend this product especially to those who have a dry skin.</li>
            <li> The lotion is a good buy comparing the store 4.2 oz bottle to the 3.4 squeeze bottle in the set.&lt;br /&gt;The spray is larger but a mist not a perfume/cologne. Still the fragrance had a satisfactory lasting aroma to me at least.&lt;br /&gt;I have other fragrances and love variety. Don&#x27;t want to spend too much on any single choice.&lt;br /&gt;This was a good buy, I chose this as my birthday present from my son &amp; husband. Now we have plenty savings left for a good dinner out as well...lol&lt;br /&gt;This is one of my favorite fragrances and it arrived promptly and in great condition.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this seller.  Good Luck !</li>
