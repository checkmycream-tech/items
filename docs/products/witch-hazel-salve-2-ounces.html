            <li>This product is wonderful if you just want to Relieve symptoms.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>It works great or itching.  </li>
            <li>It also works great for my hemmoroids .  </li>
            <li>Great product thank you</li>
            <li>It is safe and it is an excellent moisturizer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good for lube that about it</li>
            <li>I have nothing but the highest praise for Wise Ways witch hazel salve.</li>
            <li>I also invested in a good heel rasp, I soak my feet in bath salts and give myself a pedicure once a week, and boy</li>
            <li>and this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>I do like it better that the prescription oinments that also stain the panties.</li>
            <li>So glad I discovered this product.  </li>
            <li>It is the most helpful product I have found to control itching and discomfort.</li>
            <li>I love this product, and I feel safe using it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>It was what I ordered, just wish it had been sealed better, it leaked out a bit because ot the heat, but overall it was a great find and it helps with hemroids without the smell of medicine:)</li>
            <li>This is a great natural product for hemorrhoid&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>By using this along with Anusol HC (hydrocortisone), it has worked wonders (Anusol HC by itself was not cutting it but added together, it worked!).</li>
            <li>But this leaves you with relief and feeling of clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying more right now as I right this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Extremely much worth the $&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>And very fast.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many things but the hems just came back.</li>
            <li>and this is the first product to bring me</li>
            <li>I was only able to find Witch Hazel liquid at the stores, so bought the salve.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price when I was in so much pain with no relief.</li>
            <li>Size and price were reasonable.  </li>
            <li>There is not a high enough concentration of actual witch hazel for this to do any good.</li>
            <li>I normally would have used the liquid bottle form</li>
            <li>Using natural products is a high priority for me.  </li>
            <li>nearly cleared up after one use!  </li>
            <li>Hemorrhoids aren&#x27;t fun and the typical pharmacy products don&#x27;t quite do the job to relieve the itching and burning.</li>
            <li>No other inferences should be drawn.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We have to start reading the ingredient labels carefully, because there is so much poison that companies use in their products because customers aren&#x27;t educated.</li>
            <li>Draws rings around other products on the market, pain relief fast.</li>

            <li> I have tried many things but the hems just came back. I apply only at night, because the oily nature of this will stain clothes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it works so well. And very fast. I had trouble since I had my son years ago and this is the first product to bring me relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extremely much worth the $&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I hesitated to buy this because of the price but decided to try it out based on the reviews here. Hemorrhoids aren&#x27;t fun and the typical pharmacy products don&#x27;t quite do the job to relieve the itching and burning. Though you may have to apply it a few times daily, it really does provide some relief.</li>
            <li> Tried all OTC stuff &amp; followed dr&#x27;s diet recommendatipns but norhing worked &amp; was facing surgery - until I used this for hemorrhoids. The best!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my third trimester, and it seemed that all of a sudden I was being plagued by hemorrhoids.  This product is wonderful if you just want to Relieve symptoms.  If you want something to actually relieve systems and take care of the hemorrhoids, try Earth Mama Angel Baby bottom Balm.</li>
            <li> There is no change. I stopped using it for my hemorrhoids. I&#x27;m looking for another product.. This one doesn&#x27;t satisfy my expectation..</li>
            <li> I used this for a rash which broke out on my face.  I normally would have used the liquid bottle form but this seems to work much better because it has an oil base which not only dried out the rash but served as a mild moisturizer for the skin at the same time.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this to use on a spot of stubborn eczema...nearly cleared up after one use!  Amazed!!!!</li>
            <li> Still evaluating product.  Size and price were reasonable.  Very fast shipping.  Will follow up if need arises.  The opinion(s) expressed are solely based on my like or dislike of the product. No other inferences should be drawn.</li>
            <li> Does help, since I have only used it a few times, It is hard to give an accurate review. I am not diappointed in the purchase and I would reccomend to others. It will stain your panties so plan aheah for that. And the stains do not come out in the wash. I do like it better that the prescription oinments that also stain the panties. But this leaves you with relief and feeling of clean.</li>
            <li> It was what I ordered, just wish it had been sealed better, it leaked out a bit because ot the heat, but overall it was a great find and it helps with hemroids without the smell of medicine:)</li>
            <li> This is a great natural product for hemorrhoid&#x27;s.  Since it&#x27;s made from olive oil, it can be a bit greasy and may stain things but just beware.  Using natural products is a high priority for me.  No parabens!</li>
            <li> Great stuff. I have UC and I always have hemorrhoids or a rash on my bottom and this stuff is amazing. I&#x27;m buying more right now as I right this.</li>
            <li> Just like Shea butter, don&#x27;t help anything!</li>
            <li> So glad I discovered this product.  I soothes any type of rectal itching or irritation.  Would never be without.</li>
            <li> Always knew witch hazel was soothing, but this salve goes beyond what hemorrhoidal creams do. It is the most helpful product I have found to control itching and discomfort.</li>
            <li> For the application I needed, this stuff worked like a charm.  I was only able to find Witch Hazel liquid at the stores, so bought the salve.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> At 26 weeks along in my second pregnancy, I was trying everything (I am a pharmacist so I tried all the different pharmaceutical products). By using this along with Anusol HC (hydrocortisone), it has worked wonders (Anusol HC by itself was not cutting it but added together, it worked!). I will buy again when I run out for after the baby comes. Worth the price when I was in so much pain with no relief.</li>
            <li> Good for lube that about it</li>
            <li> There is not a high enough concentration of actual witch hazel for this to do any good. I am pretty disappointed that I wasted my money on this.</li>
            <li> After I did my research this summer on Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep website, I got rid of a lot of cosmetic, health, hygiene, etc. products which contained parabens and other harmful chemicals. I have nothing but the highest praise for Wise Ways witch hazel salve. It is safe and it is an excellent moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my (formerly dry, cracked) heels every night, and I just can&#x27;t believe that I put up with cracked heels and ugly feet for so long!! I also invested in a good heel rasp, I soak my feet in bath salts and give myself a pedicure once a week, and boy oh boy has it made a difference!!! I love this product, and I feel safe using it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have to start reading the ingredient labels carefully, because there is so much poison that companies use in their products because customers aren&#x27;t educated. JUST SAY NO TO TOXINS AND POISONS in your personal care products!!!!</li>
            <li> Love it.  It works great or itching.  It also works great for my hemmoroids .  Get it--you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> Great product thank you</li>
            <li> Draws rings around other products on the market, pain relief fast.</li>
