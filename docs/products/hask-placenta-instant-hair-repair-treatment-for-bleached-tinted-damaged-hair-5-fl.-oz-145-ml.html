            <li>I bought these based on the good reviews.</li>
            <li>covered more than two uses!</li>

            <li>so that was nice</li>
            <li>I really like how this stuff makes my hair feel the smell isn&#x27;t the greatest</li>

            <li>Great for damaged distressed hair, begin using this product and your hair will be on the fast track to healthiness!  </li>
            <li>but it is not the best option in general.</li>
            <li>Very good product for the price, makes hair soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>Works better than any product I have tried...</li>
            <li>Love it and recommend it to people with fried damaged tresses</li>
            <li>I decided to get the spray bottle here because it&#x27;s more</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s expired.</li>
            <li>I love this product .</li>
            <li>The top part of my hair has a lot of oil</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It made my bleach ravaged hair so moist that the ends wanted to stretch and stick together, and made them more elastic and easier to break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Hask Placents Instant Hair Repair Treatment is a really excellent product.</li>
            <li>Also helps when static flyaway is an issue.</li>
            <li>but overall I am impressed and will purchase again.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make hair feel any better than before use.</li>
            <li>I will post more updates once I have used it more.</li>
            <li>Not as great as the Henna placenta moisturizer, but a decent detangler for mix hair.</li>
            <li>This would be a great product for normal levels of chemically processed or heat damaged</li>
            <li>At the time I was like &amp;#34;Drat, this stuff was pretty good too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and silky and looks beautiful.</li>
            <li>I used this stuff for about a year and thought it was amazing, until I started to become more aware of animal-derived and animal tested products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot more silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>This is a great product to make the hair look and feel healthier, but don&#x27;t expect it to actually make it healthier - for that diet supplements and scalp treatments will probably work better.</li>
            <li>I am 50 and have fine thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>i got a wonderful idea to make a large chunk blonde....</li>
            <li>My hair was a pile of frizz, and huge chunks were falling out.</li>
            <li>Worked great at repairing my bleached and damaged hair, and as an added bonus, it grosses my male roommate out to no end when this is in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>For light weight shine and convenience, it cannot be beat.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous as a leave-in for color treated or permed hair.</li>
            <li>Honestly when I first used this stuff I was totally weirded out by it, but I can honestly say this stuff saved my hair!</li>
            <li>It has a great scent actually.</li>
            <li>Works great and is not too heavy on my very fine, color-treated hair.</li>
            <li>Great for dry colored hair.</li>
            <li>I badly damaged my hair using a popular brand straitening iron a couple of years ago, I have since changed irons but have never been able to get the top layer of my hair looking good again.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel super soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a big hair product kind of guy</li>
            <li>Although the ingredients are kind of gross to think about putting on your hair</li>
            <li>I bought this product on a whim and hoped the reviews were right.  </li>
            <li>My hair is so soft, silky and healthy now after consistently using this product for 6 weeks.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t doubt this stuff will help over time, because of the protein, but as an instant treatment for REALLY, REALLY damaged hair, it actually does more harm than good.</li>
            <li>After the first use with placenta i could see a difference.</li>
            <li>Reminds me of that American Dad episode where Francine says &amp;#34;Oh Mr. Beauregard, I&#x27;d LOVE for you to put expelled uterine matter in MY hair.&amp;#34; I just hope this stuff is humanely sourced.</li>
            <li>works really well with my bleached hair!</li>
            <li>First of all, it was almost halfway gone when i got it.</li>
            <li>Since trying the Hask leave in instant conditioner my hair has never been in better condition.</li>
            <li>If I spray this all over the underside of my hair and also on the ends, my hair definitely feels stronger and more manageable.</li>
            <li>I used this for a couple weeks and MIGHT have noticed that my hair was softer the first couple days</li>
            <li>I Use this first on damp hair,Then use Its a 10 Miracle leave in with keratin and</li>
            <li>I was better off just using my regular conditioner.</li>
            <li>I received my product in 6 days, pretty fast compared to some items on here</li>
            <li>Then again, I&#x27;m not super great about paying attention to things like that, so don&#x27;t take my word as final on it!!</li>
            <li>I have extremely fragile, baby fine hair that&#x27;s been fried from heat and over coloring.  </li>
            <li>I like this product because I have fine blonde hair</li>
            <li>This has helped so much.</li>
            <li>This stuff really delivers.  </li>
            <li>I have breakage and my hair is very course.  </li>
            <li>But my hair isn&#x27;t important enough as somebody&#x27;s life or feelings.&amp;#34; But now I use Argon Oil on my hair and I see results immediately!</li>
            <li>My hair is very damaged because I over process it with dying and bleaching.</li>
            <li>It will end up just like your money; straight into the trash.</li>
            <li>My hair is much stronger, shinier, and thicker.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my daughter who has very over-proccessed (colored) hair.</li>
            <li>I use this occasionally with other products and it makes my hair feel good</li>
            <li>but ive found other products more helpful.</li>
            <li>I noticed that this helped immediately - after about a month or so of use, my hair is almost normal!</li>
            <li>Since i have used this product previously I know for sure that it is not supposed to smell like that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought this product multiple times from my local Walmart and love it.</li>
            <li>My dry, fine and limp hair became so healthy i couldnt believe it.</li>
            <li>Most products are very sticky and end up making my hair look and feel courser throughout the day, this had the opposite effect, it&#x27;s silky all day long!!  </li>
            <li>Style as normal.</li>
            <li>My hair is coarse and wavy and around age 25, the under-side of my hair just started to get extra course and break easily.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use much - mostly on the ends of my hair and it really helps tame the frizzies!</li>
            <li>This was a new product for me</li>
            <li>I have been looking all over the place for something to repair the damage inflicted upon my golden tresses by the evils of a particular \\&quot;Blow Dry</li>
            <li>It was an older bottle and smelled of old perfume.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair strong &amp; I see less breakage with each use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s becoming soft again and there is a lot less breakage.  </li>
            <li>Didnt think it was possible after trying so many that just sat on my hair and weighed it down.  </li>
            <li>I color, blow dry and flat iron my hair, so it can become damaged easily.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, if your hair is at the gummy, stretchy, breaking off if you run your brush through it stage, it actually adds too much moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair became quite soft and healthier.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly &amp; damaged hair from coloring.</li>
            <li>but so far I have already noticed a change in my hair.</li>
            <li>After trying several unsuccessful conditioning treatments, this stuff actually worked decently well!  </li>
            <li>my hair was toast, breaking off and just generally fried.</li>
            <li>Of course, there is no such thing as a miracle repair cream for severely damaged hair, but I could at least run my fingers through my hair after the first use and after a week of consistent use, there is a noticeable difference in my hair&#x27;s texture.  </li>
            <li>unlike a particular \\&quot;Blow Dry Perfector\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many products to get my hair in better shape after coloring with very bad results.</li>
            <li>i tried everything protein packs deep conditioners nothing i was pretty sure cutting my hair off almost shaved on the one side was going to be my only option...</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product to my friends who color, blow dry and flat iron their hair.</li>
            <li>It made a big difference in that after I blew my hair straight it looked healthier, shiny and less frizz.</li>
            <li>until this was suggested to me now it hasn&#x27;t cured it completely however it has stopped breaking and slowly the root are getting healthier and it doesn&#x27;t look like a large chunk of my hair caught fire..</li>

            <li> /&gt;However, if your hair is at the gummy, stretchy, breaking off if you run your brush through it stage, it actually adds too much moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair became quite soft and healthier.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly &amp; damaged hair from coloring.</li>
            <li> but so far I have already noticed a change in my hair.</li>
            <li> After trying several unsuccessful conditioning treatments, this stuff actually worked decently well!  </li>
            <li> my hair was toast, breaking off and just generally fried.</li>
            <li> Of course, there is no such thing as a miracle repair cream for severely damaged hair, but I could at least run my fingers through my hair after the first use and after a week of consistent use, there is a noticeable difference in my hair&#x27;s texture.  </li>
            <li> unlike a particular \\&quot;Blow Dry Perfector\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many products to get my hair in better shape after coloring with very bad results.</li>
            <li> i tried everything protein packs deep conditioners nothing i was pretty sure cutting my hair off almost shaved on the one side was going to be my only option...</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product to my friends who color, blow dry and flat iron their hair.</li>
            <li> It made a big difference in that after I blew my hair straight it looked healthier, shiny and less frizz.</li>
            <li> until this was suggested to me now it hasn&#x27;t cured it completely however it has stopped breaking and slowly the root are getting healthier and it doesn&#x27;t look like a large chunk of my hair caught fire..</li>
            <li> It made my hair ridiculously soft, and it&#x27;s extremely damaged from constant bleaching and dying.</li>
            <li> In fact, my co-worker even commented the other day how soft and shiney my hair looked.  </li>
            <li> Long story short, it got rid of all the knots and gave me human hair again.</li>
            <li> I first learned about this product when I was in Beauty College during the late 1960&#x27;s and have used it ever since.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how anything could evaporate that much in 6 days</li>
            <li> i left the bleach on too long and Poof</li>
            <li> My hair is processed and long and this product saves the day.</li>
            <li> My hair has been relaxed and is undergoing the long process of treatment.</li>
            <li> I use it in combination with other oils and conditioners, but it is a definite must if you color treat your hair.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a little more expensive there.</li>
            <li> This has restored the silkiness to my hair and even repaired my split ends!I have very long hair and the bottle</li>
            <li> I color and blow dry which adds abuse to my hair.  </li>
            <li> Hask doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, but actually gives it the appearance of being shiny, silky and manageable.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down like regular conditioners.  </li>
            <li> it helps my dry hair!</li>
            <li> I wish these came in larger size bottles, as I had to buy another after less than two weeks.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is that it comes in little vials</li>
            <li> Also on a side note my daughter is African American and the battle for hydration is always hard fought in our house to eliminate the frizz this doesn&#x27;t cure it</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected.</li>
            <li> My hair did not feel silky as some have claimed, but made it feel rough and knotty.</li>
            <li> I tried this product thinking it would repair the little damage I had on my hair from dyeing it and straightening it with a flat iron, but all it did was make my hair heavy and gross feeling.</li>
            <li> My hair was extremely damaged from blow drying.  </li>
            <li> If you use this beware it can leave hair feeling weighed down and greasy with very minimal use.</li>
            <li> so I use Argan Oil from the mid-point down.</li>
            <li> They either weighed my hair down or made it look oily.</li>
            <li> She says it worked well at repair, making her hair look less straw-like.</li>
            <li> I just applied it to wet hair, let it sit on there while I made coffee and then blowdried as usual.  </li>
            <li> I use a straitener everyday but it felt like I had to use it less</li>
            <li> little</li>
            <li> I add a little bit into my hair shampoo.</li>
            <li> Soooo being naturally very dark brown</li>
            <li> After a few days i was convinced.  </li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of use, everyday, i feel that now, i dont have to use it everyday.</li>
            <li> but overall I am not happy and will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> I used this for about 4 months, not able to tell if it helped repair my hair at all.</li>
            <li> This product actually made my hair worse!</li>
            <li> At least this product is up-front about it&#x27;s ingredients...</li>
            <li> At least not from here.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and it works</li>
            <li> When you think about it, it&#x27;s probably not as weird as some of the other chemicals and dyes we slather on our hair on a semi-regular basis.  </li>
            <li> , I was so afraid of the damage I would do to my already dry, brittle hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair was dry disgusting and hay like, but this stuff saved my hair from the abyss and possible shaving it was going to incur.  </li>
            <li> Really poor packaging as well.</li>
            <li> For the price, I feel like I&#x27;ve stumbled onto a little-known beauty secret.  </li>
            <li> did she know that my secret is SHEEP PLACENTA!&lt;br</li>
            <li> To make matters worse</li>
            <li> Not only did it not work, it smelled terrible.</li>
            <li> I can not reveal the culprit, but it comes in a green box and is the worst thing I have done to my hair in YEARS.  </li>
            <li> I told my daughter that i havent had a bad hair day since using this.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad and the texture is not goopy, as one might expect.  </li>
            <li> It smells so bad</li>
            <li> I thought it would smell bad</li>
            <li> I had a stylist stupidly leave 40 volume bleach in my hair for over and hour then put me under heat for another 30mins.</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I also bought this product on a quest to find a good leave in conditioner.  Didnt think it was possible after trying so many that just sat on my hair and weighed it down.  After the first use with placenta i could see a difference. After a few days i was convinced.  My dry, fine and limp hair became so healthy i couldnt believe it. After 2 weeks of use, everyday, i feel that now, i dont have to use it everyday. I told my daughter that i havent had a bad hair day since using this.</li>
            <li> Very good product for the price, makes hair soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> Worked great at repairing my bleached and damaged hair, and as an added bonus, it grosses my male roommate out to no end when this is in the bathroom. Reminds me of that American Dad episode where Francine says &amp;#34;Oh Mr. Beauregard, I&#x27;d LOVE for you to put expelled uterine matter in MY hair.&amp;#34; I just hope this stuff is humanely sourced.</li>
            <li> Soooo being naturally very dark brown i got a wonderful idea to make a large chunk blonde....loved it rocked it for a couple months until one day i left the bleach on too long and Poof my hair was toast, breaking off and just generally fried. i tried everything protein packs deep conditioners nothing i was pretty sure cutting my hair off almost shaved on the one side was going to be my only option... until this was suggested to me now it hasn&#x27;t cured it completely however it has stopped breaking and slowly the root are getting healthier and it doesn&#x27;t look like a large chunk of my hair caught fire.. so lesson learned. Also on a side note my daughter is African American and the battle for hydration is always hard fought in our house to eliminate the frizz this doesn&#x27;t cure it but it has noticeably helped allot</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected. Really poor packaging as well.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t be without this stuff.  Works better than any product I have tried...no matter the price.  For light weight shine and convenience, it cannot be beat.  I recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> works really well with my bleached hair!</li>
            <li> This has helped so much. I use it in combination with other oils and conditioners, but it is a definite must if you color treat your hair.</li>
            <li> This is really great stuff. I&#x27;ve been using it for years now. Fabulous as a leave-in for color treated or permed hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff really delivers.  I have extremely fragile, baby fine hair that&#x27;s been fried from heat and over coloring.  Hask doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, but actually gives it the appearance of being shiny, silky and manageable.  For the price, I feel like I&#x27;ve stumbled onto a little-known beauty secret.  Great stuff.</li>
            <li> I have been looking all over the place for something to repair the damage inflicted upon my golden tresses by the evils of a particular \\&quot;Blow Dry Perfector\\&quot; (HA!  What a joke...).  I can not reveal the culprit, but it comes in a green box and is the worst thing I have done to my hair in YEARS.  My hair felt like straw when I was done and was breaking off in pieces.  After trying several unsuccessful conditioning treatments, this stuff actually worked decently well!  I wish these came in larger size bottles, as I had to buy another after less than two weeks.  Of course, there is no such thing as a miracle repair cream for severely damaged hair, but I could at least run my fingers through my hair after the first use and after a week of consistent use, there is a noticeable difference in my hair&#x27;s texture.  It&#x27;s becoming soft again and there is a lot less breakage.  In fact, my co-worker even commented the other day how soft and shiney my hair looked.  Muahaha!  little did she know that my secret is SHEEP PLACENTA!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, there&#x27;s animal placenta extract in it.  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad and the texture is not goopy, as one might expect.  It&#x27;s actually quite watery.  When you think about it, it&#x27;s probably not as weird as some of the other chemicals and dyes we slather on our hair on a semi-regular basis.  At least this product is up-front about it&#x27;s ingredients...unlike a particular \\&quot;Blow Dry Perfector\\&quot;.  Yes, I&#x27;m still bitter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions: Shampoo hair.  Spray in Hask Placenta and let sit for 3 minutes.  Style as normal.</li>
            <li> I like this product because I have fine blonde hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down like regular conditioners.  I don&#x27;t use much - mostly on the ends of my hair and it really helps tame the frizzies!</li>
            <li> Great for damaged distressed hair, begin using this product and your hair will be on the fast track to healthiness!  Love it and recommend it to people with fried damaged tresses</li>
            <li> I badly damaged my hair using a popular brand straitening iron a couple of years ago, I have since changed irons but have never been able to get the top layer of my hair looking good again. I have breakage and my hair is very course.  To make matters worse I had a big oops with some box haircolor and then had to correct it in the same day, I was so afraid of the damage I would do to my already dry, brittle hair.  This stuff came to the rescue BIG TIME!!! It is very light, watery and smells wonderful!  I just applied it to wet hair, let it sit on there while I made coffee and then blowdried as usual.  I use a straitener everyday but it felt like I had to use it less and my hair actually felt silky!  It hasn&#x27;t felt this good since before I damaged it.  Most products are very sticky and end up making my hair look and feel courser throughout the day, this had the opposite effect, it&#x27;s silky all day long!!  I also want to try their Henna &amp; Placenta treatment next which promises not to change hair color.  I am HOOKED!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 bottles of this products almost a year ago now. I am finishing the last bottle and I must say that I do NOT see any improvement in my hair growth, texture or strenght since using it. I will not buy again nor recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I first learned about this product when I was in Beauty College during the late 1960&#x27;s and have used it ever since.  In my opinion it is the best hair care product on the market.  I add a little bit into my hair shampoo.</li>
            <li> I lap swim about 10 hours a week and my hair is thrashed. I&#x27;m not a big hair product kind of guy but my wife suggested that I try this product out. Long story short, it got rid of all the knots and gave me human hair again.</li>
            <li> incredible. reviving.</li>
            <li> I dye my hair regularly. This has restored the silkiness to my hair and even repaired my split ends!I have very long hair and the bottle covered more than two uses!</li>
            <li> Product review: I&#x27;ve bought this product multiple times from my local Walmart and love it. It works great. It makes my hair feel super soft and healthy. The only problem is that it comes in little vials and it&#x27;s a little more expensive there. I decided to get the spray bottle here because it&#x27;s more convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller review: The seller was RunSkipShop. I received my product in 6 days, pretty fast compared to some items on here so that was nice BUT, I had a lot of issues with this product. First of all, it was almost halfway gone when i got it. You could tell it had been used before although the seller claimed it could be evaporation. I&#x27;m not sure how anything could evaporate that much in 6 days but whatever. Then my second problem was that it was not what was pictured here. It was an older bottle and smelled of old perfume. It smells so bad i can&#x27;t even use it. Since i have used this product previously I know for sure that it is not supposed to smell like that. It does not have an expiration date but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s expired. I will admit that they were very nice about the situation and gave me a full refund but overall I am not happy and will not be buying this again. At least not from here.</li>
            <li> SOOOO GOOD . I have FRIED my hair by heat and color, and this product has stopped the breakage! GET THIS! my hair is thicker than EVER</li>
            <li> I used this for about 4 months, not able to tell if it helped repair my hair at all.</li>
            <li> My hair was extremely damaged from blow drying.  I bought this product on a whim and hoped the reviews were right.  Although the ingredients are kind of gross to think about putting on your hair and I do not think this product smells particularly good, it works wonders.  My hair is so soft, silky and healthy now after consistently using this product for 6 weeks.  I am already on my second bottle.  Will continue to purchase and wish I could order it on auto-delivery!</li>
            <li> Love what this product does for my hair!  Received order in perfect condition and promptly!  Great for dry colored hair.</li>
            <li> It made a big difference in that after I blew my hair straight it looked healthier, shiny and less frizz. Did not make as big a difference with my curly hair. I love this product . It holds me over until I can afford another hair straightening .</li>
            <li> I used this stuff for about a year and thought it was amazing, until I started to become more aware of animal-derived and animal tested products. At the time I was like &amp;#34;Drat, this stuff was pretty good too. But my hair isn&#x27;t important enough as somebody&#x27;s life or feelings.&amp;#34; But now I use Argon Oil on my hair and I see results immediately! The top part of my hair has a lot of oil so I use Argan Oil from the mid-point down. It&#x27;s actually better than this stuff and without the cruelty! n.n</li>
            <li> I have tried many products to get my hair in better shape after coloring with very bad results. They either weighed my hair down or made it look oily. Since trying the Hask leave in instant conditioner my hair has never been in better condition. It&#x27;s soft and silky and looks beautiful. I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  You don&#x27;t have to use it every day.  It adds body.  Makes your hair feel great but doesn&#x27;t feel like there is anything on it.  No smell or any residue feeling on your hair or hands.  I use it about 3 times a week and my hair feels &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;, bouncy, and people ask, &amp;#34;what did you do to your hair&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not gross. Like, dude, I promise. My hair is coarse and wavy and around age 25, the under-side of my hair just started to get extra course and break easily. If I spray this all over the underside of my hair and also on the ends, my hair definitely feels stronger and more manageable. Very happy I gave this stuff a try and will continue to purchase until I&#x27;m bald.</li>
            <li> This would be a great product for normal levels of chemically processed or heat damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if your hair is at the gummy, stretchy, breaking off if you run your brush through it stage, it actually adds too much moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It made my bleach ravaged hair so moist that the ends wanted to stretch and stick together, and made them more elastic and easier to break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got some watery Infusium 23 Recovery leave in spray, and that seems to be helping a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t doubt this stuff will help over time, because of the protein, but as an instant treatment for REALLY, REALLY damaged hair, it actually does more harm than good.</li>
            <li> Not as great as the Henna placenta moisturizer, but a decent detangler for mix hair.</li>
            <li> The Hask Placents Instant Hair Repair Treatment is a really excellent product. I color, blow dry and flat iron my hair, so it can become damaged easily.  This was a new product for me and I think it is excellent.  It gives  your hair softness along with body.  A terrific &amp;#34;leave in&amp;#34; conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product to my friends who color, blow dry and flat iron their hair.</li>
            <li> I bought these based on the good reviews. Wish I never bought this. My hair is very damaged because I over process it with dying and bleaching. This product actually made my hair worse! My hair was breaking every time I ran a brush through it. Horrible! Don&#x27;t waste your money on this. It will end up just like your money; straight into the trash.</li>
            <li> I used this for a couple weeks and MIGHT have noticed that my hair was softer the first couple days but I didn&#x27;t see any noticeable change in the healthiness of my hair. Then again, I&#x27;m not super great about paying attention to things like that, so don&#x27;t take my word as final on it!!</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  My beautician uses it and suggested it to me.  My hair is processed and long and this product saves the day.</li>
            <li> Works great and is not too heavy on my very fine, color-treated hair. Also helps when static flyaway is an issue.</li>
            <li> it helps my dry hair!</li>
            <li> I really like how this stuff makes my hair feel the smell isn&#x27;t the greatest but overall I am impressed and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This products leaves your hair shiny! I Use this first on damp hair,Then use Its a 10 Miracle leave in with keratin and my Hair is now Strong,Shiny,And Growing!.I Will always Buy this item.</li>
            <li> It made my hair ridiculously soft, and it&#x27;s extremely damaged from constant bleaching and dying. I use it every day.</li>
            <li> I use this occasionally with other products and it makes my hair feel good but ive found other products more helpful.</li>
            <li> I am 50 and have fine thinning hair.  I color and blow dry which adds abuse to my hair.  I have been using this product every day and the difference is amazing.  My hair is much stronger, shinier, and thicker.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I have caucasian hair that I way over-processed and over-bleached. My hair was a pile of frizz, and huge chunks were falling out. I noticed that this helped immediately - after about a month or so of use, my hair is almost normal!</li>
            <li> I tried this product thinking it would repair the little damage I had on my hair from dyeing it and straightening it with a flat iron, but all it did was make my hair heavy and gross feeling. I was better off just using my regular conditioner. Not only did it not work, it smelled terrible. My hair did not feel silky as some have claimed, but made it feel rough and knotty. Perhaps you have to have severely damaged hair for it to work. Do not buy this product!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product to make the hair look and feel healthier, but don&#x27;t expect it to actually make it healthier - for that diet supplements and scalp treatments will probably work better. I don&#x27;t like to use anything else on my hair, and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Honestly when I first used this stuff I was totally weirded out by it, but I can honestly say this stuff saved my hair! I had a stylist stupidly leave 40 volume bleach in my hair for over and hour then put me under heat for another 30mins. My hair was dry disgusting and hay like, but this stuff saved my hair from the abyss and possible shaving it was going to incur.  Gave my hair shine and softness again. repaired all the damage.</li>
            <li> Great for spray on hair shine, and treatment of damaged hair. My hair has been relaxed and is undergoing the long process of treatment. This spray is helping and I can feel the difference.</li>
            <li> I saw a difference in my hair . My hair became quite soft and healthier. It has a great scent actually. I have thick curly hair and it works Totally repaired my hair and it even helped my roots</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly &amp; damaged hair from coloring. I spray this on my hair after I co Wash &amp; deep condition. It makes my hair strong &amp; I see less breakage with each use.</li>
            <li> Thus may be the best option for the all natural crowd but it is not the best option in general.</li>
            <li> This treatment does nothing for hair. It doesn&#x27;t make hair feel any better than before use. If you use this beware it can leave hair feeling weighed down and greasy with very minimal use.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter who has very over-proccessed (colored) hair. She says it worked well at repair, making her hair look less straw-like. Her hair looks and feels softer and healthier.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product twice (got it three days ago) but so far I have already noticed a change in my hair. It&#x27;s a lot more silky and smooth. I thought it would smell bad and it&#x27;s not the best smelling beauty product ever , but really not terrible. I will post more updates once I have used it more.</li>
