            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy, also works great for styling.</li>
            <li>The pure, unrefined shea butter is the best.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this amazing product for years.</li>
            <li>Amazing amazing amazing in just 3 days</li>
            <li>Nice light-yellow color.</li>
            <li>It would have been nice if they had just sent me what was in the picture...</li>
            <li>Took it home and really liked it.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to make my own lotion instead of buying lotion from the store.</li>
            <li>I made my own skin cream with the shea butter, cocoa butter, jojoba oil, olive oil, coconut oil and vitamin E oil.</li>
            <li>It created a nice scent.</li>
            <li>I put on gloves and oil my scalp with the warm oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this to make my own whipped shea butter</li>
            <li>this butter is not to greasy and smells nice - not overpowering -</li>
            <li>I love it, smells so good</li>
            <li>i wasn&#x27;t thrilled about the texture of this one...</li>
            <li>Rich, creamy, smooth shea butter!!!</li>
            <li>I first bought this for my wife at one of the booths at the State Fair, ever since she&#x27;s loved it and was glad to see it selling on Amazon since we don&#x27;t always go to the Fair.</li>
            <li>Definitely has that &amp;#34;shea butter&amp;#34; smell, but seems to be of good quality...and made for great body butter!</li>
            <li>Very Pleased and Excited!</li>
            <li>Nice product, however I will keep looking for a Shea butter with more creamy and buttery features.</li>
            <li>They work wonderfully and keep her skin soft.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>This makes it an AMAZING rich, safe moisturizer for your skin!</li>
            <li>This is a great product and I would recommend it for anyone looking for a good natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li>satisfied with this purchase(:</li>
            <li>Love love love the ivory Shea butter.</li>
            <li>Extremely pleased</li>
            <li>Most people are probably used to seeing refined shea butter.</li>
            <li>If, as I believe, it&#x27;s unrefined shea, it has better nutrient qualities, but I think I&#x27;ll stick to the refined stuff for my lotions and soaps to reduce the odor and grainy-ness.</li>
            <li>I was able to visibly see product before package opened.  </li>
            <li>and I love shea and cocoa butter</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s a you-tube video that&#x27;s been broadcast in Mali to help educate women on how to make better shea:</li>
            <li>Than I ran out and was glad to find it through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It is also more of a cream then shea butter which tends to break up more.</li>
            <li>the texture is more like CRISCO.</li>
            <li>I really love Shea butter.  </li>
            <li>Whatever the case may be I am satisfied with his product.</li>
            <li>So -- being the savvy internet shopper I am, I decided to do my own research online to learn more about the product, what to look for and price points for what was available to purchase.  </li>
            <li>The texture has changed it&#x27;s more granular, instead of the smoothe texture</li>
            <li>I love how it smells</li>
            <li>and I love how it feels when applied.</li>
            <li>Ok i use shea butter on a daily basis for my skin disorder and let me tell you the this shea better is one of the best ive ever had.</li>
            <li>No need to look around any more.  </li>
            <li>When I put it my hands it immediately worked and made my hands soooo smooth!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll order more for my mom and sis</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying some from a more reputable source and you should too.</li>
            <li>I love shea butter, I would order from this seller again.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Better than sun block for people of color and lasts all day as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I love the price</li>
            <li>and I love the quality.</li>
            <li>I just love this product a lot</li>
            <li>This has a nice smooth consistency.</li>
            <li>Was ok just not&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>Great product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I think of it as an exfoliant:).  </li>
            <li>I used it for my hair, but found something I like better as this helped my hair a lot, but not with my scalp issues.</li>
            <li>so yea I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love it,  i will buy it again for sure,</li>
            <li>I used the filtered ivory cream before but this one is better.</li>
            <li>it is just the best overall moisturizer to use.  </li>
            <li>but i will buy more</li>
            <li>Very cool product and magnificence has benefited from a lot in the practical field and wish you more time and tender Thanking you</li>
            <li>It has tons of uses and this particular brand is very nice.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is the best and only thing that works and keeps my feet smooth.</li>
            <li>I melted it some in the microwave to make it fit the container better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great stuff and natural, too.</li>
            <li>This made it easy for me to scrape it out with my rubber spatula to make my body butter mixes.</li>
            <li>It &#x27;s easy to mix and blends well.</li>
            <li>The product is grainy and has a strong smell, I can&#x27;t decide if I like the smell or not.</li>
            <li>Worked fine for my moustache wax preparation.</li>
            <li>, it is packaged in a plastic bag, but I&#x27;m fine with that.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was quick, too!</li>
            <li>Thank you Amazon for having this available at my finger tips.</li>
            <li>Free from harmulal chemicals..</li>
            <li>Product was smooth when rubbed into skin.</li>
            <li>Greatest thing for uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been great &amp; I will never go back to chemical &amp;#34;lotions&amp;#34; again.</li>
            <li>AND it almost filled the 16oz.</li>
            <li>This mixes really smooth and buttery.</li>
            <li>I sort of want to add, the grainyness is caused by heating (may be caused by shipping itself,) which causes the Shea butter to lose quality and some of its important properties.</li>
            <li>but I does a great job of keeping your skin like velvet especially during winter season.</li>
            <li>The price was good and the shipping was fast.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy my shea from Natural Cosmetics.</li>
            <li>It feels good making the skin appear supple and feel soft.</li>
            <li>So far, the butter easily melt into your skin and it has a nice light nutty smell to it.</li>
            <li>even my sebum production in my T-zone has significantly lowered.</li>
            <li>I have eczema and this has significantly improved my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have many sensitivities and allergies to all kinds of product additives and need to know exactly what it is that I am using so that I don&#x27;t have a skin reaction.  </li>
            <li>This is a rich, emollient product.</li>
            <li>They were very secure in their own airtight bags, with a second layer of plastic wrap inside.</li>
            <li>my wife notice good different smooth skin and</li>
            <li>It was a bright yellow color.</li>
            <li>The tub is packed full.</li>
            <li>this fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li>It works nicely for lightning stretch marks and made my hair feel soft.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of real Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li>I had a head time finding good real African Shea butter.</li>
            <li>It is a bit grainy but not too noticeably, becomes more liquid when rubbed into skin and appears to be the real deal.</li>
            <li>Also came within 4days after ordering not bad.</li>
            <li>Moisturized great, and I saw a reduction of my hyperpigmentation due to pregnancy acne.</li>
            <li>Melts quickly when you rub in it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 7 months pregnant</li>
            <li>and now i can produce my own creations because of Amazon anything container or natural ingredient i can find right here....</li>
            <li>There is nothing I like better then a rich and natural skin product .</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m thankful it wasn&#x27;t hot out when it was delivered!</li>
            <li>I mixed it with some oils and cocoa butter, created a body cream, and my body is super soft, feels great.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, it has little bit smell</li>
            <li>I love this natural shea butter &amp;</li>
            <li>I love everything that I have bought so far.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t offensive: but it was distinct and not in any way perfumey.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m goin&#x27; natural : )</li>
            <li>Easily absorbed by the skin.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>The shea butter is perfect - the container arrived broken</li>
            <li>and I love the way it makes my skin and natural hair look and feel.</li>
            <li>First of all the shea butter  by itself was soft and rubbed easily and smoothly on my skin.</li>
            <li>I am African, and u can attest that this is a pretty good pure Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>My first experience of purchasing shea butter from Natural Cosmetics has made me a loyal customer for life!!</li>
            <li>Right consistency as well.</li>
            <li>But that didn&#x27;t stop the incredible moisturizing effect of the butter, it is probably the only product I&#x27;ve used which does not give me a dry itchy face in the morning.</li>
            <li>It is bright yellow and soft</li>
            <li>I ended up returning it and luckily found real shea butter afterwards.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, the only negative thing I have to say about it is that after about 6 months in the container,  it starts to have a burnt type smell, however even in that time period, it still works great if you can put up with the smell, I just put it on a upper lip rash &amp; it went away after a day or so.&lt;br</li>
            <li>wow where do i start, let me see, my hair loves it, and it&#x27;s great for other things also.</li>
            <li>kids don&#x27;t like the smell of the raw shea butter, but hey, their skin is nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>A little goes a  long way because it melts so superbly.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time buying shea butter</li>
            <li>EVEN THOUGH MY SKIN IS STILL MOISTURIZED FROM THE FIRST</li>
            <li>This product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>It moisturizers mine very well!</li>
            <li>container that used to hold Blue magic hair conditioner</li>
            <li>I am using my supply from the cocoa butter container first.</li>
            <li>This was the first shea butter product I bought.</li>
            <li>The container it is held in is pretty durable....</li>
            <li>the first two nights I used this.</li>
            <li>The product came exactly when it was supposed to.</li>
            <li>All I can say I&#x27;m buying more African Shea Butter  </li>
            <li>Would most definitely buy again from this seller.</li>
            <li>shea in a pot and add your favorite essential oils (100 drops per 16 oz.</li>
            <li>shea) can make the smell more to your liking or specific to your taste and style.  </li>
            <li>I love Shea Butter especially the beige one.  </li>
            <li>and I will order more when necessary .  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time making lotion</li>
            <li>I believe this works even better than the yellow kind....wish I would&#x27;ve know about this during my teenage years:)</li>
            <li>It is exactly as it&#x27;s advertised.</li>
            <li>Made my own lotions with this and other oils.</li>
            <li>this product came in a convenient size and is raw and unrefined so that all the really good aspects of it are still intact.</li>
            <li>I described the texture of my mixture as firm soap but to be more accurate-</li>
            <li>Unlike most people, I don&#x27;t melt it and mix other oils or scents with it, I just use it right out of the bag.  </li>
            <li>Deducted one star because on one occasion it arrived somewhat grainy, an indication it had melted and reset, most likely a result of storage in high temperatures.</li>
            <li>I was first exposed to pure, raw African shea butter earlier this summer at the DelMar Fair -- and liked what I heard about its medicinal and hydrating qualities --</li>
            <li>Works magic on any dry area of your body.</li>
            <li>it does wonders for my dry feet, mostly in winter months.</li>
            <li>Also it doesnt have that strong nutty smell that often times over power even essential oils.</li>
            <li>The product the I ordered was supposed to be ivory, pure and unrefined.</li>
            <li>I am a large.</li>
            <li>You receive the item in a large ziplock bag.  </li>
            <li>but I have to question whether or not it is pure.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fairly large container, and there&#x27;s a lot of product inside.</li>
            <li>This is the only product that has helped very dry skin, plus it is great for muscle rubs, and I use on my dogs along with tinctures for natural products for them.  </li>
            <li>Very moisterizing  for hair and body.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how to tell if it&#x27;s real shea butter or not.</li>
            <li>When I received my order, it was liquid (thanks to the Texas heat), in a plastic tub in a plastic bag.</li>
            <li>Use too much though</li>
            <li>For people wondering the difference, \\&quot;ivory\\&quot; shea butter is real, unrefined shea butter.</li>
            <li>I really like the Shea butter</li>
            <li>but I soon realized that it doesn&#x27;t remain very \\&quot;moussy.\\</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable and I&#x27;d order again.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I am very upset with this product.</li>
            <li>Really, the smell was nauseating.</li>
            <li>, it is smooth enough to just rub into the skin.  </li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>this product was very grainy, it did turn to oil when its rubbed together</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really have a scent</li>
            <li>It is very similar to shea butter (from the shea tree) and has fantastic results on skin, just like shea.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing, and I ended up using the rest of it for some of my eczema.</li>
            <li>I really like this Shea butter.</li>
            <li>It is great for dry patchy skin &amp; dark spots.</li>
            <li>The long and short of it is, it&#x27;s been a couple weeks now, and I am applying the product every night not only to my hands and feet, but also to my face and neck: and to be honest, not only is the smell a non-issue, I am so pleased with how soft and fresh my face feels in the morning</li>
            <li>This shea butter is good, it is still a little grainy but much easier to apply than the yellow stuff you find in the beauty supply store.  </li>
            <li>but most that I found locally are all mixed with a whole bunch of nonsense</li>
            <li>Keeps everything hydrated plus its the first time my husband commented on how soft my skin is now,</li>
            <li>Slightly cheaper than some more than others</li>
            <li>I love the ivory because the yellow Shea butter gets on your clothes sometimes leaving yellow marks.</li>
            <li>this particular stuff.</li>
            <li>This stuff is yellow and grainy/crumbly in texture, unlike the creamy white shea butter I&#x27;ve gotten from a reputable source.</li>
            <li>I am more fond of the white shea like this product, than the yellow colored ones you might find here or elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>learned about this product while doing research for a friend that had just come back from Africa and kept raving about the yellow shea butter :)</li>
            <li>After that, it is pretty soft and has a a whipped consistency, making it easy to use for hair or skin or mixing into other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The pure raw shea butter is a bit chunky, so for a smoother texture, you may want to go with a more refined shea butter.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>We highly recommend it in place of store versions of the product..</li>
            <li>I also have asthma and am bothered by highly perfumed products.  </li>
            <li>After reading many other reviews about shea butter, I decided to order mine from Natural Cosmetics.  </li>
            <li>After a few days of using this butter my hands look and feel better than they have in years.  </li>
            <li>&quot; It becomes more firm like soap.</li>
            <li>I will continue to purchase and use as it works much better for than any commercial product for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>The next day I opened it and the butter came right out of the package and into the 16 ounce cottage cheese container</li>
            <li>and I have super long hair)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d read that some shea butter has a very noticeable, earthy smell because it is only filtered for impurities, but not refined to cosmetic grade; that&#x27;s definitely the case with this product -- and when I first opened the container and scooped out a tiny thumbnail&#x27;s worth of the butter to warm and emulsify it between my palms and then apply it to my feet and hands, I was not sure at that point if I could make peace with that smell...</li>
            <li>It has a smooth consistency and came in a tub unlike other reviews which stated that it came in a plastic bag.  </li>
            <li>This is something that I can&#x27;t live without.  </li>
            <li>This supply might last me a while because I mixed it with a pound of cocoa butter and the oils that I mentioned and that filled one 4 cup pyrex container, one 12 oz.</li>
            <li>I had also use this in my hair also as a conditioner to soften my new growth and it leaves my hair feeling soft!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just started using it for my face, and I can say this past week, my skin has been brighter, more supple, and</li>
            <li>There Shea butter is exactly the same as I was getting in Africa.</li>
            <li>That and my face was considerably clearer!</li>
            <li>Ok so I got my shea butter that I was so anxious to get</li>
            <li>Anyway, this stuff was just a little too grainy and had a rather strong (but still shea) smell to it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Remove gloves and do my whole body, I do not dry off the oil and water add moisture.</li>
            <li>It arrived looking just like the pictures with a faint but pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>It is not raw or unrefined.  </li>
            <li>Great when working out side in cold weather</li>
            <li>as well I applied the Shea butter and after a week they have started to clear.</li>
            <li>That is how soft this is.  </li>
            <li>The product posted is completely misleading.</li>
            <li>so to have this natural product</li>
            <li>I was surprised how grainy it was.</li>
            <li>how soft it makes my skin.  </li>
            <li>Then applied to my natural hair</li>
            <li>It makes and keeps my skin soft &amp; supple.</li>
            <li>I recommend shea butter for everyone and if you&#x27;re worried about the smell- just mix in a natural fragrant oil.</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s in soft chunks</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and chunky and melts like butter.</li>
            <li>It keeps them both soft and, once rubbed in, is not greasy.</li>
            <li>Lastly, the delivery was fast...</li>
            <li>which, incidentally, will take a loooooong time, because it doesn&#x27;t take much to moisturize my entire face, lips and neck --</li>
            <li>Its soft, non grainy and whips like a milk shake.</li>
            <li>I like this Shea Butter because it is all natural.  </li>
            <li>I tried amazon and with some luck I discovered Natural Cosmetics.</li>
            <li>For the rest of my life I will buy from Natural Cosmetics.</li>
            <li>I use it on my daughter and myself and it makes our hair soft</li>
            <li>Our baby has eczema and shea, paired with Dream Cream and Dream soap from Lush have made the problem history.  </li>
            <li>Far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a personal opinion really.</li>
            <li>its soft the smell is something to get use too</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin and the Shea Butter locks in the moisture and keeps my skin smooth and soft all winter long.  </li>
            <li>The only reason why I don&#x27;t love it is not because of the product per se, but because of the consistency of raw, unrefined shea butter itself.  </li>
            <li>I am 6 and a half months pregnant and so far not a stretch mark.</li>
            <li>The Shea Butter was Ivory, a little lumpy yet soft and full of moisture.</li>
            <li>Magic cream, seriously.</li>
            <li>The first thing I did was open the bag and take a deep whiff.  </li>
            <li>I ordered them from the fulfillment center so they looked pretty professional.</li>
            <li>I expected a smell due to the other reviews I had read, but the smell of this pure ivory product was not unpleasant at all, and disappeared as the butter was absorbed into my skin.  </li>
            <li>Full 5, otherwise 4.5 stars for that little detail.</li>
            <li>I normally get the yellow Shea.</li>
            <li>Nutty scent isn&#x27;t too strong and the color is pale yellow.</li>
            <li>More specifically, it is hard to rub into the skin initially.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my very flaky, dry skin after showering.</li>
            <li>The yellow is African butter, but still very moisturizing. \\&quot;White\\</li>
            <li>It may work OK as a moisturizer, but I&#x27;m wary because this is NOT the real deal.</li>
            <li>But the product is much nicer than the last, similar, product I bought.</li>
            <li>Any kind of skin irritation I have applied it to has either greatly decreased or healed by the next day.  </li>
            <li>Shea Butter is invaluable, I have no regrets!</li>
            <li>My friend at work told me about this product my skin was cracking at the time and no other creams had helped with the problem.</li>
            <li>Its really softened his rough carpenter hands.</li>
            <li>It is a bit too early to see any physical changes since I had just brought this product.</li>
            <li>But I would definitely purchase again, might use one of my old cocoa butter tubs and put it in there.</li>
            <li>When I rubbed it into my skin I barely smelled it.</li>
            <li>Will purchase in the near future.</li>
            <li>Because kpangnan is not widely known, it is often, mislabelled as shea.</li>
            <li>Thank you Natural Cosmetics for your prompt service and for selling 100 % pure African Shea Butter, not Shea Butter cut with mystery ingredients, as I have received  from other vendors.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pregnant, usually I have to add olive oil to my Shae butter</li>
            <li>This shea butter is really grainy compared to other ones I&#x27;ve bought before.</li>
            <li>Good quality REAL ivory shea from NATURAL-COSMETICS, but my only disappointment was that it was sent in a plastic bag!</li>
            <li>I slather it on my entire body once and my skin STAYS soft, hydrated and supple ALL DAY until my next bath/shower.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be a returning costumer in the near future!</li>
            <li>No excuse for misrepresenting the amount being sold.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I use if frequently for dry skin, after a shower, and when my legs hurt.  </li>
            <li>The smell has a slight nutty smell but nothing like real shea butter.</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical that this would be the ivory colored Shea Butter, but I was pleasantly suprised that it was.</li>
            <li>I found an old tub of hair moisturizer, washed it out, melted the shea butter down and poured it in the old container.</li>
            <li>My skin has been very sensitive (A bandaid worn for one day gave me dry patches!!)</li>
            <li>Since it is hot, I only use a thin spread of shea butter to keep from sweating too much.</li>
            <li>I also tried a little of it on my hands, and it&#x27;s really greasy.</li>
            <li>I expected it to be hard, yet smooth to the touch with the warmth of your hand.</li>

            <li> so it&#x27;s easy, also works great for styling.</li>
            <li> The pure, unrefined shea butter is the best.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this amazing product for years.</li>
            <li> Amazing amazing amazing in just 3 days</li>
            <li> Nice light-yellow color.</li>
            <li> It would have been nice if they had just sent me what was in the picture...</li>
            <li> Took it home and really liked it.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to make my own lotion instead of buying lotion from the store.</li>
            <li> I made my own skin cream with the shea butter, cocoa butter, jojoba oil, olive oil, coconut oil and vitamin E oil.</li>
            <li> It created a nice scent.</li>
            <li> I put on gloves and oil my scalp with the warm oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this to make my own whipped shea butter</li>
            <li> this butter is not to greasy and smells nice - not overpowering -</li>
            <li> I love it, smells so good</li>
            <li> i wasn&#x27;t thrilled about the texture of this one...</li>
            <li> Rich, creamy, smooth shea butter!!!</li>
            <li> I first bought this for my wife at one of the booths at the State Fair, ever since she&#x27;s loved it and was glad to see it selling on Amazon since we don&#x27;t always go to the Fair.</li>
            <li> Definitely has that &amp;#34;shea butter&amp;#34; smell, but seems to be of good quality...and made for great body butter!</li>
            <li> Very Pleased and Excited!</li>
            <li> Nice product, however I will keep looking for a Shea butter with more creamy and buttery features.</li>
            <li> They work wonderfully and keep her skin soft.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> This makes it an AMAZING rich, safe moisturizer for your skin!</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I would recommend it for anyone looking for a good natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li> satisfied with this purchase(:</li>
            <li> Love love love the ivory Shea butter.</li>
            <li> Extremely pleased</li>
            <li> Most people are probably used to seeing refined shea butter.</li>
            <li> If, as I believe, it&#x27;s unrefined shea, it has better nutrient qualities, but I think I&#x27;ll stick to the refined stuff for my lotions and soaps to reduce the odor and grainy-ness.</li>
            <li> I was able to visibly see product before package opened.  </li>
            <li> and I love shea and cocoa butter</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a you-tube video that&#x27;s been broadcast in Mali to help educate women on how to make better shea:</li>
            <li> Than I ran out and was glad to find it through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It is also more of a cream then shea butter which tends to break up more.</li>
            <li> the texture is more like CRISCO.</li>
            <li> I really love Shea butter.  </li>
            <li> Whatever the case may be I am satisfied with his product.</li>
            <li> So -- being the savvy internet shopper I am, I decided to do my own research online to learn more about the product, what to look for and price points for what was available to purchase.  </li>
            <li> The texture has changed it&#x27;s more granular, instead of the smoothe texture</li>
            <li> I love how it smells</li>
            <li> and I love how it feels when applied.</li>
            <li> Ok i use shea butter on a daily basis for my skin disorder and let me tell you the this shea better is one of the best ive ever had.</li>
            <li> No need to look around any more.  </li>
            <li> When I put it my hands it immediately worked and made my hands soooo smooth!</li>

            <li> Better than sun block for people of color and lasts all day as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I love the price</li>
            <li> and I love the quality.</li>
            <li> I just love this product a lot</li>
            <li> This has a nice smooth consistency.</li>
            <li> Was ok just not&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I think of it as an exfoliant:).  </li>
            <li> I used it for my hair, but found something I like better as this helped my hair a lot, but not with my scalp issues.</li>
            <li> so yea I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> love it,  i will buy it again for sure,</li>
            <li> I used the filtered ivory cream before but this one is better.</li>
            <li> it is just the best overall moisturizer to use.  </li>
            <li> but i will buy more</li>
            <li> Very cool product and magnificence has benefited from a lot in the practical field and wish you more time and tender Thanking you</li>
            <li> It has tons of uses and this particular brand is very nice.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is the best and only thing that works and keeps my feet smooth.</li>
            <li> I melted it some in the microwave to make it fit the container better.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great stuff and natural, too.</li>
            <li> This made it easy for me to scrape it out with my rubber spatula to make my body butter mixes.</li>
            <li> It &#x27;s easy to mix and blends well.</li>
            <li> The product is grainy and has a strong smell, I can&#x27;t decide if I like the smell or not.</li>
            <li> Worked fine for my moustache wax preparation.</li>
            <li> , it is packaged in a plastic bag, but I&#x27;m fine with that.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was quick, too!</li>
            <li> Thank you Amazon for having this available at my finger tips.</li>
            <li> Free from harmulal chemicals..</li>
            <li> Product was smooth when rubbed into skin.</li>
            <li> Greatest thing for uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been great &amp; I will never go back to chemical &amp;#34;lotions&amp;#34; again.</li>
            <li> AND it almost filled the 16oz.</li>
            <li> This mixes really smooth and buttery.</li>
            <li> I sort of want to add, the grainyness is caused by heating (may be caused by shipping itself,) which causes the Shea butter to lose quality and some of its important properties.</li>
            <li> but I does a great job of keeping your skin like velvet especially during winter season.</li>
            <li> The price was good and the shipping was fast.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy my shea from Natural Cosmetics.</li>
            <li> It feels good making the skin appear supple and feel soft.</li>
            <li> So far, the butter easily melt into your skin and it has a nice light nutty smell to it.</li>
            <li> even my sebum production in my T-zone has significantly lowered.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and this has significantly improved my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have many sensitivities and allergies to all kinds of product additives and need to know exactly what it is that I am using so that I don&#x27;t have a skin reaction.  </li>
            <li> This is a rich, emollient product.</li>
            <li> They were very secure in their own airtight bags, with a second layer of plastic wrap inside.</li>
            <li> my wife notice good different smooth skin and</li>
            <li> It was a bright yellow color.</li>
            <li> The tub is packed full.</li>
            <li> this fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li> It works nicely for lightning stretch marks and made my hair feel soft.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of real Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li> I had a head time finding good real African Shea butter.</li>
            <li> It is a bit grainy but not too noticeably, becomes more liquid when rubbed into skin and appears to be the real deal.</li>
            <li> Also came within 4days after ordering not bad.</li>
            <li> Moisturized great, and I saw a reduction of my hyperpigmentation due to pregnancy acne.</li>
            <li> Melts quickly when you rub in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 7 months pregnant</li>
            <li> and now i can produce my own creations because of Amazon anything container or natural ingredient i can find right here....</li>
            <li> There is nothing I like better then a rich and natural skin product .</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m thankful it wasn&#x27;t hot out when it was delivered!</li>
            <li> I mixed it with some oils and cocoa butter, created a body cream, and my body is super soft, feels great.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, it has little bit smell</li>
            <li> I love this natural shea butter &amp;</li>
            <li> I love everything that I have bought so far.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t offensive: but it was distinct and not in any way perfumey.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m goin&#x27; natural : )</li>
            <li> Easily absorbed by the skin.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> The shea butter is perfect - the container arrived broken</li>
            <li> and I love the way it makes my skin and natural hair look and feel.</li>
            <li> First of all the shea butter  by itself was soft and rubbed easily and smoothly on my skin.</li>
            <li> I am African, and u can attest that this is a pretty good pure Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> My first experience of purchasing shea butter from Natural Cosmetics has made me a loyal customer for life!!</li>
            <li> Right consistency as well.</li>
            <li> But that didn&#x27;t stop the incredible moisturizing effect of the butter, it is probably the only product I&#x27;ve used which does not give me a dry itchy face in the morning.</li>
            <li> It is bright yellow and soft</li>
            <li> I ended up returning it and luckily found real shea butter afterwards.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, the only negative thing I have to say about it is that after about 6 months in the container,  it starts to have a burnt type smell, however even in that time period, it still works great if you can put up with the smell, I just put it on a upper lip rash &amp; it went away after a day or so.&lt;br</li>
            <li> wow where do i start, let me see, my hair loves it, and it&#x27;s great for other things also.</li>
            <li> kids don&#x27;t like the smell of the raw shea butter, but hey, their skin is nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> A little goes a  long way because it melts so superbly.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time buying shea butter</li>
            <li> EVEN THOUGH MY SKIN IS STILL MOISTURIZED FROM THE FIRST</li>
            <li> This product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> It moisturizers mine very well!</li>
            <li> container that used to hold Blue magic hair conditioner</li>
            <li> I am using my supply from the cocoa butter container first.</li>
            <li> This was the first shea butter product I bought.</li>
            <li> The container it is held in is pretty durable....</li>
            <li> the first two nights I used this.</li>
            <li> The product came exactly when it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> All I can say I&#x27;m buying more African Shea Butter  </li>
            <li> Would most definitely buy again from this seller.</li>
            <li> shea in a pot and add your favorite essential oils (100 drops per 16 oz.</li>
            <li> shea) can make the smell more to your liking or specific to your taste and style.  </li>
            <li> I love Shea Butter especially the beige one.  </li>
            <li> and I will order more when necessary .  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time making lotion</li>
            <li> I believe this works even better than the yellow kind....wish I would&#x27;ve know about this during my teenage years:)</li>
            <li> It is exactly as it&#x27;s advertised.</li>
            <li> Made my own lotions with this and other oils.</li>
            <li> this product came in a convenient size and is raw and unrefined so that all the really good aspects of it are still intact.</li>
            <li> I described the texture of my mixture as firm soap but to be more accurate-</li>
            <li> Unlike most people, I don&#x27;t melt it and mix other oils or scents with it, I just use it right out of the bag.  </li>
            <li> Deducted one star because on one occasion it arrived somewhat grainy, an indication it had melted and reset, most likely a result of storage in high temperatures.</li>
            <li> I was first exposed to pure, raw African shea butter earlier this summer at the DelMar Fair -- and liked what I heard about its medicinal and hydrating qualities --</li>
            <li> Works magic on any dry area of your body.</li>
            <li> it does wonders for my dry feet, mostly in winter months.</li>
            <li> Also it doesnt have that strong nutty smell that often times over power even essential oils.</li>
            <li> The product the I ordered was supposed to be ivory, pure and unrefined.</li>
            <li> I am a large.</li>
            <li> You receive the item in a large ziplock bag.  </li>
            <li> but I have to question whether or not it is pure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fairly large container, and there&#x27;s a lot of product inside.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that has helped very dry skin, plus it is great for muscle rubs, and I use on my dogs along with tinctures for natural products for them.  </li>
            <li> Very moisterizing  for hair and body.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to tell if it&#x27;s real shea butter or not.</li>
            <li> When I received my order, it was liquid (thanks to the Texas heat), in a plastic tub in a plastic bag.</li>
            <li> Use too much though</li>
            <li> For people wondering the difference, \\&quot;ivory\\&quot; shea butter is real, unrefined shea butter.</li>
            <li> I really like the Shea butter</li>
            <li> but I soon realized that it doesn&#x27;t remain very \\&quot;moussy.\\</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable and I&#x27;d order again.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I am very upset with this product.</li>
            <li> Really, the smell was nauseating.</li>
            <li> , it is smooth enough to just rub into the skin.  </li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> this product was very grainy, it did turn to oil when its rubbed together</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really have a scent</li>
            <li> It is very similar to shea butter (from the shea tree) and has fantastic results on skin, just like shea.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, and I ended up using the rest of it for some of my eczema.</li>
            <li> I really like this Shea butter.</li>
            <li> It is great for dry patchy skin &amp; dark spots.</li>
            <li> The long and short of it is, it&#x27;s been a couple weeks now, and I am applying the product every night not only to my hands and feet, but also to my face and neck: and to be honest, not only is the smell a non-issue, I am so pleased with how soft and fresh my face feels in the morning</li>
            <li> This shea butter is good, it is still a little grainy but much easier to apply than the yellow stuff you find in the beauty supply store.  </li>
            <li> but most that I found locally are all mixed with a whole bunch of nonsense</li>
            <li> Keeps everything hydrated plus its the first time my husband commented on how soft my skin is now,</li>
            <li> Slightly cheaper than some more than others</li>
            <li> I love the ivory because the yellow Shea butter gets on your clothes sometimes leaving yellow marks.</li>
            <li> this particular stuff.</li>
            <li> This stuff is yellow and grainy/crumbly in texture, unlike the creamy white shea butter I&#x27;ve gotten from a reputable source.</li>
            <li> I am more fond of the white shea like this product, than the yellow colored ones you might find here or elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> learned about this product while doing research for a friend that had just come back from Africa and kept raving about the yellow shea butter :)</li>
            <li> After that, it is pretty soft and has a a whipped consistency, making it easy to use for hair or skin or mixing into other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pure raw shea butter is a bit chunky, so for a smoother texture, you may want to go with a more refined shea butter.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> We highly recommend it in place of store versions of the product..</li>
            <li> I also have asthma and am bothered by highly perfumed products.  </li>
            <li> After reading many other reviews about shea butter, I decided to order mine from Natural Cosmetics.  </li>
            <li> After a few days of using this butter my hands look and feel better than they have in years.  </li>
            <li> &quot; It becomes more firm like soap.</li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase and use as it works much better for than any commercial product for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> The next day I opened it and the butter came right out of the package and into the 16 ounce cottage cheese container</li>
            <li> and I have super long hair)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d read that some shea butter has a very noticeable, earthy smell because it is only filtered for impurities, but not refined to cosmetic grade; that&#x27;s definitely the case with this product -- and when I first opened the container and scooped out a tiny thumbnail&#x27;s worth of the butter to warm and emulsify it between my palms and then apply it to my feet and hands, I was not sure at that point if I could make peace with that smell...</li>
            <li> It has a smooth consistency and came in a tub unlike other reviews which stated that it came in a plastic bag.  </li>
            <li> This is something that I can&#x27;t live without.  </li>
            <li> This supply might last me a while because I mixed it with a pound of cocoa butter and the oils that I mentioned and that filled one 4 cup pyrex container, one 12 oz.</li>
            <li> I had also use this in my hair also as a conditioner to soften my new growth and it leaves my hair feeling soft!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started using it for my face, and I can say this past week, my skin has been brighter, more supple, and</li>
            <li> There Shea butter is exactly the same as I was getting in Africa.</li>
            <li> That and my face was considerably clearer!</li>
            <li> Ok so I got my shea butter that I was so anxious to get</li>
            <li> Anyway, this stuff was just a little too grainy and had a rather strong (but still shea) smell to it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Remove gloves and do my whole body, I do not dry off the oil and water add moisture.</li>
            <li> It arrived looking just like the pictures with a faint but pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> It is not raw or unrefined.  </li>
            <li> Great when working out side in cold weather</li>
            <li> as well I applied the Shea butter and after a week they have started to clear.</li>
            <li> That is how soft this is.  </li>
            <li> The product posted is completely misleading.</li>
            <li> so to have this natural product</li>
            <li> I was surprised how grainy it was.</li>
            <li> how soft it makes my skin.  </li>
            <li> Then applied to my natural hair</li>
            <li> It makes and keeps my skin soft &amp; supple.</li>
            <li> I recommend shea butter for everyone and if you&#x27;re worried about the smell- just mix in a natural fragrant oil.</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s in soft chunks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and chunky and melts like butter.</li>
            <li> It keeps them both soft and, once rubbed in, is not greasy.</li>
            <li> Lastly, the delivery was fast...</li>
            <li> which, incidentally, will take a loooooong time, because it doesn&#x27;t take much to moisturize my entire face, lips and neck --</li>
            <li> Its soft, non grainy and whips like a milk shake.</li>
            <li> I like this Shea Butter because it is all natural.  </li>
            <li> I tried amazon and with some luck I discovered Natural Cosmetics.</li>
            <li> For the rest of my life I will buy from Natural Cosmetics.</li>
            <li> I use it on my daughter and myself and it makes our hair soft</li>
            <li> Our baby has eczema and shea, paired with Dream Cream and Dream soap from Lush have made the problem history.  </li>
            <li> Far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a personal opinion really.</li>
            <li> its soft the smell is something to get use too</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and the Shea Butter locks in the moisture and keeps my skin smooth and soft all winter long.  </li>
            <li> The only reason why I don&#x27;t love it is not because of the product per se, but because of the consistency of raw, unrefined shea butter itself.  </li>
            <li> I am 6 and a half months pregnant and so far not a stretch mark.</li>
            <li> The Shea Butter was Ivory, a little lumpy yet soft and full of moisture.</li>
            <li> Magic cream, seriously.</li>
            <li> The first thing I did was open the bag and take a deep whiff.  </li>
            <li> I ordered them from the fulfillment center so they looked pretty professional.</li>
            <li> I expected a smell due to the other reviews I had read, but the smell of this pure ivory product was not unpleasant at all, and disappeared as the butter was absorbed into my skin.  </li>
            <li> Full 5, otherwise 4.5 stars for that little detail.</li>
            <li> I normally get the yellow Shea.</li>
            <li> Nutty scent isn&#x27;t too strong and the color is pale yellow.</li>
            <li> More specifically, it is hard to rub into the skin initially.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my very flaky, dry skin after showering.</li>
            <li> The yellow is African butter, but still very moisturizing. \\&quot;White\\</li>
            <li> It may work OK as a moisturizer, but I&#x27;m wary because this is NOT the real deal.</li>
            <li> But the product is much nicer than the last, similar, product I bought.</li>
            <li> Any kind of skin irritation I have applied it to has either greatly decreased or healed by the next day.  </li>
            <li> Shea Butter is invaluable, I have no regrets!</li>
            <li> My friend at work told me about this product my skin was cracking at the time and no other creams had helped with the problem.</li>
            <li> Its really softened his rough carpenter hands.</li>
            <li> It is a bit too early to see any physical changes since I had just brought this product.</li>
            <li> But I would definitely purchase again, might use one of my old cocoa butter tubs and put it in there.</li>
            <li> When I rubbed it into my skin I barely smelled it.</li>
            <li> Will purchase in the near future.</li>
            <li> Because kpangnan is not widely known, it is often, mislabelled as shea.</li>
            <li> Thank you Natural Cosmetics for your prompt service and for selling 100 % pure African Shea Butter, not Shea Butter cut with mystery ingredients, as I have received  from other vendors.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pregnant, usually I have to add olive oil to my Shae butter</li>
            <li> This shea butter is really grainy compared to other ones I&#x27;ve bought before.</li>
            <li> Good quality REAL ivory shea from NATURAL-COSMETICS, but my only disappointment was that it was sent in a plastic bag!</li>
            <li> I slather it on my entire body once and my skin STAYS soft, hydrated and supple ALL DAY until my next bath/shower.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be a returning costumer in the near future!</li>
            <li> No excuse for misrepresenting the amount being sold.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I use if frequently for dry skin, after a shower, and when my legs hurt.  </li>
            <li> The smell has a slight nutty smell but nothing like real shea butter.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical that this would be the ivory colored Shea Butter, but I was pleasantly suprised that it was.</li>
            <li> I found an old tub of hair moisturizer, washed it out, melted the shea butter down and poured it in the old container.</li>
            <li> My skin has been very sensitive (A bandaid worn for one day gave me dry patches!!)</li>
            <li> Since it is hot, I only use a thin spread of shea butter to keep from sweating too much.</li>
            <li> I also tried a little of it on my hands, and it&#x27;s really greasy.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be hard, yet smooth to the touch with the warmth of your hand.</li>
            <li> I have ordered African Shea Butter Pure Raw Unrefined online before and it was the yellow one.</li>
            <li> A little greasy for a time, then absorbed into the skin, it helps to combat dry wrinkles worsened by living in a dry climate.  </li>
            <li> PURE RAW UNREFINED</li>
            <li> I mix with other butters and essential oils and use on my natural hair an skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a long time and it&#x27;s no where near empty.</li>
            <li> As a first-time user, shea butter is definitely one I&#x27;m going to stick to regularly especially since it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It really last a long time.</li>
            <li> It can range from light to dark ivory with a slight green hue</li>
            <li> This is not real shea butter, shea butter can only be off white or ivory.</li>
            <li> This is suppose to be raw shea butter , however when it arrived it is clearly African butter as natural shea butter (which is what it is advertised as)</li>
            <li> It was raw, natural shea butter as well, and I thought this was the same.</li>
            <li> so I am not sure if this is normal.</li>
            <li> i have been using shea butter for a long time and never have i had stuff</li>
            <li> when I awake, I intend to continue using this stuff for a long time...</li>
            <li> White and semi creamy, lowish melting point as expected from shea butter.</li>
            <li> Also, if you have found your skin sensitive to harsh ingredients, you may want to try this.</li>
            <li> and I constantly have cracked knuckles due to the water and soap.  </li>
            <li> Also use it to my dry skin and my skin feels moist all day.  </li>
            <li> It feels like dry sand.</li>
            <li> I find that, over night, it will heal cuts from winter dry skin on my hands and knuckles.  </li>
            <li> If you  have any issues with dry skin, this is the product to use.</li>
            <li> you have dry patches.</li>
            <li> Apply after soaking feet for treating dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I apply it before going to bed on my hands because i have eczema, and on any dry spots on my face.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> hoping this will help my sons eczema and my dry skin.</li>
            <li> which real unrefined raw shea butter is firm in texture.  </li>
            <li> I definitely have less itching.  </li>
            <li> My hands and cuticles are very dry.</li>
            <li> i use it for me and for my son who has exema and very dry skin.</li>
            <li> My item was yellow, grainy, and sent in a little tub.</li>
            <li> This did not affect usability as the granules melted away with a little extra rubbing.</li>
            <li> A little gritty but doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> and I doubt it will work since it is not real</li>
            <li> it seems and with that growth I expected a stretch mark or two but knock on Shea butter none yet.</li>
            <li> I expected it to come in a bag and be somewhat melted in the Georgia heat.  </li>
            <li> I have a few acne scars on different parts of my body, and I heard and read that the shea butter helps lighten those areas.</li>
            <li> I have spent years searching for make-ups, soaps and lotions just to find out that they are eventually discontinued or changed in some way.  </li>
            <li> Roughly 32 oz.</li>
            <li> itching stops 90 percent with only a few days of use.</li>
            <li> Was exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s to be expected of the product, and some people might like the scent of it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never  used shea, its got a natural smell, thick in texture and not greasy, unlike petro products.  </li>
            <li> I use this everyday before I go outside, I use it when I get out of the shower on my wet hair</li>
            <li> time, I will keep the bulk of the product refrigerated as soon as I take my first few ounces out (and in between uses of course as I usually do) to slow the minute deterioration that must be producing the slightly off smell.</li>
            <li> Deep ivory colour, very slight nutty odour.</li>
            <li> I would have given this 5 stars, but I agree with the other reviewer that said the ziplog bag is a drag.  </li>
            <li> I used the raw Shea butter mixed with 100% Coconut Oil.  </li>
            <li> Its definitely no longer raw and its refined.</li>
            <li> but I did NOT like the price for these tiny little jars the guy was selling!  </li>
            <li> Maybe I was just ripped off since the other reviewers said that they recieved the butter in a plastic bag.</li>
            <li> I will be using this product to make home made hand and face creams, as well as other body and skin care products.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t leave any white stuff in my hair, i am not totally sure if this is because of the Shea butter or the change in the combination of products that i use in my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to, would recommend,not the same as what I usually get though.  </li>
            <li> Shea butter works, but you&#x27;ll have to mix this with other stuff like olive oil, etc.</li>
            <li> [...]&lt;br /&gt;It is characterized, among other things, by its yellow-ish colour.</li>
            <li> in the past, when i had shea butter, i had left it in my car in the summer, adn it melted.  </li>
            <li> The only reason that I gave it four stars was because of how hard it was to get the shea butter out, and the smell.</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be the packaging.</li>
            <li> Then again, I did notice that each and every chunk I&#x27;ve melted came across at least one speck of red glitter and another impurity.</li>
            <li> hand mixed it with the cocoa butter and oils that I mentioned until it became a thick cream.</li>
            <li> but if I melt it down-</li>
            <li> Other praises are the packaging and arriving on time!    </li>
            <li> It also is less \\&quot;crumbly\\&quot; and has a nutty scent which I don&#x27;t mind at all.  </li>
            <li> it might be a littleless than half of the container.)</li>
            <li> There was no smell (except a slight nuttiness)</li>
            <li> This stuff is already mixed, its yellow the texture is whipped feeling, and smells weird.</li>
            <li> like it slightly melted and was refirmed.  </li>
            <li> A little bit grainy until you melt it down in your hands.</li>
            <li> Still has all the nutrients and if you find it hard and stiff to work with, melt it in a pan on low heat and mix with whatever you like (i like to use jojoba and coconut oil), and refrigerate to help firm it up again.  </li>
            <li> The package was delivered ahead of its scheduled time and was sealed tightly in the container it came in.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, I noticed that my husband started to use it as well.</li>
            <li> Messy,</li>
            <li> It becomes firm like soap BUT-</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t stand putting it on my skin, and well, it was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from scalp psoriasis for years and was tired of trying to find different shampoos for relief.</li>
            <li> It faded away after a few days of using this,</li>
            <li> so getting the unrefined raw version was a necessity for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s organic and raw.  </li>
            <li> I also ordered raw cocoa butter and jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> so i put very little scented lotion over it.</li>
            <li> There are some very small black fibers floating in the mixture.</li>
            <li> I was not pleased and do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used shea butter in the past that looked like this packaging.</li>
            <li> Also, the smell is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I use lavender in mine and have used tea tree in the past.</li>
            <li> This African shea butter happened to be offered by amazon as an add-on -- meaning, if I made a minimum $25 qualified purchase, I could add this product, which would have been very expensive to ship by itself due to its point of origin.  </li>
            <li> Slightly annoying granny consistency, feels like a little sand in the butter, however it melts at the body temperature quite fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to use all the product without wasting some in the bag</li>
            <li> The shea butter was a bit on the hard side, but I figured it was like that from being shaped into the blocks.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a little false to list this as &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; if dye has been added.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s clumsy to move around.  </li>
            <li> It behaves differently in cold process soap, and doesn&#x27;t feel the same when applied to my skin, so I won&#x27;t even try it in my body butter, lip balm and salves.</li>
            <li> Also the packaging mad size was different from what I ordered.</li>
            <li> Can say I was slightly sad since it called for melting it down again for ease of use.</li>
            <li> No more expensive anti-aging treatments (that don&#x27;t work) for me.  </li>
            <li> It smells really bad and it is a thick odd consistency...</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s just a little inconvenient.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with this purchase at all</li>
            <li> It is grainy and a poor quality product.</li>
            <li> For the reviewers who didn&#x27;t like that it came in a plastic bag (which is not uncommon among shea butter retailers): it now comes in a plastic jar.</li>
            <li> I got out of the lotion game the day I found shea butter 3 years ago.  </li>
            <li> After it cooled and hardened, it was yellow, nasty-looking, and it stinks really bad.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s tough work!</li>
            <li> , don&#x27;t get me wrong.  </li>
            <li> Cheaper won&#x27;t mean bad product, but read reviews to ensure the seller sells to spec weight.  </li>
            <li> So sorry to write a bad review.</li>
            <li> Looked nothing like the picture and the smell was unbelievably bad and the texture was like greasy play doh.</li>
            <li> highly disappointed.  </li>
            <li> but it wouldnt soak into my skin and ontop of everything it had a horrible fake plastic smell.</li>
            <li> I guess they figure someone stupid wouldn&#x27;t know the difference.</li>
            <li> Hate to run out.</li>
            <li> Once you use this, all store Shea Butters will seem like crap.</li>
            <li> , im updating my review, and i hate this product.</li>
            <li> My Bad!!!</li>
            <li> and it dries your skin out and makes it worst.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t the worst smell.</li>
            <li> This shea butter came in clumps, and the smell was disgusting.</li>
            <li> I did not even want to bother with anyone who would sell something so awful.</li>
            <li> DISGUSTED!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My skin looks incredible. It&#x27;s almost like I&#x27;m aging in reverse.</li>
            <li> Came in a plastic tub. Nice light-yellow color. The tub is packed full. Melts quickly when you rub in it. As advertised.</li>
            <li> Received yellow something.  Idk what it is.  It is not raw or unrefined.  It is bright yellow and soft which real unrefined raw shea butter is firm in texture.  highly disappointed.  I would return it, but my son got into it and smeared it all over my chair.  That is how soft this is.  I bought it for my husband&#x27;s psoriasis and I doubt it will work since it is not real</li>
            <li> The product the I ordered was supposed to be ivory, pure and unrefined. The picture even shows ivory and the label in the picture does not say whipped. But, the product I actually received was a yellow mustard color and whipped. I will not buy this again from here because I wanted an ivory color for a very specific purpose. Yellow just won&#x27;t do and I didn&#x27;t ask for anything that was whipped. The product posted is completely misleading.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to make some whipped body butter to give as Christmas gifts, and it was wonderful! It arrived on time, and in my opinion it smells good. The product itself looks just like the picture.&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied with this purchase(:</li>
            <li> Very good quality, work great on hair and skin.</li>
            <li> I ORDERED WHAT APPEARED TO BE IVORY/WHITE SHEA BUTTER PURE RAW UNREFINED 16 oz AND I GET YELLOW... WHY POST THIS PIC IF WHAT YOU SEND IS YELLOW AND NOT IVORY OR WHITE!! IM DONE NEVER AGAIN....SOOOOOO PISSED!!! I guess again you get what you pay for..My Bad!!!</li>
            <li> Very moisterizing  for hair and body. Great when working out side in cold weather</li>
            <li> Love love love the ivory Shea butter. I normally get the yellow Shea. I am 6 and a half months pregnant and so far not a stretch mark. I am tiny. I was a size 0 before now I am a large. My belly just popped up overnight it seems and with that growth I expected a stretch mark or two but knock on Shea butter none yet. I have been using this amazing product for years. I love the ivory because the yellow Shea butter gets on your clothes sometimes leaving yellow marks. Now I can Shea away without any yellow residue.I also will be using this incredible product on my newborn son. Can&#x27;t say enough about the wonder of Shea Butter.Also came within 4days after ordering not bad. I am looking into Amazon prime. Thank you Amazon for having this available at my finger tips. Extremely pleased</li>
            <li> Worked fine for my moustache wax preparation.</li>
            <li> The product is grainy and has a strong smell, I can&#x27;t decide if I like the smell or not. There are some very small black fibers floating in the mixture. This is my first time buying shea butter so I am not sure if this is normal. I use this for personal/beauty products and it works well for that purpose. I am somewhat concerned about how this product is sourced and whether it is actually fair trade, organic, etc. I would probably buy again.</li>
            <li> Prompt shipping. Slightly annoying granny consistency, feels like a little sand in the butter, however it melts at the body temperature quite fast. The consistency of the Shea butter did not effect the quality: skin loves it. Nice product, however I will keep looking for a Shea butter with more creamy and buttery features. Thank you for your business.</li>
            <li> Made my skin feel wonderful without feeling greasy afterwards. After a few weeks, I noticed that my husband started to use it as well. Its really softened his rough carpenter hands.</li>
            <li> Im lovin this particular stuff. i have been using shea butter for a long time and never have i had stuff this fresh and smooth. my skin feels like its been touched by an angel.</li>
            <li> I ordered ivory Shea Butter and received yellow. Also the packaging mad size was different from what I ordered. I immediately returned the product.</li>
            <li> Definitely has that &amp;#34;shea butter&amp;#34; smell, but seems to be of good quality...and made for great body butter!</li>
            <li> My product arrived in a tub as pictured. I don&#x27;t know how to tell if it&#x27;s real shea butter or not. I think it&#x27;s unrefined shea butter, but I can&#x27;t prove it. Most people are probably used to seeing refined shea butter. Anyway, this stuff was just a little too grainy and had a rather strong (but still shea) smell to it. If, as I believe, it&#x27;s unrefined shea, it has better nutrient qualities, but I think I&#x27;ll stick to the refined stuff for my lotions and soaps to reduce the odor and grainy-ness.</li>
            <li> I use Shea butter in the making of home products for skin and am always cautious when purchasing online.  This Shea butter was great.  The packaging doesn&#x27;t bother me as I put in a different container anyway.  I was able to visibly see product before package opened.  Right consistency as well. Glad I found!</li>
            <li> After reading many other reviews about shea butter, I decided to order mine from Natural Cosmetics.  I expected it to come in a bag and be somewhat melted in the Georgia heat.  When it arrived within about four days, I placed the unopened package in the refrigerator overnight.  The next day I opened it and the butter came right out of the package and into the 16 ounce cottage cheese container I had saved for it.  I melted it some in the microwave to make it fit the container better.  I expected a smell due to the other reviews I had read, but the smell of this pure ivory product was not unpleasant at all, and disappeared as the butter was absorbed into my skin.  I love, love, love this stuff!  I have to wash my hands a lot at work and I constantly have cracked knuckles due to the water and soap.  After a few days of using this butter my hands look and feel better than they have in years.  My first experience of purchasing shea butter from Natural Cosmetics has made me a loyal customer for life!!</li>
            <li> Made my own lotions with this and other oils. Good product.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is good, it is still a little grainy but much easier to apply than the yellow stuff you find in the beauty supply store.  It also is less \\&quot;crumbly\\&quot; and has a nutty scent which I don&#x27;t mind at all.  I would have given this 5 stars, but I agree with the other reviewer that said the ziplog bag is a drag.  You receive the item in a large ziplock bag.  It&#x27;s hard to use all the product without wasting some in the bag and it&#x27;s clumsy to move around.  I found an old tub of hair moisturizer, washed it out, melted the shea butter down and poured it in the old container.</li>
            <li> Maybe I was just ripped off since the other reviewers said that they recieved the butter in a plastic bag. My item was yellow, grainy, and sent in a little tub. It would have been nice if they had just sent me what was in the picture...</li>
            <li> I first bought this for my wife at one of the booths at the State Fair, ever since she&#x27;s loved it and was glad to see it selling on Amazon since we don&#x27;t always go to the Fair. She uses it daily. Free from harmulal chemicals..etc</li>
            <li> It works nicely for lightning stretch marks and made my hair feel soft.</li>
            <li> The item shipped to me was not what was advertised. When I received my order, it was liquid (thanks to the Texas heat), in a plastic tub in a plastic bag. Some of the butter had seeped out, and before I opened the package, I weighed it. With the plastic tub, bag, and liquid, it was 13 ounces. After it cooled and hardened, it was yellow, nasty-looking, and it stinks really bad. I also tried a little of it on my hands, and it&#x27;s really greasy. Gross.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It has helped my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Very nice shea butter! I use this daily after a shower and bath. Since it is hot, I only use a thin spread of shea butter to keep from sweating too much. I have a few acne scars on different parts of my body, and I heard and read that the shea butter helps lighten those areas. It is a bit too early to see any physical changes since I had just brought this product. So far, the butter easily melt into your skin and it has a nice light nutty smell to it. I had also use this in my hair also as a conditioner to soften my new growth and it leaves my hair feeling soft! I&#x27;ll keep up with an update.</li>
            <li> I ordered this from the amazon seller sheaandmoredepot. I was very pleased with the shipping time and the product itself. I would have given this 5 stars except for the product did not come in a plastic tub or jar - it came in a ziplock bag. That&#x27;s just a little inconvenient. I suppose it may work for some but I wish this was expressed in the details. But I would definitely purchase again, might use one of my old cocoa butter tubs and put it in there. Product was smooth when rubbed into skin. It was not grainy or gritty. I&#x27;m 7 months pregnant and I love shea and cocoa butter but most that I found locally are all mixed with a whole bunch of nonsense so getting the unrefined raw version was a necessity for me. My skin has been very sensitive (A bandaid worn for one day gave me dry patches!!) so to have this natural product just a click away is a great relief. :)</li>
            <li> awesome lasted forever</li>
            <li> Greatest thing for uneven skin tone. Use too much though and it dries your skin out and makes it worst. I use it for body oil mixtures, facial moisturizer, and lip balm. I&#x27;ve had it for a long time and it&#x27;s no where near empty. I recommend to anyone, but especially those with excema.</li>
            <li> Rich, creamy, smooth shea butter!!! Good quality REAL ivory shea from NATURAL-COSMETICS, but my only disappointment was that it was sent in a plastic bag! Messy, but I&#x27;m thankful it wasn&#x27;t hot out when it was delivered! For people wondering the difference, \\&quot;ivory\\&quot; shea butter is real, unrefined shea butter. The yellow is African butter, but still very moisturizing. \\&quot;White\\&quot; is refined/unscented. Shea butter has a comedogenic (pore clogging) rating of \\&quot;0\\&quot; so won&#x27;t clog your pores. This makes it an AMAZING rich, safe moisturizer for your skin! I&#x27;ve just started using it for my face, and I can say this past week, my skin has been brighter, more supple, and even my sebum production in my T-zone has significantly lowered. I am so OVER paying for over-priced lotions... hooray for shea! Oh, and by the way, APPRECIATE our African sisters who make this -- it&#x27;s tough work! Here&#x27;s a you-tube video that&#x27;s been broadcast in Mali to help educate women on how to make better shea: [...]</li>
            <li> When it arrived there was a crack in the plastic packaging it came in. I was surprised how grainy it was. I expected it to be hard, yet smooth to the touch with the warmth of your hand. It still seemed to work well. Moisturized great, and I saw a reduction of my hyperpigmentation due to pregnancy acne. I really like the Shea butter but will probably not order from this company again.</li>
            <li> kids don&#x27;t like the smell of the raw shea butter, but hey, their skin is nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> OH SHEA BUTTER WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL OF MY LIFE? I HAVE THIS IN MY BED WITH ME AND I CANT STOP RUBBING THIS ON ME EVEN THOUGH MY SKIN IS STILL MOISTURIZED FROM THE FIRST APPLICATION.OH YEAH AND THE ZIPLOCK BAG WHO CARES,I DON&#x27;T CARE HOW YOU GET HERE, JUST GET HERE IF YOU CANNNNNNNN.LOL</li>
            <li> I came across African Shea Butter at a local Ethnic Festival.  Took it home and really liked it.  Than I ran out and was glad to find it through Amazon.  Don&#x27;t let the packaging put you off, it looks like a tub of butter.  I use if frequently for dry skin, after a shower, and when my legs hurt.  It&#x27;s great stuff and natural, too. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly as described. I used it in my homemade body butter. I love the way it makes my skin feel! Go ahead and purchase it!</li>
            <li> I love this natural shea butter &amp; how soft it makes my skin.  I have been using it all summer, as a moisturizer all over my body, as an SPF, and as a sun-burn soother.  It&#x27;s been great &amp; I will never go back to chemical &amp;#34;lotions&amp;#34; again.</li>
            <li> I used the raw Shea butter mixed with 100% Coconut Oil.  With hand held mixer whipped it up to like a butter.  Then applied to my natural hair and it did the job well.  Also use it to my dry skin and my skin feels moist all day.  I would recommend this Shea butter for hair and skin.  It moisturizers mine very well!</li>
            <li> This is suppose to be raw shea butter , however when it arrived it is clearly African butter as natural shea butter (which is what it is advertised as) is ivory and African butter is yellow.  It is also more of a cream then shea butter which tends to break up more.</li>
            <li> Excellent choice for Shea butter. I will be using this product to make home made hand and face creams, as well as other body and skin care products.  It&#x27;s organic and raw.  Perfect for what I will need it for.</li>
            <li> I was looking for the shea  butter to white because that is what the picture showed since it came yellow I could have gotten the regular shea butter</li>
            <li> I needed this and now i can produce my own creations because of Amazon anything container or natural ingredient i can find right here....No problem.</li>
            <li> I have used this for softening rougher skin (elbows, knees, feet), conditioning my locs (makes a great sealant), and I&#x27;ve incorporated into recipes for soap.  The pure, unrefined shea butter is the best.  Still has all the nutrients and if you find it hard and stiff to work with, melt it in a pan on low heat and mix with whatever you like (i like to use jojoba and coconut oil), and refrigerate to help firm it up again.  After that, it is pretty soft and has a a whipped consistency, making it easy to use for hair or skin or mixing into other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this 100%!</li>
            <li> I bought this to make my own lotion instead of buying lotion from the store. I love everything that I have bought so far.</li>
            <li> The shea butter arrived in a timely manner.  It actually came sooner than I was expecting. My shea butter arrived in a foil bag. The shea butter was wrapped in plastic wrap within the sealed foil bag. It was divided into 2 8oz. sections. I also ordered raw cocoa butter and jojoba oil. I made my own skin cream with the shea butter, cocoa butter, jojoba oil, olive oil, coconut oil and vitamin E oil. First of all the shea butter  by itself was soft and rubbed easily and smoothly on my skin. The smell is... um- I call it \\&quot;smoky-nutty.\\&quot;  It isn&#x27;t the worst smell. It isn&#x27;t the best smell.  When I rubbed it into my skin I barely smelled it. When I melted the cocoa butter in it- It created a nice scent. I whipped it/hand mixed it with the cocoa butter and oils that I mentioned until it became a thick cream. I actually was hoping to make it like a mousse but I soon realized that it doesn&#x27;t remain very \\&quot;moussy.\\&quot; It becomes more firm like soap. It becomes firm like soap BUT- IT MELTS WITH THE GREATEST OF EASE. It&#x27;s like- once it hits your skin- it just melts like butter. I guess because it is butter.... I love the stuff! It makes and keeps my skin soft &amp; supple. I slather it on my entire body once and my skin STAYS soft, hydrated and supple ALL DAY until my next bath/shower.  I also smoothe it over my face before I put on my concealer and my concealer just smoothes on flawlessly. I recommend shea butter for everyone and if you&#x27;re worried about the smell- just mix in a natural fragrant oil. I will always be a fan of shea butter and I already have the same shea butter from the same company on my wish list for future purchases. This supply might last me a while because I mixed it with a pound of cocoa butter and the oils that I mentioned and that filled one 4 cup pyrex container, one 12 oz. container that used to hold Blue magic hair conditioner AND it almost filled the 16oz. container that the cocoa butter came in (It&#x27;s in soft chunks but if I melt it down- it might be a littleless than half of the container.) I am using my supply from the cocoa butter container first. A little goes a  long way because it melts so superbly.  I&#x27;d bet that I created at least 2 months worth of mixture. It is a great investment. Shea butter is an awesome body butter. *I am LC from NC.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**EDIT** I described the texture of my mixture as firm soap but to be more accurate- the texture is more like CRISCO. It&#x27;s soft and chunky and melts like butter.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the quality of this product.&lt;br /&gt;Good Shea Butter is invaluable, I have no regrets!</li>
            <li> This was the first shea butter product I bought. It arrived looking just like the pictures with a faint but pleasant smell. I used it in making lotion for myself and friends. Great product!</li>
            <li> I heat up 2 tablespoons in my oil candle holder just before I shower. I put on gloves and oil my scalp with the warm oil.&lt;br /&gt;Remove gloves and do my whole body, I do not dry off the oil and water add moisture.</li>
            <li> Very cool product and magnificence has benefited from a lot in the practical field and wish you more time and tender Thanking you</li>
            <li> I have purchased this on several occasions and use it religiously on my feet and hands. It keeps them both soft and, once rubbed in, is not greasy. I will continue to purchase and use as it works much better for than any commercial product for my dry skin. Deducted one star because on one occasion it arrived somewhat grainy, an indication it had melted and reset, most likely a result of storage in high temperatures. This did not affect usability as the granules melted away with a little extra rubbing.</li>
            <li> I really love Shea butter.  It is perfect when I shower to put it on my face and neck.  A little greasy for a time, then absorbed into the skin, it helps to combat dry wrinkles worsened by living in a dry climate.  It seems to be a healing product.</li>
            <li> A little bit grainy until you melt it down in your hands.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that has helped very dry skin, plus it is great for muscle rubs, and I use on my dogs along with tinctures for natural products for them.  I have been using this product now for over a yr. Hate to run out.</li>
            <li> The package came just as I intended it to be. The Shea Butter was Ivory, a little lumpy yet soft and full of moisture. The container it is held in is pretty durable.... no cracks or breakage was found. Lastly, the delivery was fast... the package came within a day or two from ordering it. Very Pleased and Excited!</li>
            <li> This stuff is yellow and grainy/crumbly in texture, unlike the creamy white shea butter I&#x27;ve gotten from a reputable source. It behaves differently in cold process soap, and doesn&#x27;t feel the same when applied to my skin, so I won&#x27;t even try it in my body butter, lip balm and salves. It may work OK as a moisturizer, but I&#x27;m wary because this is NOT the real deal.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time, and was as represented.  It was a great value buy. We highly recommend it in place of store versions of the product..</li>
            <li> This is probably the best Shea butter that i have bought. This mixes really smooth and buttery. It also doesn&#x27;t leave any white stuff in my hair, i am not totally sure if this is because of the Shea butter or the change in the combination of products that i use in my hair. Whatever the case may be I am satisfied with his product.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Works for all of my Essential Oil creams without being too oily!</li>
            <li> wow where do i start, let me see, my hair loves it, and it&#x27;s great for other things also. The label does not lie. 11O% SATISFACTORY!</li>
            <li> I was first exposed to pure, raw African shea butter earlier this summer at the DelMar Fair -- and liked what I heard about its medicinal and hydrating qualities -- but I did NOT like the price for these tiny little jars the guy was selling!  So -- being the savvy internet shopper I am, I decided to do my own research online to learn more about the product, what to look for and price points for what was available to purchase.  This African shea butter happened to be offered by amazon as an add-on -- meaning, if I made a minimum $25 qualified purchase, I could add this product, which would have been very expensive to ship by itself due to its point of origin.  I&#x27;d read that some shea butter has a very noticeable, earthy smell because it is only filtered for impurities, but not refined to cosmetic grade; that&#x27;s definitely the case with this product -- and when I first opened the container and scooped out a tiny thumbnail&#x27;s worth of the butter to warm and emulsify it between my palms and then apply it to my feet and hands, I was not sure at that point if I could make peace with that smell... It wasn&#x27;t offensive: but it was distinct and not in any way perfumey.  The long and short of it is, it&#x27;s been a couple weeks now, and I am applying the product every night not only to my hands and feet, but also to my face and neck: and to be honest, not only is the smell a non-issue, I am so pleased with how soft and fresh my face feels in the morning when I awake, I intend to continue using this stuff for a long time...which, incidentally, will take a loooooong time, because it doesn&#x27;t take much to moisturize my entire face, lips and neck -- so this 1# tub of shea butter (which, BTW, never expires in terms of its inherent beneficial qualities) will last me a while.  I&#x27;m a convert.  No more expensive anti-aging treatments (that don&#x27;t work) for me.  I&#x27;m goin&#x27; natural : )</li>
            <li> This is a great product, the only negative thing I have to say about it is that after about 6 months in the container,  it starts to have a burnt type smell, however even in that time period, it still works great if you can put up with the smell, I just put it on a upper lip rash &amp; it went away after a day or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li> My ma uses these to help heal the stasis ulcers on her ankles. They work wonderfully and keep her skin soft. She doesn&#x27;t like that it still smells, but raves about its usefulness.</li>
            <li> White and semi creamy, lowish melting point as expected from shea butter. Ivory and no coloring. Perfect to use alone or to be whipped into body butters. The price is reasonable and I&#x27;d order again.</li>
            <li> The quality of this product has changed greatly..The texture has changed it&#x27;s more granular, instead of the smoothe texture it omce once had. It feels like dry sand. I am not happy with this purchase at all ):.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with purchase.  I have eczema and this has significantly improved my skin.  I definitely have less itching.  This was noticeable upon use after two days.  Will purchase in the near future.</li>
            <li> There was no smell (except a slight nuttiness) the first two nights I used this. After 5 days, I noticed that off-nutty smell others had commented on. I added ~ 1 drop of lavender oil per ounce of this ivory shea butter to apply to face at night (that requires warming of some sort to them stir to mix).  No breakouts, and I have been applying to my face, hands, and neck 10 of the last 14 nights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time, I will keep the bulk of the product refrigerated as soon as I take my first few ounces out (and in between uses of course as I usually do) to slow the minute deterioration that must be producing the slightly off smell.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I love how it smells and I love how it feels when applied. I will be a return customer for sure!</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is great! I use it for my daughter&#x27;s skin and hair who has eczema and it keeps her skin beautiful and moisturized all day. The package was delivered ahead of its scheduled time and was sealed tightly in the container it came in. This is a great product and I would recommend it for anyone looking for a good natural moisturizer. I will definitely be a returning costumer in the near future!</li>
            <li> I would consider using this product 100 times over for a business, personal use etc. Its soft, non grainy and whips like a milk shake. Also it doesnt have that strong nutty smell that often times over power even essential oils. I just wish they sold it in larger containers</li>
            <li> Ok i use shea butter on a daily basis for my skin disorder and let me tell you the this shea better is one of the best ive ever had. The price was good and the shipping was fast.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy my shea from Natural Cosmetics. Thanks</li>
            <li> Thank you Natural Cosmetics for your prompt service and for selling 100 % pure African Shea Butter, not Shea Butter cut with mystery ingredients, as I have received  from other vendors.  I have many sensitivities and allergies to all kinds of product additives and need to know exactly what it is that I am using so that I don&#x27;t have a skin reaction.  I also have asthma and am bothered by highly perfumed products.  I have spent years searching for make-ups, soaps and lotions just to find out that they are eventually discontinued or changed in some way.  I like this Shea Butter because it is all natural.  I was so happy to get my order.  The first thing I did was open the bag and take a deep whiff.  I love the smell of real Shea Butter.  Unlike most people, I don&#x27;t melt it and mix other oils or scents with it, I just use it right out of the bag.  I find that, over night, it will heal cuts from winter dry skin on my hands and knuckles.  Any kind of skin irritation I have applied it to has either greatly decreased or healed by the next day.  I have very dry skin and the Shea Butter locks in the moisture and keeps my skin smooth and soft all winter long.  I use it before going out into the freezing winter weather on my face and hands.  It prevents wind burn and chapping.  This is something that I can&#x27;t live without.  Please never change the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> I went to Africa about 2 years ago on vacation and was introduced to Shea butter. When I come back home I had a head time finding good real African Shea butter. I tried amazon and with some luck I discovered Natural Cosmetics. There Shea butter is exactly the same as I was getting in Africa. No need to look around any more.  For the rest of my life I will buy from Natural Cosmetics.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I can see a big difference in the health of my skin after just a week of using it. I will be purchasing again</li>
            <li> It is grainy and a poor quality product. I was not pleased and do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> The picture shows a tub, but I got it wrapped in plastic. otherwise good product -very strong smell But dissipates after a while.</li>
            <li> For the reviewers who didn&#x27;t like that it came in a plastic bag (which is not uncommon among shea butter retailers): it now comes in a plastic jar. This made it easy for me to scrape it out with my rubber spatula to make my body butter mixes. Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Product is great for stretch marks! My co-worker uses it on her psoriasis and it&#x27;s almost totally cleared up on her hands and elbows. It&#x27;s a great product, I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone looking for healthier, better looking skin.</li>
            <li> I am very upset with this product. It was a bright yellow color. They put a label on the ziplock bags it came in calling it yellow shea butter. I guess they figure someone stupid wouldn&#x27;t know the difference. This is not real shea butter, shea butter can only be off white or ivory. It can range from light to dark ivory with a slight green hue but it can never be yellow. If it is yellow it is not shea butter it is from a different type of tree in Africa. The smell has a slight nutty smell but nothing like real shea butter. Check u-tube for a video called Shea butter 102; yellow shea butter. It explains how this is referred to in Africa as african butter. This is not what I ordered and this is not the same product shown in there pictures.</li>
            <li> I bought this to make my own whipped shea butter and it worked great. Nutty scent isn&#x27;t too strong and the color is pale yellow. The product came in a bag; plastic and aluminum-ish. I melted it with a carrier oil (grapeseed) in a pyrex over heated water, cooled it, then whipped it with a hand-mixer together with an essential oil (ylang-ylang). It made a ton of whipped shea butter! Roughly 32 oz. Great stuff here.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is really grainy compared to other ones I&#x27;ve bought before.</li>
            <li> My friend at work told me about this product my skin was cracking at the time and no other creams had helped with the problem. When I put it my hands it immediately worked and made my hands soooo smooth! It&#x27;s incredible! I also have a couple of stretch marks on my body as well I applied the Shea butter and after a week they have started to clear. I keep applying till this day! Would definitly recommend to everyone!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used shea butter in the past that looked like this packaging. It was raw, natural shea butter as well, and I thought this was the same. This shea butter came in clumps, and the smell was disgusting. I couldn&#x27;t stand putting it on my skin, and well, it was a waste of my money. So sorry to write a bad review.</li>
            <li> itching stops, period. Humectant not greasy. Easily absorbed by the skin.&lt;br /&gt;My itching stops 90 percent with only a few days of use.</li>
            <li> I ordered based on this item stating it was 16 ounces. I received 14.75 ounces. No excuse for misrepresenting the amount being sold.&lt;br /&gt;The shea butter itself is nice, ivory toned and pleasant. Truly, I think 14.75 ounces for $10.99 (shipped!) is a very fair price. It&#x27;s just that I don&#x27;t appreciate being shorted on a promised amount of product.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical that this would be the ivory colored Shea Butter, but I was pleasantly suprised that it was. I have ordered African Shea Butter Pure Raw Unrefined online before and it was the yellow one. So, I am happy with it. I use it on my daughter and myself and it makes our hair soft and I can see the difference in the growth. Great product! Will purchase again..</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best and only thing that works and keeps my feet smooth. Magic cream, seriously. Works magic on any dry area of your body.</li>
            <li> Product that does not quite</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it because it wasn&#x27;t as good as the one I used before.Because it was not seal I don&#x27;t trust it.</li>
            <li> Was exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> Amazing amazing amazing in just 3 days my wife notice good different smooth skin and also brighter.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll order more for my mom and sis</li>
            <li> A big mustard colored yellow blob of smelly grease. Really, the smell was nauseating. I didn&#x27;t even try to return, just tossed it. I did not even want to bother with anyone who would sell something so awful. Looked nothing like the picture and the smell was unbelievably bad and the texture was like greasy play doh. I&#x27;m buying some from a more reputable source and you should too.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful! I have not tried it on my hair yet but I am planning on doing that tomorrow.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 of these and while they didn&#x27;t come in plastic containers, I didn&#x27;t mind the packaging. They were very secure in their own airtight bags, with a second layer of plastic wrap inside. NOT A ZIPLOC BAG. I ordered them from the fulfillment center so they looked pretty professional. The shea butter was a bit on the hard side, but I figured it was like that from being shaped into the blocks. I love shea butter, I would order from this seller again.</li>
            <li> The product came exactly when it was supposed to. Love this product. I plan on ordering more, it is a great product (great quality).</li>
            <li> All I can say I&#x27;m buying more African Shea Butter  it is good for the hair, nails and body. I love it!</li>
            <li> This product is great.  It has a smooth consistency and came in a tub unlike other reviews which stated that it came in a plastic bag.  Also, the smell is not overwhelming. The only reason why I don&#x27;t love it is not because of the product per se, but because of the consistency of raw, unrefined shea butter itself.  More specifically, it is hard to rub into the skin initially.  However, at night, I take out some and leave it on a plastic bag and leave it at room temperature so by the morning, it is smooth enough to just rub into the skin.  Would most definitely buy again from this seller.</li>
            <li> I got out of the lotion game the day I found shea butter 3 years ago.  If you&#x27;ve never  used shea, its got a natural smell, thick in texture and not greasy, unlike petro products.  Good for hair, skin and face if you don&#x27;t have oily skin.  Better than sun block for people of color and lasts all day as a moisturizer.  Our baby has eczema and shea, paired with Dream Cream and Dream soap from Lush have made the problem history.  We use the shea in her hair too. I am more fond of the white shea like this product, than the yellow colored ones you might find here or elsewhere.  It smells different and funkier, but not stinky and it can be gritty. Never had a problem with the white.&lt;br /&gt;Tip*&lt;br /&gt;Melt shea in a pot and add your favorite essential oils (100 drops per 16 oz. shea) can make the smell more to your liking or specific to your taste and style.  I use lavender in mine and have used tea tree in the past. $10 is the standard for 16 oz. Cheaper won&#x27;t mean bad product, but read reviews to ensure the seller sells to spec weight.  Some say 16 and are 13.  This seller has no such issue or reviews and the price was comparable.</li>
            <li> Bought this as an ingredient for a homemade lip balm recipe. Worked well. No issues recommending this to others for same purpose.</li>
            <li> this butter is not to greasy and smells nice - not overpowering - so i can use it anytime - will buy again.</li>
            <li> I am African, and u can attest that this is a pretty good pure Shea Butter. I will definitely  buy it again.</li>
            <li> MY recipe called for shea butter,,,i choice your, and was glad,,,,love work with it and oils.  thanks</li>
            <li> I use it in my recipe for homemade chapstick and body butter!</li>
            <li> Once you use this, all store Shea Butters will seem like crap. I love the price and I love the quality. I use this everyday before I go outside, I use it when I get out of the shower on my wet hair (I don&#x27;t even need conditioner anymore and I have super long hair), I use it on my scars so they go away faster. I use it as a lip balm, on my lashes so they grow faster too. I don&#x27;t know I just love this product a lot and I recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> this product was very grainy, it did turn to oil when its rubbed together but it wouldnt soak into my skin and ontop of everything it had a horrible fake plastic smell.</li>
            <li> This has a nice smooth consistency. My only complaint would be the packaging. The inner liner came apart and stuck to the butter. But the product is much nicer than the last, similar, product I bought.</li>
            <li> Was ok just not&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;m used to, would recommend,not the same as what I usually get though.  Slightly cheaper than some more than others</li>
            <li> I made a mistake and ordered from someone else and it was grainy.  I will order again for my next batch.  Great product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Not what is pictured. I received an item that is the color of mustard and has been whipped. Package even has a label that says whipped Shea butter, not like the label in the pictures. The seller was DeValley!</li>
            <li> I love Shea Butter especially the beige one.  I mix with other butters and essential oils and use on my natural hair an skin.  Great deal for the money and I will order more when necessary .  It really last a long time.</li>
            <li> A little gritty but doesn&#x27;t bother me. I think of it as an exfoliant:).  The grit dissolves as its rubbed in.  It&#x27;s my first time making lotion so maybe I missed a step</li>
            <li> Items were as described and received promptly...Thank you!</li>
            <li> The only flaw is that it was grainy beyond belief, which means it was exposed to heat. But that didn&#x27;t stop the incredible moisturizing effect of the butter, it is probably the only product I&#x27;ve used which does not give me a dry itchy face in the morning. That and my face was considerably clearer! As a first-time user, shea butter is definitely one I&#x27;m going to stick to regularly especially since it lasts a long time. I will use it to the end despite the ultra-grainy flaw.    Other praises are the packaging and arriving on time!    I sort of want to add, the grainyness is caused by heating (may be caused by shipping itself,) which causes the Shea butter to lose quality and some of its important properties. Can say I was slightly sad since it called for melting it down again for ease of use. Then again, I did notice that each and every chunk I&#x27;ve melted came across at least one speck of red glitter and another impurity. Where&#x27;d the sparkly come from?    Great product! Great service. Full 5, otherwise 4.5 stars for that little detail.</li>
            <li> If you  have any issues with dry skin, this is the product to use. Also, if you have found your skin sensitive to harsh ingredients, you may want to try this. I used it on my daughter when she was a baby and have been using it since (22 yrs). The pure raw shea butter is a bit chunky, so for a smoother texture, you may want to go with a more refined shea butter.</li>
            <li> Shea Butter has some great properties for soapmaking.  this product came in a convenient size and is raw and unrefined so that all the really good aspects of it are still intact.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from scalp psoriasis for years and was tired of trying to find different shampoos for relief. I massage this stuff into my scalp and get instant, lasting relief. I&#x27;m a male with short hair so it&#x27;s easy, also works great for styling.</li>
            <li> My hands and cuticles are very dry. This is a rich, emollient product. You can use it everywhere you have dry patches.</li>
            <li> I bought this shea butter because I needed to make some body butter and diy deordarant. The product arrived in time and it came in a container just like the one in the picture. The smell is nutty but I don&#x27;t mind the smell, I prefer this smell over cocoa butter. I can&#x27;t wait to use this for more projects! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who needs this ingredient for a DIY project!</li>
            <li> Shea butter works, but you&#x27;ll have to mix this with other stuff like olive oil, etc. I used it for my hair, but found something I like better as this helped my hair a lot, but not with my scalp issues. It is great for dry patchy skin &amp; dark spots.</li>
            <li> I use it every day on my skin, and feet. It doesn&#x27;t really have a scent so i put very little scented lotion over it. Keeps everything hydrated plus its the first time my husband commented on how soft my skin is now, so yea I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, im updating my review, and i hate this product. Its not the same thing like i ordered last time. This stuff is already mixed, its yellow the texture is whipped feeling, and smells weird. Its definitely no longer raw and its refined. I ended up returning it and luckily found real shea butter afterwards.</li>
            <li> It smells really bad and it is a thick odd consistency...</li>
            <li> it does wonders for my dry feet, mostly in winter months. love it,  i will buy it again for sure,</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful skin softener and moisturizer which I use to treat my feet.  Apply after soaking feet for treating dry skin.  Very effective.</li>
            <li> I use this for lip balm and lotion that i mix with coconut oil and cocoa butter. It&#x27;s a good quality product.</li>
            <li> The shea butter is perfect - the container arrived broken so the lid doesn&#x27;t stay attached now</li>
            <li> Daughter loves it and smell great.</li>
            <li> I love it, smells so good</li>
            <li> best moisturizer i have found to date and i don&#x27;t feel like i need to look any further! i use it for me and for my son who has exema and very dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, it has little bit smell but I does a great job of keeping your skin like velvet especially during winter season. I used the filtered ivory cream before but this one is better.</li>
            <li> This is good shea butter. I use it on my very flaky, dry skin after showering. I apply it before going to bed on my hands because i have eczema, and on any dry spots on my face. It works great to moisturize!</li>
            <li> I mixed it with some oils and cocoa butter, created a body cream, and my body is super soft, feels great.</li>
            <li> If you got the yellow butter, then you got kpangnan butter (from the kpangnan tree), which is another tree from the African rainforest. It is very similar to shea butter (from the shea tree) and has fantastic results on skin, just like shea. [...]&lt;br /&gt;It is characterized, among other things, by its yellow-ish colour. Because kpangnan is not widely known, it is often, mislabelled as shea. I&#x27;ve often encountered this. However, it is a great skin product as well. Shoulder to shoulder with shea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I learned about this product while doing research for a friend that had just come back from Africa and kept raving about the yellow shea butter :) She now knows it&#x27;s not shea, but it&#x27;s a great skin product under any name and she loves it! She has tried shea as well and favours this one. I have used it myself and was not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just don&#x27;t understand why they don&#x27;t write the proper name on the butter. It&#x27;s as if they think North americans only understand shea and nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While we are at it, another great skin product out of Africa is baobab oil. Another great find for me :) Amazon carries this as well, great job, amazon.</li>
            <li> Deep ivory colour, very slight nutty odour. It is a bit grainy but not too noticeably, becomes more liquid when rubbed into skin and appears to be the real deal.</li>
            <li> This may be shea butter but I have to question whether or not it is pure. Shea butter is naturally white or creamy to ivory colored. This is yellow. The yellow color means it has been dyed. I don&#x27;t want my shea butter dyed. I think it&#x27;s a little false to list this as &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; if dye has been added.</li>
            <li> Far exceeded my expectations. I&#x27;ve bought Shae butter before but this is just awesome. I have dry skin and I&#x27;m pregnant, usually I have to add olive oil to my Shae butter but this is easier to use and I love the way it makes my skin and natural hair look and feel.</li>
            <li> The product did what it said, moisturize and protect.  It feels good making the skin appear supple and feel soft.</li>
            <li> it is just the best overall moisturizer to use.  i wasn&#x27;t thrilled about the texture of this one...in the past, when i had shea butter, i had left it in my car in the summer, adn it melted.  i brought it inside and it firmed back up, but it was of a chunky consistency.  that is what this texture reminds me of.  like it slightly melted and was refirmed.  but it still does the job, don&#x27;t get me wrong.  that&#x27;s why it gets 4 stars, though, insted of 5.</li>
            <li> I believe this works even better than the yellow kind....wish I would&#x27;ve know about this during my teenage years:)</li>
            <li> Love this shea butter!  We use it when we&#x27;re making skin/hair balms.  It has tons of uses and this particular brand is very nice.  It is exactly as it&#x27;s advertised. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this item for Christmas for a gift that I was making. It&#x27;s a fairly large container, and there&#x27;s a lot of product inside. The only reason that I gave it four stars was because of how hard it was to get the shea butter out, and the smell. But that&#x27;s to be expected of the product, and some people might like the scent of it. It&#x27;s a personal opinion really. Very moisturizing, and I ended up using the rest of it for some of my eczema. It faded away after a few days of using this, so I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a very nice product to have around the house!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it is packaged in a plastic bag, but I&#x27;m fine with that.&lt;br /&gt;I transferred it into a plastic tub I had from another container of shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;The quality is very good, and I will buy it again from this company.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was quick, too!</li>
            <li> Ok so I got my shea butter that I was so anxious to get and..... opened the box and it was in a lil tub but it was all chopped up into lil clumps and it almost smells like what I have been smelling in the beauty supply stores which is sickining to my stomach! I will not be ordering anymore from these people!!! DISGUSTED! Hope it workks for my shea mostiure mix and not leave the lumps n clumps in it!!! smh #PISSEDBEYONDPISSTIVITY!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this Shea butter. It &#x27;s easy to mix and blends well.</li>
            <li> The Shea Butter is a great source of nutrition for the skin. There is nothing I like better then a rich and natural skin product .</li>
            <li> Love this! Amazing for my skin and hair!</li>
            <li> hoping this will help my sons eczema and my dry skin. its soft the smell is something to get use too but i will buy more</li>
