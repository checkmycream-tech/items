            <li>but thru were still awesome</li>
            <li>Awesome item, thank you!!</li>
            <li>they stick to nail polish and they look great with every color!  </li>
            <li>excellent product I recommend</li>
            <li>But they are great quality and beautiful.</li>
            <li>Happy with it.</li>
            <li>These are great for nail art.</li>
            <li>Great quality, good amount.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t think they would look good</li>
            <li>this product was good and as advertised.</li>
            <li>these accessories are awesomely cute!</li>
            <li>but I love it!</li>
            <li>This product is super easy to use and it looks great.</li>
            <li>Liked it a lot.. very nice single pieces.. and very nice shape for the nails..</li>
            <li>so I can get my desired thickness and a lot more</li>
            <li>THEY ARE STILL CUTE</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>nonetheless, the fruits are sooooo cute.</li>
            <li>they get all staticky in there and stick to the sliding top...</li>
            <li>love using the cane slices for our nails and my polymer clay projects.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-A :)</li>
            <li>Very nice and cute, some of the fruits were a bit distorted, but are very true to form, I like them very much</li>
            <li>the wheel isn&#x27;t that great but other then that its a great product</li>
            <li>These shipped quickly and they are so cute!</li>
            <li>easy to apply (but don&#x27;t use super glue on display plastic nails, the edges will curl and become brittle)&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>but it is perfect for the small nails</li>
            <li>very cute long as you take the time to make sure the edges don&#x27;t curl while drying</li>
            <li>and we enjoyed them so much.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery</li>
            <li>they chip off fast, but i do stuff  with my hands, so... overall, lovely purchase, arrived like 2 weeks before projected (?), nice variety of looks and colors...</li>
            <li>I only order this in the first place to see if I could really work with the fimo and if they looked good.</li>
            <li>Will make a good little stocking stuffer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d most likely order the fimo canes themselves with a fimo cutter</li>
            <li>Worth the money since they are very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>The little fruit slices are very cute</li>
            <li>Anyways, thanks for sending me this product.</li>
            <li>I really like this product me and my mom</li>
            <li>There where a couple of larger chunks that I was able to get a few more slices off of.</li>
            <li>It came as shown but with different cane slices - the blue,green and red, and bright red canes and banana were not included</li>
            <li>Some of the slices are a little thick, but the colors are excellent and vibrant.</li>
            <li>Most where sliced very thin which I like as they adhere to the nail better that way.</li>
            <li>The pieces were thin but looked good covered with acrylic.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>I use it very frequently.</li>
            <li>and I got the exact same product as seen in the picture</li>
            <li>I will buy more stuff from you store later down the road.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You get about 8 to 12 peices of each design which is not even ten to do a whole hand if you like.</li>
            <li>I would have liked the item to be described as to the size of the little plastic container, either in a measurement or as a comparison to say a half dollar or something.</li>
            <li>The decorations were a little mixed up but still fine.  </li>
            <li>I did count how many peices there were and there was slightly less then half of the 244 peices</li>
            <li>They showed up much quicker then expected.</li>
            <li>Most of The pieces are broken.</li>
            <li>You just have to be patient and let it dry COMPLETELY before doing anything.</li>
            <li>the little box is smaller than i expected, and it doesnt have many slices in each little compartment-</li>

            <li> This item arrived in time for Christmas 2013 after a long wait as it came from Hong Kong.  </li>
            <li> They are thin and small but cute.</li>
            <li> Also ordered several other shapes.</li>
            <li> but that is due to the tiny size of the pieces.</li>
            <li> but this item&#x27;s container was just so much smaller than expected due to no comparison of size of it in the description.</li>
            <li> the slices are a little mixed in their compartments</li>
            <li> None were broken either^_^ highly recommend</li>
            <li> I feel it was not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how few pieces look like they are in this little container even though the company lists 240 pieces of nail art</li>
            <li> only inconvenient is the wheel because the little pieces move all around and don&#x27;t stay in place..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to give negative reviews</li>
            <li> The wheel is very small but compatible.</li>
            <li> and they were REALLY thin, almost paper like, just not as flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have it a four because it came messed up and a lot of them were broken</li>
            <li> The colors were faded and I was not impressed with clay cane slices.</li>
            <li> oh one bad thing</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I&#x27;m on the fence with this product.&lt;br /&gt;When it arrived all of the pieces were mixed together, which isn&#x27;t a big deal to me, I just simply separated then myself.&lt;br /&gt;While doing that I looked at the pieces and they were REALLY thin, almost paper like, just not as flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t think they would look good but once I did a practice nail and put acrylic over them they actually looked nice.&lt;br /&gt;So for this product I&#x27;m on the fence. The pieces were thin but looked good covered with acrylic.&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion I&#x27;d most likely order the fimo canes themselves with a fimo cutter so I can get my desired thickness and a lot more product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ps I only order this in the first place to see if I could really work with the fimo and if they looked good.</li>
            <li> They are thin and small but cute. Worth the money since they are very inexpensive. Also ordered several other shapes.</li>
            <li> The picture above shows some cane slices there are. I did not receive the blue ones. The wheel is very small but compatible. Every time I turn the wheel cane slices fall out. Anyways, thanks for sending me this product. I use it very frequently.</li>
            <li> They came on time and were as advertised.  I got them for a girlfriend so what can I say.  She says she likes them.</li>
            <li> I did count how many peices there were and there was slightly less then half of the 244 peices it says that you receive! You get about 8 to 12 peices of each design which is not even ten to do a whole hand if you like. But they are great quality and beautiful.</li>
            <li> this product was good and as advertised. Happy with it. The decorations were a little mixed up but still fine.  Would order from this seller again.</li>
            <li> easy to apply (but don&#x27;t use super glue on display plastic nails, the edges will curl and become brittle)&lt;br /&gt;and very cute long as you take the time to make sure the edges don&#x27;t curl while drying</li>
            <li> The little fruit slices are very cute the only thing i didnt like were they were cut un evenly and some werebroken but thru were still awesome</li>
            <li> Awesome item, thank you!!</li>
            <li> There are not 240 pieces and it wasn&#x27;t what was pictured. Most of The pieces are broken. Buyers beware that you probably won&#x27;t get what is pictured.</li>
            <li> IT DOES NOT COME WITH THE FRUITS THAT ARE SHOWN IT COMES WITH DIFRENT ONES THEY ARE STILL CUTE BUT NOT THE SAME ONES!!!!</li>
            <li> I love it it came on time the wheel isn&#x27;t that great but other then that its a great product</li>
            <li> Very nice and cute, some of the fruits were a bit distorted, but are very true to form, I like them very much</li>
            <li> I purchased this item thinking it would look like the picture in color. The colors were faded and I was not impressed with clay cane slices. I feel it was not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have it a four because it came messed up and a lot of them were broken but it is perfect for the small nails</li>
            <li> i got these for my cousin and i to do our nails and we enjoyed them so much.  they stick to nail polish and they look great with every color!  these accessories are awesomely cute!</li>
            <li> the little box is smaller than i expected, and it doesnt have many slices in each little compartment- maybe around 15 each? nonetheless, the fruits are sooooo cute. they chip off fast, but i do stuff  with my hands, so... overall, lovely purchase, arrived like 2 weeks before projected (?), nice variety of looks and colors... (edit) oh one bad thing i forgot- the slices are a little mixed in their compartments cos they get all staticky in there and stick to the sliding top... that bugged me so i had to resort them.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought they would be but I love it!</li>
            <li> These shipped quickly and they are so cute! None were broken either^_^ highly recommend</li>

            <li> I really like this product me and my mom love using the cane slices for our nails and my polymer clay projects. I will buy more stuff from you store later down the road.&lt;br /&gt;-A :)</li>
            <li> It came as shown but with different cane slices - the blue,green and red, and bright red canes and banana were not included</li>

Will make a good little stocking stuffer.  I don&#x27;t like to give negative reviews but this item&#x27;s container was just so much smaller than expected due to no comparison of size of it in the description.</li>
            <li> Great quality, good amount. Some of the slices are a little thick, but the colors are excellent and vibrant. Get compliments every time I use them!</li>
            <li> They showed up much quicker then expected. I had them within 4 days of ordering. Most where sliced very thin which I like as they adhere to the nail better that way. There where a couple of larger chunks that I was able to get a few more slices off of.</li>
            <li> These are great for nail art. 4 star for misguiding for the size, merchant should tell upfront and compare the size with known object.</li>
            <li> At first they seem small and like there&#x27;s not a lot in there but I got a pack a year ago and still have a majority of the fimo art. This product is super easy to use and it looks great. You just have to be patient and let it dry COMPLETELY before doing anything.</li>
            <li> excellent product I recommend</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and I got the exact same product as seen in the picture</li>
