            <li>Somewhere along the way the top of the conditioner bottle loosened,</li>
            <li>I have heard many have also used moisture maniac for color treated hair with no problem.</li>
            <li>The conditioner leaves so many tangles in my hair</li>
            <li>The title says it all, cheap-ass Sauve is better than this stuff.</li>
            <li>so I can get something that is better quality.</li>
            <li>We are kindred spirits, I&#x27;m in love.</li>

            <li>I love the pumps.</li>
            <li>but I love how it smells and love how my hair feels after using this.  </li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>The smell is good- not too overwhelming, and the price was good for the amount you get in these giant bottles.</li>
            <li>I received the shampoo and conditioner as a gift a few months ago, and I had heard that TIGI had a great reputation, so I was quite happy with this.</li>
            <li>The shampoo left my mane clean and shiny (not to mention smelling awesome all day!</li>
            <li>It smells great and leaves my hair soft and my hair stays clean for three days!</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful but doesn&#x27;t moisturize my scalp as expected.</li>
            <li>nothing special about it that made it stick out more than any store bought shampoo I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>This stuff has the best citrus-y smell) , and the conditioner softened my damaged locks without making them greasy or weighed down.</li>
            <li>You see, I like my hair to look super healthy and to shine in the sun, this one does the job</li>
            <li>But again - it&#x27;s a fantastic shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I specifically bought the Self Absorbed and love it.  </li>
            <li>Definitely a great product that doesn&#x27;t weigh your do down  :)</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying myself more of this ASAP!</li>
            <li>I love that I only need less than a dime-size dollop for my whole head, it smells great and is rich and creamy!</li>
            <li>If anyone is wondering, Self Absorbed is for color treated hair.  </li>
            <li>Who wouldn&#x27;t be right?</li>
            <li>While I most definitely will purchase this product again-</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product - but that said, I will probably buy it somewhere else next time.  </li>
            <li>and I use it everyday because they are good.</li>
            <li>Because this bottle very watery like it is diluted</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It got here fast</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m a little too Self Absorbed, but I since I have met Bed Head (and a good flat iron)</li>
            <li>and I found a lovely gooey mess when I opened the box.  </li>
            <li>More than I expected ....!!!</li>
            <li>BUT I&#x27;ve tried another one of the pairs, the green ones, and I like that one so much better.</li>
            <li>but it was a royal mess to clean up!  </li>
            <li>My go-to shampoo that leaves your hair feeling amazing, with a subtle scent.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair really soft!</li>
            <li>it just a normal sizing issue with there not being enough</li>
            <li>typically buy this only at Costco because it is much cheaper getting it from there.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It was great service and product</li>
            <li> When I received the package the pump already had shampoo in it as if it had already been used? The Shampoo almost has a runny snot like feeling to it and works okay, nothing special about it that made it stick out more than any store bought shampoo I&#x27;ve used. The conditioner is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful but doesn&#x27;t moisturize my scalp as expected.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner! It smells great and leaves my hair soft and my hair stays clean for three days! The only issue I had is the fact that it spilled during shipment.  So I not only lost quite a bit of the conditioner but it was a royal mess to clean up!  While I most definitely will purchase this product again- I will not be getting it from amazon :(</li>
            <li> love this stuff I order it every year and will continue to do so in the future  after using this shampoo for 2 months or so  i change my rating to 2 stars.    Because this bottle very watery like it is diluted</li>
            <li> They are better than most shampoos and conditioners. . . and I use it everyday because they are good. BUT I&#x27;ve tried another one of the pairs, the green ones, and I like that one so much better. You see, I like my hair to look super healthy and to shine in the sun, this one does the job but there is room for improvement. I give it a B</li>
            <li> I use this with the satsuma body gel from the body shop.  Amazon also has it here.  I got the jumbo one.  This bed head shampoo and conditioner smells similar to the satsuma.  I also have very thick hair.  I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this duo from Costco on a whim and I am ever so glad.  My hair is the softest it has been in awhile.  I straighten it often and you can&#x27;t even tell.  Definitely a great product that doesn&#x27;t weigh your do down  :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product - but that said, I will probably buy it somewhere else next time.  It got here fast but the packaging leaves something to be desired.  Somewhere along the way the top of the conditioner bottle loosened, and I found a lovely gooey mess when I opened the box.  But again - it&#x27;s a fantastic shampoo.  I haven&#x27;t used anything else since discovering it a couple of years ago...</li>
            <li> If anyone is wondering, Self Absorbed is for color treated hair.  I have heard many have also used moisture maniac for color treated hair with no problem. I specifically bought the Self Absorbed and love it.  Makes my hair really soft!</li>
            <li> I am giving TIGI Bed Head Shampoo &amp; Conditioner a big FIVE STARS for economy and function! I love that I only need less than a dime-size dollop for my whole head, it smells great and is rich and creamy! These bottles last me about six months, if not longer! They leave my hair looking healthy, which is saying a lot since I&#x27;ve colored it for YEARS! I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked at the positive reviews. I hate both the shampoo and conditioner. I have to use a ton of shampoo to get any lather so I&#x27;m going through this bottle faster than any shampoo ever. The conditioner leaves so many tangles in my hair I often wonder if I forgot to use it. The title says it all, cheap-ass Sauve is better than this stuff. I can&#x27;t wait until it&#x27;s gone so I can get something that is better quality.</li>
            <li> not what is suppose to be in the bottles. It smells very different and doesn&#x27;t work as well</li>
            <li> What can I say about Bed Head. We are kindred spirits, I&#x27;m in love. Who wouldn&#x27;t be right? It is more expensive than some of the other Bed Head shampoo/conditioner sets, but #YOLO. Maybe I&#x27;m a little too Self Absorbed, but I since I have met Bed Head (and a good flat iron), I have a head of hair that, well hair models would be envious. The smell is intoxicating. I can&#x27;t keep my hands out of my hair! Thank you BED HEAD for changing my life.</li>
            <li> Love this product, but was disappointed that the shampoo pump dispenser was broken and some product spilled.  I  had another pump top, so I just used it.</li>
            <li> GAVE AS A GIFT. MY GRANDSON&#x27;S GIRLFRIEND ONLY USES THIS.. I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO GIVE HER., MY GRANDSON SAID SHE LOVE&#x27;S THIS AND NEEDS SOME MORE. SHE GIVES THIS PRODUCT 5 STARS.</li>
            <li> I really love Bed Head products its a very good product that does not leave my hair oily and it makes my hair so much healthier</li>
            <li> I received the shampoo and conditioner as a gift a few months ago, and I had heard that TIGI had a great reputation, so I was quite happy with this. Low and behold, I was not let down at all when I used the two! The shampoo left my mane clean and shiny (not to mention smelling awesome all day! This stuff has the best citrus-y smell) , and the conditioner softened my damaged locks without making them greasy or weighed down. Of course, being a college student I prefer buying more wallet-friendly products, but for the price, it works wonderfully! I will definitely be buying myself more of this ASAP!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years. Love it.</li>
            <li> Love the way the shampoo and conditioner make my hair feel- so much more healthy than a lot of others. The smell is good- not too overwhelming, and the price was good for the amount you get in these giant bottles. I love the pumps.</li>
            <li> More than I expected ....!!! Awesome price ...and product!!!</li>
            <li> My go-to shampoo that leaves your hair feeling amazing, with a subtle scent. These bottles will last you a year (if you&#x27;re a guy)! Easily the best bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> This is a splurge purchase.  It is really expensive shampoo but I love how it smells and love how my hair feels after using this.  My teenage daughter always asks for this shampoo because she loves it too.  I don&#x27;t buy it all the time because of the price but it is a great shampoo and conditioner that I love to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically buy this only at Costco because it is much cheaper getting it from there.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE this product.  The scent is wonderful!</li>
            <li> great deal but you will run out of conditioner... it just a normal sizing issue with there not being enough</li>
