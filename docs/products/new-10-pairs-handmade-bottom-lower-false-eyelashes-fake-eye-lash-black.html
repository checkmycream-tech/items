            <li>There cute and all</li>
            <li>The quality is okay.</li>
            <li>maybe you don&#x27;t know how to apply them right or just aren&#x27;t using good lash glue ?</li>
            <li>Over all they were pretty good .</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the exotic look it provides.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are light on the eye, look great, natural, and are easy to put on.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply</li>
            <li>If it does, easily remedied, however.</li>
            <li>They are easy to apply and they are light weight.</li>
            <li>I found them to be comfortable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the best looking false eyelashes, and it&#x27;s not particularly terrible for the price.</li>
            <li>The lashes came in pretty fast and they are nice for the price</li>
            <li>I loved them and would by them again for the same price.</li>
            <li>Go for it, as so many pairs for this price is unbelievable, and the quality is so good.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pretty straightforward as they are pictured.</li>
            <li>I liked them, but there too short.</li>
            <li>right ...</li>
            <li>Right ...</li>
            <li>Easy to use, may be trimmed to fit, easy to apply after a little practice.</li>
            <li>they were light weight and look very natural..</li>
            <li>Lashes look exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>Ok so ive waited weeks for these to be delivered only to receive them</li>
            <li>They are just a pair of regular top strip lashes.</li>
            <li>It gave the extra exotic look</li>
            <li>Overall, I was quite pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>, The First One Turned Out Pretty Good,But</li>
            <li>I actually ended up shifting the lashes by accident on a couple of pairs, so it&#x27;s a good thing there were ten!</li>
            <li>They are just not natural looking, or believable.</li>
            <li>That is what I did and it looks super natural.</li>
            <li>i love these hand made produce, very soft and natural, i can wear them to work every day with very natural looking.</li>
            <li>Well made lower eye lashes that really fills in the lash area of the eyes.  </li>
            <li>These are very unnatural if you use the whole thing.</li>
            <li>but it takes a bit to form them because they come in the box straight not curved .</li>
            <li>I really like how affordable it is also.</li>
            <li>They came in earlier than expected so that is good.</li>
            <li>i cut them in half or even more .</li>
            <li>I like that the strip is very flexible and clear.</li>
            <li>Im New</li>
            <li>I use a generous amount of lash glue, but the fact that they are straight and not curved like top lashes, it&#x27;s hard to apply them on.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;It is the same of the higher lashes</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t if it was because I didn&#x27;t use the right glue or didn&#x27;t put them on right, but they kept sticking straight out on one side and coming loose on the other.</li>
            <li>These are more like natural upper lashes that were flipped upside down the packaging.</li>
            <li>If you are Asian with little eyelashes, you can use these on your top eyelids.</li>
            <li>they look surprisingly natural.</li>
            <li>I am a 21 year old asian female with double eyelids and decently sized eyes.</li>
            <li>But if you slip off a couple hairs like I do and stick them individually on some parts of your bottom line, it will look natural.</li>
            <li>U might have to trim them down to avoid certain death to your eye lid.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to this, but I&#x27;ve tried to carefully apply them on but they won&#x27;t stick.</li>

            <li> When they came in the mail, the lashes were over 1/2&amp;#34; long in some places.</li>
            <li> Just be careful when handling or individual lashes might &amp;#34;spin&amp;#34; out of place.</li>
            <li> the price is too good and the product isn&#x27;t crap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;watched a long time to find these!</li>
            <li> Even though bottom eyelashes are harder to put on with long nails.</li>
            <li> The lashes are same space between hairs all the way down.</li>
            <li> They are just tooooooooooooo long to even try to pass them off as bottom lashes!!</li>
            <li> Took a while to arrive, but that was expected.</li>
            <li> Should not be advertised as bottom lashes because these are too long &amp; not very good quality.</li>
            <li> it took about two and a half weeks.</li>
            <li> Its been about a month and a half since ordered and still not here.</li>
            <li> These are way too long to be bottom lashes unless you want to look ridiculous.</li>
            <li> They difficult to handle &amp; didn&#x27;t looked natural.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money  </li>
            <li> And Looks Plain .</li>
            <li> I hate that the band is clear as opposed to being black, but I just apply black eyeliner and let it dry before I apply my bottom lashes.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know why people leave bad reviews</li>
            <li> These really aren&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> I think possibly i was sent the wrong pairs?</li>
            <li> The only problem I had was that the way they are packaged, they are difficult to take out as they are quite delicate.</li>
            <li> very dissapointed.. :(</li>
            <li> But I have an extremely hard time keeping it on.</li>
            <li> There really hard to put on.</li>
            <li> I cut both corners of each lash , this gave me a natural look.&lt;br /&gt;Not a bad deal for the price .</li>
            <li> Not good quality you can see the plastic were the eyelashes are glued</li>
            <li> It is so hard to find bottom lashes!</li>
            <li> They are poorly made and do not stay on.</li>
            <li> These bottom lower false lash did not meet my expectation.</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> Oh Also They Are  Very Thin</li>
            <li> They look redonkulously fake on my bottom lash less eyes, but it don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re too horribly made!</li>
            <li> you have to lie and take a bad reptution</li>
            <li> Im stuck with 30 pairs of awful lower false lashs!</li>
            <li> the quality  of all three sets was awful.</li>
            <li> Hated them!</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s not the best looking false eyelashes, and it&#x27;s not particularly terrible for the price. But I have an extremely hard time keeping it on.</li>
            <li> Well made lower eye lashes that really fills in the lash area of the eyes.  I thought the glue that holds them would be bothersome&lt;br /&gt;but I found them to be comfortable.</li>
            <li> I use a generous amount of lash glue, but the fact that they are straight and not curved like top lashes, it&#x27;s hard to apply them on. I&#x27;m new to this, but I&#x27;ve tried to carefully apply them on but they won&#x27;t stick.</li>
            <li> I am a 21 year old asian female with double eyelids and decently sized eyes. I wanted to try some bottom lashes to see if they would look good. These are very unnatural if you use the whole thing. But if you slip off a couple hairs like I do and stick them individually on some parts of your bottom line, it will look natural.</li>
            <li> I just got these in today! They came in earlier than expected so that is good. Lashes look exactly like the picture. I like them because they are much smaller for my bottom lashes. They are easy to apply and they are light weight. They also came with a free gift which I can use! :)</li>
            <li> b/C they were light weight and look very natural..I loved them and would by them again for the same price. lol&lt;br /&gt;p.s would also love to buy them in the color brown.</li>
            <li> Bought these because I want lower lashes. When they came in the mail, the lashes were over 1/2&amp;#34; long in some places. Could be used as uppers.. but I have uppers,  I needed bottom lashes. Save your money and buy elsewhere...</li>
            <li> These really aren&#x27;t bad. If the band was clear these would be perfect. I like the design of these they look surprisingly natural. U might have to trim them down to avoid certain death to your eye lid. All and all I recommend. C&#x27;mon the price is too good and the product isn&#x27;t crap.</li>
            <li> They look redonkulously fake on my bottom lash less eyes, but it don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re too horribly made! Easy to apply</li>
            <li> Easy to use, may be trimmed to fit, easy to apply after a little practice. Just be careful when handling or individual lashes might &amp;#34;spin&amp;#34; out of place. If it does, easily remedied, however.</li>
            <li> great fun look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;watched a long time to find these!</li>
            <li> Over all they were pretty good . I cut both corners of each lash , this gave me a natural look.&lt;br /&gt;Not a bad deal for the price .</li>
            <li> Ok so ive waited weeks for these to be delivered only to receive them and they aren&#x27;t even bottom lashes!!!! They are just a pair of regular top strip lashes. They are just tooooooooooooo long to even try to pass them off as bottom lashes!!</li>
            <li> These bottom lower false lash did not meet my expectation. They difficult to handle &amp; didn&#x27;t looked natural. I would not recommend them. Sorry</li>
            <li> Received these lashes promptly, immediately ordered more, because they are so good.&lt;br /&gt;They are light on the eye, look great, natural, and are easy to put on.  What else can you ask for.  The price is also excellent.  Go for it, as so many pairs for this price is unbelievable, and the quality is so good.  I love them.</li>
            <li> It is so hard to find bottom lashes! So when I saw these I couldn&#x27;t wait till he came in mail.. I hate that the band is clear as opposed to being black, but I just apply black eyeliner and let it dry before I apply my bottom lashes. They&#x27;re pretty straightforward as they are pictured.</li>
            <li> Not good quality you can see the plastic were the eyelashes are glued</li>
            <li> I love my bottom lashes they are even re useable if you take it off right ... It gave the extra exotic look i was looking for</li>
            <li> The lashes came in pretty fast and they are nice for the price but it takes a bit to form them because they come in the box straight not curved .</li>
            <li> because the payer lie to me it is not a bottom lash&lt;br /&gt;It is the same of the higher lashes&lt;br /&gt;Why you have to lie and take a bad reptution</li>
            <li> I liked them, but there too short. There really hard to put on. That&#x27;s the only reason why I didn&#x27;t like them. There cute and all but I couldn&#x27;t Put them on. And now there just sitting there until I do another attempt lol.</li>
            <li> The lashes i recieved looked nothing like they did in the picture.  I think possibly i was sent the wrong pairs?</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money  I brought 3 different types,the quality  of all three sets was awful. Im stuck with 30 pairs of awful lower false lashs!</li>
            <li> Took a while to arrive, but that was expected. The quality is okay. I tried them on but I don&#x27;t if it was because I didn&#x27;t use the right glue or didn&#x27;t put them on right, but they kept sticking straight out on one side and coming loose on the other. I will get a diff glue and give it another try. Still a good deal for the price!</li>
            <li> Overall, I was quite pleased with this purchase. They arrived sooner than the estimated arrival date - it took about two and a half weeks. They looked very nice once they were on. The only problem I had was that the way they are packaged, they are difficult to take out as they are quite delicate. I actually ended up shifting the lashes by accident on a couple of pairs, so it&#x27;s a good thing there were ten! Overall, I would recommend these.</li>
            <li> These are way too long to be bottom lashes unless you want to look ridiculous. These are more like natural upper lashes that were flipped upside down the packaging.</li>
            <li> Immediately went into the trash. Should not be advertised as bottom lashes because these are too long &amp; not very good quality.</li>
            <li> Its been about a month and a half since ordered and still not here.</li>
            <li> i love these hand made produce, very soft and natural, i can wear them to work every day with very natural looking.</li>
            <li> I like that the strip is very flexible and clear. The lashes are same space between hairs all the way down. They are just not natural looking, or believable.</li>
            <li> Hated them! They are poorly made and do not stay on. Also there are plastic rods holding the lashes in place that hurt. very dissapointed.. :(</li>
            <li> If you are Asian with little eyelashes, you can use these on your top eyelids. That is what I did and it looks super natural. I really like how affordable it is also.</li>
            <li> I Dont Know I Wore Two Pair Before , The First One Turned Out Pretty Good,But then The Second Time I Wore Them They Kept  Coming Off. Im New To This So Maybe I Wasnt Doing It Right ...So Still Try Them Out. Oh Also They Are  Very Thin And Looks Plain .</li>
