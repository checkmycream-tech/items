            <li>These are very durable and don&#x27;t chip or crack easily.</li>
            <li>Exactly what i ordered!  </li>
            <li>Will definitely order more once i run out!</li>
            <li>I really do recommend!!</li>
            <li>All the nails were fine and arrived fast</li>
            <li>very flimsy and cheap looking.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised on how great the product was considering the low price they are.</li>
            <li>You cant beat the price they are well worth it .</li>
            <li>they came in clear, its ok cause</li>
            <li>I really liked these tips, but I wish I would have gone with a different color.  </li>
            <li>my daughter have fun to used it..</li>
            <li>Just need to work on a more professional presentation.</li>
            <li>Save the money on ones you can buy in person, the time waiting just wasn&#x27;t worth it</li>
            <li>other then that good</li>
            <li>But mine, I received, were not cut right.</li>
            <li>but I guess the price is right.</li>
            <li>and i noticed the numbering was right</li>
            <li>The nails are a good quality but the amount of time it takes to get them is not worth it...</li>
            <li>If u don&#x27;t get these you are super duper smart.</li>
            <li>But overall, they are easy to use and cut, I would buy them again!</li>
            <li>The bend easy and do not sick to human nails..</li>
            <li>These were very cheap made and not shaped properly so</li>
            <li>very much what i needed.</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re very much like the ones u get at a beauty supply &amp; way</li>
            <li>Thank you very much</li>
            <li>these nails are really nice , they are all white, comes with all 10 different nail, and their easy to cut and for the prices</li>
            <li>Pretty flimsy.</li>
            <li>I have just now been able to actually give these a try.</li>
            <li>These nails are exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>The price is pretty unbeatable.</li>
            <li>came in the mail really fast!</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more from this seller</li>
            <li>My French tips arrived weeks ago, and I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>I love the French tip look</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used them yet, but they look like exactly what i wanted.  </li>
            <li>Definitely ordering again :)</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these French nail tips, they are my.</li>
            <li>They turned out half nails that are way to curved on top!</li>
            <li>I bought some nails from a nail supply store while waiting for these and some reason they don&#x27;t fit my nails properly:(( i&#x27;m glad these finally came</li>
            <li>i love it just long time shipping.</li>
            <li>although you have to hit them pretty hard to make them chip, mine have been doing a good job at staying on and in one piece.</li>
            <li>The nails came in a big ziplock bag and inside all the nails came numbered so it&#x27;s easy to tell the sizes apart.</li>
            <li>I was able to fit each nail to all of my finger nails except the pinky nails—too small.</li>
            <li>Acrylic sticks to them very well.</li>
            <li>I could have spent a lot more if I would have bought at the beauty supply store, but</li>
            <li>It really should.</li>
            <li>but I really like them</li>
            <li>Arrived fairly fast , was expecting it to take longer.</li>
            <li>Would recommend these nails for anyone that wants to save some cash instead of going to the salon.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable &amp; it come within the timeline give.</li>
            <li>They are very sturdy and stick well.  </li>
            <li>thanks a ton, and i can&#x27;t wait to use these for decorative nails and also some cosplay teeth.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping /</li>
            <li>and they are very sturdy.</li>
            <li>so the color doesn&#x27;t matter that much to me.</li>
            <li>The shape of the tips don&#x27;t have the curved arch as much as I was expecting.</li>
            <li>came fast</li>
            <li>so much I had to buy</li>
            <li>I really like these acrylic nails.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know whose fingers those things fit, but it&#x27;s not a female</li>
            <li>Love them shouldn&#x27;t need any for a while with 500 natural french tips.</li>
            <li>A few of them broke off and they are kind of flimsy.</li>
            <li>I thought these were clear!!!</li>
            <li>i just opened my package and they are CLEAR nails!!!</li>
            <li>They break easily and are just not for long term use.</li>
            <li>I found them easy to use, but they did not wear long.</li>
            <li>Even with the proper amount of acrylic overlay, they are very fragile and break very easily.</li>
            <li>like to be told how many word to use to express my opinion on costumes or any other product.</li>
            <li>But those are too long to fit.</li>
            <li>Most people use these with acrylics but if you file them down where they stick to your nail, they blend in</li>
            <li>I expected nail glue and easy to cut nails.</li>
            <li>Will pay the extra money next time for a better product.</li>
            <li>LOL sorry.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll  receive them soon after you&#x27;ve purchased them and will last you a LONG time because of how many nails are in the packet.</li>
            <li>I was expecting the white tips with the smile line.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t put as much pressure on the glue when I cut them down to fit.</li>
            <li>With just nail glue and some top coat they lasted me about a week and a half!</li>
            <li>New to the nail adventure</li>
            <li>when I run out I will have the new order here if not almost here by the time I run out of these.</li>
            <li>They were more like natural color and super thin.</li>
            <li>but I am thankful they came very early</li>
            <li>and the feel of them were very natural looking .</li>
            <li>It was kind of hard to set them straight on my nail at first, but I ended up get the hang of it, I would except any other nail tip to be any easier to set.</li>
            <li>But I am going to have to file pretty much every single one because they are miss shapen.</li>
            <li>The nails are pretty durable and are numerous.</li>
            <li>These are pretty standard.  </li>
            <li>It actually came with 500 pretty tips.</li>
            <li>and I would need more of the medium to small sized tips.</li>
            <li>But for the price I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>They were pure white, but it did feel like they took forever to arrive...</li>
            <li>I got them today and they&#x27;re clear.</li>
            <li>i was going to also order clear</li>
            <li>and I got clear instead</li>
            <li>and natural too.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t work with the professional glue I bought.</li>
            <li>says natural nail</li>
            <li>so I like white tips they applied very well</li>
            <li>and I recommended them to anyone who needs a professional quality nail.</li>
            <li>they are natural looking.</li>
            <li>If I had wanted the natural ones, I would have searched for and ordered those.</li>
            <li>I do not like the natural look</li>
            <li>I used professional equipment and products.</li>
            <li>Product arrived early &amp; contained everything I was expecting</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll just stick to buying professional product....</li>
            <li>It says they look natural.</li>
            <li>These came 6 days early.</li>
            <li>I was just kind of annoyed.</li>
            <li>right and other people&#x27;s fingers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They had little extra pieces of plastic around the edges, the smile line isn&#x27;t straight on all of them.</li>
            <li>but they are exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>exactly what i expected all sizes were there</li>
            <li>a bit thick but easy to use</li>
            <li>They are also good sizes in my opinion, and I have tiny, weird nails.  </li>
            <li>They maybe cheap but there are not very good.</li>
            <li>It clearly says they&#x27;re white</li>
            <li>I wanted the white tips but got clear tips instead.</li>
            <li>Instead I got the standard acrylic clear tips.</li>
            <li>these were clear not white!</li>
            <li>Ididn&#x27;t want clear i wanted WHITE!!!</li>
            <li>They are not white they are natural color.</li>
            <li>THE NATURAL PEDI AND GOT WHITE</li>
            <li>sorry if this is not an effective review but ihavent used them yet.  </li>
            <li>They are nice and thick so they don&#x27;t crack when you cut them down .</li>
            <li>I went to a professional store and bought crappy nails for double the price and only 100 nails.</li>
            <li>Natural tips not french white as described</li>
            <li>They were really flat and was really hard to bend so it could fit on my finger</li>
            <li>Very thin, and didn&#x27;t fit very well.</li>
            <li>I will just order from the beauty supply store and pay full price from now on; at least I will get what I ask for.</li>
            <li>but the mask is so hot after just a few minuets</li>
            <li>These are the regular natural off white, not French tip white!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not long enough personally for me but no complaints.</li>
            <li>As far as shipping, they came a little early.</li>

            <li> I was excited to get so many nails for so cheap, and they ship from Hong Kong</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m fine with that.</li>
            <li> They work fine.</li>
            <li> Also it looks like made of cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> if you buff the nails they look really great as a French tip!</li>

            <li> They look really cheap.</li>
            <li> Feel cheap.</li>

            <li> It came in a great timely manner, international shipping, and by number according to size in a ziploc bag!</li>
            <li> These came really quick-which was nice however....</li>
            <li> These are cute and definitely worth getting.</li>
            <li> they dont fit my nails at al</li>
            <li> but everything was good so far</li>
            <li> So, this is worth it!</li>

            <li> I bought glue from Kroger, a brush on glue, and so far I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> I was excited to use these but they are so flimsey</li>
            <li> Cant even used them and i was so excited for them to arrive</li>
            <li> these were really cool except for the part that i had to use fingernail clippers to trim them (sides and all) to fit my nails</li>
            <li> she will be so excited when she gets it for her birthday.</li>
            <li> Clean smile lines is a plus!</li>
            <li> I was worried they would be super cheap looking</li>
            <li> terrific product very easy to use all sizes and have found fits most everyone.</li>
            <li> These nails are good if you are looking to wear the for a short period of time.</li>
            <li> it would be good to use as tips and dont have to air brush or polish the french</li>
            <li> I thought they were going to be full nails.</li>
            <li> I love them so much.</li>
            <li> True to size.</li>
            <li> Bought these to do french tips and that&#x27;s what they are good for.</li>
            <li> I love them so much</li>
            <li> Thick ,very good quality tips!</li>
            <li> Not bad, not bad at all.</li>
            <li> The price should have given me a red flag that it was too good to be true.</li>
            <li> Not bad considering the price.</li>

            <li> Very fast shipping!  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t go on easily, doesn&#x27;t feel or look natural, and it comes off so easily.</li>
            <li> These are very durable and don&#x27;t chip or crack easily.</li>
            <li> Exactly what i ordered!  </li>
            <li> Will definitely order more once i run out!</li>
            <li> I really do recommend!!</li>
            <li> All the nails were fine and arrived fast</li>
            <li> very flimsy and cheap looking.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised on how great the product was considering the low price they are.</li>
            <li> You cant beat the price they are well worth it .</li>
            <li> they came in clear, its ok cause</li>
            <li> I really liked these tips, but I wish I would have gone with a different color.  </li>
            <li> my daughter have fun to used it..</li>
            <li> Just need to work on a more professional presentation.</li>
            <li> Save the money on ones you can buy in person, the time waiting just wasn&#x27;t worth it</li>
            <li> other then that good</li>
            <li> But mine, I received, were not cut right.</li>
            <li> but I guess the price is right.</li>
            <li> and i noticed the numbering was right</li>
            <li> The nails are a good quality but the amount of time it takes to get them is not worth it...</li>
            <li> If u don&#x27;t get these you are super duper smart.</li>
            <li> But overall, they are easy to use and cut, I would buy them again!</li>
            <li> The bend easy and do not sick to human nails..</li>
            <li> These were very cheap made and not shaped properly so</li>
            <li> very much what i needed.</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re very much like the ones u get at a beauty supply &amp; way</li>
            <li> Thank you very much</li>
            <li> these nails are really nice , they are all white, comes with all 10 different nail, and their easy to cut and for the prices</li>
            <li> Pretty flimsy.</li>
            <li> I have just now been able to actually give these a try.</li>
            <li> These nails are exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> The price is pretty unbeatable.</li>
            <li> came in the mail really fast!</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more from this seller</li>
            <li> My French tips arrived weeks ago, and I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I love the French tip look</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them yet, but they look like exactly what i wanted.  </li>
            <li> Definitely ordering again :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these French nail tips, they are my.</li>
            <li> They turned out half nails that are way to curved on top!</li>
            <li> I bought some nails from a nail supply store while waiting for these and some reason they don&#x27;t fit my nails properly:(( i&#x27;m glad these finally came</li>
            <li> i love it just long time shipping.</li>
            <li> although you have to hit them pretty hard to make them chip, mine have been doing a good job at staying on and in one piece.</li>
            <li> The nails came in a big ziplock bag and inside all the nails came numbered so it&#x27;s easy to tell the sizes apart.</li>
            <li> I was able to fit each nail to all of my finger nails except the pinky nails—too small.</li>
            <li> Acrylic sticks to them very well.</li>
            <li> I could have spent a lot more if I would have bought at the beauty supply store, but</li>
            <li> It really should.</li>
            <li> but I really like them</li>
            <li> Arrived fairly fast , was expecting it to take longer.</li>
            <li> Would recommend these nails for anyone that wants to save some cash instead of going to the salon.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> The price was reasonable &amp; it come within the timeline give.</li>
            <li> They are very sturdy and stick well.  </li>
            <li> thanks a ton, and i can&#x27;t wait to use these for decorative nails and also some cosplay teeth.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping /</li>
            <li> and they are very sturdy.</li>
            <li> so the color doesn&#x27;t matter that much to me.</li>
            <li> The shape of the tips don&#x27;t have the curved arch as much as I was expecting.</li>
            <li> came fast</li>
            <li> so much I had to buy</li>
            <li> I really like these acrylic nails.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know whose fingers those things fit, but it&#x27;s not a female</li>
            <li> Love them shouldn&#x27;t need any for a while with 500 natural french tips.</li>
            <li> A few of them broke off and they are kind of flimsy.</li>
            <li> I thought these were clear!!!</li>
            <li> i just opened my package and they are CLEAR nails!!!</li>
            <li> They break easily and are just not for long term use.</li>
            <li> I found them easy to use, but they did not wear long.</li>
            <li> Even with the proper amount of acrylic overlay, they are very fragile and break very easily.</li>
            <li> like to be told how many word to use to express my opinion on costumes or any other product.</li>
            <li> But those are too long to fit.</li>
            <li> Most people use these with acrylics but if you file them down where they stick to your nail, they blend in</li>
            <li> I expected nail glue and easy to cut nails.</li>
            <li> Will pay the extra money next time for a better product.</li>
            <li> LOL sorry.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll  receive them soon after you&#x27;ve purchased them and will last you a LONG time because of how many nails are in the packet.</li>
            <li> I was expecting the white tips with the smile line.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t put as much pressure on the glue when I cut them down to fit.</li>
            <li> With just nail glue and some top coat they lasted me about a week and a half!</li>
            <li> New to the nail adventure</li>
            <li> when I run out I will have the new order here if not almost here by the time I run out of these.</li>
            <li> They were more like natural color and super thin.</li>
            <li> but I am thankful they came very early</li>
            <li> and the feel of them were very natural looking .</li>
            <li> It was kind of hard to set them straight on my nail at first, but I ended up get the hang of it, I would except any other nail tip to be any easier to set.</li>
            <li> But I am going to have to file pretty much every single one because they are miss shapen.</li>
            <li> The nails are pretty durable and are numerous.</li>
            <li> These are pretty standard.  </li>
            <li> It actually came with 500 pretty tips.</li>
            <li> and I would need more of the medium to small sized tips.</li>
            <li> But for the price I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> They were pure white, but it did feel like they took forever to arrive...</li>
            <li> I got them today and they&#x27;re clear.</li>
            <li> i was going to also order clear</li>
            <li> and I got clear instead</li>
            <li> and natural too.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work with the professional glue I bought.</li>
            <li> says natural nail</li>
            <li> so I like white tips they applied very well</li>
            <li> and I recommended them to anyone who needs a professional quality nail.</li>
            <li> they are natural looking.</li>
            <li> If I had wanted the natural ones, I would have searched for and ordered those.</li>
            <li> I do not like the natural look</li>
            <li> I used professional equipment and products.</li>
            <li> Product arrived early &amp; contained everything I was expecting</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just stick to buying professional product....</li>
            <li> It says they look natural.</li>
            <li> These came 6 days early.</li>
            <li> I was just kind of annoyed.</li>
            <li> right and other people&#x27;s fingers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They had little extra pieces of plastic around the edges, the smile line isn&#x27;t straight on all of them.</li>
            <li> but they are exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> exactly what i expected all sizes were there</li>
            <li> a bit thick but easy to use</li>
            <li> They are also good sizes in my opinion, and I have tiny, weird nails.  </li>
            <li> They maybe cheap but there are not very good.</li>
            <li> It clearly says they&#x27;re white</li>
            <li> I wanted the white tips but got clear tips instead.</li>
            <li> Instead I got the standard acrylic clear tips.</li>
            <li> these were clear not white!</li>
            <li> Ididn&#x27;t want clear i wanted WHITE!!!</li>
            <li> They are not white they are natural color.</li>
            <li> THE NATURAL PEDI AND GOT WHITE</li>
            <li> sorry if this is not an effective review but ihavent used them yet.  </li>
            <li> They are nice and thick so they don&#x27;t crack when you cut them down .</li>
            <li> I went to a professional store and bought crappy nails for double the price and only 100 nails.</li>
            <li> Natural tips not french white as described</li>
            <li> They were really flat and was really hard to bend so it could fit on my finger</li>
            <li> Very thin, and didn&#x27;t fit very well.</li>
            <li> I will just order from the beauty supply store and pay full price from now on; at least I will get what I ask for.</li>
            <li> but the mask is so hot after just a few minuets</li>
            <li> These are the regular natural off white, not French tip white!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not long enough personally for me but no complaints.</li>
            <li> As far as shipping, they came a little early.</li>
            <li> I got these very quick but out of 10 small bags of nails not 1 fit me</li>
            <li> I can honestly say I haven&#x27;t ever had an artificial nail/tip that has lasted as long as these.</li>
            <li> These came pretty late.</li>
            <li> last as long as salon nails FOR THIS PRICE</li>
            <li> Shipping time is extremely long, but for that price I&#x27;ll just buy before I run out next time.</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t have the groove for nails and are rounded on both ends for full coverage false nails.</li>
            <li> very very white, other people are saying how they weren&#x27;t white enough.</li>
            <li> I bought these to use as fake teeth and they look fantastic.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with package and cheap price.</li>
            <li> Took a long time to get.</li>
            <li> I expected to receive these next month</li>
            <li> It arrived earlier than expected with all of them in separate bags with the correct numbers.</li>
            <li> Delivery takes a long time</li>
            <li> Though it took long it was from across the world</li>
            <li> Be prepared to wait a long time</li>
            <li> The length allows for a wide selection of personal choice.</li>
            <li> but they take a long time to get to me</li>
            <li> The shipping takes extremely long!</li>
            <li> One pack had 500 the other pack clearly had less in it</li>
            <li> and they are very very long..</li>
            <li> These nails came really early I was shocked when I found them in the mail box, but I gave 4 stars because they need to be reshapped to fit, and doesn&#x27;t come with glue...</li>
            <li> Not what I ordered but not worth sending back.</li>
            <li> kind of disappointed.</li>
            <li> The shipping time was really long but expected as they come from China.</li>
            <li> I have had the same ones on now for about a week and a half,</li>
            <li> I meant to buy actual fake nAils not fake nail tips</li>
            <li> Thought it would look like package, not, crammed into little packets in a bag smaller than a sandwich bag</li>
            <li> i saw two little bags with the same number</li>
            <li> oh and it came earlier than expected!!!</li>
            <li> then i expected.</li>
            <li> Not in anyway what I expected</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not very durable.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected and as pictured.</li>
            <li> Package came as expected and the nails are how they were described.</li>
            <li> Came before expected delivery date.</li>
            <li> Took forever to get but they are as expected.</li>
            <li> Not only did I receive them in less than a week from when I ordered them, but they&#x27;re sturdy nails!</li>
            <li> Got here before expected delivery date!</li>
            <li> Other then not put together</li>
            <li> It says white French false nails</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the wells are too rounded at the ends, almost like they ran a bit in the mold.</li>
            <li> My experience was that they are actually thicker than any nail tip I have ever bought at a drug store, almost too thick.</li>
            <li> make sure that you hold the base of the tip as you trim it to size.</li>
            <li> I always cut them down some before I glue them on</li>
            <li> Some of the nails were also chipped, which I&#x27;m not too upset about considering I&#x27;m going to shave them down anyways.</li>
            <li> But I think there is less than 500 nails</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t receive nails for month and a half.</li>
            <li> a little to flexible for my taste</li>
            <li> but I guess it&#x27;s what you would expect for so little.</li>
            <li> they need to be shaped a little.</li>
            <li> They look like little kid nails.</li>
            <li> Nothing that can&#x27;t be filed down though!</li>
            <li> The tips are kinda thick not very bendy, which depending on the person could either be a con or a pro.</li>
            <li> doe not fit the nail beds correctly.</li>
            <li> it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I got these a few days ago</li>
            <li> I will be using in a few days and the shipping takes time</li>
            <li> I was expecting the tips to be missing some or flimsy because of the price</li>
            <li> Just cheap, plastic, crap nail tips.</li>
            <li> I was absolutely shocked when I got these early (yay!), but when I opened them, EVERY SINGLE TIP NEEDED FILED BECAUSE</li>
            <li> They are very stiff, and not cheap; I found that because they were stiff, I had to bend them a little.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> All of them were too small.</li>
            <li> they are terrible  there smaller than American made French tip nails.....</li>
            <li> Waste of my money!</li>
            <li> although i got a little confused wen</li>
            <li> It was, at least for me, everything they said.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Since these are thicker, they were harder for me to file down to my size and that was a little annoying.</li>
            <li> Was not satisfied!</li>
            <li> The shipping time was ridiculous, but I knew what I was getting myself into.</li>
            <li> not good quality .Very</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re thin.</li>
            <li> Do buy this false nails, they work well</li>
            <li> I like them, they are just very hard to apply! ;(</li>
            <li> so I was skeptical of the quality...</li>
            <li> So sad.</li>
            <li> I rate this a 3 because I got the wrong product...</li>
            <li> I guess, I&#x27;ve never had fake nails before</li>
            <li> of them where broken, dirty, or unusable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but the sticker was put on wrong.</li>
            <li> Very thin.  </li>
            <li> i hated this product not what i was expecting made poorly not much more to say about this item it sucked</li>
            <li> They are REALLY badly shaped for ANYONE&#x27;S finger.</li>
            <li> Bad quality.</li>
            <li> The shipping wasn&#x27;t bad, I waited a week before I got them.</li>
            <li> I cant say anything bad about them</li>
            <li> slightly disappointed by this product.</li>
            <li> but was disappointed when I found that out.</li>
            <li> disappointed</li>
            <li> Was really disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> worthless</li>
            <li> I hate them</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed that I didn&#x27;t receive the product that was advertised.</li>
            <li> So very disappointed with this because I needed white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Awesome sauce, these are great for the price.</li>
            <li> Nicely packaged and worker great</li>
            <li> Delivered before expected and great quality tips will order again !!</li>
            <li> 500 nails for this price? mind if I do! I went to a professional store and bought crappy nails for double the price and only 100 nails. So, this is worth it!</li>
            <li> Amazing tips!! love thm very sturdy!</li>
            <li> a bit thick but easy to use</li>
            <li> These nails are amazing! I love them and I will purchase them again when I run out! They are flimsy tho. But they do the job when the acrylic is on them! (:</li>
            <li> I did get the package but what i feel better with is if it did come in a box that would of being easier than having it in bags. i have not used it as yet but will recommend it as the price is good</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my wife. But those are too long to fit. Also it looks like made of cheap plastic. Not properly finished also.</li>
            <li> I love these nails. I am going to order again. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Pretty flimsy. Get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Took a long time to get. But can&#x27;t complain great price great product. I will definitely buy from again. If you do nails this is perfect for you</li>
            <li> These nails are good if you are looking to wear the for a short period of time. They break easily and are just not for long term use.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.. very nice and u can&#x27;t be the price:)</li>
            <li> and natural too. The biggest flaw? Even with the proper amount of acrylic overlay, they are very fragile and break very easily.</li>
            <li> Not what I ordered but not worth sending back. Natural tips not french white as described</li>
            <li> I bought glue from Kroger, a brush on glue, and so far I&#x27;m very pleased. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the glue that is high quality or the nails, but I&#x27;m happy with it. The shipping time was ridiculous, but I knew what I was getting myself into.</li>
            <li> Great price, tip works great with acrylic or gel overlay.</li>
            <li> I just recieved my nails today and i love them. I bought some nails from a nail supply store while waiting for these and some reason they don&#x27;t fit my nails properly:(( i&#x27;m glad these finally came they&#x27;re not flimsy and the nails fit really well excellent quality for the price. I will by lots more of these from this seller:))</li>
            <li> I liked them. definitely will buy them again when I run out.</li>
            <li> The tips are kinda thick not very bendy, which depending on the person could either be a con or a pro. The shipping time was amazing! came much earlier then i expected. Acrylic sticks to them very well.</li>
            <li> I have just now been able to actually give these a try. They are REALLY badly shaped for ANYONE&#x27;S finger. They were really flat and was really hard to bend so it could fit on my finger right and other people&#x27;s fingers.&lt;br /&gt;I would NOT recomend anyone buy these. They maybe cheap but there are not very good.</li>
            <li> terrific product very easy to use all sizes and have found fits most everyone.I love this product and at a great price shipping was on time as well</li>
            <li> These are great if you no how to put them on</li>
            <li> if you buff the nails they look really great as a French tip!</li>
            <li> These are awesome I was scared because the price was so cheap but they hold up awesome and I will recommend these to anyone:)</li>
            <li> very flimsy and cheap looking.</li>
            <li> Just  got  mine  to day  I&#x27;m so happy  cuz  I was not supposed  to get  thim tell  July  so I give  them  all star</li>
            <li> not what I needed. I expected nail glue and easy to cut nails. slightly disappointed by this product. works okay.</li>
            <li> These nails are great! Not only did I receive them in less than a week from when I ordered them, but they&#x27;re sturdy nails! I was pleasantly surprised on how great the product was considering the low price they are. If you&#x27;re in a budget like I am and you want a great product, then don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase these!! You&#x27;ll  receive them soon after you&#x27;ve purchased them and will last you a LONG time because of how many nails are in the packet.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t spend your money on this garbage.&lt;br /&gt;dont work. i been doing nails for the last 12 yrs.&lt;br /&gt;though it would be good to use as tips and dont have to air brush or polish the french on.&lt;br /&gt;these doe not fit the nail beds correctly.</li>
            <li> I´m very satisfied with this product, it´s excellent and easy to use and paint placed in hands. That´s why I recomend this excellent product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even receive my nails. DO NOT BUY. SCAM</li>
            <li> These tips have definitely exceeded my expectations. They are very good quality and look beautiful, but they do have a higher curvature than regular tips. My only complaint is that the wells are too rounded at the ends, almost like they ran a bit in the mold. Nothing that can&#x27;t be filed down though!</li>
            <li> I did not likr wat I recieve I frlt it was a waste of money. Not in anyway what I expected</li>
            <li> very easy to put on and great sizes for each nail and i can decorate and polish easily and good</li>
            <li> very very white, other people are saying how they weren&#x27;t white enough. these were so white. they all came and all in different sizes, so you have to use a nail file to make them smaller.</li>
            <li> I thought they were white! It clearly says they&#x27;re white and they&#x27;re white in the picture, yet I got them today and they&#x27;re clear. I&#x27;m pretty disappointed. I wanted French tips...</li>
            <li> Takes a lot to get these to glue on. Otherwise ok product.</li>
            <li> Hoping these turn out great</li>
            <li> They are awesome! Very good quality and I&#x27;m so happy with them iwill repurchase them everyone needs to have a basic French tip . But I think there is less than 500 nails</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t ask for a better deal. And the quality is great. This is salon quality for a great price and the shipment was in a timely manner. I got it in about a week. Not bad, not bad at all.</li>
            <li> These are pretty cheap so I was skeptical of the quality...after reading reviews that &amp;#34;they are sort of flimsy&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;they aren&#x27;t white&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;it took forever to arrive&amp;#34;. I decided to just go for it and buy them anyway. I&#x27;m glad I did. My experience was that they are actually thicker than any nail tip I have ever bought at a drug store, almost too thick. They were pure white, but it did feel like they took forever to arrive...but I was expecting that. I wasn&#x27;t happy with the range of sizes because I couldn&#x27;t find tips to fit two of my nails. Since these are thicker, they were harder for me to file down to my size and that was a little annoying. But overall, they are easy to use and cut, I would buy them again! Great value</li>
            <li> Was expecting non acrylic needing tips. New to the nail adventure but was disappointed when I found that out.</li>
            <li> I like them, they are just very hard to apply! ;(</li>
            <li> they are sort of flimsy but I did like the price and quantity !! you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price</li>
            <li> Good quality, good shipping</li>
            <li> i hated this product not what i was expecting made poorly not much more to say about this item it sucked</li>
            <li> These nails are exactly what I wanted. I could have spent a lot more if I would have bought at the beauty supply store, but at this price why would I?</li>
            <li> They work greaT! Came with all 500 isn&#x27;t CHEAP LOOKING last as long as salon nails FOR THIS PRICE THIS IS A STEAL !</li>
            <li> I thought they were going to be full nails. They turned out half nails that are way to curved on top! Its not meant for just gluing on. Its actually meant for the acrylic nail kit ( which I can&#x27;t afford...lol)</li>
            <li> All the nails were fine and arrived fast</li>
            <li> Great value, decent shipping time,  and they do come separated by size</li>
            <li> The price is pretty unbeatable.I bought these to use as fake teeth and they look fantastic.The nails are pretty durable and are numerous.</li>
            <li> ESte articulo lo pedi desde antes de venirme de paseo a este maravilloso pais y lo pedi antes de venirme porque pense que alcanzaba a llevar antes de yo devolmerme a mi pais. estoy aca en Estados Unidos desde el pasado 10 de septiembre y regreso a mi casa el 12 de octubre y no alcanza a llegar este articulo para yo llevarmelo conmigo, entonces despues que me toca hacer pagar un envio a Colombia solo para un articulo de estos. Si me parece que devieran agilizar la entrega de ciertos productos.&lt;br /&gt;Gracias.&lt;br /&gt;Ana Estella J.G</li>
            <li> I have to use a lot of nail glue in order for them to stay on. It&#x27;s why i gave them 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping!  Have ordered from a different place and they were just thrown in bags......These come all stacked and appearance looks awesome!</li>
            <li> These are about the same quality as another set I bought on amazon. Seem just like the ones the salon uses. I always cut them down some before I glue them on so it doesn&#x27;t put as much pressure on the glue when I cut them down to fit. Overall happy with these and would prob by them again.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty cool buy great product ..just wondering what else to do.,.&lt;br /&gt;Is it only for the tips? Will I be able to do the full nail</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not very durable.</li>
            <li> I bought these a while ago, but don&#x27;t know what kind of glue works with the nails...kind of disappointed. doesn&#x27;t work with the professional glue I bought.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say I haven&#x27;t ever had an artificial nail/tip that has lasted as long as these. I have had the same ones on now for about a week and a half, although you have to hit them pretty hard to make them chip, mine have been doing a good job at staying on and in one piece. I would recommend this product to someone who enjoys doing their nails, but also to someone who enjoys having them on for a while.</li>
            <li> these are very good also well for beginners i do suggest them to any one who is looking for a quality nail.</li>
            <li> These nails came really early I was shocked when I found them in the mail box, but I gave 4 stars because they need to be reshapped to fit, and doesn&#x27;t come with glue... It really should.</li>
            <li> I expected to receive these next month but I am thankful they came very early so I am really happy about that and as far as the nails they are excellent quality and they come in individual bags with numbers so you will know what finger to use them on it says natural nail but I don&#x27;t think it means the color cause mine were white but that&#x27;s ok I use them for acrylic so I like white tips they applied very well and the feel of them were very natural looking . I will definitely buy these again and I recommended them to anyone who needs a professional quality nail. You cant beat the price they are well worth it .</li>
            <li> Very thin.  Easily breaks when glueing before acrylic is applied.  Good price and reasonable shipping times.  Just use a size up and file sides.</li>
            <li> I got these very quick but out of 10 small bags of nails not 1 fit me and I have petite hands. All of them were too small. I had to throw them all away.</li>
            <li> I loved it! Good nails.</li>
            <li> I got these a few days ago I thought they would never come took like a month lol but they did come from china anyways but I really like them they fit nicely oI was kinda worried after looking at some of the reviews but they are exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Arrived fairly fast , was expecting it to take longer. The nails are nice and sturdy. The nails came in a big ziplock bag and inside all the nails came numbered so it&#x27;s easy to tell the sizes apart. Would recommend these nails for anyone that wants to save some cash instead of going to the salon. Very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> Just came in today perfect fit,  more then enough shapes and sizes to choose from durable and formable!  Just darling I tell you.  Also so affordable I am now a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> Got the tips in the mail today thought they would be in a box not a bag but that&#x27;s OK they seem to good I will be using in a few days and the shipping takes time so if u can wait I would say u should buy</li>
            <li> Let me just say first that the shipping was great. They arrived even before they were supposed to. With that being said, in the description of these nails it says they are WHITE. They are not white they are natural looking. NOT what I wanted. If I had wanted the natural ones, I would have searched for and ordered those. I do not like the natural look, I like the white, that is why I picked to order the nails that said WHITE.</li>
            <li> It arrived earlier than expected with all of them in separate bags with the correct numbers. It&#x27;s not long enough personally for me but no complaints.</li>
            <li> I do my own nails and these are perfect. Sizes to fit fingers and toes. Just like the ones at the salon.</li>
            <li> These are ok. They don&#x27;t split or crack. But mine, I received, were not cut right. They had little extra pieces of plastic around the edges, the smile line isn&#x27;t straight on all of them. But I just file them till I get the look I want.</li>
            <li> These are pretty standard.  You get more for your money than if you bought them at the beauty supply store.  I found them easy to use, but they did not wear long.</li>
            <li> Do buy this false nails, they work well and they come in 10 sizes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still ok with the nails I did receive though. I wanted the white tips but got clear tips instead. Since I can always use white acrylic powder it&#x27;s not a big deal. I was just kind of annoyed.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t come white like it says. they came in clear, its ok cause i was going to also order clear but i was hoping this would come in white</li>
            <li> Easy so clip and nice quality for the price :3</li>
            <li> I was excited to use these but they are so flimsey they came off within a day or two and trust me I used professional equipment and products. if you are a begginer they might be ok but if you are intermediate to expert you should exet of the item immedietly.</li>
            <li> These were very cheap made and not shaped properly so look forward to a lot of filing and reshaping ...disappointed</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product the French nail tips are very nice and work great in my spa. They were a good buy I would recommend them to any one.</li>
            <li> Love these better quality than I thought for the price..</li>
            <li> Just received my nails today they took forever to come in like 3 weeks which sucked bt these nails are really nice , they are all white, comes with all 10 different nail, and their easy to cut and for the prices I&#x27;d say their perfect really good quality..</li>
            <li> Really really really good deal. They give u a lot for the price. I will def order again!! Really good.</li>
            <li> Very good for acrylic. Great price for so many! ! Will be buying again (:</li>
            <li> It actually came with 500 pretty tips.</li>
            <li> I was expecting the tips to be missing some or flimsy because of the price but they are great! My order came with all my tips and they&#x27;re so strong and the range of sizes is great for my clients!</li>
            <li> Great products. Will recommend to anyone want to have cute looking nails.</li>
            <li> Nice and fast shipping</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 packs of these.One pack had 500 the other pack clearly had less in it so I counted them  also.I guess being a honest person I expect others to be also.So sad.</li>
            <li> Good product and really cheap! came in the mail really fast!</li>
            <li> exactly as described and nice as well. a little to flexible for my taste but my friends liked them with there acrylic nails and thats what matters</li>
            <li> Great got everything. It was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom for mothers day perfect present</li>
            <li> Most people use these with acrylics but if you file them down where they stick to your nail, they blend in so well that I just use them with regular nail polish. These are very durable and don&#x27;t chip or crack easily. With just nail glue and some top coat they lasted me about a week and a half!</li>
            <li> I meant to buy actual fake nAils not fake nail tips but these are nice</li>
            <li> I rate this a 3 because I got the wrong product... I was expecting the white tips with the smile line. Instead I got the standard acrylic clear tips. But it&#x27;s okay because I guess I wanted this kind too. But now I have to order the correct thing with another vendor.</li>
            <li> Perfect perfect perfect !</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected and as pictured.</li>
            <li> Very thin, and didn&#x27;t fit very well. Will pay the extra money next time for a better product.</li>
            <li> These nails are fabulous! I can cut them or file them without them breaking and they&#x27;re easy to put on or decorate. They are durable and amazing for the price.</li>
            <li> Delivered quick. Daughter loves them</li>
            <li> love my nails.  Delivery time was excellent.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Got here before expected delivery date! Good quality!</li>
            <li> Just got them today. Love them shouldn&#x27;t need any for a while with 500 natural french tips.</li>
            <li> why can&#x27;t the product I buy come now cause I&#x27;ve bought it since last month and I want to use it for graduation but I cannot because it&#x27;s not here as yet?</li>
            <li> Its great thanks lookin forward to conduct business with your co.pant again soon do hope the same treatment will be extended to me</li>
            <li> Great nails for acrylics easy to use and to cut if I ever run out I will definitely buy more from this seller</li>
            <li> i love it just long time shipping.</li>
            <li> Delivery takes a long time but I guess the price is right. The nails are a great shape and fit really well.</li>
            <li> My French tips arrived weeks ago, and I am pleased with the product. I was able to fit each nail to all of my finger nails except the pinky nails—too small. However, I was able to fit another nail to my pinky. These will be great nail tips to practice my acrylic technique.</li>
            <li> Just Received Today It Won&#x27;t be used until next Month But I&#x27;ll Rated 5 star .. Good Quality Thanks A Lot !!</li>
            <li> My daughter was so happy to get the nails, she couldn&#x27;t wait to get started. The price was reasonable &amp; it come within the timeline give.</li>
            <li> Amazing! I saved a lot of money on these. I will be getting these in the future.</li>
            <li> I got these within two weeks of ordering, which was great....however when I opened them, they were full-cover nails with no wells, no &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; curve to show that they were tips, and I can&#x27;t use them for anything. The price should have given me a red flag that it was too good to be true. I will just order from the beauty supply store and pay full price from now on; at least I will get what I ask for. I was very disappointed that I didn&#x27;t receive the product that was advertised. I was relying on them for the nail clients I have at work. Will NOT be ordering these again.</li>
            <li> I really liked these tips, but I wish I would have gone with a different color.  They are very sturdy and stick well.  They are also good sizes in my opinion, and I have tiny, weird nails.  All 500 pieces and 10 different sizes were there.  They were in in 16 days and was a good buy.  Packaging was also good.</li>
            <li> very much what i needed. thanks a ton, and i can&#x27;t wait to use these for decorative nails and also some cosplay teeth. super cheap and great quality.</li>
            <li> All these came in 3 dayss! I love them so much. I just got them today and I did count them all. lol. And it was 500 as it said! Great product and amazing time shipping!!!</li>
            <li> did not want to leave a comment but everything was good so far I appreciate it maybe we&#x27;ll order more from this seller but everything was actually good</li>
            <li> I like that it gives the sizes and stuff but it just comes in bags it don&#x27;t come line the picture shows organized and stuff it&#x27;s just nails in bags with numbers on them other then that good</li>
            <li> It says white French false nails these were clear not white! They took over a month to get to me.</li>
            <li> my daughter have fun to used it..but we don&#x27;t have glue for it..Maybe it better I will order some glue..</li>
            <li> Nice and love the nails. I would tell a friend about the nails. Good job and lee up the good work</li>
            <li> I got these tips at an excellent price, and they are what I was hoping for. However, the two largest sizes will not work on my nails and I would need more of the medium to small sized tips. Oh well!</li>
            <li> I seam they nail were thicker  snd they did not break thet stayed on longer which i like.</li>
            <li> Not bad considering the price.</li>
            <li> The shipping takes extremely long! almost 3 weeks. The nails are a good quality but the amount of time it takes to get them is not worth it...</li>
            <li> Took over a month to get here, but good if you are not urgent to get the product. Now that I have these I will immediately make my next order, so when I run out I will have the new order here if not almost here by the time I run out of these. Good product!</li>
            <li> Product arrived early &amp; contained everything I was expecting</li>
            <li> Package came as expected and the nails are how they were described. Nothing wrong with package and cheap price. Though it took long it was from across the world so I&#x27;m fine with that. I would suggest these to nail art addicts😂</li>
            <li> Bad quality. I wouldn&#x27;t do anyone&#x27;s nails with these. But you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Thanks for fixing the problem u r great thumbs up</li>
            <li> Great product for do it yourself acrylic nails.</li>
            <li> Exactly what i ordered!  Shipped fast. Organized and labeled according to nail size.</li>
            <li> they turned out really great (: I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t receive nails for month and a half. Thought it would look like package, not, crammed into little packets in a bag smaller than a sandwich bag</li>
            <li> Great price and great product. My daughter loves them and I loved the price. Just good for what she need them for.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping / Great item! Very happy!</li>
            <li> These nails are pretty good. They are tips for making french tips acrylic nails. A few of them broke off and they are kind of flimsy. That&#x27;s why I only rate this a 3. Otherwise, they came packaged well and arrived in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with this item it works very well and they are very sturdy. I love the French tip look</li>
            <li> love it!!! came in time they all great conditions will use it for practice doing designs ,&lt;br /&gt;thanks!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get 500. But for the price it&#x27;s alright.</li>
            <li> 😫😫 I thought these were clear!!!</li>
            <li> Be prepared to wait a long time</li>
            <li> These nails are great. Reviewers that complain that they look cheap need to remember the price paid. But for the price I was pleasantly surprised! They hold up well with strong glue. The shipping time was really long but expected as they come from China.</li>
            <li> These came pretty late. Later than the estimated delivery dates. Got them. use them with acrylics. They work fine. They haven&#x27;t cracked or broke. They work great.</li>
            <li> Wish I never bought them.....they are terrible  there smaller than American made French tip nails.....they took forever to receive too....had I known they were coming from China I would&#x27;ve have never ordered them but it didn&#x27;t say where there from.....I won&#x27;t be ordering them again .....worthless</li>
            <li> Love love love these nails definitely worth it! !!</li>
            <li> Happy with the nails. Came before expected delivery date. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected. All 500 nails were there. They are nice and thick so they don&#x27;t crack when you cut them down . Good packaging and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Came in a timely manner. True to size.</li>
            <li> Great price got them for the 17 year old it is a great price for a lot of nails could not find a deal this good any where but amazon I love amazon love the great deal</li>
            <li> very cheap quality- again- you get what you pay for. There were reviews that said these were amazing- nope. Cheap. Won&#x27;t buy anything else from them again.</li>
            <li> I love that you get so many of these. They are really great quality and I love doing my nails with them</li>
            <li> exactly what i expected all sizes were there</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t find any flaws, very nice!</li>
            <li> Came On Time And Greatt Nails For What I Paid.</li>
            <li> I have&#x27;nt use it yet. it just stock in my manicure kit. I kinda like it. yes i will recommend this product</li>
            <li> the nail tips are very nice quality....they give my fingers a nice touch and look...love love love them 500 just what i needed.</li>
            <li> Super happy with this purchase. These arrived nearly 3 weeks sooner than I expected. Haven&#x27;t used them yet, but they seem to be standard quality. Great price, free shipping.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Label with numbers. Just need to work on a more professional presentation. But they are okay for the price</li>
            <li> I got these yesterday.  I haven&#x27;t used them yet, but they look like exactly what i wanted.  I like that they are all individually packaged by size.</li>
            <li> I bought these because they were cheaper than the ones sold in stores, they aren&#x27;t that great but I guess it&#x27;s what you would expect for so little. Save the money on ones you can buy in person, the time waiting just wasn&#x27;t worth it</li>
            <li> Great tips and they&#x27;re easy to cut.  I love them and the numbers make them easy to make up to your hands</li>
            <li> These are the regular natural off white, not French tip white!  They are still good for my business so the color doesn&#x27;t matter that much to me.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t very impressed with all the nails being stuck together. The shape of the tips don&#x27;t have the curved arch as much as I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Not what i was expecting&lt;br /&gt; They break and bend too easily . not good quality .Very cheap rather spend more money on better quality nails . Cant even used them and i was so excited for them to arrive</li>
            <li> This is such a awesome deal I will never buy nails at the store again.</li>
            <li> I received these nails and they are great! However, I wasn&#x27;t expecting them to be the shape they were.</li>
            <li> As a licensed nail technician, I cannot use these. I was absolutely shocked when I got these early (yay!), but when I opened them, EVERY SINGLE TIP NEEDED FILED BECAUSE THE WERE MISSHAPPENED! So I took the time to file them, only to have them not stay on my clients nails. I have had so many complaints; I will never buy these again and wouldn&#x27;t recommend them! I&#x27;ll just stick to buying professional product....you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I got these to cut into points to use as fangs for Homestuck trolls. I can&#x27;t say how they work as nails because I haven&#x27;t used them for that purpose. They&#x27;re nice I guess, I&#x27;ve never had fake nails before so I can&#x27;t tell you if they&#x27;re good quality or work as they&#x27;re intended to.</li>
            <li> Junk. Can&#x27;t get any kind of nail glue to work with these nails. They will not stay on. Tried 3 different kinds of glue.</li>
            <li> I hate them and I want my money back now. If u don&#x27;t get these you are super duper smart.</li>
            <li> got them for my  costume was going to be vampire but the mask is so hot after just a few minuets so just decided to give to my granddaughter.&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t like to be told how many word to use to express my opinion on costumes or any other product.</li>
            <li> Just received them today! I was worried they would be super cheap looking but looks just like the ones at the nail salon! Cant wait to use them!! Will definitely order more once i run out! And Great price for all those 500 nails!!!!  Yay!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product, great price</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting such good quality for the price! Definitely ordering again :)</li>
            <li> They look really cheap. Feel cheap. They&#x27;re thin. They did arrive before the date but they just look raggedy and cheap.</li>
            <li> They are not white they are natural color. Was really disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Bought these to do french tips and that&#x27;s what they are good for. The length allows for a wide selection of personal choice. Clean smile lines is a plus!</li>
            <li> Normal tips good for manicure and practice i love them and they are a lot&lt;br /&gt;And came fast</li>
            <li> It was, at least for me, everything they said.&lt;br /&gt;I actually took the time to count them and all 500 pieces were there.&lt;br /&gt;None of them where broken, dirty, or unusable.&lt;br /&gt;Me being me I couldn&#x27;t wait to use them and because I didn&#x27;t have anyone&#x27;s nails to do at the time I did my own. I love them. And when I run low I will order them again</li>
            <li> They were apses to arrive July 29 but they finally came today. Beautiful looking nails.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t go on easily, doesn&#x27;t feel or look natural, and it comes off so easily.</li>
            <li> Honestly these are great nails love them so much I had to buy more!!!:D</li>
            <li> I ordered WHITE tips and WAITED forever for them to come...i just opened my package and they are CLEAR nails!!! Ididn&#x27;t want clear i wanted WHITE!!! Im sending them back in hopes to get the correct order next time!!! #notsatisfied</li>
            <li> As far as shipping, they came a little early. But I am going to have to file pretty much every single one because they are miss shapen. I hope they last..I guess time will tell if I buy again.</li>
            <li> these were really cool except for the part that i had to use fingernail clippers to trim them (sides and all) to fit my nails</li>
            <li> I love them!! Very easy to stick on! Good quality!!! I really do recommend!! Very😏 easy to work with :)</li>
            <li> These nails are great, i just file them to fit my nails before i glue them on. I did my and my best friend&#x27;s nails for her wedding with these and they held up nicely!</li>
            <li> Was not satisfied! All the nails where mixed up! Didn&#x27;t have a full 500 count! Other then not put together well it was alright!</li>
            <li> I love them so much I love that I can choose the size and they don&#x27;t crack like some of the nails I get from beautysupply&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so so much :D</li>
            <li> I really like these acrylic nails. They are very stiff, and not cheap; I found that because they were stiff, I had to bend them a little. The shipping wasn&#x27;t bad, I waited a week before I got them.</li>
            <li> these nails look great but they take a long time to get to me&lt;br /&gt;hope the turn out great :))!!!!</li>
            <li> Loved them! they need to be shaped a little. but got here 2 or 3 weeks earlier then estimated date which is great! they are good quality and you should consider. comes in nice bags and are numbered. love them</li>
            <li> Good for acrylics.just make sure that you hold the base of the tip as you trim it to size. and apply acrylic before shaping with file.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get so many nails for so cheap, and they ship from Hong Kong so I could understand why they took forever to get here. The only downside is that I could&#x27;ve sworn they were supposed to come with nail glue and they didn&#x27;t. Some of the nails were also chipped, which I&#x27;m not too upset about considering I&#x27;m going to shave them down anyways. Otherwise a good purchase!</li>
            <li> Love them! They are white just like the pic!</li>
            <li> Thick ,very good quality tips!</li>
            <li> Cannot beat the price wish they were curved more but they&#x27;re very much like the ones u get at a beauty supply &amp; way cheaper Love them will order again</li>
            <li> I love these tips and I will order again. They arrived quickly and just as they say it will. They are packaged really nice and look good. Thank you very much</li>
            <li> I love my nails! It came in a great timely manner, international shipping, and by number according to size in a ziploc bag! Yes!</li>
            <li> Good for beginners &amp; pros.</li>
            <li> Great product. .I would purchase again</li>
            <li> PERFECT FIT NICE, GREAT AND EASY TO FILE ACRYLIC AND UV GELS AND EASILY APPLIED I RECCOMENDED IT TO ANYONE.</li>
            <li> Just cheap, plastic, crap nail tips. I&#x27;m not buying this brand again. I think I&#x27;ll go purchase them at a store where I can SEE WHAT I&#x27;M GETTING. I don&#x27;t know whose fingers those things fit, but it&#x27;s not a female</li>
            <li> Great price, tons of pieces.</li>
            <li> I got mine yesterday and I love them! they fit my nails perfectly and are the right color!!! Will be ordering more! oh and it came earlier than expected!!! That was a plus!!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered these tip and they looked the way i epxected them to look.  sorry if this is not an effective review but ihavent used them yet.  I cant say anything bad about them</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these French nail tips, they are my. Favorite. They are of quality. Just ordered another 500 pcs and I recommended them to my friend and she ordered them last night. Customer service is good aswell, very courteous. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> If i could, no stars. It says they look natural. They look like little kid nails. They are flimsy. The bend easy and do not sick to human nails.. LOL sorry. I did not like it.</li>
            <li> These came 6 days early. Great buy. I&#x27;m very satisfied. I&#x27;ll repurchase when I run out</li>
            <li> These are good nails. They are easy to use and cut. If I run out of these I will definately buy more.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my daughter.  she will be so excited when she gets it for her birthday.</li>
            <li> The nail tips are great very strong  easy to use</li>
            <li> They worked GREAT. It was kind of hard to set them straight on my nail at first, but I ended up get the hang of it, I would except any other nail tip to be any easier to set.</li>
            <li> Took forever to get but they are as expected.</li>
            <li> Was expecting white nails and I got clear instead</li>
            <li> These came really quick-which was nice however....PRODUCT MISCOMMUNICATION!! The title and description say WHITE, but I received natural(which the picture states but shows white) That is not what I wanted. So very disappointed with this because I needed white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, not tips! These didn&#x27;t have the groove for nails and are rounded on both ends for full coverage false nails.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for such a low price. Shipping time is extremely long, but for that price I&#x27;ll just buy before I run out next time.</li>
            <li> THE NATURAL PEDI AND GOT WHITE</li>
            <li> I never got my white tips at all!! I am very disappointed with this. I waited and waited. Waste of my money!</li>
            <li> These are cute and definitely worth getting. They are not truly universal measurements though</li>
            <li> These tips are exactly as the pictures described them and are perfect for my own manicure. Thank you SO much for amazing products!</li>
            <li> I just got my package and i must say I love it...although i got a little confused wen i saw two little bags with the same number and i noticed the numbering was right but the sticker was put on wrong. Other than that I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> It took forever for them to get to my house, like 3 weeks. These nails are a little flimsy but they are a great price and once they are on they are fine.</li>
            <li> My nails arrived but they were not white. They were more like natural color and super thin. I only used them once. They break off so quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish they were white!!</li>
            <li> they dont fit my nails at al and they are very very long.. like bird toes</li>
    </ol>
