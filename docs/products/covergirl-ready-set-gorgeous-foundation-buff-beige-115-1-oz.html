            <li>Too oily for my t-zone, but otherwise nice coverage..</li>
            <li>and I loved that it was oil free as it didn&#x27;t add any shine.</li>

            <li>/&gt;I’ve been switching between a matte mousse foundation (which I love) and a BareMinerals powder set</li>
            <li>It works just as well and better than some department store brands.</li>
            <li>still pretty good.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the Covergirl Ready, Set, Gorgeous foundation.</li>

            <li>/&gt;(I received this complimentary product from Influenster for testing/reviewing purposes)</li>
            <li>Amazing coverage and no smearing, and nice subtle glow.</li>
            <li>me, this isn&#x27;t the right foundation because of the lack of staying power.</li>
            <li>For a drug store product its actually pretty amazing, its similar to the Laura Mercier foundation.</li>
            <li>I was really excited because I have been in the market for a new foundations.</li>
            <li>My skin looks so much smoother with this foundation!</li>
            <li>I have a very acne prone face, and this foundation covered everything!</li>
            <li>I love how well it works, especially since its so affordable!</li>
            <li>It also lasts all day and  can withstand the hot weather of Texas.</li>
            <li>I really like this foundation!</li>
            <li>I normaly buy realy expensive foundation, but I am realy impressed with this product!</li>
            <li>I’m pretty sure I won’t be buying it in the future, and I won’t be recommending it to any of my friends either.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty oily and this really didn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t dry it out more.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite foundations I have used in years, my skin is oily with dry areas</li>
            <li>I moat certainly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I also love that it stays matte for a few hours without a touch up, and the last thing would be how smooth it goes on but has full coverage.</li>
            <li>I am so in love with this foundation, many other kinds will dry out my skin and not give much coverage</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Ready,</li>
            <li>The foundation glides on smoothly and tends to set in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>used this foundation on Halloween to really test how well it stayed on.</li>
            <li>With a test for color match on my hand, it washed off without soap or really any scrubbing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would say it is light-medium coverage, but it&#x27;s very buildable without looking cakey.</li>
            <li>I have some acne and it covers it enough to where I feel comfortable leaving the house.</li>
            <li>It completely covers my whole face and blends right in with my skin tone.</li>
            <li>so I was excited to see some “regular” foundation to try out in the Dean’s List VoxBox.</li>
            <li>It requires a bit more blending than other foundations.</li>
            <li>I am normally a creamy natural and i am going a shade up every time to find my right shade</li>
            <li>well, decent coverage.</li>
            <li>so I had some high expectations for this foundation.</li>
            <li>this product I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m normally fair-ivory, so I use their #105.</li>
            <li>Definitely a product worth trying</li>
            <li>But seriously, it works amazing.</li>
            <li>I am usually not a huge fan of foundation, but this proved to be better than anything I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>Makes skin very soft and almost has a matte effect to it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend it to anyone that has dry skin, just because this foundation leaves more of a matte finish and can dry out your skin a bit when</li>
            <li>It makes your skin look natural and does not get oily throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Still searching for my shade due to the shades are alot lighter than most other foundations.</li>
            <li>( I usually get the lightest tone available )</li>
            <li>It seamlessly covers my dark spots and red areas quickly.</li>
            <li>I will probably buy this again and will definitely recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a new foundation</li>
            <li>it was slightly darker than my skin tone, but it blends pretty well.</li>
            <li>I have a slew of issues with this product, but first onto the few things I like about it.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> /&gt;(I received this complimentary product from Influenster for testing/reviewing purposes)</li>
            <li> Amazing coverage and no smearing, and nice subtle glow.</li>
            <li> me, this isn&#x27;t the right foundation because of the lack of staying power.</li>
            <li> For a drug store product its actually pretty amazing, its similar to the Laura Mercier foundation.</li>
            <li> I was really excited because I have been in the market for a new foundations.</li>
            <li> My skin looks so much smoother with this foundation!</li>
            <li> I have a very acne prone face, and this foundation covered everything!</li>
            <li> I love how well it works, especially since its so affordable!</li>
            <li> It also lasts all day and  can withstand the hot weather of Texas.</li>
            <li> I really like this foundation!</li>
            <li> I normaly buy realy expensive foundation, but I am realy impressed with this product!</li>
            <li> I’m pretty sure I won’t be buying it in the future, and I won’t be recommending it to any of my friends either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty oily and this really didn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t dry it out more.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite foundations I have used in years, my skin is oily with dry areas</li>
            <li> I moat certainly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I also love that it stays matte for a few hours without a touch up, and the last thing would be how smooth it goes on but has full coverage.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this foundation, many other kinds will dry out my skin and not give much coverage</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Ready,</li>
            <li> The foundation glides on smoothly and tends to set in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> used this foundation on Halloween to really test how well it stayed on.</li>
            <li> With a test for color match on my hand, it washed off without soap or really any scrubbing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would say it is light-medium coverage, but it&#x27;s very buildable without looking cakey.</li>
            <li> I have some acne and it covers it enough to where I feel comfortable leaving the house.</li>
            <li> It completely covers my whole face and blends right in with my skin tone.</li>
            <li> so I was excited to see some “regular” foundation to try out in the Dean’s List VoxBox.</li>
            <li> It requires a bit more blending than other foundations.</li>
            <li> I am normally a creamy natural and i am going a shade up every time to find my right shade</li>
            <li> well, decent coverage.</li>
            <li> so I had some high expectations for this foundation.</li>
            <li> this product I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m normally fair-ivory, so I use their #105.</li>
            <li> Definitely a product worth trying</li>
            <li> But seriously, it works amazing.</li>
            <li> I am usually not a huge fan of foundation, but this proved to be better than anything I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> Makes skin very soft and almost has a matte effect to it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend it to anyone that has dry skin, just because this foundation leaves more of a matte finish and can dry out your skin a bit when</li>
            <li> It makes your skin look natural and does not get oily throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Still searching for my shade due to the shades are alot lighter than most other foundations.</li>
            <li> ( I usually get the lightest tone available )</li>
            <li> It seamlessly covers my dark spots and red areas quickly.</li>
            <li> I will probably buy this again and will definitely recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a new foundation</li>
            <li> it was slightly darker than my skin tone, but it blends pretty well.</li>
            <li> I have a slew of issues with this product, but first onto the few things I like about it.</li>
            <li> I am not normally a huge fan of drug store foundation because I have really oily skin</li>
            <li> Things I do not like: if you put any product over it it begins to look very cakey, it is super oily and makes me breakout, it was the wrong color even though this is the shade I typically wear-</li>
            <li> I could only wear this make up a few days before passing along to my sister because the color was much too dark for me</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a soft feeling and a little goes along</li>
            <li> The shade is a bit too dark and does show up in different lights with my skin tone being different.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and on oily days it helps dry my face out and on dry days</li>
            <li> but this one combats my oily without showing the dry spots.</li>
            <li> If you have very few imperfections it would completely cover everything.</li>
            <li> What I like about this foundation is that it provides a wide color selection for the consumers so you are bound to find your shade in stores.</li>
            <li> Other foundations will make my skin appear greasy but this doesn&#x27;t at all.</li>
            <li> I apply it with a foundation brush only complaint</li>
            <li> I have had trouble with foundation either being to flaky, oily or heavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always suffered with uneven skin tones but</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy at all</li>
            <li> It lasts a few hours without oil</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t feel heavy on my face</li>
            <li> I after using this a few times</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of wearing makeup solely because I do not like the feeling of it on my face..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using another brand for years, and until I used COVERGIRL&#x27;s foundation, I didn&#x27;t know I was using the wrong color for my skin, and the old stuff felt so oily and thick.</li>
            <li> I am usually around the sun a lot</li>
            <li> so it is hard finding a foundation that works for me</li>
            <li> Cons: sticky, hard to blend, glossy.</li>
            <li> so a little squeeze of the bottle will send a lot of but other than that I have nothing bad to say.</li>
            <li> Im obsessed with this foundation and HIGHLYY</li>
            <li> However, I’m not impressed.</li>
            <li> I hate writing negative reviews.</li>
            <li> I was sceptical because I&#x27;ve had bad experiences with their products.</li>
            <li> I recommend everyone to try this foundation you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Hate it.</li>
            <li> I hate to say it, influenster and covergirl, this was not a hit for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I adore this foundation; light, smooth, not oily and all around awesome! I have had trouble with foundation either being to flaky, oily or heavy. Even with this being covergirl I was sceptical because I&#x27;ve had bad experiences with their products. But seriously, it works amazing. I&#x27;m normally fair-ivory, so I use their #105. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of wearing makeup solely because I do not like the feeling of it on my face.. However this makeup is totally different. I put it on and couldn&#x27;t even feel it. Its like I wasn&#x27;t wearing anything at all. So in other words, its amazing! (:</li>
            <li> One of my favorite cover girl products, great coverage and good for every day use.</li>
            <li> I received this free from Influenster for texting purpose and I love it! It blends so easily and covers up any flaws. Other foundations will make my skin appear greasy but this doesn&#x27;t at all.</li>
            <li> I got some free stuff in my VOXBOX from influenster!(: Had the chance to test out cover girls ready set gorgeous foundation. For a drug store product its actually pretty amazing, its similar to the Laura Mercier foundation. So if you ladies wanted an alternative for a more cheaper foundation I would highly suggest this product for anyone with oily to combination skin. I don&#x27;t recommend it to anyone that has dry skin, just because this foundation leaves more of a matte finish and can dry out your skin a bit when applying.&lt;br /&gt;@COVERGIRL, and @Influenster #instaGLAM and #COVERGIRL.</li>
            <li> I LOVE my new COVERGIRL Ready, Set Gorgeous Liquid Makeup Foundation! I&#x27;ve been using another brand for years, and until I used COVERGIRL&#x27;s foundation, I didn&#x27;t know I was using the wrong color for my skin, and the old stuff felt so oily and thick. This foundation goes on evenly and has a lot of coverage. My skin looks so much smoother with this foundation! I&#x27;ve always suffered with uneven skin tones but no one will ever know when I wear this. I will definitely be sticking to this foundation from here on out! I received this product complimentary from influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I loved this! It said medium coverage, but I was blessed with full coverage! It covered everything. I have a very acne prone face, and this foundation covered everything!</li>
            <li> This foundation is perfect. It has the best price, especially at Walmart, and goes on nice and flawlessly. It makes your skin look natural and does not get oily throughout the day. Definitely something I will have in my beauty routine forever!</li>
            <li> I recently received this item in the mail from Influenster to test out and review. And I really liked it, it was easy to apply and to remove. and it wasn&#x27;t greasy or clumpy. I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Although I didnt not receive this in my Influenster Dean&#x27;s List VoxBox, I decided to go out to my nearest drugstore and buy this product to test and review. I am quite a fan of Covergirl and its products so I had some high expectations for this foundation. What I like about this foundation is that it provides a wide color selection for the consumers so you are bound to find your shade in stores. The foundation in itself provides a light to medium coverage, although it can be layered. The foundation glides on smoothly and tends to set in a short amount of time. I am usually around the sun a lot so I was worried that the foundation would start rubbing off or smearing, however, that was not the case. This foundation is quite light and easy to carry in your makeup bag for touchups. As a college student, it is quite helpful to be able to rely on a foundation and not have to worry about it in between classes. Definitely a product worth trying</li>
            <li> This foundation has become my FAVORITE to use. I have combination skin and on oily days it helps dry my face out and on dry days it doesn&#x27;t dry it out more. It completely covers my whole face and blends right in with my skin tone. My blemishes disappear with this foundation whereas others I have to use concealer and foundation. It literally feels like there is nothing on my skin and doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out! I love how well it works, especially since its so affordable! Im obsessed with this foundation and HIGHLYY recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I received this for free thanks to the DL VoxBox and Influenster in order for me to review. It goes on smooth without leaving my face cakey and it really helps me even out my skin tone! I like the travel sized container as well!</li>
            <li> This is a really great coverup. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy at all and it stays on throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Covergirl Ready, Set, Gorgeous foundation. It provides great coverage while feeling very light. It&#x27;s a great foundation to use when you like to layer your make up. I use one layer all over my face and double up on any scars I have and it doesn&#x27;t look cackey at all. I bought it in three different shades because my skin color changes drastically from summer to winter.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this foundation, many other kinds will dry out my skin and not give much coverage but this one does! Good job Covergirl, i will be buying this for sure in the future!</li>
            <li> I love the new covergirl ready set gorgeous cover up! It goes on so smoothly and matches my skin color perfectly! I definitely recommend!!!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite foundations I have used in years, my skin is oily with dry areas so it is hard finding a foundation that works for me but this one combats my oily without showing the dry spots. I also love that it stays matte for a few hours without a touch up, and the last thing would be how smooth it goes on but has full coverage. I did Receive this product complimentary of influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> Amazing coverage and no smearing, and nice subtle glow. Definitely reccommending to friends</li>
            <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;I love the matte look this foundation gives. I also find that it is a medium coverage on my skin, yet feels lightweight and not cakey at all. It also lasts all day and  can withstand the hot weather of Texas. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I received it complimentary from influenster for testing purposes and I already purchased the rest of the set, it has phenomenonal coverage and is great for a dry face. I moat certainly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I received this in my DLVoxBox through Influenster to try and review for free. I was pleased with the results after wearing it for a week.. It applied smooth and even, matched my skin tone once blended, it was lightweight. It lasted throughout the day with medium coverage. I have sensitive skin, so I&#x27;m glad to reach for this foundation when I am in a rush.</li>
            <li> I have tried Covergirl&#x27;s 3-in1 foundation and while it was nice, it almost always oxidized on my skin. With this product, I doesn&#x27;t do it. Maybe because it&#x27;s &amp;#34;oil controlling&amp;#34;? Regardless, it&#x27;s a great foundation. The color was spot on, didn&#x27;t oxidize, blended easily and I loved the tube design. It lasts a few hours without oil but beware, it&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;all day long&amp;#34; foundation like it claims. I do have oily skin so that might just be why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would repurchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I received this from Influenster for free for my honest review)</li>
            <li> I received this product complementary from Influenster for testing and review purposes!! I really like this foundation! I am not normally a huge fan of drug store foundation because I have really oily skin and it seems to break me out.  I really enjoy the consistency of the make up and I think it feels light but still gives you that full coverage look.  I could only wear this make up a few days before passing along to my sister because the color was much too dark for me ( I usually get the lightest tone available ) but my sister has been loving it as well! Instead of going back to my $60+ lancome foundation I might stop in at walgreens and get my color and try it again!</li>
            <li> I love this foundation. I was so impresses with it. I got this in an influenster box. I normaly buy realy expensive foundation, but I am realy impressed with this product! It does not make me oily, and covers well.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this foundation! I received a free sample via Influenster DLVoxBox and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product! I usually skip foundation because I could not find one that I absolutely loved, but this changed everything! Such a lightweight and amazing foundation!</li>
            <li> This is the only make up that has matched exactly to my skin tone, it isn&#x27;t shiny and covers perfectly!!!</li>
            <li> Received this prouduct in my influenster vox box and I have to say this was an amazing product it&#x27;s a soft feeling and a little goes along way it helped to cover my flaws and didn&#x27;t break my skin out I love this product</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I received this product for free for testing/review purposes from Influenster.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this foundation on Halloween to really test how well it stayed on. With a test for color match on my hand, it washed off without soap or really any scrubbing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this isn&#x27;t the right foundation because of the lack of staying power. I&#x27;m pretty oily and this really didn&#x27;t work well. I ended up putting my regular foundation on over it because 1) it didn&#x27;t cover as well as I wanted and 2) the non staying power.  If you don&#x27;t have the problems that I do with oily and red skin, then this may work well for you</li>
            <li> I received this product for testing purposes from Influenster. I really enjoy this foundation. It gives a nice and even coverage and blends very nicely. It is a light foundation so i don&#x27;t feel like i&#x27;m wearing it. It is a liquid foundation and not a mousse so a little squeeze of the bottle will send a lot of but other than that I have nothing bad to say. I will probably buy this again and will definitely recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a new foundation</li>
            <li> I received this for free to try from Influenster for testing purposes in my Dean&#x27;s List VoxBox. I am usually not a huge fan of foundation, but this proved to be better than anything I have tried so far. it was slightly darker than my skin tone, but it blends pretty well. it didn&#x27;t feel heavy on my face and I loved that it was oil free as it didn&#x27;t add any shine. because it doesn&#x27;t match perfectly to my skin tone I don&#x27;t use it as much as I would like to.</li>
            <li> I received this complimentary for testing purposes. I have a slew of issues with this product, but first onto the few things I like about it. It goes on very smooth, blends well, and has an overall nice finish. Things I do not like: if you put any product over it it begins to look very cakey, it is super oily and makes me breakout, it was the wrong color even though this is the shade I typically wear-yes I know they change but the bottle shows it darker! So, I used it to do Halloween makeup, and it works as a great highlighter. But, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it on my own and wouldn&#x27;t really suggest any one else should unless you know for sure it is the correct color and you don&#x27;t contour your face.</li>
            <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. Makes skin very soft and almost has a matte effect to it. I wish it had a tad bit more coverage but still pretty good. I would like to try the powder as well, but I have heard that the colors in the powder vary from the numbering of the liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive this in my DL VoxBox but I decided to try it. I have to say I was very impressed with it. It has become my new favorite foundation. Makes my face feel so smooth and it doesn&#x27;t even feel like I have foundation on my face and I love that! I recommend everyone to try this foundation you wont be disappointed. I have always been a big fan of cover girl and this product made me an even bigger fan. LOVEE!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing foundation. I was sent this from Influesnter to try out and I love it. The shade is a bit too dark and does show up in different lights with my skin tone being different. You need to make sure you get the right shade because of this. It blends, smooths and covers wonderfully. I can&#x27;t wait to go out and get my shade which might be 110 or 105. I love it and recommend it.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product for free from influenster, all opinions are my own. I honestly love this foundation. I would say it is light-medium coverage, but it&#x27;s very buildable without looking cakey. I have repurchased this twice on my own since receiving this in my box, and it&#x27;s definitely what I reach for in my collection.</li>
            <li> Too oily for my t-zone, but otherwise nice coverage..</li>
            <li> I received this foundation free from influester in my dean&#x27;s list VOXBOX. I was really excited because I have been in the market for a new foundations. I was pleasantly surprised that this foundation felt light on my skin and blended into it perfectly. I would highly recommend this product for anyone wishing to look absolutely amazing and feel that way too!!</li>
            <li> I received this foundation from Influenster for testing purposes. I like it, it goes on very smooth and covers your flaws.</li>
            <li> I hate writing negative reviews. Hate it. But here goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve been switching between a matte mousse foundation (which I love) and a BareMinerals powder set so I was excited to see some “regular” foundation to try out in the Dean’s List VoxBox. However, I’m not impressed. Pros: color matches my skin tone well, decent coverage. Cons: sticky, hard to blend, glossy. I felt like I was rubbing glue on my face.&lt;br /&gt;So, I after using this a few times I’m pretty sure I won’t be buying it in the future, and I won’t be recommending it to any of my friends either. I hate to say it, influenster and covergirl, this was not a hit for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I received this complimentary product from Influenster for testing/reviewing purposes)</li>
            <li> thanks to Influenster for this complimentary product, I was able to try it out and I love it! It seamlessly covers my dark spots and red areas quickly. It doesn&#x27;t look caked up either!</li>
            <li> i love the new ready, set, gorgeous liquid makeup foundation!! It works amazingly!:)</li>
            <li> This was my first liquid foundation and I am extremely impressed with it. To be so lightweight, the coverage is amazing. If you have very few imperfections it would completely cover everything. I have some acne and it covers it enough to where I feel comfortable leaving the house. Love it!</li>
            <li> Works great! I apply it with a foundation brush only complaint is I have to apply it to my face one area at a time. The product dries fairly quickly... So I found applying it to my face one section at a time fixes the issue. That way no product is waisted. It requires a bit more blending than other foundations. But once im finished its flawless with great natural airbrush looking coverage. It works just as well and better than some department store brands. If you dont want to spend a minute extra applying foundation then I dont recommend this foundation. If you want great all day coverage for a cheap price, and dont mind spending an extra minute on ur foundation this product I highly recommend. This comming from a cosmetologist!</li>
            <li> Great foundation goes on smooth and blends easily. Still searching for my shade due to the shades are alot lighter than most other foundations. I am normally a creamy natural and i am going a shade up every time to find my right shade</li>
            <li> Covergirl ready set go foundation is the truth light weight but has medium coverage and has amazing stay power last all day no melting in this hot texas weather and at a great price I was sent mine by influenster #DLV VOX BOX</li>
            <li> I got this product free to review from influenster. I really love this foundation because it feels soft and light on my skin and lets my skin breathe. This foundation gives my face a flawless look.</li>
