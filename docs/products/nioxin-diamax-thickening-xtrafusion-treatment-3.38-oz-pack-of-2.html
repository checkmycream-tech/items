            <li>It&#x27;s worth the results.</li>
            <li>Service was good and product was exactly as I expected.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful product for people with thin hair</li>
            <li>I recommend those with fine hair and especially those with gray hair which breaks off easily to try this product.</li>
            <li>I am a Stylist and can honestly say that after spine surgery several summers ago I forgot not to use a hot curling iron on my hair until all the meds from surgery were out of my system.</li>
            <li>I have fine to normal hair,.  </li>
            <li>hair grew super fast in one month even after I cut 4/5 inches off after using Nioxin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will continue using it with pleasure, thank you very much.</li>
            <li>My stylist turned me on to this stuff - and it really works!  </li>
            <li>My hair is not 100% back, but I am no longer able to polish my dome.</li>
            <li>Two people actually have told me my hair shined so much more</li>
            <li>No big deal really because I love the results.</li>
            <li>would certainly recommend trying it.</li>
            <li>cause it certainly makes your hair thinner if you don&#x27;t keep up with its use.</li>
            <li>no particular findings for hair volume up for just few days use, but the liquid smells very good.</li>
            <li>This thickening treatment really works well on my short fine hair.  </li>
            <li>This product works great for giving a little extra lift in the crown and forefront area of my hair.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair look so much thicker.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much</li>
            <li>It give my hair so much body and thicknes, like a day at the beach.  </li>
            <li>Diamax really makes my hair feel and look fuller.  </li>
            <li>I have very thinning hair</li>
            <li>My hair looks much thicker.  </li>
            <li>Really like this product it does thicken the hair.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper on line that in the salon.  </li>
            <li>I started using Nioxin products and they made my hair grow so fast.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t believe how fast Nioxin products make your hair grow.</li>
            <li>*** Thanks</li>
            <li>Really works</li>
            <li>THEY REALLY MAKE YOUR HAIR GROW</li>
            <li>Really like the product</li>
            <li>and I love the product but due to the expense I decided to order it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Have purchased other Nioxin products that seem to work better.  </li>
            <li>Would not purchase this particular item again.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend to others.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend for&lt;br /&gt;anyone</li>
            <li>i had high expectations from this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The whole combo seems to bring out more curl in my wavy hair, but that lets me go an extra day without the wash and blow dry routine.</li>
            <li>I received the product on time and it was well packaged but the liquid itself is much thinner than my old bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it tkaes a few months to notice the difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten this before and continue to use, hair hasn&#x27;t been the same since chemo and this used regularly after washing and made hair start to fill out and be strong, high recommend for thinning hair.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li>I have not seen new hair growth yet.  </li>
            <li>I am still hoping for new hair growth.</li>
            <li>It really adds body to your hair and will last the whole day.</li>
            <li>Received this product, not in original box and the nozzle taped with some sort of white medical tape.  </li>
            <li>Seems to work better if you blow dry your hair after putting it on your roots/scalp instead of just leaving your hair to air dry.</li>
            <li>but I can clearly see the difference now.  </li>
            <li>but I hv done such b4 w/o Nioxin and it nvr grew this fast or got thicker..</li>
            <li>So far, I haven&#x27;t had any comments that my hair looks thicker or anything yet.</li>
            <li>On time and professional.</li>
            <li>EVEN MY HUSBAND SAID WOW</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>it really makes a big difference in how my hair looks.</li>
            <li>Love the product and how it makes my hair look and feel thick.  </li>
            <li>My hair is not only baby fine, it is brittle due to coloring, disease and medications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I actually have new hair growing!</li>
            <li>used on dry hair - it works a little better.</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight, thin hair.  </li>
            <li>I wash my hair every other day and use the product o dry hair both days along with a light styling product.  </li>
            <li>this stuff really works especially if used in conjunction with any over the counter generic minoxidil product</li>
            <li>Maybe I haven&#x27;t given it enough time, but I really don&#x27;t see much difference in my hair (wello, maybe a little).</li>
            <li>Too early to make a solid judgement.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s old healthy thick hair!!</li>
            <li>I use it directly after washing my hair, and it helps if I let my hair air dry to the point where it&#x27;s on the dryer side before applying the product.  </li>
            <li>Works miracles on fine thin hair.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair and this product makes a difference.  </li>
            <li>The Diamax thickening product is terrific for thin fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It basically thickens up the shafts of hair that you have, not really makes more hair grow, but it makes the hair you have look like there is more there, so the spots that are still thin are far less thin.</li>

            <li> Would not purchase this particular item again.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend for&lt;br /&gt;anyone</li>
            <li> i had high expectations from this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The whole combo seems to bring out more curl in my wavy hair, but that lets me go an extra day without the wash and blow dry routine.</li>
            <li> I received the product on time and it was well packaged but the liquid itself is much thinner than my old bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it tkaes a few months to notice the difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten this before and continue to use, hair hasn&#x27;t been the same since chemo and this used regularly after washing and made hair start to fill out and be strong, high recommend for thinning hair.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li> I have not seen new hair growth yet.  </li>
            <li> I am still hoping for new hair growth.</li>
            <li> It really adds body to your hair and will last the whole day.</li>
            <li> Received this product, not in original box and the nozzle taped with some sort of white medical tape.  </li>
            <li> Seems to work better if you blow dry your hair after putting it on your roots/scalp instead of just leaving your hair to air dry.</li>
            <li> but I can clearly see the difference now.  </li>
            <li> but I hv done such b4 w/o Nioxin and it nvr grew this fast or got thicker..</li>
            <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t had any comments that my hair looks thicker or anything yet.</li>
            <li> On time and professional.</li>
            <li> EVEN MY HUSBAND SAID WOW</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> it really makes a big difference in how my hair looks.</li>
            <li> Love the product and how it makes my hair look and feel thick.  </li>
            <li> My hair is not only baby fine, it is brittle due to coloring, disease and medications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually have new hair growing!</li>
            <li> used on dry hair - it works a little better.</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight, thin hair.  </li>
            <li> I wash my hair every other day and use the product o dry hair both days along with a light styling product.  </li>
            <li> this stuff really works especially if used in conjunction with any over the counter generic minoxidil product</li>
            <li> Maybe I haven&#x27;t given it enough time, but I really don&#x27;t see much difference in my hair (wello, maybe a little).</li>
            <li> Too early to make a solid judgement.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s old healthy thick hair!!</li>
            <li> I use it directly after washing my hair, and it helps if I let my hair air dry to the point where it&#x27;s on the dryer side before applying the product.  </li>
            <li> Works miracles on fine thin hair.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair and this product makes a difference.  </li>
            <li> The Diamax thickening product is terrific for thin fine hair.  </li>
            <li> It basically thickens up the shafts of hair that you have, not really makes more hair grow, but it makes the hair you have look like there is more there, so the spots that are still thin are far less thin.</li>
            <li> I am unable to give a fair review on this product because I have only used it a few times.</li>
            <li> But due to my medication &amp; thyroid my hair and I are in a fight to Stay Alive..</li>
            <li> Definitely boosts volume in my flat , body-less hair.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to tell the difference,hopefully it does well.</li>
            <li> Hair feels thicker, knots much less, and has much less breakage after using the first bottle.</li>
            <li> Have noticeably thinning hair, and tried the System 2 Scalp Treatment; it left my hair dull and very sticky.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t keep up with how fast my hair grows I like to wear it short and am always cutting and coloring it because of how fast it takes off.  </li>
            <li> it was long, thicker and healthier...</li>
            <li> So if you use this product, you gotta be in it for the long run</li>
            <li> unlike the other nioxin products purchased at my local salon.  </li>
            <li> Just spray on dry or damp root hair area, massage into the&lt;br /&gt;scalp and blow dry.  </li>
            <li> I have also used it on dry hair, still works but makes hair feel dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I am noticing any thickening of my hair, but it may be too early to tell.  </li>
            <li> used on damp hair it  leaves your hair very dry.</li>
            <li> Product arrived before its expected arrival time.</li>
            <li> but there price was the least expensive for bthis product I love.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not sure if it was getting rid of dead hair on my head or my new meds &amp; Thyroiditis</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that the bottles are small and since you have to apply the product liberally, a bottle does not last for long.</li>
            <li> In other reviews customers have claimed it &amp;#34;burned&amp;#34; their scalp.</li>
            <li> Tried other Nioxin products and nothing works like the Root Lifter.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> The product does make your hair thicker and works well with other products.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money at all.</li>
            <li> You can not go wrong with growing your hair fast with Nioxin Products.  </li>
            <li> This item is quite expensive, but much to my surprise</li>
            <li> scalp looks and feels healthier  with less hair breakage.</li>
            <li> I have previously used this product and it meets with my needs.  </li>
            <li> It also has a slight (very slight) medicinal scent to it.</li>
            <li> I have used Diamax for a few months now</li>
            <li> Took a few weeks to notice</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend this product for woman with thin hair.</li>
            <li> I use it after I shower and wash my hair, I spray it on and then style as usual.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure yet</li>
            <li> This product noticeably makes a difference, but i&#x27;ve started to notice that on days when you don&#x27;t use the diamax my hair looked thinner then usual on a day without using the nioxin.</li>
            <li> i have been using nioxin diamax for the past 6 months..</li>
            <li> My hair came back very thin after chemo.</li>
            <li> It is also hard to notice something changing on yourself when you see yourself every day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try a little longer but my hair is still thin.</li>
            <li> I have re-ordered at least 3 times.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too soon to say it works but at least my hair stopped falling out.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair seem thick.  </li>
            <li> Is very expensive , but you only need a drop.</li>
            <li> and it is less expensive on Amazon</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;However, my hair started shedding badly around the 3rd week..</li>
            <li> My hair was getting really thin in the front and once I started to use these products my hair started to grow and my hair looked fuller.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;***(A secret</li>
            <li> I have thin hair from Chemo treatments.</li>
            <li> I believe this is a bootleg product.</li>
            <li> Product instructions difficult to read.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair - it doesn&#x27;t turn into glue when you apply it to your hair and, it does give your hair body.</li>
            <li> Contacting Amazon about returning this very disappointing product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> I have used Diamax for a few months now and I love the product but due to the expense I decided to order it on Amazon.  I received the product on time and it was well packaged but the liquid itself is much thinner than my old bottle. Beware of ordering this product on Amazon. Guess you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> this product does everything as claimed.  Makes my hair thicker with no resido.  More words RIDICULAS I said it all</li>
            <li> I love this product, it makes my hair appear fuller and much better buy thru amazon.</li>
            <li> Ships fast, great product</li>
            <li> Makes hair look fuller</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff! It makes my hair look so much thicker.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to get this....just in the nick of time!  I love Nioxin!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product...best thickening for thin hair I have ever tried.  And the ordering/shipping process was flawless.  I will do this again...and again!</li>
            <li> adds body but I like to wash it out every day and start over.  I just feel cleaner but could go 2 days</li>
            <li> I love this product &amp; will continue to buy it as long as it&#x27;s available! It arrived right on time and was in perfect condition! Thanks so much</li>
            <li> My hair is feeling and looking thicker.  Better price than retail. Would like instruction for use to be included.  Product instructions difficult to read.</li>
            <li> Have purchased other Nioxin products that seem to work better.  Did not notice any increase in hair thickness, growth or anything.....unlike the other nioxin products purchased at my local salon.  Would not purchase this particular item again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten this before and continue to use, hair hasn&#x27;t been the same since chemo and this used regularly after washing and made hair start to fill out and be strong, high recommend for thinning hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight, thin hair.  My stylist turned me on to this stuff - and it really works!  The product says it gives the illusion that you have 6000 more hairs on your head - I would agree.  I wash my hair every other day and use the product o dry hair both days along with a light styling product.  I have told several friends about it.</li>
            <li> This actually works. Took a few weeks to notice but I can clearly see the difference now.  I love it.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by a dermatologist and is doing I good job.  I have re-ordered at least 3 times.</li>
            <li> Everyone should try this.  My hair was listless and since I&#x27;ve started using this I can tell the texture of my hair is changing and getting thicker.  Try it and you&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Works miracles on fine thin hair.  have been using it for several years. Would highly recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Great product quick delivery</li>
            <li> This product is great.  My hair has more body to it and is easier to style.</li>
            <li> This thickening treatment really works well on my short fine hair.  Just spray on dry or damp root hair area, massage into the&lt;br /&gt;scalp and blow dry.  It give my hair so much body and thicknes, like a day at the beach.  Would highly recommend for&lt;br /&gt;anyone with fine or thinning hair.</li>
            <li> It is an easy to use product, and helps with some body on my very baby fine hair. In other reviews customers have claimed it &amp;#34;burned&amp;#34; their scalp. It is a very light tingle, of a menthol type. I have used it for many months and there have been no side effects. I recommend this product for someone wanting that extra thickening without hesitation.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and it does make your hair appear to be fuller and thicker.  I will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> This product does almost nothing to add lift, body or &amp;#34;thickening&amp;#34; to my hair. Been searching for a replacement for Nioxin Volumizing Reflectives Root Lifter which was a 5 Star product but suddenly disappeared!  Why do they do away with products that actually do what they say? Tried other Nioxin products and nothing works like the Root Lifter. Will have to try another brand... I guess.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it makes my thinning hair easier to manage and style.  My hair seems to be fuller after styling.</li>
            <li> no particular findings for hair volume up for just few days use, but the liquid smells very good.</li>
            <li> Diamax really makes my hair feel and look fuller.  I use it every time I shampoo and style my hair.</li>
            <li> Tried it once, now I&#x27;m hooked, so it will now be a routine product for my hair care.  I have been using the nioxin line for many years.</li>
            <li> this stuff really works especially if used in conjunction with any over the counter generic minoxidil product&lt;br /&gt;(if you are able to use it)&lt;br /&gt;i suspect you have to continue using it forever though or you lose all the benefit</li>
            <li> I have very thinning hair and I noticed a decline of hair loss with each shampoo when using this product.</li>
            <li> It did nothing for my hair! Contacting Amazon about returning this very disappointing product. I used it daily for a week, thinking it might start working after repeated applications but it didn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> Not worth the money at all.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a difference. Not worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> My hair has never looked so good! My hair was getting really thin in the front and once I started to use these products my hair started to grow and my hair looked fuller.</li>
            <li> Maybe I haven&#x27;t given it enough time, but I really don&#x27;t see much difference in my hair (wello, maybe a little).</li>
            <li> My hair is so fine, but when I spray this stuff in my hair it truly thickens it up. I use it after I shower and wash my hair, I spray it on and then style as usual. Unfortunately it is only topical and not permanent so it only works when I use it. It also has a slight (very slight) medicinal scent to it. No big deal really because I love the results. Will continue to buy this product. And this seller is amazing, thank you for the fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Product really works to make your hair looks like it has more volume to it. Nice pleasant smell, nothing overpowering. Seems to work better if you blow dry your hair after putting it on your roots/scalp instead of just leaving your hair to air dry. Wish the bottle is bigger in size for the price tag.</li>
            <li> Simply put, I have been on Nioxin now for 16 months. My hair is not 100% back, but I am no longer able to polish my dome. This Diamax stuff I was honestly leery about, but it did what it was supposed to. It basically thickens up the shafts of hair that you have, not really makes more hair grow, but it makes the hair you have look like there is more there, so the spots that are still thin are far less thin. A bit spendy, but considering the alternatives, this stuff is worth it!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time  And this is my second time using this product. Two people actually have told me my hair shined so much more, what was I doing different.</li>
            <li> Thank you for my order</li>
            <li> The product does make your hair thicker and works well with other products.  Would definitely recommend this product for woman with thin hair.</li>
            <li> The product works as promised.  My hair looks much thicker.  Only complaint is that the bottles are small and since you have to apply the product liberally, a bottle does not last for long.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this Nioxin..&lt;br /&gt;My hair grew super fast in one month even after I cut 4/5 inches off after using Nioxin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally my hair is getting back to it&#x27;s old healthy thick hair!! Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this along w/ Nioxin and Diamax..&lt;br /&gt;I used both every night religiously for a month and I didn&#x27;t put any heat in my hair(well I hvnt for a year). But due to my medication &amp; thyroid my hair and I are in a fight to Stay Alive..lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m excited to have gorgeous hair..Yay! So w/ Nioxin I&#x27;m winning..&lt;br /&gt;However, my hair started shedding badly around the 3rd week.. But I&#x27;m not sure if it was getting rid of dead hair on my head or my new meds &amp; Thyroiditis were causing this..&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t panic.. Why? 1). I am use to this happening and 2.) hair grows bk..&lt;br /&gt;***(A secret if you want to stop shedding immediately use GARLIC- yes smelling Garlic for 2/3 hours mixed w/ reg condition and it will stop for 2/3 months)... U will stink.. Ugghh.. I didn&#x27;t do it this time b/c the smell but after I finally washed &amp; permed my hair it was long, thicker and healthier... Love it.. Can wear my own hair w/o any extensions..&lt;br /&gt;I love extensions but I I like scratching my scalp more..&lt;br /&gt;I am scared to stop using this product b/c I wonder if it will fall out or stop growing super fast&lt;br /&gt;Btw, I did take lots of Biotin and vitamins but I hv done such b4 w/o Nioxin and it nvr grew this fast or got thicker..&lt;br /&gt;Loving my hair!!</li>
            <li> Really like this product it does thicken the hair.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product and does work. a bit pricey and i lost my job so have to wait until i get another job before purchasing more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I am noticing any thickening of my hair, but it may be too early to tell.  It is also hard to notice something changing on yourself when you see yourself every day.  So far, I haven&#x27;t had any comments that my hair looks thicker or anything yet.</li>
            <li> Fast service - nice price!!</li>
            <li> Really good product and smells good but more time is needed to see visible results&lt;br /&gt;So buy it and try</li>
            <li> used on damp hair it  leaves your hair very dry. used on dry hair - it works a little better. I have thin hair from Chemo treatments. My hair just never grew in well and I am always looking for products that will improve the appearance of my hair. i had high expectations from this product. Maybe I need to give it a longer try.</li>
            <li> On time and professional. Pricey but there price was the least expensive for bthis product I love. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> This product is great.  I use it all the time to help maintain strong hair.  Very satisfied with the pricing and the product.</li>
            <li> Love the product and how it makes my hair look and feel thick.  After using the product for 4 months now it feels like it is working!!!</li>
            <li> Good product Works as advertised and good value. .. . . . . . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to tell the difference,hopefully it does well.I&#x27;m sure it tkaes a few months to notice the difference.</li>
            <li> My husband brought this home from the salon to use on his hair.  I have thinning hair up front in my bang area.  I tried this product and felt that it gave more thickness and structure.  My thinning is not as noticeable when I use this product.  I will continue to use it.  Much cheaper on line that in the salon.  I bought it 2 for the price of 1.  Give it a try if thinning if a problem.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair and this product makes a difference.  I also use the Nioxin shampoo for thinning hair and like it, too.</li>
            <li> This product works great for giving a little extra lift in the crown and forefront area of my hair.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Nioxin Diamax has been a life saver for my thinning hair.  I use it directly after washing my hair, and it helps if I let my hair air dry to the point where it&#x27;s on the dryer side before applying the product.  I was happy with this seller&#x27;s follow through after ordering my Diamax and will use them for future orders.</li>
            <li> Too early to make a solid judgement.  But it appears to be working to thicken my hair.  Time will tell....</li>
            <li> This product works without buildup and stickiness .My scalp looks and feels healthier  with less hair breakage.I recommend those with fine hair and especially those with gray hair which breaks off easily to try this product.</li>
            <li> Have noticeably thinning hair, and tried the System 2 Scalp Treatment; it left my hair dull and very sticky.  This product works !  It adds volume and shine without any gummy residue.</li>
            <li> Hair cutter recommended this. It is pretty good.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li> This product is really good.</li>
            <li> Nioxin is one of the best products on the Market. I am a Stylist and can honestly say that after spine surgery several summers ago I forgot not to use a hot curling iron on my hair until all the meds from surgery were out of my system. My hair stuck to my Marcel Iron.  I actually had to burn my hair off to get the Iron out.  I started using Nioxin products and they made my hair grow so fast. You won&#x27;t believe how fast Nioxin products make your hair grow. Just remember you have to wash and condition your hair every day for great results.  I can&#x27;t keep up with how fast my hair grows I like to wear it short and am always cutting and coloring it because of how fast it takes off.  You can not go wrong with growing your hair fast with Nioxin Products.  Just remember to wash and condition with Nioxin every day.  It&#x27;s worth the results.</li>
            <li> Product arrived before its expected arrival time. I love the prduct does what it says. Is very expensive , but you only need a drop. would certainly recommend trying it.</li>
            <li> well I absolutely love the stuff if that&#x27;s what you want to hear but why should I have to write a review about something that people of use is good quality product and what the f*** good is my review going to do who the f*** am i nobody I just like the s*** Thanks</li>
            <li> My hairdresser gave me a sample of thias product and I loved it. I decided I did not want to run out so I went to Amazon to find it. The product is the same, the results are great and the price cannot be beat!!!</li>
            <li> I have not seen new hair growth yet.  I have used for 3 months.  But I like the product and it is less expensive on Amazon that at Ulta.  I am still hoping for new hair growth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure yet but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be working.  I&#x27;ll try a little longer but my hair is still thin.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually plumps up the hair and gives it extra body.  It works.</li>
            <li> Makes fine hair very manageable</li>
            <li> I have previously used this product and it meets with my needs.  My hair came back very thin after chemo.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  I have very thin hair - it doesn&#x27;t turn into glue when you apply it to your hair and, it does give your hair body.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair seem thick.  Really works</li>
            <li> Service was good and product was exactly as I expected.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> It is a fantastic product. I will continue using it with pleasure, thank you very much. I will also tell my friends</li>
            <li> Am trying a combo of the 3 part system and this product and it seems to work.  My hairdresser did not notice a difference, but I had only recently started using the product.  The whole combo seems to bring out more curl in my wavy hair, but that lets me go an extra day without the wash and blow dry routine.</li>
            <li> This product noticeably makes a difference, but i&#x27;ve started to notice that on days when you don&#x27;t use the diamax my hair looked thinner then usual on a day without using the nioxin. So if you use this product, you gotta be in it for the long run cause it certainly makes your hair thinner if you don&#x27;t keep up with its use.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product for people with thin hair</li>
            <li> I LOVE ALL NIOXIN PRODUCTS THEY REALLY MAKE YOUR HAIR GROW EVEN MY HUSBAND SAID WOW YOUR HAIR IS SO MUCH THICKER!!! WOW GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Gives my hair an extra boost which I needed.  Product is very good for making your hair feel fuller.</li>
            <li> I use this product with following each shampoo and it gives volume at the roots.</li>
            <li> This product has worked wonders for my baby fine, brittle hair. Hair feels thicker, knots much less, and has much less breakage after using the first bottle. My hair is not only baby fine, it is brittle due to coloring, disease and medications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update in April 2015. It has been 2 years now since I started using this product. My hair has never been in such good condition. My hairdresser is impressed with the results. I actually have new hair growing!</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed with genetic women&#x27;s hair loss in April and started using the Nioxin product line.  The Diamax thickening product is terrific for thin fine hair.  It really adds body to your hair and will last the whole day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too soon to say it works but at least my hair stopped falling out.</li>
            <li> i have been using nioxin diamax for the past 6 months..my hair does feel thicker, works best on wet hair. I have also used it on dry hair, still works but makes hair feel dry.</li>
            <li> I am unable to give a fair review on this product because I have only used it a few times. I originally bought it from my salon and I loved the brand. I actually use the shampoo and conditioner now.</li>
            <li> Really like the product</li>
            <li> I have fine to normal hair,.  This gives the body I need. And make it easier to manage. I would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> Received this product, not in original box and the nozzle taped with some sort of white medical tape.  The product leaked and I returned it.  I did receive a full refund.  I believe this is a bootleg product.</li>
            <li> Definitely boosts volume in my flat , body-less hair.  Not a miracle worker but I have yet to find that Holy Grail.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted...great price!</li>
            <li> This item is quite expensive, but much to my surprise it really makes a big difference in how my hair looks. The claim actually matches the results. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
