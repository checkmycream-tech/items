            <li>Still sexy and unique, as it was for my beautiful grand mother and mother</li>
            <li>Years ago it was rating as one of the top 5 fragrances that men liked.</li>

            <li>A wonderful fragrance, very feminine, there is only a passing resemblance to the Original Shalimar (which I also love), but this one is delicious too!</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>i personnaly love the smell</li>
            <li>this is not the authentic Shalimar.</li>
            <li>I tried the parfum this time and still not the authentic Shalimar.</li>
            <li>your Grandma&#x27;s&amp;#34; perfume any more.</li>
            <li>She thought it was not sold any more.</li>
            <li>She said yes but doubted I could find it any more.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about ordering perfume online</li>
            <li>Normally, I love this perfume.  </li>
            <li>and you should probably not take any more orders for it.  </li>
            <li>I fell in love with this fragrance, and it is now my signature scent.</li>
            <li>The presentation is lovely and adds to any dresser top.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume it is a timeless fragrance.</li>
            <li>Guerlain has such wonderful stories on how each of their fragrances came into existence</li>
            <li>Shalimar has been my signature perfume most of my life.</li>
            <li>Stronger, but famous</li>
            <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;Since 1925</li>
            <li>Shalimar is my wife&#x27;s favorite (and I agree). . .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>It is really another kind!</li>
            <li>Nice and good price, but not the original Shalimar like a thought, my fault, I didn&#x27;t know what the Guerlain meant , real stuff and does smell great, just a different make of it</li>
            <li>My mother says she has to spray it and walk into it because it&#x27;s so strong.</li>
            <li>was a kind of a shock , at the same time a great enjoyment, thanks a lot  to Amazon, but a vison of our changing world!</li>
            <li>AS OTHERS HAVE NOTED, I STILL USE THE ORIGINAL SHALIMAR PERFUME WHICH I LOVE FROM FOREVER MORE, BUT, THE INITIAL I USE DAILY AND FEEL SO LIGHT AND BRIGHT AND HAPPY.  </li>
            <li>It is feminine, soft, powdery, sexy in its own way but elegant.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The original is still available.  </li>
            <li>For now, the Shalimar Initial is exquisite and lovely and it is definitely not Shalimar.</li>
            <li>perfume is lovely, light and very feminine.</li>
            <li>, the price is so much more reasonable this way.</li>
            <li>and, when compared to authentic shalimar, really missed the mark</li>
            <li>but it is its own unique formula, a modern twist of a classic.</li>
            <li>it is a clean fresh scent</li>
            <li>They responded quickly to my inquiry and delivery was within a week.  </li>
            <li>This is very nice, a little fruitier than the original.  </li>
            <li>long ago, when starting in the &amp;#34;Art Decos&amp;#34; time...still beloved today by many!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s old and hasn&#x27;t been stored correctly.  </li>
            <li>An old favorite with an updated lighter scent.</li>
            <li>Having been during my long life a Guerlain&#x27;s fan i was very pleased to read  </li>
            <li>it has been a success...</li>
            <li>I say this because it does not smell right and the color is darker than it should be.  </li>
            <li>Reordered the right one.</li>
            <li>Love the smell very feminine it so unique and lasting</li>
            <li>It is pure seduction!</li>
            <li>I am a college student and nice things are not really attainable right now.</li>
            <li>saw that this bottle was 3.4 oz and the price was very, very, reasonable from what I saw in stores.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Guerlain&#x27;s  new perfume called  &amp;#34;Shalimar Parfume initial&amp;#34; arrived safely, sooner than expected and perfect, as usually Guerlain&#x27;s products are.</li>
            <li>Box, plastic wrap, and perfume was as it should be, brand new and original.  </li>
            <li>Give time for yourself to get used to it, you will smell the different notes, the complexity which is lacking in most \\&quot;modern\\&quot; perfumes.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was fast too!</li>
            <li>Initial is an okay fragrance but is NOT Shalimar....</li>
            <li>I FIRST BOUGHT IT IN PARIS</li>
            <li>I really love this Shalimar Initial!</li>
            <li>This is a new, modern fragrance that plays off the original.  </li>
            <li>will anyhow stay faithful also, to the former Shalimar, so different, that is sure!</li>
            <li>ONE OF MY VERY FAVORITES-LOVE IT</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon....</li>
            <li>do not expect the real thing - it is not.</li>
            <li>It was an absolute winner.  </li>
            <li>I really recommend PERFUMESWORLD as a seller.</li>
            <li>This is genuine Shalimar Parfum Initial for a gift to the wife.  </li>
            <li>I think younger women might prefer it to the original.  </li>
            <li>I like both this and the original, but for different occasions.</li>
            <li>I love Shalimar, so I thought I&#x27;d try this other fragrance by Guerlain.  </li>
            <li>THIS IS SUCH A LOVELY DELICATE FEMININE SEXY FRAGRANCE, ITS NOT SHALIMAR</li>
            <li>I AGREE WITH ALL THE PREVIOUS REVIEWS THAT LOVE THIS &amp;#34;SHALIMAR INITIAL&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately wasted $50 during the whole process. :)</li>
            <li>I guess I should have read the description a little better.</li>
            <li>However I was pleasantly surprised that I really do like this fragrance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing it for a few years and have had more compliments than I can say.  </li>
            <li>i have experimented with a few scents over the years, and whatever was sent to me in that bottle was more of a nauseating jungle gardenia than</li>
            <li>I could have all lived with that if the actual smell was right.</li>
            <li>Not much like the original Shalimar.  </li>
            <li>I have wore Shalimar for over 20 years and must say this new Shalimar is my new favorite!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>This new scent smells like A Chemical and can&#x27;t wait to finish it.</li>
            <li>I shall be more careful next time</li>
            <li>Does it remind us of the pink French Champagne, my favorite???</li>
            <li>Shalimar Parfum Initial is not intended to be the same as the original Shalimar.  </li>
            <li>was this a imitation of the original SHALIMAR</li>
            <li>When I ordered this perfume, I thought I was ordering the old Shalimar perfume</li>
            <li>This perfume seems to be old.  </li>
            <li>which is over a century old.  </li>
            <li>I AM TRULY SORRY THAT THE DEPARTMENT STORES DO NOT CARRY IT ANY LONGER AND AM DELIGHTED THAT AMAZON HAS IT</li>
            <li>The price I paid for it through Amazon makes it possible for me to wear  as my &amp;#34;everyday&amp;#34; perfume, and wear a more expensive one for special occasions.</li>
            <li>One should not mess with perfection.</li>
            <li>other reviews here that gave this fragrance low ratings, are ones that thought they received the original Shalimar fragrance.  </li>
            <li>it was not true Shalamar which proves the old addage &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>any any of the major stores.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Both are completely two different animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wife currently went through a fragrance consultation at a major department store.  </li>
            <li>If not I feel cheated, as there apparently isn&#x27;t anyway to send it back or get a refund.  </li>
            <li>However, this parfum smells sweeter and by far doesn&#x27;t last as long as I am used to.</li>
            <li>I will add a new special touch: the subtle pink color !</li>
            <li>I found it on their website and now has made my wife smile like a little girl on Christmas day!!  </li>

            <li> The price I paid for it through Amazon makes it possible for me to wear  as my &amp;#34;everyday&amp;#34; perfume, and wear a more expensive one for special occasions.</li>
            <li> One should not mess with perfection.</li>
            <li> other reviews here that gave this fragrance low ratings, are ones that thought they received the original Shalimar fragrance.  </li>
            <li> it was not true Shalamar which proves the old addage &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> any any of the major stores.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Both are completely two different animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife currently went through a fragrance consultation at a major department store.  </li>
            <li> If not I feel cheated, as there apparently isn&#x27;t anyway to send it back or get a refund.  </li>
            <li> However, this parfum smells sweeter and by far doesn&#x27;t last as long as I am used to.</li>
            <li> I will add a new special touch: the subtle pink color !</li>
            <li> I found it on their website and now has made my wife smile like a little girl on Christmas day!!  </li>
            <li> color has never been pink in 40 years and the fragrance is a total scam---- nothing like the subtle, vanilla based original formula that i have grown up on........</li>
            <li> It will last her a long time.</li>
            <li> My Mom has used this for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> It has a scent that lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be the same scent, but lighter.  </li>
            <li> Also, before you purchase a perfume smell it in store, always review the notes to determine if it is for you, and be attentive to when purchasing online because the people who gave this seller a bad rating were confusing the original &amp;#34;leathery&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Even other people around me noticed the different smell and that it doesn&#x27;t stay on as long.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it lasts for eons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since I had opened the package I had no recourse other than to keep it.  </li>
            <li> Even the free hand creme smelled so bad I threw it out.</li>
            <li> it is not worth even trying ....</li>
            <li> Love this and hate you cant buy it</li>
            <li> shalimar initial is awful, doesn&#x27;t smell anything like shalimar original, like it was advertised !  </li>
            <li> This scent is not a pleasant smelling perfume and is NOTHING like regular Shalimar.</li>
            <li> She sprays it on everyday, so</li>
            <li> A FEW YEAR AGO, WHEN I CAME TO THE U.S</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t order, it is a waste of your money.</li>
            <li> this imposter shalimar was heavy, cloying  </li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed that it wasn&#x27;t the same old Shalimar that I&#x27;ve been wearing for almost 40 years.</li>
            <li> This latest bottle that I ordered  from you is terrible.  </li>
            <li> I am a perfume fanatic and this is a perfume you MUST buy!  </li>
            <li> my usual subtle fragrance--- what a scam!!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it turned out that I was right.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sorry Guerlain isn&#x27;t making it anymore.  </li>
            <li> An expensive lesson, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> An expensive lesson for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ignore the bad reviews from the confused consumers who thought they were purchasing Shalimar.  </li>
            <li> I NOTED THAT I WAS UNABLE TO BUY IT AT ANY OF THE STORES?!</li>
            <li> Has an unpleasant chemical smell.</li>
            <li> Very expensive lesson for me.</li>
            <li> It may be that I got the one bad bottle; I&#x27;ve ordered another in hopes that&#x27;s the case.  </li>
            <li> So, I was initially disappointed (no pun intended).</li>
            <li> SO I AM VERY MAD</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT...</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with Guerlain and how this scent has changed.</li>
            <li> , it is awful.</li>

            <li> ONE OF MY VERY FAVORITES-LOVE IT</li>
            <li> A wonderful fragrance, very feminine, there is only a passing resemblance to the Original Shalimar (which I also love), but this one is delicious too! Give time for yourself to get used to it, you will smell the different notes, the complexity which is lacking in most \\&quot;modern\\&quot; perfumes.  Next time, I am buying the largest bottle this comes in!</li>
            <li> Love this. Perfect for me.</li>
            <li> This is the perfume my wife was wearing when I met her 24 years ago!!  She still wears it whenever I could afford it! Thanks to Amazon....I found it on their website and now has made my wife smile like a little girl on Christmas day!!  :)</li>
            <li> it was a gift purchase from last year Christmas..  i personnaly love the smell</li>
            <li> this is not the authentic Shalimar. do not expect the real thing - it is not. I tried the parfum this time and still not the authentic Shalimar. This should not be allowed to be sold as Shalimar.</li>
            <li> the strength or odor was not the same. was this a imitation of the original SHALIMAR</li>
            <li> Love this and hate you cant buy it any any of the major stores.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Not your Grandma&#x27;s&amp;#34; perfume any more.</li>
            <li> Shalimar Parfum Initial is not intended to be the same as the original Shalimar.  The original is still available.  This is a new, modern fragrance that plays off the original.  It is not a knockoff as some claim, it is truly a Guerlain product..  My husband bought it for me as a gift, thinking it was the original, but I&#x27;m very happy he did.  This is very nice, a little fruitier than the original.  I think younger women might prefer it to the original.  I like both this and the original, but for different occasions.</li>
            <li> My Mom has used this for as long as I can remember. She thought it was not sold any more. I asked if she was almost out of it seeing I get it for her about every 2 years. She said yes but doubted I could find it any more. I had no fear of not finding it- Amazon does not disappoint me. My Mom turned 91 and she was delighted with her gift!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this online being sceptical about buying a parfum online. Unfortunately, it turned out that I was right.&lt;br /&gt;Although the box was foiled the box inside was damaged as it looked like something has been torn off and the closing was shorter than it should be (compared it with the packaging of my parfum I had purchased in a store). I could have all lived with that if the actual smell was right. However, this parfum smells sweeter and by far doesn&#x27;t last as long as I am used to. Even other people around me noticed the different smell and that it doesn&#x27;t stay on as long. For me this was a one time buy - I go back to the store.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about ordering perfume online but this smells just like the one I bought in the department store.  It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> Normally, I love this perfume.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it for a few years and have had more compliments than I can say.  This latest bottle that I ordered  from you is terrible.  When I spray it on the smell simply isn&#x27;t the same and when it hits my skin it might as well be water.  No scent at all.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s old and hasn&#x27;t been stored correctly.  I&#x27;m very disappointed.  I have no idea where it&#x27;s being sent from and you should probably not take any more orders for it.  It may be that I got the one bad bottle; I&#x27;ve ordered another in hopes that&#x27;s the case.  If not I feel cheated, as there apparently isn&#x27;t anyway to send it back or get a refund.  This scent is truly wonderful and I miss having it.  I&#x27;m so sorry Guerlain isn&#x27;t making it anymore.  It was an absolute winner.  I would have given 10 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this for years and always get compliments.  Years ago it was rating as one of the top 5 fragrances that men liked.</li>
            <li> Love the smell very feminine it so unique and lasting it is an exquisite scent a must have for a girls night out to attract a cute guy or the man in your life!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my grandmother who has practically been using this product for over 20+ years. She loves it, so I&#x27;m happy with this purchase as well! She sprays it on everyday, so I&#x27;ll probably be buying her another one in about a month to take on vacation with her.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for my Aunt &amp; she is THRILLED, the price is so much more reasonable this way.</li>
            <li> I just figured &amp;#34;Shalimar&amp;#34; was Shailmar. I didn&#x27;t realize until I recieved it that it is a different fragrance than what I like. I was a bit disappointed that it wasn&#x27;t the same old Shalimar that I&#x27;ve been wearing for almost 40 years. I guess I should have read the description a little better.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother as a gift. She loves Shalimar. It has a scent that lasts a long time. You only need a spray or two. My mother says she has to spray it and walk into it because it&#x27;s so strong. It will last her a long time.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this fragrance, and it is now my signature scent. It is feminine, soft, powdery, sexy in its own way but elegant.&lt;br /&gt;I saw that this bottle was 3.4 oz and the price was very, very, reasonable from what I saw in stores.&lt;br /&gt;  Thank you! I am a college student and nice things are not really attainable right now. I will continue to purchase this fragrance from this seller. The perfume came on time, well packaged and protected, and sealed in the box. Also, before you purchase a perfume smell it in store, always review the notes to determine if it is for you, and be attentive to when purchasing online because the people who gave this seller a bad rating were confusing the original &amp;#34;leathery&amp;#34; Shalimar, for Shalimar initial.&lt;br /&gt;Shalimar Initial has remnants of Shalimar but it is its own unique formula, a modern twist of a classic. Guerlain did wonderful in crafting this. I really recommend PERFUMESWORLD as a seller. I Hope this is helpful to any shoppers. Thank you :)!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful just love Shalimar! The bottle is so pretty makes a great gift. The shipping was fast too!</li>
            <li> When I ordered this perfume, I thought I was ordering the old Shalimar perfume, I didn&#x27;t notice the word &amp;#34;Initial&amp;#34;. So, I was initially disappointed (no pun intended). However I was pleasantly surprised that I really do like this fragrance. The price I paid for it through Amazon makes it possible for me to wear  as my &amp;#34;everyday&amp;#34; perfume, and wear a more expensive one for special occasions.</li>
            <li> An old favorite with an updated lighter scent. Great for daytime. The price great. The presentation is lovely and adds to any dresser top.</li>
            <li> Nice and good price, but not the original Shalimar like a thought, my fault, I didn&#x27;t know what the Guerlain meant , real stuff and does smell great, just a different make of it</li>
            <li> A  truly magnificent Eau De Parfum .</li>
            <li> VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT...IT IS NOT THE SHALIMAR PERFUME I HAVE WORN FOR 50 YEARS...IT IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PRODUCT NAMED SHALIMAR INITIAL WOMAN ..I DID NOT KNOW GUERLAIN MADE DIFFERENT SHALIMAR NAMED PERFUME...THOUGHT I WAS GETTING SHALIMAR WHICH IS THE ONLY PERFUME I AM NOT ALLERGIC TO.....CANT RETURN IT...SO I AM VERY MAD</li>
            <li> This perfume seems to be old.  I say this because it does not smell right and the color is darker than it should be.  Since I had opened the package I had no recourse other than to keep it.  It will probably go into garbage.  An expensive lesson, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I am a perfume fanatic and this is a perfume you MUST buy!  The dealer is authentic and I love the way this perfume smells!</li>
            <li> Not much like the original Shalimar.  I expected it to be the same scent, but lighter.  Nope.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume it is a timeless fragrance. I also bought the body cream  it is a clean fresh scent</li>
            <li> je suis toujours extrement satisfaite de ma commande et de la livraison..je conseve cette adresse pour de futures commandes.&lt;br /&gt;merci</li>
            <li> This is Shalimar, only softer...its longevity is amazing...</li>
            <li> I have wore Shalimar for over 20 years and must say this new Shalimar is my new favorite!&lt;br /&gt;This scent is wonderful</li>
            <li> My wife currently went through a fragrance consultation at a major department store.  She tried both the Shalimar and Shalimar \\&quot;INITIAL\\&quot;  Both are completely two different animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other reviews here that gave this fragrance low ratings, are ones that thought they received the original Shalimar fragrance.  Do not be put off by this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This perfume is lovely, light and very feminine. She has been wearing it now for two days and loves it.  Guerlain has such wonderful stories on how each of their fragrances came into existence and she hopes some day to acquire their \\&quot;Jicky\\&quot; which is over a century old.  For now, the Shalimar Initial is exquisite and lovely and it is definitely not Shalimar.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with Guerlain and how this scent has changed. One should not mess with perfection. BRING BACK Shalimar of years ago. This new scent smells like A Chemical and can&#x27;t wait to finish it. What a shame to a beautiful perfume like Shalimar and to Mr. Guerlain.</li>
            <li> I thought I was buying a great price on true Shalimar....it was not true Shalamar which proves the old addage &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;.  Frankly your use of the Brand Shalimar is deceitful...and was disappointig.  Initial is an okay fragrance but is NOT Shalimar....I shall be more careful next time</li>
            <li> I AGREE WITH ALL THE PREVIOUS REVIEWS THAT LOVE THIS &amp;#34;SHALIMAR INITIAL&amp;#34;.  I FIRST BOUGHT IT IN PARIS A FEW YEAR AGO, WHEN I CAME TO THE U.S I FOUND IT AT BERGDORF GOODMAN AND BLOOMINGDALES, WHEN I RAN OUT I NOTED THAT I WAS UNABLE TO BUY IT AT ANY OF THE STORES?!, I CONTACTED GUERLAIN PARIS TO REORDER AND THEN I SAW IT HERE ON AMAZON. THIS IS SUCH A LOVELY DELICATE FEMININE SEXY FRAGRANCE, ITS NOT SHALIMAR AS OTHERS HAVE NOTED, I STILL USE THE ORIGINAL SHALIMAR PERFUME WHICH I LOVE FROM FOREVER MORE, BUT, THE INITIAL I USE DAILY AND FEEL SO LIGHT AND BRIGHT AND HAPPY.  I AM TRULY SORRY THAT THE DEPARTMENT STORES DO NOT CARRY IT ANY LONGER AND AM DELIGHTED THAT AMAZON HAS IT AND AT A GOOD PRICE.  THANK YOU.  AG</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice the name of the perfume. Shalimar has been my signature perfume most of my life. This is NOT that Shalimar, look at the title &amp;#34;Shalimar INITIAL&amp;#34; it looks the same, is packaged the same but it is NOT the same, it is awful. Very expensive lesson for me. This scent is not a pleasant smelling perfume and is NOTHING like regular Shalimar. Even the free hand creme smelled so bad I threw it out. Has an unpleasant chemical smell. Don&#x27;t order, it is a waste of your money. An expensive lesson for me. Reordered the right one. Unfortunately wasted $50 during the whole process. :)</li>
            <li> The Guerlain&#x27;s  new perfume called  &amp;#34;Shalimar Parfume initial&amp;#34; arrived safely, sooner than expected and perfect, as usually Guerlain&#x27;s products are. Having been during my long life a Guerlain&#x27;s fan i was very pleased to read  the smart  excellent, reviews...I will add a new special touch: the subtle pink color ! Does it remind us of the pink French Champagne, my favorite??? It is pure seduction! For &amp;#34; a thing of beauty is a joy for ever&amp;#34;... And the color adds to the smelling...&lt;br /&gt;I will anyhow stay faithful also, to the former Shalimar, so different, that is sure! It is really another kind! Stronger, but famous long ago, when starting in the &amp;#34;Art Decos&amp;#34; time...still beloved today by many! I am among them,  but not perfumed in the streets, of course! Still sexy and unique, as it was for my beautiful grand mother and mother .&lt;br /&gt;May I add that to find Guerlain in sale at Amazon.com was a kind of a shock , at the same time a great enjoyment, thanks a lot  to Amazon, but a vison of our changing world!</li>
            <li> It is an excellent product. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;Since 1925 it has been a success...&lt;br /&gt;Meets all my expectations about a perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Undoubtedly reccomended!</li>
            <li> This is genuine Shalimar Parfum Initial for a gift to the wife.  They responded quickly to my inquiry and delivery was within a week.  Box, plastic wrap, and perfume was as it should be, brand new and original.  Bought from PerfumesWorld and will definitely buy from again.</li>
            <li> Shalimar is my wife&#x27;s favorite (and I agree). . . so the decision is simple.  Very Nice!!  ;-)~</li>
            <li> I love Shalimar, so I thought I&#x27;d try this other fragrance by Guerlain.  I&#x27;m so glad I did.  It is simply beautiful.  A little goes a long way and it lasts for eons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ignore the bad reviews from the confused consumers who thought they were purchasing Shalimar.  I guess they didn&#x27;t read the description.</li>
            <li> shalimar initial is awful, doesn&#x27;t smell anything like shalimar original, like it was advertised !  don&#x27;t buy it it is not worth even trying ....</li>
            <li> i have ben wearing shalimar for about 40yrs,  the stuff i received was a pink-colored liquid in what looked like shalimar bottle..... color has never been pink in 40 years and the fragrance is a total scam---- nothing like the subtle, vanilla based original formula that i have grown up on........ this imposter shalimar was heavy, cloying  and, when compared to authentic shalimar, really missed the mark......i have experimented with a few scents over the years, and whatever was sent to me in that bottle was more of a nauseating jungle gardenia than my usual subtle fragrance--- what a scam!!!</li>
            <li> I really love this Shalimar Initial! It is the best Shalimar flanke!.</li>
