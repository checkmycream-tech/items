            <li>Very good product though.</li>
            <li>I know DHC products are great because I&#x27;ve been Cleansing Oil user for about 10 years.  </li>
            <li>I find it to  do a great job.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like any kind of cream for my face that has a scent with it, so this was perfect.  </li>
            <li>Have always taken fairly good care of my skin (been a cosmetologist since</li>
            <li>I have always loved this eye cream, been using it for years.............</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve used it many times.</li>

            <li>I love this cream.  </li>
            <li>19).&lt;br /&gt;DHC&#x27;s concentrated eye cream is my favorite eye cream before bed.</li>
            <li>I love this eye cream.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ll continue using it until I find something better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years and am satisfied with its consistency and texture.  </li>
            <li>Very silky, emollient texture and feels great on.  </li>
            <li>Many eye creams/serums either do not work at all, or they put a film on my contact lenses.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply around the eyes.</li>
            <li>For puffy eyes and dark circles it is the best I have found.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say i see a big difference, but as good or better than most products i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>But this cream is the best from all other creams she has been using ever!</li>
            <li>I like this eye cream,and I think it works for fine lines.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see any difference in fine lines.</li>
            <li>This eye cream is so light and nourishing for the parchment paper skin around the eyes.  </li>
            <li>I truly enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>All About Eyes Rich.</li>
            <li>I originally discovered this eye cream from a DHC sample packet.</li>
            <li>Be sure that once you&#x27;ve lightly smoothed cream under and over lids, to pat it in gently.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t make your makeup smudge.</li>
            <li>Very hydrating and feels good on the soft skin around the eyes.</li>
            <li>Still love it and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply w/ a brush, and does very well under makeup.</li>
            <li>With consistent use, this product works wonders on my eyes!</li>
            <li>Most of the products don&#x27;t give her enough moisturizing effect</li>
            <li>This company should stop testing there products on people and test it on themselves first.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the first thing I put on after washing my face.  </li>
            <li>so now I am going to buy the real thing!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I even realized how much my eye area was thirsting for a cream like this!</li>
            <li>and I anticipate it will last me for many months.</li>
            <li>I think some companies send samples that work better than the actual product.</li>
            <li>I have used expensive one like Lancome, Chanel, Dior just to mention some this one is as good or better than some of these.</li>
            <li>This product has a stellar list of ingredients, and it is very soothing as well as moisturizing and softening.  </li>
            <li>Very moisturizing, but not greasy.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with its super thick, creamy, moisturizing texture and the lack of any greasy film after absorbing.</li>
            <li>It has definitely helped my eye area to look more smooth, firm, and refreshed.</li>
            <li>It spreads on light and silky and just feels like it is being absorbed completely---no heavy sludgy cream</li>
            <li>It quickly seems to absorb right into the skin, leaving behind only super hydrated and smooth skin.</li>
            <li>I have been experiencing flares of irritation on my eyelids that are very drying and end up making my eyelids look old and wizened.  </li>
            <li>For winter, their CoQ10 eye cream is richer and more moisturizing, but I like this one for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only just begun to see some crows feet when I smile.</li>
            <li>Living at a high mountain elevation (9,000+ ft) in the drying winter months, I know all about dry skin, and this cream is an absolute dream!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s refreshing and really helps when my eyes are looking tired.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so rich and hydrating that even the small packet lasted me for well over a week.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and would recommend this to other people.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not cheap and a little goes far, but we&#x27;ll worth the cost.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap and a little goes far, but we&#x27;ll worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I tend to have oily/combo skin, yet after a few minutes this cream absorbs completely and doesn&#x27;t leave any trace of a slick or greasy residue - which I absolutely need in order to keep my eye makeup from melting off or smudging.</li>
            <li> But this eye cream actually seemed to make my upper eye lids firmer, less droopy.</li>
            <li> I am 62 with dry skin and wear contact lenses.</li>
            <li> The lines are half or more diminished and the skin feels less delicate, though we all know just how delicate it is.</li>
            <li> Have bought this cream for my mum who has a very dry aging skin.</li>
            <li> I expected thicker and heavier one.</li>
            <li> I usually pat a bit extra where lower lid meets upper cheek or where the dark crescent lies.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is pricy, but it&#x27;s also so creamy that you only need a small amount</li>
            <li> Greasy; no mention of all at ability to lessen dark circles around eyes as mentioned in a review.  Overpriced.</li>
            <li> Creamy, soft and non-greasy, this works so well for dark circles and tired eyes.  </li>
            <li> May just slow down the aging process a bit.</li>
            <li> but I learned I can&#x27;t use it often because it causes me to develope small pimples around outer edge of my eyes.</li>
            <li> Used this product in the past.</li>
            <li> This is a very heavy eye cream.</li>
            <li> No strong odor or irritating side effects either.</li>
            <li> I am over 50 and have felt the skin under my eyes just beginning to feel thin and papery.</li>
            <li> After trying a sample of DHC cream that I received in mail, next morning sever allergy occur on my face, with very painful blisters.</li>
            <li> Very faint scent.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I know DHC products are great because I&#x27;ve been Cleansing Oil user for about 10 years.  I like this eye cream,and I think it works for fine lines. However, the texture is too thin and light for eye cream.  I expected thicker and heavier one.</li>
            <li> Have bought this cream for my mum who has a very dry aging skin. Most of the products don&#x27;t give her enough moisturizing effect and she keep on suffering from dryness around the eye area. But this cream is the best from all other creams she has been using ever! She is absolutely happy, so I&#x27;ll keep on purchasing it for her :)</li>
            <li> Love this eye cream- it&#x27;s soothing and moisturizing without being too greasy. Absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t make your makeup smudge. I like this more than Clinique All About Eyes Rich. For winter, their CoQ10 eye cream is richer and more moisturizing, but I like this one for everyday use.  Doesn&#x27;t sting.</li>
            <li> For puffy eyes and dark circles it is the best I have found. Try it.</li>
            <li> I never received this product.  I wrote to the supplier twice and have not received a response.  I was charged for it.  I obviously don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> Greasy; no mention of all at ability to lessen dark circles around eyes as mentioned in a review.  Overpriced.</li>
            <li> I bought this eye cream after receiving a sample of it in the DHC magazine I recieved in the mail.... This doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything like that sample did???</li>
            <li> Great product! Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and would recommend this to other people. Will reorder this product. Wonderful eye concentrate. Easy to apply around the eyes.</li>
            <li> DHC Concentrate eye cream is a lovely product that does a wonderfuly job of moisurizing my eyelids and undereyes.  I use it at night before bed and in the morning before I apply my make-up.  I find it to  do a great job.</li>
            <li> After trying a sample of DHC cream that I received in mail, next morning sever allergy occur on my face, with very painful blisters. This company should stop testing there products on people and test it on themselves first.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Very hydrating and feels good on the soft skin around the eyes.</li>
            <li> Excellent eye cream on my favorites. I have used expensive one like Lancome, Chanel, Dior just to mention some this one is as good or better than some of these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it many times. It&#x27;s one of the best nourishing eye creams on the market. All of DHC&#x27;s products are top quality.</li>
            <li> Instant wrinkle eraser.  I love this cream.  I&#x27;m almost 60 and it&#x27;s the first thing I put on after washing my face.  It&#x27;s like a wrinkle-eraser!</li>
            <li> This is a very heavy eye cream. I like it but I learned I can&#x27;t use it often because it causes me to develope small pimples around outer edge of my eyes. I think it may be too occulisive for my skin type. Very good product though.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference in fine lines.</li>
            <li> every eye cream that i have ever tried has always burned my skin in some way! I LOVE this stuff! It hydrates the eyes and even eyelids and doesn&#x27;t sting the eye or anything what-so-ever...I am in love with this stuff! I always get sample packets from DHC so now I am going to buy the real thing!</li>
            <li> I am over 50 and have felt the skin under my eyes just beginning to feel thin and papery. I&#x27;ve only just begun to see some crows feet when I smile. Have always taken fairly good care of my skin (been a cosmetologist since 19).&lt;br /&gt;DHC&#x27;s concentrated eye cream is my favorite eye cream before bed. Eyes look refreshed in morning and skin feels firmer. The lines are half or more diminished and the skin feels less delicate, though we all know just how delicate it is. Be sure that once you&#x27;ve lightly smoothed cream under and over lids, to pat it in gently. I usually pat a bit extra where lower lid meets upper cheek or where the dark crescent lies. Use sparingly. It&#x27;s not cheap and a little goes far, but we&#x27;ll worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I originally discovered this eye cream from a DHC sample packet. It&#x27;s so rich and hydrating that even the small packet lasted me for well over a week. I fell in love with its super thick, creamy, moisturizing texture and the lack of any greasy film after absorbing. It quickly seems to absorb right into the skin, leaving behind only super hydrated and smooth skin. I don&#x27;t think I even realized how much my eye area was thirsting for a cream like this! In fact, I&#x27;ve started using it all over the eye area, including the upper lid and below the brow line. I tend to have oily/combo skin, yet after a few minutes this cream absorbs completely and doesn&#x27;t leave any trace of a slick or greasy residue - which I absolutely need in order to keep my eye makeup from melting off or smudging. I LOVE this cream! Yes, it is pricy, but it&#x27;s also so creamy that you only need a small amount and I anticipate it will last me for many months. Living at a high mountain elevation (9,000+ ft) in the drying winter months, I know all about dry skin, and this cream is an absolute dream! It has definitely helped my eye area to look more smooth, firm, and refreshed. No strong odor or irritating side effects either. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I have always loved this eye cream, been using it for years.............</li>
            <li> This eye cream is so light and nourishing for the parchment paper skin around the eyes.  It spreads on light and silky and just feels like it is being absorbed completely---no heavy sludgy cream feeling-- just light!!</li>
            <li> Used this product in the past. Very moisturizing, but not greasy. Easy to apply w/ a brush, and does very well under makeup.</li>
            <li> This product has a stellar list of ingredients, and it is very soothing as well as moisturizing and softening.  I have been experiencing flares of irritation on my eyelids that are very drying and end up making my eyelids look old and wizened.  This product softens the skin and reduces the irritation.  It is a keeper!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased two of these DHC Concentrated Eye Creams for myself since October, simply because I never again want to see what my eyelids look like without the cream.    I put it on after showering at night, and the effect lasts until the next shower.  It&#x27;s magic!</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream. It&#x27;s refreshing and really helps when my eyes are looking tired.</li>
            <li> When I buy and use face creams it is with the understanding that it&#x27;s not going to perform miracles. May just slow down the aging process a bit. But this eye cream actually seemed to make my upper eye lids firmer, less droopy. Amazing. So I&#x27;ll continue using it until I find something better.</li>
            <li> Ordered this after using a sample. Love it! Switched from department store brand.</li>
            <li> The DHC eye cream was just like the sample I received and used. You never know when you order stuff after having used the sample. I think some companies send samples that work better than the actual product. Then when you get the product, it&#x27;s not the same as the sample. But not the DHC eye cream. Still love it and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would purchase this item again</li>
            <li> Does not irritate the eyes.  Can&#x27;t say i see a big difference, but as good or better than most products i&#x27;ve tried. Nice glass jar. No smell.  I like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and am satisfied with its consistency and texture.  A good moisturizer for under the eyes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like any kind of cream for my face that has a scent with it, so this was perfect.  Very silky, emollient texture and feels great on.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I truly enjoy this product. I use it day and night and it definitely softens the lines around my eyes. I am 62 with dry skin and wear contact lenses. Many eye creams/serums either do not work at all, or they put a film on my contact lenses. Another thing about the eye cream is it is not oily so any eye makeup I use stays on and in place. I really am so pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> I love DHC products and this is just another one of the great products that I consistently use!  Creamy, soft and non-greasy, this works so well for dark circles and tired eyes.  With consistent use, this product works wonders on my eyes! Very faint scent. Very clean product!</li>
