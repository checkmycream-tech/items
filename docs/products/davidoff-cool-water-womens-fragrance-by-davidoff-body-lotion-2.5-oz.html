            <li> is the 2nd time I have made this purchase and both times my order has been delivered earlier than expected with no problems.</li>
            <li> which is a waste of ten dollars.</li>
            <li> Not sure it&#x27;s the actual product.</li>
            <li> and I never had any issues with the products being fake, yes sometimes they are defectived or damaged items but not fake ones.</li>
            <li> I thought the heat may have contributed to the consistency but after reading other reviews, I think not.</li>
            <li> Just a little to watery foe my taste.</li>
            <li> I have been an amazon customer for a few years now</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t use the fragrance...just the lotion....and please no more E-mails...</li>
            <li> However, there is definitely something wrong with the product sold by this supplier.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too weak.</li>
            <li> If I leave the cap off while applying, the lotion automatically pours out because it is too thin and runny.</li>

            <li> It really wasn&#x27;t the original smell of cool water!! It smelled as if it had somethingelse added to it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like the original. Makes me wonder if manufacturer tampered with the contents.</li>
            <li> my all time fav fragrance</li>
            <li> My wife really likes this brand and was happy to get her body lotion refills.  this time I went with four 2.5 oz bottels and she keeps one in her car and purse.  Wife is happy, I&#x27;m happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yay!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this been wearing it on and of since 1997.</li>
            <li> Both the body wash and the lotion were very watery. As if liquid had been added. Maybe they were just old. Probably will not order any fragrance products via internet again.</li>
            <li> Your product was a gift for someone else...and as far as I know they are completely satisfied, and because of sensitive skin, it is the only body lotion they use...They don&#x27;t use the fragrance...just the lotion....and please no more E-mails...I&#x27;m only the gift giver...thank you.</li>
            <li> I buy this fragrance for my D-I-L every Christmas and she loves it.</li>
            <li> As another buyer had stated, the lotion is very runny/watery. Not sure it&#x27;s the actual product. I have used this lotion before from dept stores and it was much better. If I leave the cap off while applying, the lotion automatically pours out because it is too thin and runny. The scent is not as fragrant as I recall</li>
            <li> I love the scent of Cool Water. It has a brisk scent without being over-powering. I&#x27;m not fond of flowery fragrances and Cool Water is definitely within my spectrum of favorite lotions and perfumes.</li>
            <li> I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;This is the 2nd time I have made this purchase and both times my order has been delivered earlier than expected with no problems.</li>
            <li> Wow!  This smells GREAT!</li>
            <li> I received a gift set for Christmas and I ordered more lotion because I use a lot of it and this stuff is FABULOUS!!</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN WEARING COOL WATER FOR 10 YEARS AND WOULDN&#x27;T WEAR ANYTHING ELSE.  I DON&#x27;T LIKE ANYTHING FLOWERY OR A STRONG SCENT SO THIS WORKS BEST FOR ME.  I ALWAYS GET COMPLIMENTS AND PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW WHAT I AM WEARING.</li>
            <li> I have been an amazon customer for a few years now and I never had any issues with the products being fake, yes sometimes they are defectived or damaged items but not fake ones. I was very dissapointed when I received this product, not even the bottled looks like the original Cool Water; and the smell is so poor. I wore it a couple of times thinking it was my allergies causing me to smell the scent differently and maybe the bottled was upgraded or something like that but no. It is not the real product, period.</li>
            <li> IT WAS LEFT IN MY MAILBOX AND THE HEAT MADE IT  THE CONSISTENCY OF MILK.  IT WAS NOT THE PRODUCT ITSELF BUT THE HEAT...I GUESS.</li>
            <li> I have worn cool water for years and love the smell. I only wanted the lotion this time so ordered it and it does not smell anything like the lotion that I received with my perfume. It almost has a medicine smell and seems thinner or more watered down than the lotion that came in my gift set. I can not use this so will throw it away which is a waste of ten dollars.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smells great. Just a little to watery foe my taste.</li>
            <li> Lotion was too runny I threw it away.</li>
            <li> Fast turnaround....love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also a fan of Cool Water. However, there is definitely something wrong with the product sold by this supplier. It&#x27;s like a tube of water!  I thought the heat may have contributed to the consistency but after reading other reviews, I think not. I even put it in the fridge for 24 hours but it made no difference. It just pours out like water, has a bluish tinge and barely any fragrance. When I set it on its side with the cap open it just dripped out. Definitely not up to Amazon standards.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS FRAGRANCE ON ME</li>
            <li> This lotion does not meet my expectation. It&#x27;s too weak. I can&#x27;t smell anything.</li>
