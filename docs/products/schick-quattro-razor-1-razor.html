    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Also, who isn&#x27;t somewhat impressed by the aesthetics of those four metallic blades?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With the Quattro, I can hold the razor by the handle and still maintain excellent contact with my face.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the Schick Quattro about two months ago and it was one of my best purchases ever.</li>
            <li>The best blade razor ever, and my best shave.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best disposable razors I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li>, I thought it was the best shaving system I had ever come across.  </li>
            <li>The Fusion is the best shave out there bar none.</li>
            <li>A GREAT SHAVE!!!!!!</li>
            <li>HE SAID IT WORKED GREAT EVEN ON HIS HEAD</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I have been happily using the Gillette Mach 3 for a year.  </li>
            <li>I had been happily using the Mach 3 before this.</li>
            <li>Many of my friends told me they got the best shaves of their life with the Mach 3 Power Nitro:</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used most of the popular shavers and blades out there, and this one delivers the best quality at the lowest price per shave.  </li>
            <li>MY HUSBAND USED THIS RAZOR AND ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT</li>
            <li>Gillette makes good products</li>
            <li>The Mach 3 is clearly superior to this piece of garbage.</li>
            <li>Looks fairly hi-tech, however you notice things like the design of the handle isnt as well executed as Gillette shavers.</li>
            <li>I bought the Schick quattro because I had read good reviews about it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Years ago, I shaved with the Schick FX Diamond, I liked it.  </li>
            <li>Others may want to try it based on their own needs.</li>
            <li>Works, nice non slip surface.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to get a better shave than the already sensational shave my Mach 3 delivers!&amp;quot; ...</li>
            <li>My choice is the Schick Quattro due to the superior closeness of the shave (a perfect shave is achievable on the Quattro)</li>
            <li>, well, you rinse from the top with Quattro.</li>
            <li>It seemed to me that the engineers with the Quattro were focusing more on the looks of the product, rather than the quality.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t agree with the argument of more irritation.</li>
            <li>Most of the reviewers who gave the shaver 1 or 2 stars do admit that it takes them More strokes to get a comparable shave with the gilette as they did with one stroke of the Quattro.</li>
            <li>Sure, it may not have the electrical glide</li>
            <li>Maybe someone with a hotter water setting would have better luck.</li>
            <li>For more just didn&#x27;t prove to be better</li>
            <li>Probably like most men thinking the more the blades the better/closer the shave.</li>
            <li>The 3 blade razor I was using performed much better.</li>
            <li>HE SAID IT WAS WAY BETTER</li>
            <li>No joke they work better than that piece of junk.&lt;BR</li>
            <li>On curved surfaces, the shave was comparable to the Mach 3, and required just as many touch up passes.  </li>
            <li>*might* be excellent to shave one&#x27;s legs with, if you don&#x27;t shave above the knee.  </li>
            <li>I have used all the latest generation razors including the Mach3Turbo, M3Power, and the Schick Quattro.  </li>
            <li>My hope is that now that there&#x27;s an alternative product in the market, Gillette may respond by pricing its two-bladed and three-bladed products more competitively.</li>
            <li>Schick Quattro cartridges are the cheapest of the bunch (Mach 3 Turbo, M3 Power,..), last the longest, and deliver the best shave.</li>
            <li>get a Mach 3, its cheaper, and a much better shave over all.</li>
            <li>The top strip didn&#x27;t lubricate well</li>
            <li>I shave my head twice a week, and have always enjoyed the benefits of the Mach 3 Turbo.  </li>
            <li>I signed on the band-wagon of having the newest and most improved.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am very impressed with this razor, and don&#x27;t plan on going back to my Mach 3.  </li>
            <li>Going to give me a better shave...</li>
            <li>I have been very happy with the Quattro and haven&#x27;t looked back since.</li>
            <li>If you compare the Quattro to the Fusion then I would give a slightly better shave to the Fusion.</li>
            <li>Have used this razor for over two years now, and it is just flat out the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>I loved the Mach 3 and after using it exclusively for years, I switched to the Gilette Fusion when it first came out.</li>
            <li>Then, all the blades are squished together, so the hair gets stuck and clogged between the blades pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I mean, if you&#x27;ve never had a really good shave, you might think the Quattro is awesome.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re fine though</li>
            <li>Then I moved on the the Gillette Mach 3, marked improvement and have been happy with that for years.  </li>
            <li>I have a lifelong hobby of seeking the perfect shave.  </li>
            <li>Just like all the other reviews here, I have to agree that no shaver is perfect.</li>
            <li>They are worth the 15% more cost for the 3000% better product.</li>
            <li>I agree with those that say the Quattro clogs up easily.  </li>
            <li>Recently, Schick sent me a free Quattro razor in the mail and I loved it!</li>
            <li>The blades transition on and off just fine.  </li>
            <li>Even if I got another for free.</li>
            <li>Light application of a shaving oil is an option.</li>
            <li>Shave with Quattro razor, attempt to go with the direction of the growth with light pressure.  </li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve been using this razor, the Mach 3 seems too light.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m going to go ahead and buy another handle (they&#x27;re surprisingly cheap).  </li>
            <li>My wife got a coupon for a free Quattro with blades, so I gave it a try for a week.  </li>
            <li>Tried the free sample, then got one for my wife.</li>
            <li>I got this from a free coupon offer.  </li>
            <li>Thankfully, I got this for free</li>
            <li>I tried salvaging the cartridge by soaking it, running dish soap through it to free the hair, blasting water through it and wiping it with a wash cloth.  </li>
            <li>I got a free Schick Quattro sample in the mail, and decided to give it a \\&quot;wurl\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I used a Gillette Fusion for a while and the shave you get is effortless, close, and smooth.</li>
            <li>I got a Gillette with 3 blades, and my face is smooth again.</li>
            <li>Sure, your face is smooth afterwards, but it really isn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
            <li>In both cases, the Quattro delivered a superior shave on flat surfaces (side of the neck and top of the side-burns area).  </li>
            <li>I went over the side of my face  that I had first shaved with the Quattro, and was able to cut additional hair that the Quattro missed.</li>
            <li>To begin with, I immediately noticed the significant weight difference between the Quattro and the Fusion.</li>
            <li>I should also mention that I have a fairly light growth (can&#x27;t even grow a full beard)</li>
            <li>Keep luke-warm water flowing from tap to clean razor blade.</li>
            <li>The Quattro is way easier to clean out than the Gillette razors.</li>
            <li>However, if you want the absolute closest possible shave and are willing to put up with the discomfort, the Quattro is the best choice.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly</li>
            <li>Afterall, I thought, since I liked Gillette&#x27;s Mach 3 so much that surely if there would be any difference between it and the Quattro, that the Quattro would only be the better of the two.  </li>
            <li>Though the shave is good with new cartridges, I have a great deal of trouble cleaning the hairs out from between the blades.  </li>
            <li>The Power Quattro was slightly better, but not by much.  </li>
            <li>Thought, what the hey I&#x27;ll give it another shot, after another year of shaving experience maybe and another year of possibly improvements to the razor, it might make a good shave.  </li>
            <li>However true this might be</li>
            <li>But of course we all think about when we are going to have to buy a new pack of blades, and I&#x27;d say that market share is the more important factor for Schick.</li>
            <li>*) I rinse after each stroke, and it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more ergonomic IMO than the gilette, and definitely adapts better to the curvature of the face.  </li>
            <li>It is far better to buy cheap plastic disposables.</li>
            <li>The first shave is fairly smooth, I will give it that.</li>
            <li>Both razors give me awesome shaves, and the blades last a long time.  </li>
            <li>When I first switched to the Schick, I didn&#x27;t like it as much as the Mach 3, but after a while I came to like it more.  </li>
            <li>I think it is great that they threw in an extra blade in the new Schick Quattro Razor.  </li>
            <li>Previously, I had used the Mach3 and found that the Mach3Turbo was more comfortable than the Mach3(better lubrication) and for many years this was my razor of choice.  </li>
            <li>I think the multiple-bladed razors are an emerging technology, and apparently are very easy to make incorrectly.</li>
            <li>are far better than anything else out there</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t worth two cents.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It felt  smooth while I used it, but it left a stubble no matter how many times I shaved over.</li>
            <li>recommendation is that if you can live with a less than perfect shave in difficult areas, then the Gillette Mach3Turbo is the best razor.  </li>
            <li>I was not aware how much I loved the Gilette Fusion until I tried the Shick Quattro.</li>
            <li>I also agree with the other reviewers who said that the razor leaves one with a relatively good deal of razor burn.  </li>
            <li>I remembered that it used to pull out my hair and pinch me, right out of the box.</li>
            <li>It must rock the Gillete Mach 3 right??</li>
            <li>Warbull(a reviewer) is right</li>
            <li>Go for the smooth, effortless experience of a new blade!</li>
            <li>if you are looking for the ultimate close shave - you will find the Quattro superior to any Gillette if you can live with the discomfort.  </li>
            <li>But perhaps the most apparent difference was that with the Quattro, the five o&#x27;clock shadow becomes the noontime shadow.</li>
            <li>I use a spray bottle to make sure I clean out between the blades after each use and I blot it dry on a towel and them keep it in the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li>Indeed, the first problem I noticed was the near impossiblity of easily cleaning out hair shavings caught underneath the Quattro&#x27;s blades.  </li>
            <li>excel thank you very much.</li>
            <li>The unit has a nice grip, but the handle is a little light for a razor with a large head.  </li>
            <li>However, later on, when being clean shaven was called for by my work, I found myself using the free Gilette Mach 3 which I received in the mail.</li>
            <li>I was pretty excited about a new razor (well, as excited as one can get about a new raor).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the reason the cart is open up top.</li>
            <li>Although I preferred the Mach 3 at first, I have gotten used to the Fusion over time and have come to appreciate it.    </li>
            <li>I was surprised at how cheap and flimsy the Quattro felt in my hand.</li>
            <li>;-)    </li>
            <li>first reason is that it works well.  </li>
            <li>I used the schick quattro the first time</li>
            <li>I was an avid user of the Gillette Mach3 and decided to try the Quattro to get a closer shave.  </li>
            <li>I used to use Mach 3&#x27;s when they first came out</li>
            <li>I had bought a package of four refill cartridges, and tried two, hoping the first cartridge was a dud.  </li>
            <li>Gillette hands down is the more comfortable blade due to its shallower blade angle and far superior lubrication strips.  </li>
            <li>I agree with the other reviewers who say that the disposable razors have their advantages -- easy to clean, close shave, easier to trim with (sideburns, etc).  </li>
            <li>In both cases, the Quattro made it feel as if the hair was being pulled a great deal, and that leaves you with the feeling that the blades aren&#x27;t sharp enough.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s just as good if not better than Mach3/Turbo.</li>
            <li>However, at the end of the day, I find it difficult to get a perfectly close shave in particular on my neck with the Gillete.  </li>
            <li>I see and feel no other significant difference in performance, feel, ease of cleaning and storing.</li>
            <li>By the second shave I noticed that it clogged too easily</li>
            <li>The shave is so easy that if you go back to disposeables, you will cut your face for a while.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotta say, it certainly seems like both companies have encouraged their employees to &#x27;pad&#x27; the reviews.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s new and has 4 Blades!!</li>
            <li>To start off, I really don&#x27;t have a huge amount of experience using different razors.</li>
            <li>the Quattro came out, however, I gave in since I never really was able to achieve the &amp;quot;perfect shave&amp;quot; with the Mach3Turbo, although the shave was always very comfortable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In addition, I&#x27;ve used one blade for two weeks straight once and never did the wire break.</li>
            <li>I recently received a free sample of the Schick Quattro razor in the mail (strangely enough, only a day after reading the reviews on this site), and decided to conduct my own experiment to compare the Gilette Mach3 Turbo against the Schick Quattro.</li>
            <li>for the design of the Quattro, I find that I much prefer the simplicity of the Mach3 Turbo design over the Quattro.</li>
            <li>It delivers a close, comfortable shave, even without the fourth blade.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Schick for F**in</li>
            <li>The Schick Quattro is much easier to control and gives me a much closer shave.</li>
            <li>forward one year later, I got another free sample box from college.  </li>
            <li>Priced reasonably.</li>
            <li>I got a closer and smoother shave with this razor compared with my Mach, and it didn&#x27;t irritate me as much.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t actually begin to lubricate until I began rubbing the strip, far more vigorously</li>
            <li>Based on all the negative reviews, there&#x27;s a good chance that it&#x27;s all from Gillette that simply wants to wipe out the competition.</li>
            <li>The vibrations on the M3Power cause more trouble than its worth, and cannot shave as close as either razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The blades last longer, and the shaving angle is more natural than I found with the Atra or Sensor.</li>
            <li>Maybe pitch the Quattro as lasting up to 40% longer than Schick&#x27;s own 3-blade, and (independently) the 3-blade (which I have not tried) as equivalent to the Mach 3.    </li>
            <li>I was positive it had to have given a decent shave there.</li>
            <li>On my first try with a new blade and longer hair, I ruined the cartridge.  </li>
            <li>I like most other people here used to use Mach</li>
            <li>The cartridge is bulkier than the 3 blade variety, though, and I believe it may hinder movement enjoyed by other blades like the Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep buying these as long as they remain available.</li>
            <li>another reviewer mentioned, there&#x27;s too much \\&quot;going on\\&quot; with it behind the blades for the hair to be able to free itself.  </li>
            <li>On the other hand, the Mach 3 will wash clean, easily and simply, under virtually any tempterature of water.  </li>
            <li>I like using a Quattro more than a Mach 3 because it leaves me with less ingrown hairs than a Mach 3.  </li>
            <li>Pre-shave prep with a hot towel or hot shower to soften hairs and open pores.  </li>
            <li>I thought it would be a decent product because of the quality of the Diamond.  </li>
            <li>This of course is likely to vary, might not be as good on other trials, and the judgement of when you have to change to a new blade is subjective, but the difference was so substantial that it seems beyond subjective, far outweighing the 5% or so added cost.     </li>
            <li>Because Gillette patents things to high heaven, Schick has to do a lot of work arounds.</li>
            <li>It does seem to clog up faster than the Mach 3, but since I shave in the shower (*highly recommend this to everybody</li>
            <li>It gives by a large margin an inferior shave to my el cheapo Bic Sensitive.</li>
            <li>I have to remind myself to throw out blades every couple of weeks, and the little lather strips (or whatever they are) on the top and bottom have never shown any wear.&lt;br</li>
            <li>unless you shave very very slowly, you will not get a good shave.  </li>
            <li>Pat dry with a clean towel.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t until I actually cut my skin - a rare thing indeed when using the Mach 3 Turbo - that I gave up, and discontinued the experiment.</li>
            <li>I will go back to the 3 blade as soon as I can use up the 16 dollars worth of cartridges I got suckered into buying.</li>
            <li>But is it worth the extra price?</li>
            <li>The shave is extremely close and incredibly comfortable.  </li>
            <li>then began shaving with my Mach 3 Turbo, which had been used once or twice before (meaning the shaver blades were not brand new).</li>
            <li>3(also tried the turbo and the power \\&quot;lots of vibration, but no result\\&quot;) and was reluctant to try anything new.  </li>
            <li>My skin felt irritated, as if the top layer had been burned raw.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really only noticable after roughly 12-14 hours so both do a more than adaquate job in that department.</li>
            <li>The differences I&#x27;ve found between the Quattro and the mach3 turbo are; the Quattro shaves slightly closer, nicks slightly less under my neck (but both are far better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used), and gets my upper lip hairs better.</li>
            <li>And this was only after the first swipe through my sideburns.</li>
            <li>I usually use a gillette mach 3 turbo and love it but decided to try the quatro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Hot water from my faucet simply isn&#x27;t enough.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I can feel the blades cutting across my face and it has a bit more drag than my Mach 3, which is a good thing because I know it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li>Wow 4 blades!</li>
            <li>The blades last a ridiculously long time, the shave is close and comfortable, and cuts and nicks are virtually non-existent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shave itself was shockingly bad, was ok on the main part of my face, however its extremely &#x27;grabby&#x27; which isnt a pleasant experience considering you have four razor blades on your skin.</li>
            <li>True, it is harder to clean the shaver after using it on long hair, but no such problem exists if you use it every couple of days.  </li>
            <li>I experimented with new blades on both shavers for several weeks to compare them both objectively and went through several cycles of blade changes.&lt;br /&gt;After inspecting the blades on both razors closely, first I determined that the reason that the Quattro feels more iritating during shaving is probably due to the blade angle differences on the razors</li>
            <li>I gave the Quattro a try, and feel that it&#x27;s more comparable to my electric razor (which I hardly use).</li>
            <li>2-3 passes to clear.  </li>
            <li>so if I tried to clear the hair by wiping it with a wash cloth, the hair stuck on the notches.  </li>
            <li>Before shaving, I tested the lubricating quality of the strips by moistening my finger and gently moving it back and forth over the surface of the strip.</li>
            <li>Nope, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone who wants to avoid razor cuts, copious amounts of blood, pain, and facial disfigurement.</li>
            <li>I took one swipe with it and wanted to stop completely</li>
            <li>It felt like rubbing sand paper on already sensitive skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, after weeks of testing, I find that the steeper blade angle and the central pivot on the Quattro give a much closer shave than the Gillette.  </li>
            <li>Common sense thinking would tell you, &amp;quot;the more, the merrier.&amp;quot;  </li>
            <li>I EVEN tried using an old tooth brush to wedge the hair out, but gave up after 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>But overall it gives very satisfactory results for the price.    </li>
            <li>and I washed the thing out on nearly every pass.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that to be true, especially if you wait until your beard is long to shave</li>
            <li>And last for around a weeks worth of daily shaving.&lt;BR</li>
            <li>They give a great shave, you have to go slow and do some re-shaving on the neck if you leave your beard a few days.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, the Quattro, after less than one full shave, is in the trash.</li>
            <li>It is a decent razor -- not terrible, not great.    </li>
            <li>After I got done joking about how the razor companies (Gillette and Schick) were going to keep making razors with a greater number of blades than their opponent, I decided to take the Quattro seriously and bought it.  </li>
            <li>Even after shaving, the lubricating strips felt dry, and certainly nowhere near as helpful as - you guessed it - the Mach3 Turbo.</li>
            <li>The Fusion is probably about three times as heavy as the Quattro, and it simply feels more solid in my hand.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this new 4 blade razor.</li>
            <li>Hot water from a tap into the back of the blades should clean it out in half a sec!</li>
            <li>It can be hard to clean, and yes, I have resorted to using an old toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>With former razors (Ultrex twin blade), a pass along the edge with a toothpick would do it easily, but the vertical wires on the blades make it impossible to clean these cartridges efficiently, resulting in my having to spend a lot of extra time cleaning them or keep changing cartridges, which really increases the expense.  </li>
            <li>My Fusion blades gradually grew dull over time, so I decided to try the free Quattro I received in the mail.</li>
            <li>facial growth is relatively light however so I am not sure how heavier growth users would do.&lt;br /&gt;I used the Mach3Turbo exclusively until the Shick Quattro came out.  </li>
            <li>second reason is that it finally offers Gillette some competition in the \\&quot;premium\\&quot; segment of the market.  </li>
            <li>So after the Fusion I went back to Bic Sensitive disposeables.</li>
            <li>The four blade razor is average with light one day stubble, but put it up against a couple days rough stubble</li>
            <li>, unfortunately I did not have another razor handy.  </li>
            <li>first day that I tried the Quattro, I admit that I hated it - for many of the same reasons that other reviewers have said - primarily the razor feels very &amp;quot;scratchy&amp;quot; when you shave and there is virtually no lubrication vs the Gillette.  </li>
            <li>These quatro blades hold an edge a very long time as long as you clean them thoroughly and keep them dry (don&#x27;t store in the shower).</li>
            <li>The Turbo shaves with less friction and the handle doesn&#x27;t accumulate as much of that old shaving cream gunk which tends to pile up over time.&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed is it&#x27;s not as smooth as my usual razor, and mostly it clogged up with hair SO BAD that I had to discontinue using it.</li>
            <li>That can generally be avoided by rinsing regularly.    </li>
            <li>It seemed to really irritate my face to the extreme, didn&#x27;t glide easily, and failed to get a close shave.  </li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Also, who isn&#x27;t somewhat impressed by the aesthetics of those four metallic blades?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With the Quattro, I can hold the razor by the handle and still maintain excellent contact with my face.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the Schick Quattro about two months ago and it was one of my best purchases ever.</li>
            <li> The best blade razor ever, and my best shave.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best disposable razors I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> , I thought it was the best shaving system I had ever come across.  </li>
            <li> The Fusion is the best shave out there bar none.</li>
            <li> A GREAT SHAVE!!!!!!</li>
            <li> HE SAID IT WORKED GREAT EVEN ON HIS HEAD</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I have been happily using the Gillette Mach 3 for a year.  </li>
            <li> I had been happily using the Mach 3 before this.</li>
            <li> Many of my friends told me they got the best shaves of their life with the Mach 3 Power Nitro:</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used most of the popular shavers and blades out there, and this one delivers the best quality at the lowest price per shave.  </li>
            <li> MY HUSBAND USED THIS RAZOR AND ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT</li>
            <li> Gillette makes good products</li>
            <li> The Mach 3 is clearly superior to this piece of garbage.</li>
            <li> Looks fairly hi-tech, however you notice things like the design of the handle isnt as well executed as Gillette shavers.</li>
            <li> I bought the Schick quattro because I had read good reviews about it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Years ago, I shaved with the Schick FX Diamond, I liked it.  </li>
            <li> Others may want to try it based on their own needs.</li>
            <li> Works, nice non slip surface.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to get a better shave than the already sensational shave my Mach 3 delivers!&amp;quot; ...</li>
            <li> My choice is the Schick Quattro due to the superior closeness of the shave (a perfect shave is achievable on the Quattro)</li>
            <li> , well, you rinse from the top with Quattro.</li>
            <li> It seemed to me that the engineers with the Quattro were focusing more on the looks of the product, rather than the quality.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t agree with the argument of more irritation.</li>
            <li> Most of the reviewers who gave the shaver 1 or 2 stars do admit that it takes them More strokes to get a comparable shave with the gilette as they did with one stroke of the Quattro.</li>
            <li> Sure, it may not have the electrical glide</li>
            <li> Maybe someone with a hotter water setting would have better luck.</li>
            <li> For more just didn&#x27;t prove to be better</li>
            <li> Probably like most men thinking the more the blades the better/closer the shave.</li>
            <li> The 3 blade razor I was using performed much better.</li>
            <li> HE SAID IT WAS WAY BETTER</li>
            <li> No joke they work better than that piece of junk.&lt;BR</li>
            <li> On curved surfaces, the shave was comparable to the Mach 3, and required just as many touch up passes.  </li>
            <li> *might* be excellent to shave one&#x27;s legs with, if you don&#x27;t shave above the knee.  </li>
            <li> I have used all the latest generation razors including the Mach3Turbo, M3Power, and the Schick Quattro.  </li>
            <li> My hope is that now that there&#x27;s an alternative product in the market, Gillette may respond by pricing its two-bladed and three-bladed products more competitively.</li>
            <li> Schick Quattro cartridges are the cheapest of the bunch (Mach 3 Turbo, M3 Power,..), last the longest, and deliver the best shave.</li>
            <li> get a Mach 3, its cheaper, and a much better shave over all.</li>
            <li> The top strip didn&#x27;t lubricate well</li>
            <li> I shave my head twice a week, and have always enjoyed the benefits of the Mach 3 Turbo.  </li>
            <li> I signed on the band-wagon of having the newest and most improved.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am very impressed with this razor, and don&#x27;t plan on going back to my Mach 3.  </li>
            <li> Going to give me a better shave...</li>
            <li> I have been very happy with the Quattro and haven&#x27;t looked back since.</li>
            <li> If you compare the Quattro to the Fusion then I would give a slightly better shave to the Fusion.</li>
            <li> Have used this razor for over two years now, and it is just flat out the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> I loved the Mach 3 and after using it exclusively for years, I switched to the Gilette Fusion when it first came out.</li>
            <li> Then, all the blades are squished together, so the hair gets stuck and clogged between the blades pretty good.  </li>
            <li> I mean, if you&#x27;ve never had a really good shave, you might think the Quattro is awesome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re fine though</li>
            <li> Then I moved on the the Gillette Mach 3, marked improvement and have been happy with that for years.  </li>
            <li> I have a lifelong hobby of seeking the perfect shave.  </li>
            <li> Just like all the other reviews here, I have to agree that no shaver is perfect.</li>
            <li> They are worth the 15% more cost for the 3000% better product.</li>
            <li> I agree with those that say the Quattro clogs up easily.  </li>
            <li> Recently, Schick sent me a free Quattro razor in the mail and I loved it!</li>
            <li> The blades transition on and off just fine.  </li>
            <li> Even if I got another for free.</li>
            <li> Light application of a shaving oil is an option.</li>
            <li> Shave with Quattro razor, attempt to go with the direction of the growth with light pressure.  </li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve been using this razor, the Mach 3 seems too light.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m going to go ahead and buy another handle (they&#x27;re surprisingly cheap).  </li>
            <li> My wife got a coupon for a free Quattro with blades, so I gave it a try for a week.  </li>
            <li> Tried the free sample, then got one for my wife.</li>
            <li> I got this from a free coupon offer.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully, I got this for free</li>
            <li> I tried salvaging the cartridge by soaking it, running dish soap through it to free the hair, blasting water through it and wiping it with a wash cloth.  </li>
            <li> I got a free Schick Quattro sample in the mail, and decided to give it a \\&quot;wurl\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I used a Gillette Fusion for a while and the shave you get is effortless, close, and smooth.</li>
            <li> I got a Gillette with 3 blades, and my face is smooth again.</li>
            <li> Sure, your face is smooth afterwards, but it really isn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
            <li> In both cases, the Quattro delivered a superior shave on flat surfaces (side of the neck and top of the side-burns area).  </li>
            <li> I went over the side of my face  that I had first shaved with the Quattro, and was able to cut additional hair that the Quattro missed.</li>
            <li> To begin with, I immediately noticed the significant weight difference between the Quattro and the Fusion.</li>
            <li> I should also mention that I have a fairly light growth (can&#x27;t even grow a full beard)</li>
            <li> Keep luke-warm water flowing from tap to clean razor blade.</li>
            <li> The Quattro is way easier to clean out than the Gillette razors.</li>
            <li> However, if you want the absolute closest possible shave and are willing to put up with the discomfort, the Quattro is the best choice.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly</li>
            <li> Afterall, I thought, since I liked Gillette&#x27;s Mach 3 so much that surely if there would be any difference between it and the Quattro, that the Quattro would only be the better of the two.  </li>
            <li> Though the shave is good with new cartridges, I have a great deal of trouble cleaning the hairs out from between the blades.  </li>
            <li> The Power Quattro was slightly better, but not by much.  </li>
            <li> Thought, what the hey I&#x27;ll give it another shot, after another year of shaving experience maybe and another year of possibly improvements to the razor, it might make a good shave.  </li>
            <li> However true this might be</li>
            <li> But of course we all think about when we are going to have to buy a new pack of blades, and I&#x27;d say that market share is the more important factor for Schick.</li>
            <li> *) I rinse after each stroke, and it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more ergonomic IMO than the gilette, and definitely adapts better to the curvature of the face.  </li>
            <li> It is far better to buy cheap plastic disposables.</li>
            <li> The first shave is fairly smooth, I will give it that.</li>
            <li> Both razors give me awesome shaves, and the blades last a long time.  </li>
            <li> When I first switched to the Schick, I didn&#x27;t like it as much as the Mach 3, but after a while I came to like it more.  </li>
            <li> I think it is great that they threw in an extra blade in the new Schick Quattro Razor.  </li>
            <li> Previously, I had used the Mach3 and found that the Mach3Turbo was more comfortable than the Mach3(better lubrication) and for many years this was my razor of choice.  </li>
            <li> I think the multiple-bladed razors are an emerging technology, and apparently are very easy to make incorrectly.</li>
            <li> are far better than anything else out there</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t worth two cents.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It felt  smooth while I used it, but it left a stubble no matter how many times I shaved over.</li>
            <li> recommendation is that if you can live with a less than perfect shave in difficult areas, then the Gillette Mach3Turbo is the best razor.  </li>
            <li> I was not aware how much I loved the Gilette Fusion until I tried the Shick Quattro.</li>
            <li> I also agree with the other reviewers who said that the razor leaves one with a relatively good deal of razor burn.  </li>
            <li> I remembered that it used to pull out my hair and pinch me, right out of the box.</li>
            <li> It must rock the Gillete Mach 3 right??</li>
            <li> Warbull(a reviewer) is right</li>
            <li> Go for the smooth, effortless experience of a new blade!</li>
            <li> if you are looking for the ultimate close shave - you will find the Quattro superior to any Gillette if you can live with the discomfort.  </li>
            <li> But perhaps the most apparent difference was that with the Quattro, the five o&#x27;clock shadow becomes the noontime shadow.</li>
            <li> I use a spray bottle to make sure I clean out between the blades after each use and I blot it dry on a towel and them keep it in the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> Indeed, the first problem I noticed was the near impossiblity of easily cleaning out hair shavings caught underneath the Quattro&#x27;s blades.  </li>
            <li> excel thank you very much.</li>
            <li> The unit has a nice grip, but the handle is a little light for a razor with a large head.  </li>
            <li> However, later on, when being clean shaven was called for by my work, I found myself using the free Gilette Mach 3 which I received in the mail.</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited about a new razor (well, as excited as one can get about a new raor).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the reason the cart is open up top.</li>
            <li> Although I preferred the Mach 3 at first, I have gotten used to the Fusion over time and have come to appreciate it.    </li>
            <li> I was surprised at how cheap and flimsy the Quattro felt in my hand.</li>
            <li> ;-)    </li>
            <li> first reason is that it works well.  </li>
            <li> I used the schick quattro the first time</li>
            <li> I was an avid user of the Gillette Mach3 and decided to try the Quattro to get a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> I used to use Mach 3&#x27;s when they first came out</li>
            <li> I had bought a package of four refill cartridges, and tried two, hoping the first cartridge was a dud.  </li>
            <li> Gillette hands down is the more comfortable blade due to its shallower blade angle and far superior lubrication strips.  </li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers who say that the disposable razors have their advantages -- easy to clean, close shave, easier to trim with (sideburns, etc).  </li>
            <li> In both cases, the Quattro made it feel as if the hair was being pulled a great deal, and that leaves you with the feeling that the blades aren&#x27;t sharp enough.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just as good if not better than Mach3/Turbo.</li>
            <li> However, at the end of the day, I find it difficult to get a perfectly close shave in particular on my neck with the Gillete.  </li>
            <li> I see and feel no other significant difference in performance, feel, ease of cleaning and storing.</li>
            <li> By the second shave I noticed that it clogged too easily</li>
            <li> The shave is so easy that if you go back to disposeables, you will cut your face for a while.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotta say, it certainly seems like both companies have encouraged their employees to &#x27;pad&#x27; the reviews.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s new and has 4 Blades!!</li>
            <li> To start off, I really don&#x27;t have a huge amount of experience using different razors.</li>
            <li> the Quattro came out, however, I gave in since I never really was able to achieve the &amp;quot;perfect shave&amp;quot; with the Mach3Turbo, although the shave was always very comfortable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In addition, I&#x27;ve used one blade for two weeks straight once and never did the wire break.</li>
            <li> I recently received a free sample of the Schick Quattro razor in the mail (strangely enough, only a day after reading the reviews on this site), and decided to conduct my own experiment to compare the Gilette Mach3 Turbo against the Schick Quattro.</li>
            <li> for the design of the Quattro, I find that I much prefer the simplicity of the Mach3 Turbo design over the Quattro.</li>
            <li> It delivers a close, comfortable shave, even without the fourth blade.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Schick for F**in</li>
            <li> The Schick Quattro is much easier to control and gives me a much closer shave.</li>
            <li> forward one year later, I got another free sample box from college.  </li>
            <li> Priced reasonably.</li>
            <li> I got a closer and smoother shave with this razor compared with my Mach, and it didn&#x27;t irritate me as much.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t actually begin to lubricate until I began rubbing the strip, far more vigorously</li>
            <li> Based on all the negative reviews, there&#x27;s a good chance that it&#x27;s all from Gillette that simply wants to wipe out the competition.</li>
            <li> The vibrations on the M3Power cause more trouble than its worth, and cannot shave as close as either razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The blades last longer, and the shaving angle is more natural than I found with the Atra or Sensor.</li>
            <li> Maybe pitch the Quattro as lasting up to 40% longer than Schick&#x27;s own 3-blade, and (independently) the 3-blade (which I have not tried) as equivalent to the Mach 3.    </li>
            <li> I was positive it had to have given a decent shave there.</li>
            <li> On my first try with a new blade and longer hair, I ruined the cartridge.  </li>
            <li> I like most other people here used to use Mach</li>
            <li> The cartridge is bulkier than the 3 blade variety, though, and I believe it may hinder movement enjoyed by other blades like the Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep buying these as long as they remain available.</li>
            <li> another reviewer mentioned, there&#x27;s too much \\&quot;going on\\&quot; with it behind the blades for the hair to be able to free itself.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, the Mach 3 will wash clean, easily and simply, under virtually any tempterature of water.  </li>
            <li> I like using a Quattro more than a Mach 3 because it leaves me with less ingrown hairs than a Mach 3.  </li>
            <li> Pre-shave prep with a hot towel or hot shower to soften hairs and open pores.  </li>
            <li> I thought it would be a decent product because of the quality of the Diamond.  </li>
            <li> This of course is likely to vary, might not be as good on other trials, and the judgement of when you have to change to a new blade is subjective, but the difference was so substantial that it seems beyond subjective, far outweighing the 5% or so added cost.     </li>
            <li> Because Gillette patents things to high heaven, Schick has to do a lot of work arounds.</li>
            <li> It does seem to clog up faster than the Mach 3, but since I shave in the shower (*highly recommend this to everybody</li>
            <li> It gives by a large margin an inferior shave to my el cheapo Bic Sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have to remind myself to throw out blades every couple of weeks, and the little lather strips (or whatever they are) on the top and bottom have never shown any wear.&lt;br</li>
            <li> unless you shave very very slowly, you will not get a good shave.  </li>
            <li> Pat dry with a clean towel.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until I actually cut my skin - a rare thing indeed when using the Mach 3 Turbo - that I gave up, and discontinued the experiment.</li>
            <li> I will go back to the 3 blade as soon as I can use up the 16 dollars worth of cartridges I got suckered into buying.</li>
            <li> But is it worth the extra price?</li>
            <li> The shave is extremely close and incredibly comfortable.  </li>
            <li> then began shaving with my Mach 3 Turbo, which had been used once or twice before (meaning the shaver blades were not brand new).</li>
            <li> 3(also tried the turbo and the power \\&quot;lots of vibration, but no result\\&quot;) and was reluctant to try anything new.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt irritated, as if the top layer had been burned raw.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really only noticable after roughly 12-14 hours so both do a more than adaquate job in that department.</li>
            <li> The differences I&#x27;ve found between the Quattro and the mach3 turbo are; the Quattro shaves slightly closer, nicks slightly less under my neck (but both are far better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used), and gets my upper lip hairs better.</li>
            <li> And this was only after the first swipe through my sideburns.</li>
            <li> I usually use a gillette mach 3 turbo and love it but decided to try the quatro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Hot water from my faucet simply isn&#x27;t enough.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I can feel the blades cutting across my face and it has a bit more drag than my Mach 3, which is a good thing because I know it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li> Wow 4 blades!</li>
            <li> The blades last a ridiculously long time, the shave is close and comfortable, and cuts and nicks are virtually non-existent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shave itself was shockingly bad, was ok on the main part of my face, however its extremely &#x27;grabby&#x27; which isnt a pleasant experience considering you have four razor blades on your skin.</li>
            <li> True, it is harder to clean the shaver after using it on long hair, but no such problem exists if you use it every couple of days.  </li>
            <li> I experimented with new blades on both shavers for several weeks to compare them both objectively and went through several cycles of blade changes.&lt;br /&gt;After inspecting the blades on both razors closely, first I determined that the reason that the Quattro feels more iritating during shaving is probably due to the blade angle differences on the razors</li>
            <li> I gave the Quattro a try, and feel that it&#x27;s more comparable to my electric razor (which I hardly use).</li>
            <li> 2-3 passes to clear.  </li>
            <li> so if I tried to clear the hair by wiping it with a wash cloth, the hair stuck on the notches.  </li>
            <li> Before shaving, I tested the lubricating quality of the strips by moistening my finger and gently moving it back and forth over the surface of the strip.</li>
            <li> Nope, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone who wants to avoid razor cuts, copious amounts of blood, pain, and facial disfigurement.</li>
            <li> I took one swipe with it and wanted to stop completely</li>
            <li> It felt like rubbing sand paper on already sensitive skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, after weeks of testing, I find that the steeper blade angle and the central pivot on the Quattro give a much closer shave than the Gillette.  </li>
            <li> Common sense thinking would tell you, &amp;quot;the more, the merrier.&amp;quot;  </li>
            <li> I EVEN tried using an old tooth brush to wedge the hair out, but gave up after 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> But overall it gives very satisfactory results for the price.    </li>
            <li> and I washed the thing out on nearly every pass.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that to be true, especially if you wait until your beard is long to shave</li>
            <li> And last for around a weeks worth of daily shaving.&lt;BR</li>
            <li> They give a great shave, you have to go slow and do some re-shaving on the neck if you leave your beard a few days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, the Quattro, after less than one full shave, is in the trash.</li>
            <li> It is a decent razor -- not terrible, not great.    </li>
            <li> After I got done joking about how the razor companies (Gillette and Schick) were going to keep making razors with a greater number of blades than their opponent, I decided to take the Quattro seriously and bought it.  </li>
            <li> Even after shaving, the lubricating strips felt dry, and certainly nowhere near as helpful as - you guessed it - the Mach3 Turbo.</li>
            <li> The Fusion is probably about three times as heavy as the Quattro, and it simply feels more solid in my hand.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this new 4 blade razor.</li>
            <li> Hot water from a tap into the back of the blades should clean it out in half a sec!</li>
            <li> It can be hard to clean, and yes, I have resorted to using an old toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> With former razors (Ultrex twin blade), a pass along the edge with a toothpick would do it easily, but the vertical wires on the blades make it impossible to clean these cartridges efficiently, resulting in my having to spend a lot of extra time cleaning them or keep changing cartridges, which really increases the expense.  </li>
            <li> My Fusion blades gradually grew dull over time, so I decided to try the free Quattro I received in the mail.</li>
            <li> facial growth is relatively light however so I am not sure how heavier growth users would do.&lt;br /&gt;I used the Mach3Turbo exclusively until the Shick Quattro came out.  </li>
            <li> second reason is that it finally offers Gillette some competition in the \\&quot;premium\\&quot; segment of the market.  </li>
            <li> So after the Fusion I went back to Bic Sensitive disposeables.</li>
            <li> The four blade razor is average with light one day stubble, but put it up against a couple days rough stubble</li>
            <li> , unfortunately I did not have another razor handy.  </li>
            <li> first day that I tried the Quattro, I admit that I hated it - for many of the same reasons that other reviewers have said - primarily the razor feels very &amp;quot;scratchy&amp;quot; when you shave and there is virtually no lubrication vs the Gillette.  </li>
            <li> These quatro blades hold an edge a very long time as long as you clean them thoroughly and keep them dry (don&#x27;t store in the shower).</li>
            <li> The Turbo shaves with less friction and the handle doesn&#x27;t accumulate as much of that old shaving cream gunk which tends to pile up over time.&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed is it&#x27;s not as smooth as my usual razor, and mostly it clogged up with hair SO BAD that I had to discontinue using it.</li>
            <li> That can generally be avoided by rinsing regularly.    </li>
            <li> It seemed to really irritate my face to the extreme, didn&#x27;t glide easily, and failed to get a close shave.  </li>
            <li> The Quattro however, is hands down the winner on closeness of shave, if you can live with the irration caused by the steep blade</li>
            <li> If I were in Schick&#x27;s marketing department, I&#x27;d pitch how long the blades last.</li>
            <li> The blades also seem to last twice as long as the Mach 3 blades.  </li>
            <li> However the blades dont last that long</li>
            <li> These wires come loose and break after about the third use of one blade.</li>
            <li> /&gt;No way these negative reviews are for real.</li>
            <li> I had to replace the blade on the Mach 3 long before I replaced that on the Quattro.</li>
            <li> SO HE GROWS HAIR FAST AND THICK.</li>
            <li> I experienced less irritation overall, due to the fact that the shave was closer and I stopped getting annoying ingrown hairs, from the not too close shave of the gilette.</li>
            <li> I felt like I wasn&#x27;t given enough control due to the configuration.  </li>
            <li> I tend to hold the head of the Gillette during shaving due to its pivot being towards the back since the front of the razor</li>
            <li> In addition, the blade lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> All it did was pull my beard, and I had to make approximately 3 passes total to get a reasonable shave.  </li>
            <li> and I never go more than a few days without shaving, so I am unable to comment on how well it works with heavier patterns of hair.</li>
            <li> recommend you not using this product if you have the same situation of a thick beard and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I also felt like the razor became dull much quicker than the Mach 3 - only after a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I remember buying a razor in England that utilized the same theory - place wire strips down the face of the blades and folks won&#x27;t get cut.</li>
            <li> A typical cart seems to last me about 10 shaves.</li>
            <li> I was tempted to think there might not be enough spacing between the blades, but they look about as close to each other as other brands.  </li>
            <li> In fact, in the roughly 100 shaves using this razor, none of the head&#x27;s wires broke</li>
            <li> do not fit in existing trays to hold extra blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hair got stuck in the blades and it stopped shaving well after only a few strokes.</li>
            <li> In the meantime I&#x27;ve been using what we have in the house which I have to admit is one of my wife&#x27;s disposable pink razors.  </li>
            <li> It felt as rough as those plastic ones you buy in 20 packs.  </li>
            <li> If used cautiously, one can achieve a close shave with minimal irritation.  </li>
            <li> I have a thick beard coupled with fairly sensitive skin, so your results might vary, but I found myself going over areas 3-4 times where the Mach 3 handled them in 1-2 swipes.  </li>
            <li> The Mach-3 head flops around making it very difficult to accurately trim.</li>
            <li> I planned on shaving one side of my face with the Quattro, and the other with the Mach3 Turbo.</li>
            <li> However, the Mach 3 Power left me with the worst razor burn and the most cuts I&#x27;ve ever had from a razor!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pulling hair on the other end.  </li>
            <li> I threw away that razor after one use, and threw away the other sample I managed to get.  </li>
            <li> Comments from other reviewers do not make any sense to me and do not jibe with what I see on other sites, e.g.     (...)    </li>
            <li> It was very rough on my face</li>
            <li> When I shaved on a daily routine, I found it worked well and shaved closely although my skin did feel a slight bit raw.</li>
            <li> The Quattro&#x27;s rotating head uses an overly complicated method to rotate the head, as well as replace the head when it dulls (which seems to be straight out of the package).</li>
            <li> I was wrong, it was still the same old hair pulling razor.   </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have thick facial hair during highschool, so I found using an electric every other day was sufficient.</li>
            <li> If I hadn&#x27;t bought all of those replacement Quattro blades I might stick with her little pink razors.  </li>
            <li> If I have a couple of week&#x27;s worth of growth, the hairs all get stuck in the safety wires they put over the blades to keep them from cutting you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be so down on the Quattro.</li>
            <li> and it is almost useless, and this razor is brand new!</li>
            <li> previous handle came apart after 24</li>
            <li> If they are really serious, then why don&#x27;t they just add an extra blade and make it an M4 and put some perpendicular wiring to the blades just like Schick and grow the</li>
            <li> It shaves a little closer than the mach3 turbo</li>
            <li> The Quattro&#x27;s handle manages to be bulky, has slick chrome, and has a short handle, not exactly a good omen.   </li>
            <li> The only worse blade I ever used was a dollar store brand.</li>
            <li> Indeed, even leaving the razon under running, scolding-hot water for a few minutes did nothing to alleviate the problem.</li>
            <li> I would like to save you the trouble that I had to go through I buying the Schick Quattro razor.&lt;BR</li>
            <li> the end of the day, Quattro is my choice when I want the closest shave possible.&lt;br /&gt;For others who have tried the Quattro for a few shaves and gave up,</li>
            <li> I also got a few nicks around my jaw line that I never got with the Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;The handle</li>
            <li> You can run water over it, wipe it off, a few hairs will always be stuck in it.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble shaving the curves in the lower part of my neck, but the Quattro&#x27;s abundance of blades has solved that problem.</li>
            <li> Come in packs of 12 for a few bucks.</li>
            <li> I hate to make the site look like a broken record, but this razon honestly hurts to use.  </li>
            <li> it is a poor and uncomfortable shave, for a very high price.</li>
            <li> what a disappointment this new Schick Quattro is.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure where they&#x27;re coming from.</li>
            <li> It now sits in my cabinet with the extra blade, useless.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the difference was the opposite of what I had anticipated.</li>
            <li> overall shave is uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Also, the design is a complicated row of plastic grid work on the back and doesn&#x27;t lend itself well to letting the hair escape.</li>
            <li> The cartridges are way too expensive to use on only one shave.</li>
            <li> The drag on this is horrible, and after only a few uses the pivot on the head didn&#x27;t work properly.</li>
            <li> I give it 4 out of 5 due to its poor lubrication strip.</li>
            <li> If you are one of those guys who get terrible razor burn and cuts in the neck region when shaving, I highly suggest using the plain Quattro razor in combination with the following regimen.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to shave through curves</li>
            <li> I feel like I am shaving with dull blades when I use this Quattro -- even with a brand-new blade cartridge.</li>
            <li> this razor completely sucks.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know if it is a common problem, but it pissed the hell out of me.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t even have a thick beard.</li>
            <li> is thick and holds well.  </li>
            <li> I have an thick beard</li>
            <li> I MEAN</li>
            <li> I have never had such bad razor burn as I had with this razor.  </li>
            <li> But I figured I&#x27;d use it a few times since razor blades are so expensive.  </li>
            <li> Unlike the Mach 3, the back end of the cartridge is inexplicably blocked!</li>
            <li> Then (if you don&#x27;t like it) throw away the used blade and give the rest to someone you know who has a tough beard to try out.  </li>
            <li> It glided through with little resistance over my face, cutting the hair and not my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this product shows a lack of usability study, poor customer service, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, I believe that the thin wires around the blades also contribute to the irration.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would rate this razor poorly versus the Mach3Turbo.  </li>
            <li> So I get one, and notice when I take it out of the box that it had thin wires</li>
            <li> Instead of gracefully and effortlessly cutting through the hair, the Quattro grated against my skin as if it were dull.</li>
            <li> It was by far the worst shave I had ever had in my life.</li>
            <li> The Schick Quattro Titanium Razor just put a 3-inch slice in my cheek and caused a bloody mess.</li>
            <li> I have been very disappointed with the Quattro and will switch to a different razor once I use all the cartridges.  </li>
            <li> The product is a sad attempt to match the quality of the Mach3 Turbo, and in no way does it come close.</li>
            <li> The top blade came out of the side holder and stuck up to give a nasty razor cut (in fact, two nasty cuts).</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to believe that the Quattro could be rated either 5 stars or 1 star.  </li>
            <li> The Quattro is too bulky and uncomfortable to recommend.  </li>
            <li> But the concept is flawed somewhere.  </li>
            <li> but of course that&#x27;s silly, why would they ever do that.     </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, if the hair is longer than five-o&#x27;clock shadow the razor clogs something fierce.  </li>
            <li> WRONG.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re incredibly expensive.</li>
            <li> But paying $20+ a month just to shave is too expensive.   </li>
            <li> When Schick came out with the Quattro I was skeptical but ended up giving it a shot because the Mach 3 blades were still expensive.</li>
            <li> It fails miserably in this department, I start noticing stubble appear before the day is even half over.    </li>
            <li> Instead of cutting the hair, I felt it being pulled from the roots.</li>
            <li> Using this product is dangerous and an incentive to buy a Norelco.</li>
            <li> Rinse face with cold water.  </li>
            <li> The Quattro is awkward to hold, too.</li>
            <li> But the 4 Blades are for some CRAZY reason Tied Together with a WIRE wrapped around them every 1/6 of an inch.</li>
            <li> i cut my self or the razor diggs in pulling up skin and cutting the skin as it does so.</li>
            <li> IT WOULD ALWAYS CUT REALLY BAD</li>
            <li> This is a really bad razor.</li>
            <li> I tried running it under water,shaking it violently under water, and even running my finger with the blades with no results.</li>
            <li> I hate this razor with a passion.</li>
            <li> Very bad experience, would not recommend this for shaving my dog!</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst razors I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Horrible product.</li>
            <li> WORST</li>
            <li> WORST Razor i ever used in my life.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read some of the complaints regarding this razor and I&#x27;m not sure where they&#x27;re coming from. Because Gillette patents things to high heaven, Schick has to do a lot of work arounds. &lt;BR&gt;Can&#x27;t rinse from the back, well, you rinse from the top with Quattro. It&#x27;s the reason the cart is open up top. There is zero clogging if you follow Schick&#x27;s directions to rinsing. In addition, I&#x27;ve used one blade for two weeks straight once and never did the wire break. In fact, in the roughly 100 shaves using this razor, none of the head&#x27;s wires broke so I wouldn&#x27;t worry about that. A typical cart seems to last me about 10 shaves. It shaves a little closer than the mach3 turbo but it&#x27;s really only noticable after roughly 12-14 hours so both do a more than adaquate job in that department. &lt;BR&gt;The differences I&#x27;ve found between the Quattro and the mach3 turbo are; the Quattro shaves slightly closer, nicks slightly less under my neck (but both are far better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used), and gets my upper lip hairs better. The Turbo shaves with less friction and the handle doesn&#x27;t accumulate as much of that old shaving cream gunk which tends to pile up over time.&lt;br /&gt;Both are far better than anything else out there so I keep both handles in the cabinet and buy replacements depending on which, if either, is on sale.</li>
            <li> I recently received a free sample of the Schick Quattro razor in the mail (strangely enough, only a day after reading the reviews on this site), and decided to conduct my own experiment to compare the Gilette Mach3 Turbo against the Schick Quattro. I planned on shaving one side of my face with the Quattro, and the other with the Mach3 Turbo. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In a word: ow. Instead of gracefully and effortlessly cutting through the hair, the Quattro grated against my skin as if it were dull. Instead of cutting the hair, I felt it being pulled from the roots. My skin felt irritated, as if the top layer had been burned raw. And this was only after the first swipe through my sideburns. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I dutifully continued with the experiment, now vocally protesting from the pain. It wasn&#x27;t until I actually cut my skin - a rare thing indeed when using the Mach 3 Turbo - that I gave up, and discontinued the experiment. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I then began shaving with my Mach 3 Turbo, which had been used once or twice before (meaning the shaver blades were not brand new). It glided through with little resistance over my face, cutting the hair and not my skin. I went over the side of my face  that I had first shaved with the Quattro, and was able to cut additional hair that the Quattro missed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As for the design of the Quattro, I find that I much prefer the simplicity of the Mach3 Turbo design over the Quattro. The Quattro&#x27;s rotating head uses an overly complicated method to rotate the head, as well as replace the head when it dulls (which seems to be straight out of the package). It seemed to me that the engineers with the Quattro were focusing more on the looks of the product, rather than the quality. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Quattro&#x27;s packaging claims that the dual lubricating strips help condition the skin before and after the shave, to cut closer. Before shaving, I tested the lubricating quality of the strips by moistening my finger and gently moving it back and forth over the surface of the strip. Nothing happened. It didn&#x27;t actually begin to lubricate until I began rubbing the strip, far more vigorously than I would had I shaved it with my face. Even after shaving, the lubricating strips felt dry, and certainly nowhere near as helpful as - you guessed it - the Mach3 Turbo. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So, the Quattro, after less than one full shave, is in the trash. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone. The product is a sad attempt to match the quality of the Mach3 Turbo, and in no way does it come close.</li>
            <li> Just like all the other reviews here, I have to agree that no shaver is perfect. I like most other people here used to use Mach 3(also tried the turbo and the power \\&quot;lots of vibration, but no result\\&quot;) and was reluctant to try anything new.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;However, my face is thanking me for trying this shaver.  &lt;br /&gt;1. Closer shave than any of the gilettes.  &lt;br /&gt;2. I experienced less irritation overall, due to the fact that the shave was closer and I stopped getting annoying ingrown hairs, from the not too close shave of the gilette. &lt;br /&gt;3. I don&#x27;t agree with the argument of more irritation. Most of the reviewers who gave the shaver 1 or 2 stars do admit that it takes them More strokes to get a comparable shave with the gilette as they did with one stroke of the Quattro. Hence, the irritation \\&quot;if any\\&quot; should be the same.  &lt;br /&gt;4. True, it is harder to clean the shaver after using it on long hair, but no such problem exists if you use it every couple of days.  &lt;br /&gt;5. It&#x27;s more ergonomic IMO than the gilette, and definitely adapts better to the curvature of the face.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> To start off, I really don&#x27;t have a huge amount of experience using different razors. I didn&#x27;t have thick facial hair during highschool, so I found using an electric every other day was sufficient. However, later on, when being clean shaven was called for by my work, I found myself using the free Gilette Mach 3 which I received in the mail. I loved the Mach 3 and after using it exclusively for years, I switched to the Gilette Fusion when it first came out. Although I preferred the Mach 3 at first, I have gotten used to the Fusion over time and have come to appreciate it.    I was not aware how much I loved the Gilette Fusion until I tried the Shick Quattro. My Fusion blades gradually grew dull over time, so I decided to try the free Quattro I received in the mail. WHAT A SHOCK.    To begin with, I immediately noticed the significant weight difference between the Quattro and the Fusion. The Fusion is probably about three times as heavy as the Quattro, and it simply feels more solid in my hand. I was surprised at how cheap and flimsy the Quattro felt in my hand. But perhaps the most apparent difference was that with the Quattro, the five o&#x27;clock shadow becomes the noontime shadow. The shave is simply not close enough. It fails miserably in this department, I start noticing stubble appear before the day is even half over.    So in closing... I would avoid this razor at all costs. Even if I got another for free.</li>
            <li> The Schick Quattro Titanium Razor just put a 3-inch slice in my cheek and caused a bloody mess. Thank goodness it wasn&#x27;t shaving my throat. The top blade came out of the side holder and stuck up to give a nasty razor cut (in fact, two nasty cuts). Nope, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone who wants to avoid razor cuts, copious amounts of blood, pain, and facial disfigurement. Using this product is dangerous and an incentive to buy a Norelco.</li>
            <li> I have four problems with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A) Product quality:&lt;br /&gt;My previous handle came apart after 24 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B) Usability:&lt;br /&gt;The handles are entirely different shape and contour between models.&lt;br /&gt;Many do not come with a tray to hold extra blades.&lt;br /&gt;Many do not fit in existing trays to hold extra blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C) Customer Service:&lt;br /&gt;I reported the problem to Shick, which is \\&quot;Energizer Personal Care\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;2 weeks later, they responded with apology, and committment to send me a coupon to replace the handle.&lt;br /&gt;5 weeks after that email, I received the coupon in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;D) The blades clog.  If I have stubble only, then the shaving goo and stubble bits pack into the razor.  It can&#x27;t be rinsed out except maybe by a pressure-washer.  If I have a couple of week&#x27;s worth of growth, the hairs all get stuck in the safety wires they put over the blades to keep them from cutting you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product shows a lack of usability study, poor customer service, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go back to Gillette.  They are worth the 15% more cost for the 3000% better product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ben shaving my entire head for 6 years. I usually use a gillette mach 3 turbo and love it but decided to try the quatro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a shave brush and shave soap. So I lather up and start shaving. The hair got stuck in the blades and it stopped shaving well after only a few strokes. I tried running it under water,shaking it violently under water, and even running my finger with the blades with no results. It stayed clogged. It now sits in my cabinet with the extra blade, useless. I once used a clogged bick razor and it took a chunk out of my forhead. So I went back to my trusty Mach 3 Turbo. I havent tried the auto vibrating one. Seems like a gimmick. The only worse blade I ever used was a dollar store brand. One word-OUCH!</li>
            <li> Sure, it may not have the electrical glide but it&#x27;s just as good if not better than Mach3/Turbo. Like Mach3, the Quattro Schick comes with lube strips of Vitamin E and Aloe. Also, the perpendicular wires to the blades help prevent nicks and burns. Based on all the negative reviews, there&#x27;s a good chance that it&#x27;s all from Gillette that simply wants to wipe out the competition. If they are really serious, then why don&#x27;t they just add an extra blade and make it an M4 and put some perpendicular wiring to the blades just like Schick and grow the **** up !</li>
            <li> I hate to make the site look like a broken record, but this razon honestly hurts to use.  The Mach3 was so smoothe, and this one is like a drawn out wax job.  I have never had such bad razor burn as I had with this razor.  Sure, your face is smooth afterwards, but it really isn&#x27;t worth it.  stick to the M3.</li>
            <li> I have been very disappointed with the Quattro and will switch to a different razor once I use all the cartridges.  Though the shave is good with new cartridges, I have a great deal of trouble cleaning the hairs out from between the blades.  Hot water from my faucet simply isn&#x27;t enough.  With former razors (Ultrex twin blade), a pass along the edge with a toothpick would do it easily, but the vertical wires on the blades make it impossible to clean these cartridges efficiently, resulting in my having to spend a lot of extra time cleaning them or keep changing cartridges, which really increases the expense.  Maybe someone with a hotter water setting would have better luck.</li>
            <li> After I got done joking about how the razor companies (Gillette and Schick) were going to keep making razors with a greater number of blades than their opponent, I decided to take the Quattro seriously and bought it.  Afterall, I thought, since I liked Gillette&#x27;s Mach 3 so much that surely if there would be any difference between it and the Quattro, that the Quattro would only be the better of the two.  Also, who isn&#x27;t somewhat impressed by the aesthetics of those four metallic blades?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Unfortunately, the difference was the opposite of what I had anticipated. Indeed, the first problem I noticed was the near impossiblity of easily cleaning out hair shavings caught underneath the Quattro&#x27;s blades.  Indeed, even leaving the razon under running, scolding-hot water for a few minutes did nothing to alleviate the problem. On the other hand, the Mach 3 will wash clean, easily and simply, under virtually any tempterature of water.  I also agree with the other reviewers who said that the razor leaves one with a relatively good deal of razor burn.  I also felt like the razor became dull much quicker than the Mach 3 - only after a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Ultimately, I definitely prefer the Mach 3, and should - heaven forbid - we ever see a five bladed razor, I&#x27;ll definitely be more skeptical.  For more just didn&#x27;t prove to be better here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - Dane</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Quattro for about 3 years now, and I though I would try out both the Mach 3 Power Nitro and the Schick Power Quattro just to see if they lived up to the hype.  Many of my friends told me they got the best shaves of their life with the Mach 3 Power Nitro: No razor burn or bumps etc. However, the Mach 3 Power left me with the worst razor burn and the most cuts I&#x27;ve ever had from a razor!  The Power Quattro was slightly better, but not by much.  If you are one of those guys who get terrible razor burn and cuts in the neck region when shaving, I highly suggest using the plain Quattro razor in combination with the following regimen. &lt;br /&gt;1) Pre-shave prep with a hot towel or hot shower to soften hairs and open pores.  Light application of a shaving oil is an option. &lt;br /&gt;2) Use a fragrance-free shave gel with Aloe and Vitamin E.  Lather the face with a shaving brush and allow it to \\&quot;settle in\\&quot; for about a minute. &lt;br /&gt;3) Shave with Quattro razor, attempt to go with the direction of the growth with light pressure.  Keep luke-warm water flowing from tap to clean razor blade. &lt;br /&gt;4) Rinse face with cold water.  Pat dry with a clean towel.  Apply an alcohol-free aftershave gel or cream. &lt;br /&gt;This should result in the closest and least-irritating shave possible.</li>
            <li> I like both this razor and the Mach 3 from Gillete.  Both razors give me awesome shaves, and the blades last a long time.  When I first switched to the Schick, I didn&#x27;t like it as much as the Mach 3, but after a while I came to like it more.  It does seem to clog up faster than the Mach 3, but since I shave in the shower (*highly recommend this to everybody*) I rinse after each stroke, and it&#x27;s fine.  Now that I&#x27;ve been using this razor, the Mach 3 seems too light.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this new 4 blade razor. Probably like most men thinking the more the blades the better/closer the shave. I was wrong. The four blade razor is average with light one day stubble, but put it up against a couple days rough stubble and it is almost useless, and this razor is brand new! The 3 blade razor I was using performed much better. I will go back to the 3 blade as soon as I can use up the 16 dollars worth of cartridges I got suckered into buying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotta say, it certainly seems like both companies have encouraged their employees to &#x27;pad&#x27; the reviews.  I noticed that almost all of the one(1) star reviews compared the Quattro to the Gillette Mach 3.    It is difficult to believe that the Quattro could be rated either 5 stars or 1 star.  It is a decent razor -- not terrible, not great.    I agree with those that say the Quattro clogs up easily.  I&#x27;ve found that to be true, especially if you wait until your beard is long to shave and/or you don&#x27;t rinse the razor regularly.  It can be hard to clean, and yes, I have resorted to using an old toothbrush.  That can generally be avoided by rinsing regularly.    I recently dropped my Shick Quattro handle and it broke.  That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve been reading these reviews.  I just purchased a bunch of blades on sale so I&#x27;m going to go ahead and buy another handle (they&#x27;re surprisingly cheap).  In the meantime I&#x27;ve been using what we have in the house which I have to admit is one of my wife&#x27;s disposable pink razors.  I agree with the other reviewers who say that the disposable razors have their advantages -- easy to clean, close shave, easier to trim with (sideburns, etc).  If I hadn&#x27;t bought all of those replacement Quattro blades I might stick with her little pink razors.  ;-)    I haven&#x27;t used the Gillette razors so I can&#x27;t comment on them.  I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re fine though or they would have gone out of business.</li>
            <li> These quatro blades hold an edge a very long time as long as you clean them thoroughly and keep them dry (don&#x27;t store in the shower). I shave every 2-3 days and mine lasted for 10 months. I use a spray bottle to make sure I clean out between the blades after each use and I blot it dry on a towel and them keep it in the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> MY HUSBAND USED THIS RAZOR AND ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT HE SAID IT WAS WAY BETTER THEN THE MACH 3. HE IS MEXICAN/INDIAN SO HE GROWS HAIR FAST AND THICK. HE SAID IT WORKED GREAT EVEN ON HIS HEAD HE LOVES TO SHAVE HIS HEAD BALD AND WITH THE MACH3 IT WOULD ALWAYS CUT REALLY BAD SO HE STUCK TO USING THE GILLETE SENSOR EXCEL BUT THEN I GAVE HIM THE SCHICK QUATTRO AND HE THRU EVERYTHING ELSE OUT AND THAT WILL BE THE ONLY RAZOR HE WILL EVER USE.</li>
            <li> I would like to save you the trouble that I had to go through I buying the Schick Quattro razor.&lt;BR&gt;It was by far the worst shave I had ever had in my life. It did cut close but only after being dragged across my face four or five times. It wasn&#x27;t worth two cents. It was very rough on my face and I don&#x27;t even have a thick beard. All I did was irritate my face and cut myself. &lt;BR&gt;It is far better to buy cheap plastic disposables. No joke they work better than that piece of junk.&lt;BR&gt;I got one of my friends who didn&#x27;t believe me to try it and he had the same opinion.</li>
            <li> This is a comparison of the Schick Quattro versus the Gillette Mach 3.  I used Colgate Aloe shaving cream, and shaved twice with the Quattro:  Once with 4-day stubble, once with 2-day stubble.  In both cases, the Quattro delivered a superior shave on flat surfaces (side of the neck and top of the side-burns area).  On curved surfaces, the shave was comparable to the Mach 3, and required just as many touch up passes.  I would think this razor *might* be excellent to shave one&#x27;s legs with, if you don&#x27;t shave above the knee.  However, if you don&#x27;t shave above the knee, you&#x27;re probably blonde, and can use an electric!&lt;br /&gt;The Quattro&#x27;s head feels cumbersome compared to the Mach 3, especially on the upper lip.  I felt like I wasn&#x27;t given enough control due to the configuration.  This may be a matter of the difference of form, since I only used it twice.&lt;br /&gt;The overall shave is uncomfortable.  In both cases, the Quattro made it feel as if the hair was being pulled a great deal, and that leaves you with the feeling that the blades aren&#x27;t sharp enough.  It felt as if there wasn&#x27;t enough lubrication either on my face or the razor.&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I will stay with the Mach 3.  It delivers a close, comfortable shave, even without the fourth blade.  The Quattro is too bulky and uncomfortable to recommend.  I suggest that if you buy the Quattro to try out, just use the one of the two blades packaged with it.  Then (if you don&#x27;t like it) throw away the used blade and give the rest to someone you know who has a tough beard to try out.  I think the multiple-bladed razors are an emerging technology, and apparently are very easy to make incorrectly.</li>
            <li> Very bad experience, would not recommend this for shaving my dog! I used this razor once and never again after that.  All it did was pull my beard, and I had to make approximately 3 passes total to get a reasonable shave.  I have always used the Mach3 by Gillette and I will continue to do this!  Thanks Schick for F**in this one up!</li>
            <li> Years ago, I shaved with the Schick FX Diamond, I liked it.  Then I moved on the the Gillette Mach 3, marked improvement and have been happy with that for years.  Now I come to the &amp;quot;next generation&amp;quot; of razors.  I thought it would be a decent product because of the quality of the Diamond.  I couldn&#x27;t be more wrong.  I can not remember the last time I cut myself shaving.  It felt as rough as those plastic ones you buy in 20 packs.  I took one swipe with it and wanted to stop completely, unfortunately I did not have another razor handy.  It felt like rubbing sand paper on already sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t even shave closely.  I will NEVER use this razor again.  I want to run out and stock up on Mach 3 cartridges so I can survive until the 5 blade razor eventually comes out.  Hopefully Gillete will make it.</li>
            <li> I have used all the latest generation razors including the Mach3Turbo, M3Power, and the Schick Quattro.  My choice is the Schick Quattro due to the superior closeness of the shave (a perfect shave is achievable on the Quattro) although this is a tradeoff on comfort vs the Mach3Turbo.  The vibrations on the M3Power cause more trouble than its worth, and cannot shave as close as either razor.&lt;br /&gt;My facial growth is relatively light however so I am not sure how heavier growth users would do.&lt;br /&gt;I used the Mach3Turbo exclusively until the Shick Quattro came out.  Previously, I had used the Mach3 and found that the Mach3Turbo was more comfortable than the Mach3(better lubrication) and for many years this was my razor of choice.  I had never tried a Schick razor prior to the Quattro.&lt;br /&gt;Once the Quattro came out, however, I gave in since I never really was able to achieve the &amp;quot;perfect shave&amp;quot; with the Mach3Turbo, although the shave was always very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;The first day that I tried the Quattro, I admit that I hated it - for many of the same reasons that other reviewers have said - primarily the razor feels very &amp;quot;scratchy&amp;quot; when you shave and there is virtually no lubrication vs the Gillette.  I went back to my Mach3Turbo temporarily and awaited for the arrival of the M3Power, hoping that the M3Power would give me the ultimate close shave.&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime however, I decided to give the Quattro a second chance.  I experimented with new blades on both shavers for several weeks to compare them both objectively and went through several cycles of blade changes.&lt;br /&gt;After inspecting the blades on both razors closely, first I determined that the reason that the Quattro feels more iritating during shaving is probably due to the blade angle differences on the razors - the Quattro blades are at a steeper angle vs the Mach3Turbo (about 45 degrees vs 30 degrees on the Mach3Turbo).  Also, I believe that the thin wires around the blades also contribute to the irration.&lt;br /&gt;That said, after weeks of testing, I find that the steeper blade angle and the central pivot on the Quattro give a much closer shave than the Gillette.  I tend to hold the head of the Gillette during shaving due to its pivot being towards the back since the front of the razor I feel lifts up during shaving and does not shave as close otherwise.  With the Quattro, I can hold the razor by the handle and still maintain excellent contact with my face.  I have no issues with the blades clogging on either razor (I shave in the shower and rinse frequently).&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette hands down is the more comfortable blade due to its shallower blade angle and far superior lubrication strips.  However, at the end of the day, I find it difficult to get a perfectly close shave in particular on my neck with the Gillete.  The Quattro however, is hands down the winner on closeness of shave, if you can live with the irration caused by the steep blade angle.&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation is that if you can live with a less than perfect shave in difficult areas, then the Gillette Mach3Turbo is the best razor.  However, if you want the absolute closest possible shave and are willing to put up with the discomfort, the Quattro is the best choice.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I have been trying the M3Power since it came out last week and have found that although the vibrations can be soothing, the shave is not as close as the Mach3Turbo (the vibrations make the razor skip over your skin as you shave) and unless you shave very very slowly, you will not get a good shave.  I would rate this razor poorly versus the Mach3Turbo.  Also, I felt that the lubrciation strip on the M3Power does not glide as well as the Mach3Turbo.  I have cut myself about equally as often on all 3 razors so in that respect I doubt any is better.&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day, Quattro is my choice when I want the closest shave possible.&lt;br /&gt;For others who have tried the Quattro for a few shaves and gave up, I recommendthat you give it a second chance if you are looking for the ultimate close shave - you will find the Quattro superior to any Gillette if you can live with the discomfort.  I give it 4 out of 5 due to its poor lubrication strip.</li>
            <li> I think it is great that they threw in an extra blade in the new Schick Quattro Razor.  Common sense thinking would tell you, &amp;quot;the more, the merrier.&amp;quot;  There&#x27;s only one problem.  It just doesn&#x27;t make a difference.  &lt;br /&gt;I have been happily using the Gillette Mach 3 for a year.  My wife got a coupon for a free Quattro with blades, so I gave it a try for a week.  It ended up in the trash can after 7 days.  I have a thick beard coupled with fairly sensitive skin, so your results might vary, but I found myself going over areas 3-4 times where the Mach 3 handled them in 1-2 swipes.  I also got a few nicks around my jaw line that I never got with the Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;The handle is thick and holds well.  The blades transition on and off just fine.  But the concept is flawed somewhere.  I was tempted to think there might not be enough spacing between the blades, but they look about as close to each other as other brands.  The cartridge is bulkier than the 3 blade variety, though, and I believe it may hinder movement enjoyed by other blades like the Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend you not using this product if you have the same situation of a thick beard and sensitive skin.  Others may want to try it based on their own needs.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Schick Quattro about two months ago and it was one of my best purchases ever. I used to use Mach-3 but not anymore. The Mach-3 head flops around making it very difficult to accurately trim. The Schick Quattro is much easier to control and gives me a much closer shave. I can&#x27;t believe some of the reviews on this site. It sounds like Gillette asked their salesforce to write reviews trashing Schicks product. Every one I&#x27;ve spoken to who has tried both products prefers Quattro.</li>
            <li> Tried the free sample, then got one for my wife. The best blade razor ever, and my best shave. My wife loves hers as well. The blades last longer, and the shaving angle is more natural than I found with the Atra or Sensor.</li>
            <li> I got this from a free coupon offer.  I do not like it at all.  It seemed to really irritate my face to the extreme, didn&#x27;t glide easily, and failed to get a close shave.  I found myself going back over what it left with my Mach 3.  I&#x27;m throwing it away now.</li>
            <li> Alright so I&#x27;ve tried this through a mail sample before, did not like it.  I remembered that it used to pull out my hair and pinch me, right out of the box. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fast forward one year later, I got another free sample box from college.  Managed to pick up two of them.  Thought, what the hey I&#x27;ll give it another shot, after another year of shaving experience maybe and another year of possibly improvements to the razor, it might make a good shave.  I was wrong, it was still the same old hair pulling razor.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;First off, the head is too bulky and big.  It&#x27;s hard to shave through curves just b/c it&#x27;s so big, if ur shaving close to one part it&#x27;s pulling hair on the other end.  Also, for some reason it has these lil strings over the blades.  Why they have those is beyond me, but it prevents the razor from giving a closer shave since the string is in the way.  Then, all the blades are squished together, so the hair gets stuck and clogged between the blades pretty good.  You can run water over it, wipe it off, a few hairs will always be stuck in it.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So this razor completely sucks.  I&#x27;d rather use a one bladed bic razor than this.  I threw away that razor after one use, and threw away the other sample I managed to get.  I will stick to my gilette sensor excel thank you very much.</li>
            <li> There are two reasons to like the Schick Quattro. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The first reason is that it works well.  I&#x27;ve always had trouble shaving the curves in the lower part of my neck, but the Quattro&#x27;s abundance of blades has solved that problem. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The second reason is that it finally offers Gillette some competition in the \\&quot;premium\\&quot; segment of the market.  Gillette makes good products I suppose but I&#x27;ve always resented the company&#x27;s price-skimming ways.  My hope is that now that there&#x27;s an alternative product in the market, Gillette may respond by pricing its two-bladed and three-bladed products more competitively. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Recently, Schick sent me a free Quattro razor in the mail and I loved it! Schick Quattro cartridges are the cheapest of the bunch (Mach 3 Turbo, M3 Power,..), last the longest, and deliver the best shave. They also cover in one pass what a M3-product would take 2-3 passes to clear.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;No way these negative reviews are for real. Who uses a toothbrush to unclog a razor? Hot water from a tap into the back of the blades should clean it out in half a sec! The Quattro is way easier to clean out than the Gillette razors.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best disposable razors I&#x27;ve used. Priced reasonably. And last for around a weeks worth of daily shaving.&lt;BR&gt;I&#x27;m happy with this purchase! Close, comfortable.&lt;BR&gt;John Row</li>
            <li> I used the schick quattro the first time and I couldn&#x27;t believe how close a shave I got, I thought it was the best shaving system I had ever come across.  By the second shave I noticed that it clogged too easily and I couldn&#x27;t get the hair out! Unlike the Mach 3, the back end of the cartridge is inexplicably blocked! And as we all have seen the front end has those protective wires compounding the problem.  I have an thick beard so I don&#x27;t know if it is a common problem, but it pissed the hell out of me.</li>
            <li> Works, nice non slip surface.</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited about a new razor (well, as excited as one can get about a new raor). So I get one, and notice when I take it out of the box that it had thin wires (protective wires - I think is what they were called by Wilkenson, an English company now owned by Shick)running vertically across all four blades. This sent up red flags. I remember buying a razor in England that utilized the same theory - place wire strips down the face of the blades and folks won&#x27;t get cut. However true this might be, the fact is, is that it forces the blades to run across the face higer than without the &amp;quot;protective&amp;quot; wires. Four blades or not, I felt that without the protective wires, as in the case with the Mach3, I got a closer shave. As well, the Mach3 felt as though I were shaving my face, not pulling out the hair by the roots. &lt;BR&gt;   I gave the Quattro a try, and feel that it&#x27;s more comparable to my electric razor (which I hardly use). Alass, I will stick with the MAch3 until something else comes out that just might rival it. The Quattro isn&#x27;t that razor at the moment.</li>
            <li> &amp;quot;Four blades?! Wow! Can&#x27;t wait to get a better shave than the already sensational shave my Mach 3 delivers!&amp;quot; ... &lt;br /&gt;Fast forward ... &lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Boy, what a disappointment this new Schick Quattro is. Yes, the shave is close, but no closer than the Mach 3. The Quattro is awkward to hold, too. But the big letdown is the comfort. I feel like I am shaving with dull blades when I use this Quattro -- even with a brand-new blade cartridge. One shave is all I need to make my decision. I am throwing this Quattro in the trash or giving it away. Or maybe I should ask Schick for my money back. Hmmm. Maybe if I had never tried the Mach 3 I wouldn&#x27;t be so down on the Quattro. I mean, if you&#x27;ve never had a really good shave, you might think the Quattro is awesome. Alas!&amp;quot;</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst razors I have ever used. The drag on this is horrible, and after only a few uses the pivot on the head didn&#x27;t work properly. Thankfully, I got this for free so I have no qualms about tossing it in the trash where it belongs. The Mach 3 is clearly superior to this piece of garbage.</li>
            <li> This is just a pile of junk, id rather use a plastic disposable insted of this. it is a poor and uncomfortable shave, for a very high price. get a Mach 3, its cheaper, and a much better shave over all.</li>
            <li> I used the Mach 3 and the Quattro side by side, alternating days, for over 6 months. I had to replace the blade on the Mach 3 long before I replaced that on the Quattro. On this one trial, the Quattro lasted about 40% longer. This of course is likely to vary, might not be as good on other trials, and the judgement of when you have to change to a new blade is subjective, but the difference was so substantial that it seems beyond subjective, far outweighing the 5% or so added cost.     I had been happily using the Mach 3 before this. I see and feel no other significant difference in performance, feel, ease of cleaning and storing. Comments from other reviewers do not make any sense to me and do not jibe with what I see on other sites, e.g.     (...)    I even began to wonder if Gillette has got people to pack the reviews -- but of course that&#x27;s silly, why would they ever do that.     If I were in Schick&#x27;s marketing department, I&#x27;d pitch how long the blades last. Wasn&#x27;t that the Wilkinson Sword pitch, years ago? Selling replacement blades is where the money is, and both companies want to focus our attention on quality of shave etc. Don&#x27;t try to make those blades last! Go for the smooth, effortless experience of a new blade! But of course we all think about when we are going to have to buy a new pack of blades, and I&#x27;d say that market share is the more important factor for Schick. Maybe pitch the Quattro as lasting up to 40% longer than Schick&#x27;s own 3-blade, and (independently) the 3-blade (which I have not tried) as equivalent to the Mach 3.    I now prefer the Quattro -- 6 to 4.</li>
            <li> I was an avid user of the Gillette Mach3 and decided to try the Quattro to get a closer shave.  When I shaved on a daily routine, I found it worked well and shaved closely although my skin did feel a slight bit raw. Unfortunately, if the hair is longer than five-o&#x27;clock shadow the razor clogs something fierce.  I noticed the blades have notches on them so if I tried to clear the hair by wiping it with a wash cloth, the hair stuck on the notches.  Also, the design is a complicated row of plastic grid work on the back and doesn&#x27;t lend itself well to letting the hair escape. The top strip didn&#x27;t lubricate well and I have no clue what the bottom strip was supposed to do. On my first try with a new blade and longer hair, I ruined the cartridge.  The cartridges are way too expensive to use on only one shave. I tried salvaging the cartridge by soaking it, running dish soap through it to free the hair, blasting water through it and wiping it with a wash cloth.  The hair remained stuck and it didn&#x27;t shave well after that.  I think I&#x27;ll stick to the Gillette Mach3.</li>
            <li> I shave my head twice a week, and have always enjoyed the benefits of the Mach 3 Turbo.  I got a free Schick Quattro sample in the mail, and decided to give it a \\&quot;wurl\\&quot;.  The first thing I noticed is it&#x27;s not as smooth as my usual razor, and mostly it clogged up with hair SO BAD that I had to discontinue using it. &lt;br /&gt;Like another reviewer mentioned, there&#x27;s too much \\&quot;going on\\&quot; with it behind the blades for the hair to be able to free itself.  I EVEN tried using an old tooth brush to wedge the hair out, but gave up after 10 minutes. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Have used this razor for over two years now, and it is just flat out the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  The blades last a ridiculously long time, the shave is close and comfortable, and cuts and nicks are virtually non-existent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used most of the popular shavers and blades out there, and this one delivers the best quality at the lowest price per shave.  I&#x27;ll keep buying these as long as they remain available.</li>
            <li> I signed on the band-wagon of having the newest and most improved. It&#x27;s new and has 4 Blades!! It must rock the Gillete Mach 3 right?? WRONG. I hate this razor with a passion. The first shave is fairly smooth, I will give it that. But the 4 Blades are for some CRAZY reason Tied Together with a WIRE wrapped around them every 1/6 of an inch. These wires come loose and break after about the third use of one blade. Then the wire starts RIPPING YOUR FACE APART every stroke. Then you have to rip the wire out with pliers, and then, ANOTHER one breaks the next time you shave. Horrible product. With an 8 pack of Blades costing $16 (!!??!!), I can go broke in a month trying to shave with this thing.</li>
            <li> I was a longtime Mach 3 user before getting this razor.  I had brand loyalty to Gillette, and when this thing came out, like a lot of people, I made jokes about it and how 4 blades was getting a bit absurd.&lt;br /&gt;I got this razor for a Christmas present and groaned when seeing it.  But I figured I&#x27;d use it a few times since razor blades are so expensive.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I got a closer and smoother shave with this razor compared with my Mach, and it didn&#x27;t irritate me as much.  I also noticed that hair did&#x27;t get stuck in between the blades like it did with my Mach 3.  I can feel the blades cutting across my face and it has a bit more drag than my Mach 3, which is a good thing because I know it&#x27;s working and I&#x27;m not tempted togo back a second time on an area.  The blades also seem to last twice as long as the Mach 3 blades.  I have to remind myself to throw out blades every couple of weeks, and the little lather strips (or whatever they are) on the top and bottom have never shown any wear.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very impressed with this razor, and don&#x27;t plan on going back to my Mach 3.  My only problem with it is that the handle doesn&#x27;t feel as ergonomical as my Mach 3 handle did.  I should also mention that I have a fairly light growth (can&#x27;t even grow a full beard) and I never go more than a few days without shaving, so I am unable to comment on how well it works with heavier patterns of hair.</li>
            <li> WORST I MEAN WORST Razor i ever used in my life. Always a big fan of the Mach 3 but then Schick Quattro came out. Wow 4 blades! Going to give me a better shave... One use... 3 cuts, feeling my bread are being pluck out rather than shaving it! You know what? I rather pluck my beard off and not getting any cuts!  Warbull(a reviewer) is right i wouldnt even use it to shave my dog!</li>
            <li> I like using a Quattro more than a Mach 3 because it leaves me with less ingrown hairs than a Mach 3.  The unit has a nice grip, but the handle is a little light for a razor with a large head.  If used cautiously, one can achieve a close shave with minimal irritation.  However, the blades are even more expensive than a Mach 3 (even the Turbo).</li>
            <li> Now I am not biased against these &#x27;hi-tech&#x27; shavers. I used a Gillette Fusion for a while and the shave you get is effortless, close, and smooth. However the blades dont last that long and they&#x27;re incredibly expensive. The shave is so easy that if you go back to disposeables, you will cut your face for a while.   So after the Fusion I went back to Bic Sensitive disposeables. Took about 2 shaves and my face got used to the disposeables again. They give a great shave, you have to go slow and do some re-shaving on the neck if you leave your beard a few days. But overall it gives very satisfactory results for the price.    Now I got a Schick Quattro in the mail. Looks fairly hi-tech, however you notice things like the design of the handle isnt as well executed as Gillette shavers. The Quattro&#x27;s handle manages to be bulky, has slick chrome, and has a short handle, not exactly a good omen.   The shave itself was shockingly bad, was ok on the main part of my face, however its extremely &#x27;grabby&#x27; which isnt a pleasant experience considering you have four razor blades on your skin. On the neck it was downright inept. I went over and over and over the same spots. I was positive it had to have given a decent shave there. Then I towel my face and I still have stubble. Unreal. I only have a 2 day beard and I washed the thing out on nearly every pass.   It gives by a large margin an inferior shave to my el cheapo Bic Sensitive. It simply isnt in the same stratosphere as the Gillette Fusion.   The Fusion is the best shave out there bar none. But paying $20+ a month just to shave is too expensive.   Bic disposeables get about 4 shaves on each razor. Come in packs of 12 for a few bucks. I need to get them in bulk at Costco they&#x27;d probably be even cheaper.</li>
            <li> I used to use Mach 3&#x27;s when they first came out and they were revolutionary at the time. Schick had a 3-blade model as well shortly after and I did not like it compared to the Mach 3. When Schick came out with the Quattro I was skeptical but ended up giving it a shot because the Mach 3 blades were still expensive. I have been very happy with the Quattro and haven&#x27;t looked back since. The blades are cheaper and I cannot tell the different between shaving with a Quattro or a Mach 3. If you compare the Quattro to the Fusion then I would give a slightly better shave to the Fusion. But is it worth the extra price? Not a chance. I&#x27;ll continue to use the Quattro for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li> I have a lifelong hobby of seeking the perfect shave.  I have found it with the Schick Quattro razor with the titanium blade with Edge Gel.  The shave is extremely close and incredibly comfortable.  In addition, the blade lasts a very long time. A GREAT SHAVE!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought one of these razor last month and everytime I shave my head i cut my self or the razor diggs in pulling up skin and cutting the skin as it does so. This is a really bad razor. I am switching back to Gillette Mach 3</li>
            <li> I bought the Schick quattro because I had read good reviews about it.&lt;br /&gt;It felt  smooth while I used it, but it left a stubble no matter how many times I shaved over. I had bought a package of four refill cartridges, and tried two, hoping the first cartridge was a dud.  I now have two unused cartridges, I&#x27;ll use for days when I&#x27;m not going out.  I got a Gillette with 3 blades, and my face is smooth again.</li>
