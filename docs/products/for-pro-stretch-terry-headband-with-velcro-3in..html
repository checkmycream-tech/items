            <li>I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>The band terry material part are nice.</li>
            <li>Excellent for washing face and to protect hair near scalp in shower.</li>

            <li>I love this Headband.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>and I love the product it is perfect for holding back my hair while I cleanse and moisturize my face.  </li>
            <li>width is perfect for protecting hair while washing your face or a home facial.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s more comfortable around my ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Soft, stretchy, great quality.</li>
            <li>I love this item, perfectly fit and received them 3 days, thank you.</li>
            <li>Strong velcro-Durable.</li>
            <li>Fabulous crate and ship.</li>
            <li>I was free to splash any amount of water on my face without the worries of ruining my blow-drying hair.</li>
            <li>those tend to not be as comfortable and get hair tangled up in them.</li>
            <li>Wish they made fun colors for use during workouts!</li>
            <li>Very comfortable and soft and easy to use with the velcro style.</li>
            <li>but really, this headband is huge!</li>
            <li>Not such a good thing for me.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s totally worth the money.  </li>
            <li>also, it is great to use under tight shower caps to avoid the dreaded elastic head imprint!</li>
            <li>This is just band  not a thick and looking cheap headband without velcro.</li>
            <li>Nice and wide on head, but needs a longer Velcro band to fit a little more securely.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li>The product is much nicer than the picture looks!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described</li>
            <li>Love it use it daily.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>this stretches plenty for any size head and is super soft!</li>
            <li>This headband is so much nicer than the one I bought at the drug store.  </li>
            <li>this is just a cheap white stretch terrycloth headband.  </li>
            <li>doesnt stay attached very well.</li>
            <li>Keeps hair dry and clean when washing face or doing makeup.</li>
            <li>It has a nice wide width, stretches and so far is lasting.</li>
            <li>Wide band, soft terry cloth and Velcro for a custom fit.</li>
            <li>Hopefully, the seller will exchange all the stretchy sweatbands for the spa headband described in the listing because it&#x27;s so much nicer than ones I&#x27;ve seen in local stores</li>
            <li>I was happily surprised at the quality of this item.</li>
            <li>It holds my hair very well with the help of the adjustable thing on the back.</li>
            <li>i am actually PLEASANTLY surprised that this doesn&#x27;t have a velcro closure.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what expected, adjustable tightness with velcro.</li>
            <li>Not bad but not fantastic either.</li>
            <li>Soft, durable, and adjustable (it does have Velcro in the back).</li>

            <li> Not professional use not as described looks like you could find it a 99cent store and throw it away the next day</li>
            <li> I have purchased just regular stretch, and it&#x27;s either too tight on my head or not wide enough.</li>
            <li> I bought this one but it tends to slide back off my head if my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> the band has slipped back and my hair next to my ears is exposed and wet.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s wide enough to cover my hair for when I wash my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost twice as wide and stretchy</li>
            <li> Not as functional as expected.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money especially when you get less than expected!!!</li>
            <li> What do you mean velcro?</li>
            <li> They keep the hair out of the way without messing it up too badly!</li>
            <li> And because of that, I was very disappointed with this purchase.</li>

            <li> I love it !!!! A +++++&lt;br /&gt;Super RECOMMEND !</li>
            <li> I bought these and I love using these on my clients when I give them facials. They are great for the price and I plan on buying more.</li>
            <li> These are awesome!  Love them for facials, massages and make up applications.  They keep the hair out of the way without messing it up too badly!</li>
            <li> I bought this one but it tends to slide back off my head if my hair is dry. I think it&#x27;s good at the spa, or after washing my hair to keep it from my face. But otherwise I am constantly having to pull it forward and in place. Not such a good thing for me.  Virginia</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking all over for something that&#x27;s adjustable for when I wash my face and do my makeup. I have purchased just regular stretch, and it&#x27;s either too tight on my head or not wide enough. This was perfect, love the material and adjustable velcro...and it&#x27;s wide enough to cover my hair for when I wash my face.</li>
            <li> This headband is so much nicer than the one I bought at the drug store.  It&#x27;s almost twice as wide and stretchy so it&#x27;s more comfortable around my ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There does seem to be some question about whether or not the band is attached with Velcro.  Mine has Velcro as the description specifies.  From some of the comments is seems that some folks received sweatbands, like you wear while working out, instead of the spa wrap headband.  Hopefully, the seller will exchange all the stretchy sweatbands for the spa headband described in the listing because it&#x27;s so much nicer than ones I&#x27;ve seen in local stores and it&#x27;s totally worth the money.  I bring it with me when I get a facial because the extra width ensures I won&#x27;t get lotion all over my hair.</li>
            <li> Soft, stretchy, great quality.</li>
            <li> I love this item, perfectly fit and received them 3 days, thank you.</li>
            <li> Excellent for washing face and to protect hair near scalp in shower. Stays put and does not slip off. Strong velcro-Durable.</li>
            <li> I was happily surprised at the quality of this item. I will be purchasing more in the future. The product is much nicer than the picture looks!</li>
            <li> This headband is really big. I bought it for my girlfriend and she didn&#x27;t like it, so we gave it to her brother who ended up liking it...</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and soft and easy to use with the velcro style. I use it all the time when washing my face or just to keep my hair back without a restrictive headband.</li>
            <li> A+++++. Fabulous crate and ship. Exactly as described</li>
            <li> this is just a cheap white stretch terrycloth headband.  could be purchased at the local drug store or dollar store.  No velcro anywhere on it!</li>
            <li> The item has no Velcro and looks like a simple sports headband athletes wear. Do not be mislead. Not worth the money especially when you get less than expected!!!</li>
            <li> The band terry material part are nice. But the velcro closure pulls out my hair when it catches onto it.</li>
            <li> I love this Headband. It holds my hair very well with the help of the adjustable thing on the back. I was free to splash any amount of water on my face without the worries of ruining my blow-drying hair.</li>
            <li> Good quality product with a good price. Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Not bad but not fantastic either. Doesn&#x27;t keep hair back as well as I&#x27;d like it to. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to someone over another product.</li>
            <li> doesnt stay attached very well. Not as functional as expected. Can get terry cloth elastic head band from walmart for same price.</li>
            <li> Love it use it daily.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! Soft, durable, and adjustable (it does have Velcro in the back). It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to. I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> The width and quality are great, love it! Machine washable! Perfect for keeping the hair out of your face while washing!</li>
            <li> Yes, my head is on the smaller side but really, this headband is huge! I will add Velcro instead of going thru the hassle sending it back.</li>
            <li> I use this band to keep my hair off of my face when I do my washing routine for my face. It has a nice wide width, stretches and so far is lasting.</li>
            <li> I ordered product on the 9/10 and received today9/13.  and I love the product it is perfect for holding back my hair while I cleanse and moisturize my face.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Wide band, soft terry cloth and Velcro for a custom fit. Wish they made fun colors for use during workouts! Keeps hair dry and clean when washing face or doing makeup. A must!</li>
            <li> Nice and wide on head, but needs a longer Velcro band to fit a little more securely. Also stretches out a bit.</li>
            <li> i am actually PLEASANTLY surprised that this doesn&#x27;t have a velcro closure. those tend to not be as comfortable and get hair tangled up in them. this stretches plenty for any size head and is super soft! width is perfect for protecting hair while washing your face or a home facial. would definitely recommend! also, it is great to use under tight shower caps to avoid the dreaded elastic head imprint!</li>
            <li> Not professional use not as described looks like you could find it a 99cent store and throw it away the next day</li>
            <li> It is just a stretch terry headband, like a sweat band. There is no velcro on this product. And because of that, I was very disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what expected, adjustable tightness with velcro.</li>
            <li> What do you mean velcro? This is just band  not a thick and looking cheap headband without velcro. I don&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> I like for the band to sit just above my hairline and cover my ears but by the time I am finished washing my face the band has slipped back and my hair next to my ears is exposed and wet.</li>
