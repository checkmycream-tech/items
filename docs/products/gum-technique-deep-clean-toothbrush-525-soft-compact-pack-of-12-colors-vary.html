            <li>For me, this is an excellent toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Best toothbrushes out there.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t locate them at a store, so was very happy to find them online.</li>
            <li>These are the best toothbrushes.</li>

            <li>I have used this model now and I am truly happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Very glad I found them on Amazon</li>
            <li>The right firmness and the feathered ends do a great job of cleaning.</li>
            <li>at that, I&#x27;m guessing it will be because this brush makes me want to brush more often.  </li>
            <li>We love these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Glad to have bought many of them.</li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush, it&#x27;s feels like it flosses your teeth while you brush.</li>
            <li>I love these toothbrushes .</li>
            <li>Great soft bristles!!</li>
            <li>This is the most comfortable, makes-your-gums-feel-good</li>
            <li>I received this product before expected which is really good, and the product I love it, because is pretty soft and does not make you bleed, it helps you to improve the health of your gums and I am really happy with this product.</li>
            <li>The bristles have very fine filament at the very ends of the bristle that get between teeth and below the gum-line.  </li>
            <li>If you like really soft toothbrushes, you&#x27;ll love these!</li>
            <li>Nice soft toothbrush like the sample I received from my dentist.</li>
            <li>The action of the fine bristles makes the toothpaste become sort of foamy, more so than I&#x27;m used to.  </li>
            <li>I really love these tooth brushes and was only able to get them when I went in for my semi annual cleaning</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m waiting to see how my next cleaning goes to see if it&#x27;s as effective as my electric was ...</li>
            <li>They clean very well without harming the gums, which is essential for a healthy mouth.</li>
            <li>I definitely brush more with this one.</li>
            <li>I feel like it cleans and massages gums better than regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My first experience with the toothbrush was from a sample my new Dentist gave me.  </li>
            <li>Feels better than any other brush I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li>I like how gentle it is on gums while cleaning more completely than any other toothbrush</li>
            <li>Very soft and seems to clean well enough.</li>
            <li>soft and do the job very well</li>
            <li>This one is truly soft and gentle.</li>
            <li>I used to use various small-tipped brushes to reach behind my back most teeth, but no need for those any more.</li>
            <li>It has some feathery purple tips that reach slightly under the gum to clean thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>My dentist gives me one at each visit, and no other brush I have used comes close in cleaning effect.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft (not sure if you can get them more firm if that&#x27;s what you like).  </li>
            <li>It was immediately apparent that I would be giving up my electric toothbrush and go back to &amp;#34;manual&amp;#34;.  </li>

            <li> Best toothbrushes out there.  I always got them from my dentist when I went for a cleaning, but never could find them in stores.  Very glad I found them on Amazon</li>
            <li> The assistant to my periodontist gave me one initially.  It has some feathery purple tips that reach slightly under the gum to clean thoroughly.  Now it&#x27;s the only toothbrush I use.  I used to use various small-tipped brushes to reach behind my back most teeth, but no need for those any more. This brush cleans those hard to reach areas as well.  I like how gentle it is on gums while cleaning more completely than any other toothbrush I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had some trouble with gums receding due to harshness of brushing.

            <li> These are the best toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Sandly, they did not arrive on time, so I could not get them while traveling. However, I ordered these ones as my dentist recommended them before. I have used this model now and I am truly happy with the results. They clean very well without harming the gums, which is essential for a healthy mouth.</li>
            <li> If you like really soft toothbrushes, you&#x27;ll love these! They brush well without hurting the gums.</li>
