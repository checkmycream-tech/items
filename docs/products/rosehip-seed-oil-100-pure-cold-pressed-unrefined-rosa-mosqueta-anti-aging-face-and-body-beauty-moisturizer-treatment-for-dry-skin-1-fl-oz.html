            <li>so it&#x27;s a good surprise.&lt;br /&gt;- Cheap price :)&lt;</li>
            <li>This oil is very light - one of the lightest I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>The smell is very light, smells like olive oil, but not offensive.  </li>
            <li>I have been unscrewing the top to get the amount I want out of it.  </li>
            <li>Seems to work ok but has a fishy smell to it.  </li>
            <li>I love the BEAUTYOILS.CO Rosehip Oil &amp; its packaging is supper cute too.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT...</li>
            <li>At night I put Rosehip Oil on my face and neck, about 30 minutes before I go to bed, then I put shea butter on top of that.  </li>
            <li>I had heard many great things from my girlfriends about rosehip seed oil that I finally had to try it for myself - I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>My fine lines have pretty well vanished, which makes me love the Rosehip Oil all the more!  </li>
            <li>My face feels smooth and hydrated after using this.</li>
            <li>and my skin looks fantastic.</li>
            <li>Overall Rosehip oil is great for all over skin use.</li>
            <li>It does absorb nicely but I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference with regards to my skin appearance..</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about this AWESOME oil, but I&#x27;m very please with it</li>
            <li>Very clean and easy to control how much you need to use.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>This oil is absorbed quickly and leaves your skin so smooth.  </li>
            <li>The unscented oil absorbs quickly into the skin</li>
            <li>I also mix a little in with my body lotion to make it more effective.  </li>
            <li>Since it is absorbed, it doesn&#x27;t make your skin oily.</li>
            <li>If I would be more diligent about it, the problem would clear up even faster.</li>
            <li>I soaks right in.  </li>
            <li>The product works for me and the price is right.</li>
            <li>I mix it with rose absolute essential oil and coconut oil</li>
            <li>Overall, though I love the oil and will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li>It has a funny smell but it goes away in a couple minutes.</li>
            <li>This product is surprisingly super high quality.</li>
            <li>I am going without foundation most days, my skin is that even and pore size is very visibly smaller.</li>
            <li>I look better without makeup, my pores are smaller, and my normally blotchy skintone is a glowing even color.</li>
            <li>but I have developed a lipstick allergy and it works quickly to heal my lips and stop the rash</li>
            <li>I ordered this product because it had nothing else added and was pure oil.  </li>
            <li>It is the ONLY oil (besides emu oil) that doesn&#x27;t break me out like crazy, but instead leaves my skin all glowy and nice pretty when I wake up in the morning :) If you have any questions about it just comment and I can give more info.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing and soothing .</li>
            <li>With this type of cap, you with either get too much or nothing comes out.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs fast into the skin and does not leave an oily residue.</li>
            <li>I WILL BUY AGAIN WHEN I&#x27;M READY.  </li>
            <li>FAST AND RELIABLE SHIPPING.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the smell..</li>
            <li>almond oil seems to work just as well and is much cheaper...</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It does smell a &amp;#34;little&amp;#34; fishy, but I mix a drop with my moisturizer and don&#x27;t really smell anything after mixing.  </li>
            <li>It does not leave your skin feeling greasy and soaks in fast.  </li>
            <li>but certainly my face is well hydrated and looks fine through this rough winter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to any fish-type smell so this could just be my interpretation of it..</li>
            <li>Not terrible, just odd.  </li>
            <li>I love this oil--It smells a little fishy, but I do not mind.  </li>
            <li>although I do love the little pump bottle!</li>
            <li>Obviously when you first put in on it is oily but as you massage it in your skin you can see how your skin just soaks it in.</li>
            <li>It made those huge holes caused by acne scars become less noticeable.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin nor leave any red spots what it does is smooth out all my dry spot area in my face.</li>
            <li>WOW THIS STUFF WORKS.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>This is a very luxurious oil and my skin cannot get enough of it----I</li>
            <li>This brand is cold pressed (good quality) and a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It is very light, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if everyone will have the same results, but it sure worked for me.</li>
            <li>and I have noticed how smooth the skin is becoming  with even small lines hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li>I use it every night, and my skin has been beautiful throughout this long cold snap we have had in the Northeast.</li>
            <li>I am 35 with very dry skin and pretty deep crows feet.</li>
            <li>With so many natural products to choose from, it&#x27;s difficult to decide which ones to get.</li>
            <li>The clear cap is too loose.</li>
            <li>in all, the good outweighs the bad.</li>

            <li> Rosehip Seed Oil has worked really well at keeping my maturing skin soft and keeping those annoying lines away - I use it primarily on my face.</li>
            <li> It lasts quite a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I noticed that other reviews had this same comment.  </li>
            <li> I was also hoping it would help with flaky, dry patches.</li>
            <li> but this did in addition to healing both the acne scars and dry patches.</li>
            <li> bought this for dry face.  </li>
            <li> My rough dry spots gets softer each day i apply the rosehip oil</li>
            <li> This is like any oil, and it does not have preservatives or other properties to keep a long shelf life, thus storing it refrigerated helps.  </li>
            <li> Wish I could return the other skincare products I bought.</li>
            <li> I have eczema that is bothering me on my hands probably due to dish soap and/or hand soap.</li>
            <li> To help combat general winter dryness and pregnancy-related dryness, I’ve been mixing a few drops in with my usual moisturizer after showering at night.</li>
            <li> I actually gave up long time ago thinking that I would have to live with those ugly holes.</li>
            <li> almost seems slightly &amp;#34;fishy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> A FEW MINUTES,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently obsessed with using natural beauty products.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I should just use it sparingly and incorporate a little into my moisturizer and try again or not.</li>
            <li> You have to shake the bottle for it to come out of the small hole in the cap.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is small and hard plastic.</li>
            <li> Plus since I usually deal with acne &amp; eczema, Rosehip oil helps with those skin conditions too!</li>
            <li> It is very hard to get it to dispense.  </li>
            <li> It happened a few time and the pump now is broken :(</li>
            <li> Forget about expensive creams and lotions.  </li>
            <li> either way..it&#x27;s weird.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great multi-purpose oil. It is very moisturizing and soothing . I use it for my hair, skin and nails. My face feels smooth and hydrated after using this. I soaks right in.  It is great as a cuticle oil before going to bed.  I also mix a little in with my body lotion to make it more effective.  The only problem that I have with this item is the bottle.  It is very hard to get it to dispense.  The bottle is small and hard plastic. It is not squeezable. You have to shake the bottle for it to come out of the small hole in the cap.  With this type of cap, you with either get too much or nothing comes out.  I have been unscrewing the top to get the amount I want out of it.  It needs to have a pump dispenser.  Overall, though I love the oil and will continue to use it.  I received a complimentary product in exchange for a fair and honest review.</li>
            <li> I had just bought $200 of (won&#x27;t mention name) skin care and then I came across an article of the miracle rosehip oil. Bought this and have applied it two nights in a row and my skin looks fantastic. I look better without makeup, my pores are smaller, and my normally blotchy skintone is a glowing even color. I&#x27;m hooked. This brand is cold pressed (good quality) and a reasonable price. Wish I could return the other skincare products I bought.</li>
            <li> To help combat general winter dryness and pregnancy-related dryness, I’ve been mixing a few drops in with my usual moisturizer after showering at night. I’ve noticed that my skin feels softer and seems to ‘glow’ more on the days I use the rosehip seed oil and am very glad that BeautyOils.Co provided me with this product to review. I’m a big fan of one-ingredient beauty products and will be continuing to use BEAUTYOILS.CO Rosehip Seed Oil for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li> Forget about expensive creams and lotions.  This oil is absorbed quickly and leaves your skin so smooth.  I use it on my face especially under the eyes and I have noticed how smooth the skin is becoming  with even small lines hardly noticeable. Since it is absorbed, it doesn&#x27;t make your skin oily. Obviously when you first put in on it is oily but as you massage it in your skin you can see how your skin just soaks it in. I have eczema that is bothering me on my hands probably due to dish soap and/or hand soap. I put the oil on whenever I remember and it has helped quite a bit with the eczema.  If I would be more diligent about it, the problem would clear up even faster.</li>
            <li> I used this on my hair, and it helped make it look shinier and healthier. I did not use on my skin. It moisturized my scalp and help with the dryness and flakiness.</li>
            <li> Oil arrived in a timely manner.  Seems to work ok but has a fishy smell to it.  I noticed that other reviews had this same comment.  I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the quality of this Rosehip oil. It absorbs fast into the skin and does not leave an oily residue. After application my skin feels like velvet. I am also very satisfied with there customer service. Great company. I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> It smells funky!! but I have developed a lipstick allergy and it works quickly to heal my lips and stop the rash so it gets 4 stars for that. I also use it on my face in the nighttime</li>
            <li> I have used this oil for a week at night in place of moisturizer - and I started getting bumpy skin again....Not sure if I should just use it sparingly and incorporate a little into my moisturizer and try again or not.</li>
            <li> This is a very good quality oil.  It has a fruity aroma.  I will buy again.  A great price too.</li>
            <li> I love the BEAUTYOILS.CO Rosehip Oil &amp; its packaging is supper cute too. Overall Rosehip oil is great for all over skin use. I&#x27;ve been using this instead of lotion &amp; my skin feels so good it glows. Plus since I usually deal with acne &amp; eczema, Rosehip oil helps with those skin conditions too!</li>
            <li> I have eczema on my eye lids and do not like using a cortisone cream because it can cause thinning of the eye lids and wrinkling.  I had heard that Rose Hips Oil would help, so I decided to give it a try.  I ordered this product because it had nothing else added and was pure oil.  I applied it to my eye lids one time and by the next day it was gone.  I&#x27;m not sure if everyone will have the same results, but it sure worked for me.</li>
            <li> I WILL BUY AGAIN WHEN I&#x27;M READY.  FAST AND RELIABLE SHIPPING.  PRODUCT AS DESCRIBED.  GOOD FOR THE SKIN.  MIX IT WITH 100% SHEA BUTTER AND YOU HAVE YOURSELF AN EXCELLENT FACE LOTION.  ABSORBS IN THE SKIN AFTER 15 MINUTES, SO YOU NEED A FEW MINUTES, BUT IT WILL ABSORB.  LOVE IT...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently obsessed with using natural beauty products. With so many natural products to choose from, it&#x27;s difficult to decide which ones to get. I had heard many great things from my girlfriends about rosehip seed oil that I finally had to try it for myself - I&#x27;m glad I did. This oil is very light - one of the lightest I&#x27;ve ever tried. The unscented oil absorbs quickly into the skin so I don&#x27;t have to worry about it being greasy or shiny. Beautyoils.co Rosehip Seed Oil has worked really well at keeping my maturing skin soft and keeping those annoying lines away - I use it primarily on my face. The product works for me and the price is right.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the smell.. almost seems slightly &amp;#34;fishy&amp;#34; to me? I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to any fish-type smell so this could just be my interpretation of it..either way..it&#x27;s weird. Not terrible, just odd.  I been using it on my face for a month or so now in select areas. It does absorb nicely but I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference with regards to my skin appearance..it hasn&#x27;t caused any acne so that&#x27;s good..Overall, I don&#x27;t see any reason to continue to include this once I&#x27;m done with the bottle...almond oil seems to work just as well and is much cheaper...although I do love the little pump bottle!</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel! I use it twice a day and it does not leave an oily feeling at all.</li>
            <li> I love this oil--It smells a little fishy, but I do not mind.  I mix it with rose absolute essential oil and coconut oil and it&#x27;s all good. Works great.</li>
            <li> Since i have eczema this rosehip oil works great it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin nor leave any red spots what it does is smooth out all my dry spot area in my face. My rough dry spots gets softer each day i apply the rosehip oil</li>
            <li> I received one bottle of Rosehip Oil to review!  I absolutely love Rosehip Oil, it makes my skin look the best it has ever looked!  At night I put Rosehip Oil on my face and neck, about 30 minutes before I go to bed, then I put shea butter on top of that.  The results are quite amazing.  My fine lines have pretty well vanished, which makes me love the Rosehip Oil all the more!  I can&#x27;t say enough about this AWESOME oil, but I&#x27;m very please with it and I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love this oil! It is very light, and a little goes a long way. I use it every night, and my skin has been beautiful throughout this long cold snap we have had in the Northeast. I am very impressed with this products ability to hydrate and nourish my skin.</li>
            <li> This product is surprisingly super high quality. For the price, I would recommend it to anyone. It is the ONLY oil (besides emu oil) that doesn&#x27;t break me out like crazy, but instead leaves my skin all glowy and nice pretty when I wake up in the morning :) If you have any questions about it just comment and I can give more info.</li>
            <li> I used a pump of this oil 2 times a day for three weeks, then discontinued for one week...... the results were INCREDIBLE! I am 35 with very dry skin and pretty deep crows feet. I tried this oil because I recently started breaking out like I never had before and I was getting some scarring. I was also hoping it would help with flaky, dry patches. WOW THIS STUFF WORKS. It has a funny smell but it goes away in a couple minutes. I am going without foundation most days, my skin is that even and pore size is very visibly smaller. I did not think there was anything that would even out my rosy cheeks and red nose but this did in addition to healing both the acne scars and dry patches. I am now adding rose hip oil to my lotion to heal scars and razor burn on my legs, after just over a week I can see it working. I will never be without this stuff agian.</li>
            <li> This is like any oil, and it does not have preservatives or other properties to keep a long shelf life, thus storing it refrigerated helps.  It does smell a &amp;#34;little&amp;#34; fishy, but I mix a drop with my moisturizer and don&#x27;t really smell anything after mixing.  I don&#x27;t know if I see a change in my complexion but certainly my face is well hydrated and looks fine through this rough winter.</li>
            <li> bought this for dry face.  It does not leave your skin feeling greasy and soaks in fast.  The smell is very light, smells like olive oil, but not offensive.  It leaves your skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Pump bottle. Very clean and easy to control how much you need to use.&lt;br /&gt;- Fading scars.&lt;br /&gt;- It made those huge holes caused by acne scars become less noticeable. Almost disappear. I actually gave up long time ago thinking that I would have to live with those ugly holes. Didn&#x27;t expect this at all so it&#x27;s a good surprise.&lt;br /&gt;- Cheap price :)&lt;br /&gt;- Since I need only two pumps each days, one for my face and another one for scars on my leg. It lasts quite a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The clear cap is too loose. (Not shown in the picture.) I forget about that sometimes and holding it up by the cap, so the bottle fell on the floor. It happened a few time and the pump now is broken :( Maybe it&#x27;s just my bottle. I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip:&lt;br /&gt;- You can use it on your face twice a day, but for those of you who have over-sensitive skin like me, I&#x27;d say once a day is enough. Otherwise it could make you breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the good outweighs the bad. I will definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> This is a very luxurious oil and my skin cannot get enough of it----I definitely  will purchase this product again!!!</li>
