            <li>I love these wipes they serve the purpose!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t love these at all!</li>
            <li>You get a lot which is nice but</li>
            <li>more the one time , good quality</li>
            <li>the wipes are soft and the size is perfect for infant</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed at a great price.</li>
            <li>I know that most use these to save on product.  </li>
            <li>These are perfect for removing product on my clients during a facial.</li>
            <li>These cotton squares are just perfect for cleansing my clients skin during the facial.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a licensed esthetician and enjoy using 4X4 esthetic wipes instead of cotton rounds and pads when cleansing and applying product.  </li>
            <li>When I first purchased these I wasn&#x27;t sure what I&#x27;d be getting, but they are disposable cotton, woven</li>
            <li>: I originally purchased these through amazon for about $6.50 per pack of 200.</li>
            <li>I use the wipes and water to clean her face and butt...</li>
            <li>These aesthetic wipes works great in my spa -- they don&#x27;t bunch up when wet and remove makeup and product without residue.</li>
            <li>They are much softer than facial cloths and great at removing make-up.</li>

            <li>They aren&#x27;t meant for scrubbing like muslin cloth, but they do a really nice job removing facial products.</li>
            <li>..thank you very much</li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>The wipes allows more product to be absorbed by the skin instead of being absorbed into the the cotton round or pad.</li>
            <li>My daughter use these for her facial customers and is very please and wants to buy more</li>
            <li>They stand up to removing masks and skin treatments really well in my treatment room.</li>
            <li>And you get 200 per pack for a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>not as thick as others, but are good for saving money.  </li>
            <li>Special product for facial or home use durable too</li>
            <li>Hold up strongly when wet.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend</li>
            <li>These are nice a little on the thin side but still nice..</li>
            <li>However, the cotton pads that so many of us like to use are just to harsh for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve accidentally purchased other brands and they ended up being a bit scratchy and cheap.</li>
            <li>They are very  soft and durable.</li>
            <li>They are so soft and hold the cleansing solution really well without being too saturated (essential oils, witch hazel and a bit of cetaphil, all combined with water).</li>
            <li>Soft</li>
            <li>You can unfold them and use various sides making one last a whole lot longer than a cotton pad.</li>
            <li>I wish they were a little thicker but not bad overall.</li>
            <li>Exactly as expected and fast delivery.</li>

            <li> I usually use 2 on my face with my cleanser.  </li>

            <li> The wipes are dirty and how could I use them?!!Disgusting!!!</li>

            <li> These are great both for cleansing and for applying toners.  Even folded twice to make a square one-fourth its original size, the wipes still waste less product through absorption than a regular drugstore cotton round.  When used for cleansing, one wipe does the job for face and neck.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> We use these (with purified water) as baby wipes for our newborn daughter. They&#x27;re very soft, thin enough to get into tight spaces, and thick enough that I don&#x27;t get fingers full of poo during diaper changes.</li>
            <li> Amazing quality! Enjoying using these for facials! When I first purchased these I wasn&#x27;t sure what I&#x27;d be getting, but they are disposable cotton, woven so they are durable, folded into four. Hold up strongly when wet. They aren&#x27;t meant for scrubbing like muslin cloth, but they do a really nice job removing facial products. They stand up to removing masks and skin treatments really well in my treatment room. You can unfold them and use various sides making one last a whole lot longer than a cotton pad. I will definitely be buying these again when I run out! A good quantity came in the package too which means I&#x27;ll have them for awhile.</li>
            <li> These are nice a little on the thin side but still nice..I usually use 2 on my face with my cleanser.  You get a lot which is nice but seeing that you may have to use two at a time can be a little annoying..</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed at a great price.</li>
            <li> not as thick as others, but are good for saving money.  I may or may not get them again depending.</li>
            <li> I know that most use these to save on product.  However, the cotton pads that so many of us like to use are just to harsh for my skin.  These have been SO good for my skin.  I have noticed a difference in the texture of my skin since using these.</li>
            <li> My daughter use these for her facial customers and is very please and wants to buy more..thank you very much</li>
            <li> I have to admit I&#x27;m still a fan of Shisaedo&#x27;s nothing beats their softness, but these 4 X 4 wipes work well with my Bioderma makeup remover. Will order more!</li>
            <li> Special product for facial or home use durable too I use this for personal use only&lt;br /&gt;and more the one time , good quality</li>
            <li> I bought the wipes for my newborn baby....I use the wipes and water to clean her face and butt...the wipes are soft and the size is perfect for infant</li>
            <li> These are absorbant and a great size for using for many applications.  I use mine for facial applications. Great for using during permenant makeup procedures and removing makeup.</li>
            <li> I bought these because they were recommended by my aesthetician. They are much softer than facial cloths and great at removing make-up. Also, I use them in the morning and evening for applying Bulgarian Rose Water, which is a great toner!</li>
            <li> These are perfect for removing product on my clients during a facial.</li>
            <li> I use it for my baby diapers change. She is allergic to wipes so I use this and water and she has never had a rash.</li>
            <li> I bought these to make face cleansing/makeup remover cloths with and they are PERFECT! They are so soft and hold the cleansing solution really well without being too saturated (essential oils, witch hazel and a bit of cetaphil, all combined with water). I will definitely be buying these again!</li>

            <li> These cotton squares are just perfect for cleansing my clients skin during the facial. They are very  soft and durable.</li>
            <li> Great peoduct ... Soft and it holds up when soaked in water ... I highly recommend</li>
            <li> These work great for washing my face and removing makeup, and I just toss them in the trash after. I also used them to remove nail polish.</li>

            <li> work well for what i needed</li>
            <li> Great product, awesome price!!</li>
            <li> These are the best! I&#x27;ve accidentally purchased other brands and they ended up being a bit scratchy and cheap. These are not. And you get 200 per pack for a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I originally purchased these through amazon for about $6.50 per pack of 200. The price has gone up so I now buy them from an online spa supply store. I still love the esti wipes, but the price is too high on amazon.</li>
            <li> I wish they were a little thicker but not bad overall.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t love these at all! They fell apart and they leave a ton of lint</li>
