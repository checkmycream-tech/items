            <li>my friend wanted to know what I had done to my skin, and being the kind of person I am, I said....&amp;#34;nothing&amp;#34;!!!!</li>

            <li>Fantastic serum!  </li>

            <li>Compared to the Skinceutical&#x27;s brand, this Serum is more viscous</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>but when it&#x27;s gone I will order more for sure.</li>
            <li>( my Mom is 64 &amp; has many lines etc.</li>
            <li>A lot of serums have that slippery silicone feel and just sit on top of your skin.  </li>
            <li>Works well and glad</li>
            <li>I have tried several Hyaluronic acid products out there over the years and this has been the best I have ever used!!!</li>
            <li>All of my spa clients love it.</li>
            <li>This brand get very good reviews on other site, so I felt good purchasing it.</li>
            <li>This is a good product that really delivers.</li>
            <li>Nice product not greasy.soaks right into skin.</li>
            <li>Other brands may sell this acid, but I like this brand best.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin softer and smoother,  absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li>It lasts for about 12 hours, which is fine.  </li>
            <li>My makeup goes on smoothly</li>
            <li>Because of the lack of detailed info, I will give this 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone who wants to have and maintain youthful and beautiful skin and look young forever!</li>
            <li>so it’s really economical!  </li>
            <li>It goes on easily and dries very fast.</li>
            <li>serum has made a tremendous difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance.  </li>
            <li>the package, now that I received my order (and they did a great job of shipping quickly and packing very well), the actual ingredients are, in order:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I put this product on right after I clean my face with Origin&#x27;s Cleansing Oil.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it seems very good, but I&#x27;ve only had it for a week.  </li>
            <li>This serum is light, absorbs readily, and leaves the skin re-hydrated, plumped up and looking radiant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other Hyaluronic formulas and there are some good ones on Amazon, however this is # 1.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product - a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Smelled a bit weird but works great!</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;- 100% Pure Hyaluronic Acid</li>
            <li>I really like this serum.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is absorbed completely into the skin and won&#x27;t crumble off the way some do.  </li>
            <li>I did absolutely notice a difference within days.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended it and it really works.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the few xtra dollars for sure.</li>
            <li>I have only used it for the past 3 days, morning and night, it feels good on the face and it gets absorbed immediately.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t just sit on top of your skin waiting to ball up into little pieces like so many other serums.</li>
            <li>Tried this product with high hopes.  </li>
            <li>with everyday use its benefits get better.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s new to &amp;#34;Amazon&amp;#34; since it was not here when I bought mine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s new on here</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for few months and use it in conjunction with the “Serumtologie C Serum”, “Avalon Organics” - Vitamin C Renewal moisturizing skin cr&amp;egrave;me and also take some collagen/hyaluroinc acid - advanced formula supplements by “youtheory” that help work from within, this combination has really worked well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>From looking at other hyaluronic acid products, it was clear that this is not actually 100% pure hyaluronic acid as the description says (that would probably be way too acidic and too strong to use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the large bottle, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>serum makes you look young again and really puts the moisture back in your skin; I can’t imagine life without this product.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to be making any difference as far as I can see.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 65 year old woman living in the desert</li>
            <li>So far its 5 stars for price &amp; hydration</li>
            <li>Sorry, but I haven&#x27;t finish the bottle yet to give a better review.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty good……so far!</li>
            <li>Bought in early Sept. &amp; still have 1/2 bottle left.</li>
            <li>I applied some on my arm and it actually made my skin very supple and smooth (at least for a little while).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little thick, yet smooth &amp; disappears into your skin with NO sticky residue !  </li>

            <li> This bottle is big enough to last long</li>
            <li> After it is absorbed I spray on Alaffia&#x27;s coconut water toner or just plain water followed by Strivectin or other moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I have been using 100 Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum and Vitamin C Serum for the past two weeks.</li>
            <li> I was looking at other brands, since this one is a bit higher priced, but I don&#x27;t want to waste my money-</li>
            <li> My skin looks tight and clear.</li>
            <li> The label is not clear, and I could not see the other ingredient&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> However, due to the price, I decided to try this one out due to its value and reviews.  </li>
            <li> just wish, for comparison to other products, that this company would list the amount of hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li> And since the bottle is quite large I don’t feel guilty about using it in other areas besides the face and neck areas.  </li>
            <li> The Serum is thick only pea size is needed  for application on your neck and face.</li>
            <li> - It is mild, but when I apply it on my face, there is an unpleasant scent that lasts for about 10 mins.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I then add a little moisturizer (honesty</li>
            <li> I like to change up my skin care every few weeks</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> In addition to which, the additives in the product make my skin dry, not a good.</li>
            <li> I think it might work, but it is hard to tell this soon.  </li>
            <li> This is PURE hyaluronic acid with no added crap.</li>
            <li> Have not heard anything negative</li>
            <li> people complained of drying in the reviews of other hyaluronic acid serums, but those all had alcohols as a base, which of course are themselves drying.</li>
            <li> This product uses water as a base, so it should help that</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product contains Opthipen, a preservative that seems to have a drying effect on my skin. The label is not clear, and I could not see the other ingredient&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a month. I see no improvement. In addition to which, the additives in the product make my skin dry, not a good. thing.</li>
            <li> My second bottle. I love it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic serum!  Love the large bottle, a little goes a long way so it’s really economical!  I saw an improvement immediately and the results have been incredible.  And since the bottle is quite large I don’t feel guilty about using it in other areas besides the face and neck areas.  I’ve been using it also on my hands and see a big difference in the appearance there too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum has made a tremendous difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance.  I&#x27;ve been using it for few months and use it in conjunction with the “Serumtologie C Serum”, “Avalon Organics” - Vitamin C Renewal moisturizing skin cr&amp;egrave;me and also take some collagen/hyaluroinc acid - advanced formula supplements by “youtheory” that help work from within, this combination has really worked well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum makes you look young again and really puts the moisture back in your skin; I can’t imagine life without this product.  This serum is a keeper... forever!  I recommend this product to anyone who wants to have and maintain youthful and beautiful skin and look young forever!</li>
            <li> Nice product not greasy.soaks right into skin.</li>
            <li> It feels silky g agaioing on  agamy  face appears smoother after use.</li>
            <li> This is a good product that really delivers.I use it daily as a serum. Other brands may sell this acid, but I like this brand best. This is good for the skin&#x27;s collagen and it does improve the skin&#x27;s texture and &amp;#34;plumps&amp;#34; your skin a  bit.</li>
            <li> Tried this product with high hopes.  I didn&#x27;t see any change.  I did break out a bit from it so stopped using.</li>
            <li> Excellent product - a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I am currently using Skinceuticals B5 with Hyaluronic Acid.  Have been using this product for over 5 years and I love it.  However, due to the price, I decided to try this one out due to its value and reviews.  Compared to the Skinceutical&#x27;s brand, this Serum is more viscous but it&#x27;s not sticky. I applied some on my arm and it actually made my skin very supple and smooth (at least for a little while).  Overall, it seems very good, but I&#x27;ve only had it for a week.  It is priced well too.&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple of drawbacks for me.&lt;br /&gt;1. The smell - It is mild, but when I apply it on my face, there is an unpleasant scent that lasts for about 10 mins.&lt;br /&gt;2. I think it should have come with some sort of a dropper.</li>
            <li> The product came as promised, it&#x27;s my 3rd day of using this product and it&#x27;s still immature to say how it works but over all good service, i will update when i see the result.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be making any difference as far as I can see.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum.  It goes on easily and dries very fast. It leaves my skin very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other Hyaluronic formulas and there are some good ones on Amazon, however this is # 1.  It is thicker.  It is absorbed completely into the skin and won&#x27;t crumble off the way some do.  Best of all I&#x27;m seeing a huge difference in the appearance of my skin. I&#x27;m a 65 year old woman living in the desert so believe me when I say I need all the moisture I can get.  I put this product on right after I clean my face with Origin&#x27;s Cleansing Oil.  After it is absorbed I spray on Alaffia&#x27;s coconut water toner or just plain water followed by Strivectin or other moisturizer.  My skin is smoother now than it&#x27;s been in years.  I&#x27;m thinking about trying ASDM Collagen Cream.</li>

            <li> I still trying this product.  I think it might work, but it is hard to tell this soon.  This company is the only one that had 100% Hyaluronic  Acid Serum at the Dr. Oz recommended price tag.</li>
            <li> love this! my skin looks better already! my friend wanted to know what I had done to my skin, and being the kind of person I am, I said....&amp;#34;nothing&amp;#34;!!!!</li>
            <li> I have only used it for the past 3 days, morning and night, it feels good on the face and it gets absorbed immediately.  I like to change up my skin care every few weeks so my skin doesn&#x27;t get used to one thing.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because Dr. Oz recommended this.  I have been using it for a few weeks and I love it.  Each morning after I wash my face I put this on.  I then add a little moisturizer (honesty, my skin looks so beautiful with just the Hyaluronic Serum, I could go without it,  However I see a tighter smoother skin immediately.  My makeup goes on smoothly and I look years younger.&lt;br /&gt;This is now part of my makeup routine every day.  It would really be a perfect world if the hyaluronic acid was permanent.  However it is not.  It lasts for about 12 hours, which is fine.  When I wash my face at night, I put in on again, just because my  skin looks so beautiful.</li>
            <li> I have not tried this yet, but wanted to post to let people know what&#x27;s in this. I just got it today.  From looking at other hyaluronic acid products, it was clear that this is not actually 100% pure hyaluronic acid as the description says (that would probably be way too acidic and too strong to use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the package, now that I received my order (and they did a great job of shipping quickly and packing very well), the actual ingredients are, in order:&lt;br /&gt;- Distilled Water&lt;br /&gt;- 100% Pure Hyaluronic Acid&lt;br /&gt;- Opthipen  (Optiphen is a paraben and formaldehyde-free preservative.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people complained of drying in the reviews of other hyaluronic acid serums, but those all had alcohols as a base, which of course are themselves drying. This product uses water as a base, so it should help that issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish, for comparison to other products, that this company would list the amount of hyaluronic acid. Is it 1%? 2%? 0.5%?  Because of the lack of detailed info, I will give this 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. Keep it simple when it comes to skin care. This is PURE hyaluronic acid with no added crap. Works almost immediately! Love it.</li>
            <li> This serum helps you moisturize your face and it is not oily. Great product.</li>
            <li> I love this product line and the Hyaluronic Acid is great. Its feels great when you put in on your face!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin softer and smoother,  absorbs very quickly. This bottle is big enough to last long but when it&#x27;s gone I will order more for sure.</li>
            <li> I purchased for my wife who is in Greece. She heard on Greek TV that this product helps Arthritis. Have not heard anything negative so I give it a 5.</li>
            <li> I purchased this same bottle off another site ( Eb@!) &amp;  I LOVED IT, still do. I bought another bottle for my Mother as well. I guess it&#x27;s new to &amp;#34;Amazon&amp;#34; since it was not here when I bought mine. Bought in early Sept. &amp; still have 1/2 bottle left. I use it 1-2 times a day on face , neck &amp; chest. I did absolutely notice a difference within days. The 1st time I used it my skin appeared plumper, but I figured it was a temp fix, not so- with everyday use its benefits get better. It&#x27;s a little thick, yet smooth &amp; disappears into your skin with NO sticky residue !  I was looking at other brands, since this one is a bit higher priced, but I don&#x27;t want to waste my money- I know this works, so why switch? It&#x27;s worth the few xtra dollars for sure. This brand get very good reviews on other site, so I felt good purchasing it. It&#x27;s new on here &amp; I understand it takes time for ppl to notice or try a product. I hope this review helps someone - it works great for my Mother &amp; I ( my Mom is 64 &amp; has many lines etc. from smoking !) I loved this product &amp; will 100% buy again soon!!</li>
            <li> Fast Service, Great Product!</li>
            <li> It feels like a mini-facelift!</li>
            <li> I can see no difference in my skin after a month. Lines, wrinkles and skin texture still the same as before I started treatment.  I&#x27;m still using it, maybe I&#x27;ll see a difference at some point.</li>
            <li> Feels great,  most importantly though, it absorbs!  Doesn&#x27;t just sit on top of your skin waiting to ball up into little pieces like so many other serums. A lot of serums have that slippery silicone feel and just sit on top of your skin.  Not this one. Moisturizer goes over it very smoothly.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but I haven&#x27;t finish the bottle yet to give a better review.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty good……so far!</li>
            <li> Works well and glad I found it.  I will be happy to order with this company again.  Packed great and arrived in tip top shape.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Not performing the way I hoped.  My fault for not understand the properties of hydraulic acid.</li>
            <li> I have been using 100 Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum and Vitamin C Serum for the past two weeks.Everyone around me is noticing the change- Two of my colleagues have already ordered this product after seeing the results.The Serum is thick only pea size is needed  for application on your neck and face. I am so happy that I came accross this brand.</li>
            <li> Fourth type if HA serum I&#x27;ve tried.  So far its 5 stars for price &amp; hydration</li>
            <li> I have tried several Hyaluronic acid products out there over the years and this has been the best I have ever used!!!</li>
            <li> Love this! My dermatologist recommended it and it really works. My skin looks tight and clear. I will purchase this product when I need another supply.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any results as others may have said but I gave it a try!!!!  Another product to put away</li>
            <li> Smelled a bit weird but works great!</li>
            <li> I consider hylauronic acid to be the \\&quot;youth nectar\\&quot; for the skin. This serum is light, absorbs readily, and leaves the skin re-hydrated, plumped up and looking radiant. I use this in every facial I perform. It is suitable for every skin type. All of my spa clients love it. Everyone should have hylauronic acid serum in their skin care regimen. This product is a fabulous value and is great quality. I am happy it is USA made as well! I will definitely re-order this serum!</li>
