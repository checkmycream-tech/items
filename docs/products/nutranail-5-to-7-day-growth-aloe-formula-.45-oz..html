            <li>I bought this when my friend told me about it, and it is amazing.</li>
            <li>The purchase was sent very rapidly and arrived in excellent condition.</li>
            <li>I was determined to grow my own nails.</li>
            <li>My nails peel very easily and</li>
            <li>and then you can paint and do nail designs right over it!!!</li>
            <li>Nice to be able to order it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>My nails now have a nice healthy sheen to them.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>so I bought this stuff to keep them strong!</li>
            <li>The layered nail grew into a normal , strong nail and my nails look great!</li>
            <li>Very glad it&#x27;s still available online.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s almost too good to be true...</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I did notice that they seem more supple/flexible than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it several times a day to keep my nails looking this wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I think it works best with use multiple times a day, so be sure to follow the instructions.</li>
            <li>I am almost out and will buy more.</li>
            <li>This product worked for a short time but it wasn&#x27;t the greatest either</li>
            <li>I laid off the habit I decided to try this in hope I could grow better nails.</li>
            <li>you will be satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this.....</li>
            <li>When I read on Amazon the label on the packaging, it said that it help your nails grow faster and better.</li>
            <li>Glad i brought it :)</li>
            <li>I use this as a cuticle oil, it is not a polish but more of an oil.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I got this product because I needed my nail to get healthy again and grow out so it would attach again.</li>
            <li>OMG I love it...</li>
            <li>and then you are doing more damage to your nails.</li>
            <li>I love this product by Nutranail.  </li>
            <li>and I love the condition of my nails now.  </li>
            <li>I use more than twice a day-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure results vary from person to person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>The one thing that truly makes me love this product is that al you have to do is massage the oil in,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one product I can honestly say is true to it&#x27;s word.   </li>
            <li>But it is still a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t comment on the effectiveness itself but it does absorb quickly and the packaging is nice which I give it a 2 star.</li>
            <li>Great Seller, Fast Shipment, Very Pleased, Thanks, Paula</li>
            <li>The top layer is unbelievably smooth.</li>
            <li>This is the one product that visibly made a difference and strengthened my nails so they didn&#x27;t break as easily.</li>
            <li>This is fantastic for keeping your nails strong without acetone.   </li>
            <li>They are strong, long, and utterly beautiful.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how much was just my nail healing on it&#x27;s own</li>
            <li>My nails take abit of time to grow but it IS worth it :)</li>
            <li>Made my nails grow long and strong!!!</li>
            <li>With continued use I was actually able to grow a perfect set of 10 long nails, which I could never do before because my nails are naturally soft.  </li>
            <li>Grew my nails so fast, and strong!</li>
            <li>love my love NATURAL nails</li>
            <li>This is great to use if your nails are dry and crack a lot.  </li>
            <li>oily and does not come off - you have to wipe your nails clean of this stuff.  ??</li>
            <li>This strenghthened my nails and while you wont have amazing nails the first week, there is a significant growth, thanks to this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Within 7 days I had grown a good amount of nail, especially since I&#x27;ve been biting my nails for 35 years!  </li>
            <li>I love this item so much I never had nails before</li>
            <li>When I first tried it on my own nails, it only made them grow better not faster.</li>
            <li>I now have a full set of normal  nails that look healthy.</li>
            <li>Overall, not the best product if you&#x27;re trying to grow sandal-worthy nails in a short period of time.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for strong, smooth, long, healthy nails, use this product.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product to anyone who would like long and beautiful nails without having to spend a fortune on treatments.</li>
            <li>Leaves my cuticles and under the nails moisturized - just like a good hand lotion for dry hands.</li>
            <li>I did exactly as the directions told me so and my goodness!</li>
            <li>This product makes your nails strong and healthy in a short time.</li>
            <li>after reading all the positive reviews on this product, i was excited to try it out.</li>
            <li>This is no set back, seeing as you get amazing results.</li>
            <li>This one helps my nails growth back after deteriorating from neglect, my own.  </li>
            <li>I think it was somewhat helpful, I wish results would have been more quick and apparent.</li>
            <li>Plus the tips right.</li>
            <li>I use it several times a day and you will see growth in really two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Having painted nails and coating them with top coat and applying Nutra nail is fine together.</li>
            <li>I noticed better results when using it less as like a nail polish and more like a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Got here super fast</li>
            <li>Now they are long and very very strong.  </li>
            <li>- this is my first and the Nutra Nail</li>
            <li>I just applied first treatment.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works well and exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>and your nails grow so fast!</li>
            <li>and it actually helped me stop biting my nails! :)</li>
            <li>Thanks, Nutra Nail!</li>
            <li>maybe it need more time, I will see what will happen in the next days ?</li>
            <li>gloves on while washing dishes and cleaning is a big help to keeping your nails healthy and strong.&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li>On top of that spending $125 a week on nails only hair was $60 a week.</li>
            <li>and I used it exactly as directed</li>
            <li>missed a day and used it this fourth day and my nails have a good length I can see the white part alot...</li>
            <li>I refuse to pay nail salons for nails when I can grow my own for less.</li>
            <li>My nails feel much stronger and healthier.</li>
            <li>i have been a nail biter my whole life.</li>
            <li>I saw results in about 5 days,but very minimum results.</li>
            <li>If you need FAST results,dont buy this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product as I have had years of difficulty with my nails splitting at the tip and never getting any length, twisitng because they were so weak....no longer!  </li>
            <li>The aloe is very soothing.  </li>
            <li>I Like this product really well.  </li>
            <li>My nail grew fast and stopped looking like it had pits in it.</li>
            <li>and how much was this product, but I would use it again.</li>
            <li>I was Really scared that it wasn&#x27;t going to work</li>
            <li>MY NAILS ARE VERY BRITTLE AND CHIP</li>
            <li>IT REALLY HEALS BRITTLES NAILS</li>
            <li>I try never to be without one of Nutranail&#x27;s nail products as they have really improved my nails.</li>
            <li>Just a quick note to say that this product actually works and works REALLY well.  </li>
            <li>at first I applied over a polish I had on, since it said it was fine to use over polish, it is NOT, because 2 days later all my polish was coming off, like all at once, in one big piece each nail, so don&#x27;t use over polish.</li>
            <li>Okay, first of all, I have rock hard nails that grow so fast</li>
            <li>After 10 days with taking a supplement here and there, my nails grew back so long and strong!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also applied to to my fairly normal fingernails as I go</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;ve been applying this product 2-3 times a day to my stumpy toenails which never seem to grow past the quick for almost a full month now.</li>
            <li>I live in Hawaii.</li>
            <li>A year ago I bought this product in a local store and before long I noticed my nails were growing and becoming stronger.  </li>
            <li>I am amazed how I have such healthy pink nail bed nails.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a few weeks now, it has not made my nails any stronger at all, it has not helped my cuticals any at all, and I cant tell any difference really, well I may not have as many chips, but my nails are still really weak and break super easy, and I have not grown them out any at all, sill extremely short</li>
            <li>When I used to bite my nails, I would peel off the top layers of my nail, but this product has fixed all the damage I&#x27;ve been doing for the past twenty-one years.</li>
            <li>I no longer have baby soft nails that just wouldn&#x27;t grow.</li>
            <li>to me this means that the item was old and expired</li>
            <li>I do receive compliments on my natural nails.</li>
            <li>This product works and lasts pretty long.</li>
            <li>when used daily this stuff really works</li>
            <li>I was expecting maybe a clear laquer and was surprised</li>
            <li>In just a few days my nails were growing much faster and looked much healthier!</li>
            <li>this product is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Seeing nails for the first time starting to grow and all bitten skin beginning to grow back</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve followed the instructions carefully (massaging the oil into the nail and cuticle), but my nails are still super short and janky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>next I took off the polish, filed and shaped my nails and cleaned them, left completely polish free, and used this for over 3 weeks, and nothing, so I give up, I have used over half the bottle, and no improvement really, mabey a little bit, like I said, not as many chips, but that&#x27;s about it, but its just not worth it, not the price,ordering, or the trouble of using, and not painting my nails for something that doesn&#x27;t really work!</li>
            <li>As a former nail biter (I stopped in August), my nails were so soft and brittle.</li>
            <li>I am very optimistic based on the other reviews.....</li>

            <li> highly recommend this product to anyone who would like long and beautiful nails without having to spend a fortune on treatments.</li>
            <li> Leaves my cuticles and under the nails moisturized - just like a good hand lotion for dry hands.</li>
            <li> I did exactly as the directions told me so and my goodness!</li>
            <li> This product makes your nails strong and healthy in a short time.</li>
            <li> after reading all the positive reviews on this product, i was excited to try it out.</li>
            <li> This is no set back, seeing as you get amazing results.</li>
            <li> This one helps my nails growth back after deteriorating from neglect, my own.  </li>
            <li> I think it was somewhat helpful, I wish results would have been more quick and apparent.</li>
            <li> Plus the tips right.</li>
            <li> I use it several times a day and you will see growth in really two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Having painted nails and coating them with top coat and applying Nutra nail is fine together.</li>
            <li> I noticed better results when using it less as like a nail polish and more like a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Got here super fast</li>
            <li> Now they are long and very very strong.  </li>
            <li> - this is my first and the Nutra Nail</li>
            <li> I just applied first treatment.  </li>
            <li> This stuff works well and exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> and your nails grow so fast!</li>
            <li> and it actually helped me stop biting my nails! :)</li>
            <li> Thanks, Nutra Nail!</li>
            <li> maybe it need more time, I will see what will happen in the next days ?</li>
            <li> gloves on while washing dishes and cleaning is a big help to keeping your nails healthy and strong.&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li> On top of that spending $125 a week on nails only hair was $60 a week.</li>
            <li> and I used it exactly as directed</li>
            <li> missed a day and used it this fourth day and my nails have a good length I can see the white part alot...</li>
            <li> I refuse to pay nail salons for nails when I can grow my own for less.</li>
            <li> My nails feel much stronger and healthier.</li>
            <li> i have been a nail biter my whole life.</li>
            <li> I saw results in about 5 days,but very minimum results.</li>
            <li> If you need FAST results,dont buy this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product as I have had years of difficulty with my nails splitting at the tip and never getting any length, twisitng because they were so weak....no longer!  </li>
            <li> The aloe is very soothing.  </li>
            <li> I Like this product really well.  </li>
            <li> My nail grew fast and stopped looking like it had pits in it.</li>
            <li> and how much was this product, but I would use it again.</li>
            <li> I was Really scared that it wasn&#x27;t going to work</li>
            <li> MY NAILS ARE VERY BRITTLE AND CHIP</li>
            <li> IT REALLY HEALS BRITTLES NAILS</li>
            <li> I try never to be without one of Nutranail&#x27;s nail products as they have really improved my nails.</li>
            <li> Just a quick note to say that this product actually works and works REALLY well.  </li>
            <li> at first I applied over a polish I had on, since it said it was fine to use over polish, it is NOT, because 2 days later all my polish was coming off, like all at once, in one big piece each nail, so don&#x27;t use over polish.</li>
            <li> Okay, first of all, I have rock hard nails that grow so fast</li>
            <li> After 10 days with taking a supplement here and there, my nails grew back so long and strong!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also applied to to my fairly normal fingernails as I go</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve been applying this product 2-3 times a day to my stumpy toenails which never seem to grow past the quick for almost a full month now.</li>
            <li> I live in Hawaii.</li>
            <li> A year ago I bought this product in a local store and before long I noticed my nails were growing and becoming stronger.  </li>
            <li> I am amazed how I have such healthy pink nail bed nails.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now, it has not made my nails any stronger at all, it has not helped my cuticals any at all, and I cant tell any difference really, well I may not have as many chips, but my nails are still really weak and break super easy, and I have not grown them out any at all, sill extremely short</li>
            <li> When I used to bite my nails, I would peel off the top layers of my nail, but this product has fixed all the damage I&#x27;ve been doing for the past twenty-one years.</li>
            <li> I no longer have baby soft nails that just wouldn&#x27;t grow.</li>
            <li> to me this means that the item was old and expired</li>
            <li> I do receive compliments on my natural nails.</li>
            <li> This product works and lasts pretty long.</li>
            <li> when used daily this stuff really works</li>
            <li> I was expecting maybe a clear laquer and was surprised</li>
            <li> In just a few days my nails were growing much faster and looked much healthier!</li>
            <li> this product is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Seeing nails for the first time starting to grow and all bitten skin beginning to grow back</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve followed the instructions carefully (massaging the oil into the nail and cuticle), but my nails are still super short and janky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> next I took off the polish, filed and shaped my nails and cleaned them, left completely polish free, and used this for over 3 weeks, and nothing, so I give up, I have used over half the bottle, and no improvement really, mabey a little bit, like I said, not as many chips, but that&#x27;s about it, but its just not worth it, not the price,ordering, or the trouble of using, and not painting my nails for something that doesn&#x27;t really work!</li>
            <li> As a former nail biter (I stopped in August), my nails were so soft and brittle.</li>
            <li> I am very optimistic based on the other reviews.....</li>
            <li> I now have to cut them twice per week because work requires trimmed nails and they grow so fast now and don&#x27;t rip off for any little injury as they did for years!</li>
            <li> I wore acrylic nails for more years than anyone should and it left my nails in deplorable condition.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely purchase this product again as well as recommend this for anyone experiencing problems with hangnails or dry and damaged cuticles.</li>
            <li> They get really long.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s not what astonished me, it&#x27;s how thick, hard, and strong my nails are.</li>
            <li> just need to stop biting them off when the grow long ugghhh!</li>
            <li> Before I started using it my nails were extremely brittle and broke off constantly.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with nail biting for a very long time and nothing has seemed to help.</li>
            <li> My brush was dry</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen my nails this long in 15 yrs!!</li>
            <li> All the sudden, my nails started growing a little</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had short little nails and have struggled to grow them out.</li>
            <li> for some dumb reason i used it right before i got acrylics on and now after less then a week with the acrylics, i need fills!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need harder nails.</li>
            <li> After a few days actual nail growth was noticable.</li>
            <li> This product has given me the nails I&#x27;ve envied on other people all my life.</li>
            <li> I used this on one hand and not the other for a week.</li>
            <li> The hand I used it on grew longer than the other one.</li>
            <li> My nails are weak and brake easily, after using this product my nails are hard and growing!!</li>
            <li> i have average length nails</li>
            <li> I use to bite my nails and then years of acrylics that made my nail lift from my nail bed, fungus green growing under nail bed in the center of your nail bed</li>
            <li> So to prevent them from breaking cut them down and they will get thicker and never break.  </li>
            <li> I have always been a nail bitter always had small nails.</li>
            <li> I know this product is the miracle because I had stopped biting my nails for a few months, and even when they grew out they were still damaged, week, and uneven in the layers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll first admit I was very skeptical of this product.</li>
            <li> A DAY EVERYDAY</li>
            <li> and I used as directed, applied 2 times a day everyday...</li>
            <li> I also dont remember to use this everyday</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to suggest applying everyday for two weeks then, using the product and covering with nail polish.</li>
            <li> When I do try to grow out my nails, it&#x27;s a long process and my nails are usually weak and brittle.</li>
            <li> My nail biting habit has gone down lately.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a miracle in a little bottle!</li>
            <li> I took them off about 6 months ago and my nails have finally stopped peeling, but they are very weak.  </li>
            <li> and though they aren&#x27;t growing any father than usual, the tops do seem a bit smoother.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past 2 months to repair my damaged nails after removing acrylic nails.  </li>
            <li> I saw noticeable growth while I used it until I got lazy , but that&#x27;s my fault.</li>
            <li> I bought this prod because of the positive reviews, but I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am excited to get a manicure in a couple of weeks without having to get those awful acrylic nails that destroy my nails everytime.  </li>
            <li> ordered 2 separate times and all of the applicators were hard as a rock.</li>
            <li> so it is hard on my nails.  </li>
            <li> I was not expecting this to work, but I thought that I would at least give it a shot.</li>
            <li> well at least i don&#x27;t notice it..</li>
            <li> In personal experience, green tea isn&#x27;t bad for ANYTHING.</li>
            <li> and I am in my late twenties</li>
            <li> It is oily and dries slowly.</li>
            <li> I had a very bad problem in the past with biting my nails and this helped them grow fast and well.</li>
            <li> The only con is that it smells bad</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so bad that after the 3rd day I felt too weird using it</li>
            <li> I used to buy this in drugstores, but it&#x27;s been difficult to find lately.  </li>
            <li> I bought fungus nail stuff at the drug store and that stopped the fungus and prevented my nail from looking worse.</li>
            <li> I been biting them for years, and they stopped growing and if I tried to grow them they grew thin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years; am now unable to find it in stores.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical but gave it a try.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, one of my nails somehow got a fungus (I have no idea</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my nail had detached almost halfway down my nail bed and looked horrible.</li>
            <li> I am always cutting them.</li>
            <li> So I was a nail biter and let me tell you, some of my nails were just an unpleasant sight.</li>
            <li> I received it as pictured, but when I opened the bottle to use it, it smelled really bad; there&#x27;s a fishy combined with trash smell.</li>
            <li> I was a bad nail biter</li>
            <li> I was shocked that it worked.</li>
            <li> As ugly as they were like you see in the pictures .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for two weeks now and no difference :(</li>
            <li> I just apply it whenever I remember to or as a base coat when I put on polish.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what all the rave to this product is about, but it smells so awful.</li>
            <li> I have a terrible habit of biting my nails but this polish helped grow my nails within 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I became allergic and my hands were on fire from the product and worst the drill.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it. Strengthens nails without coating them with something that will peel off or turn white.</li>
            <li> To begin, I have never in my life reviewed an item - this is my first and the Nutra Nail 5 to 7 Day Growth Aloe Formula truly deserves one.   This product works! And it works well! As a former nail biter (I stopped in August), my nails were so soft and brittle. I have been using this product for about two weeks, and my nails grew. But that&#x27;s not what astonished me, it&#x27;s how thick, hard, and strong my nails are. The top layer is unbelievably smooth. When I used to bite my nails, I would peel off the top layers of my nail, but this product has fixed all the damage I&#x27;ve been doing for the past twenty-one years. I no longer have baby soft nails that just wouldn&#x27;t grow. This product has given me the nails I&#x27;ve envied on other people all my life. They are strong, long, and utterly beautiful. I know this product is the miracle because I had stopped biting my nails for a few months, and even when they grew out they were still damaged, week, and uneven in the layers. In the last two weeks there has been a total transformation of my nails. I am amazed to look at my hands and convince myself that they are indeed mine.   I have also been applying this product every chance I get, not the recommended twice a day. I carry it around in my purse or pocket and just apply it whenever I think about it, every chance I get. If you&#x27;re looking for strong, smooth, long, healthy nails, use this product. It works!</li>
            <li> I have actually never had nails! All the sudden, my nails started growing a little so I bought this stuff to keep them strong! Now..they are definitely stronger now! Will continue to buy and use this! Also my nails look healthier, including the cuticles!(sp)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It works fantastically, I used it two times daily and it worked for me in the allotted week. My nails feel much stronger and healthier. I used this before coating my nails with any polish, though at night I have to take the polish off in order to reach my nails and properly use this growth formula. This is no set back, seeing as you get amazing results. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nutranail for years. It&#x27;s one product I can honestly say is true to it&#x27;s word.   Whenever I want my nails to grow, I faithfully use Nutranail. I&#x27;ll apply it nightly for 5-7 days and within that time, I notice a difference in the length of my nails. So the product does work. Nutranail is a great product!! Wish they made it for hair...lol</li>
            <li> It grows my nails!! I use this product every time I polish my nails. The only con is that it smells bad so don&#x27;t inhale.</li>
            <li> Only 4 stars because it just arrived today - and I just applied first treatment.  I am very optimistic based on the other reviews.....I wore acrylic nails for more years than anyone should and it left my nails in deplorable condition.  I took them off about 6 months ago and my nails have finally stopped peeling, but they are very weak.  I am ever hopeful this will be the solution-I have tried EVERYTHING!&lt;br /&gt;I will return and revise after I have used for a week-  According to the packaging I should see improvement in 5 to 7 DAYS.  We&#x27;ll see - that&#x27;s almost too good to be true...IMO&lt;br /&gt;Update: It&#x27;s been a bit over a week-using faithfully per directions 2X a day---NOTHING</li>
            <li> This stuff works well and exactly as advertised.  Within 7 days I had grown a good amount of nail, especially since I&#x27;ve been biting my nails for 35 years!  I now have a full set of normal  nails that look healthy.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any changes.</li>
            <li> Comprei esse produto, basicamente influenciada pelas ótimas reviews que vi. E realmente, funciona. Depois de quase minha vida toda roendo as unhas, finalmente deixei-as crescer, mas estavam fracas e quebradiças. Estou usando faz duas semanas, e passo o NutraNail sempre que lembro. As vezes passo umas 05x por dia, sem problemas. NÃO IRÃO SE ARREPENDER, É ÓTIMO!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what all the rave to this product is about, but it smells so awful. I received it as pictured, but when I opened the bottle to use it, it smelled really bad; there&#x27;s a fishy combined with trash smell. It&#x27;s so bad that after the 3rd day I felt too weird using it so I can&#x27;t comment on the effectiveness itself but it does absorb quickly and the packaging is nice which I give it a 2 star.</li>
            <li> love it!! love my love NATURAL nails (:</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve been applying this product 2-3 times a day to my stumpy toenails which never seem to grow past the quick for almost a full month now. I&#x27;ve followed the instructions carefully (massaging the oil into the nail and cuticle), but my nails are still super short and janky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I did notice that they seem more supple/flexible than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve also applied to to my fairly normal fingernails as I go and though they aren&#x27;t growing any father than usual, the tops do seem a bit smoother. Overall, not the best product if you&#x27;re trying to grow sandal-worthy nails in a short period of time. It does seem like it would be nice for people with brittle, flaky nails, though!</li>
            <li> Works like a miracle!.... just need to stop biting them off when the grow long ugghhh!</li>
            <li> I bought it 2 weeks ago. My nails are weak and brake easily, after using this product my nails are hard and growing!! I haven&#x27;t seen my nails this long in 15 yrs!! I will be buying this product again!!!</li>
            <li> This product makes your nails strong and healthy in a short time. and your nails grow so fast! It&#x27;s a miracle in a little bottle!</li>
            <li> MY NAILS GREW IN 5 DAYS VERY IMPRESSED!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past 2 months to repair my damaged nails after removing acrylic nails.  I have noticed my nails have been growing and this product has helped their appearance.  I use it several times a day to keep my nails looking this wonderful.  I am excited to get a manicure in a couple of weeks without having to get those awful acrylic nails that destroy my nails everytime.  I wish I would have found this product sooner before damaging my nails with acrylics.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic for keeping your nails strong without acetone.   I used to buy this in drugstores, but it&#x27;s been difficult to find lately.  Nice to be able to order it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting this to work, but I thought that I would at least give it a shot. Lone behold, it actually made my nails tougher and grew them quicker. I was shocked that it worked. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Loved this product! I have a terrible habit of biting my nails but this polish helped grow my nails within 2 weeks I saw a big difference and it actually helped me stop biting my nails! :)</li>
            <li> this is the best thing I have found to help make my nails stronger and not break as easy. the best</li>
            <li> A year ago I bought this product in a local store and before long I noticed my nails were growing and becoming stronger.  With continued use I was actually able to grow a perfect set of 10 long nails, which I could never do before because my nails are naturally soft.  When I quit using this product because I could not find it locally, my nails again began to split and peel.  So happy to find it on Amazon and ordered 3.  The purchase was sent very rapidly and arrived in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> As for me I wanted the calcium formula.  I didn&#x27;t know they had this type out there.  It is oily and dries slowly.</li>
            <li> So I used this product twice a day for a week and at time I would massage it in. Seem to work, my nails a showing length again.</li>
            <li> after reading all the positive reviews on this product, i was excited to try it out. i have average length nails but i wanted them to grow  longer and i have been applying this product on my nails 2 times a day and after 5 days, i have not seen a difference. my nails aren&#x27;t growing any faster or longer. well at least i don&#x27;t notice it.. it may work for others out there but i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll first admit I was very skeptical of this product. I have struggled with nail biting for a very long time and nothing has seemed to help. This is the one product that visibly made a difference and strengthened my nails so they didn&#x27;t break as easily. I think it works best with use multiple times a day, so be sure to follow the instructions. I noticed better results when using it less as like a nail polish and more like a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I think it was somewhat helpful, I wish results would have been more quick and apparent. But it does somewhat work.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and my mom said it worked well.  I didn&#x27;t actually use it myself so can&#x27;t otherwise comment.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. i have been a nail biter my whole life. When I do try to grow out my nails, it&#x27;s a long process and my nails are usually weak and brittle. This stuff is a miracle. Not only did I see instant results but my nails are stronger than they have ever been!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years; am now unable to find it in stores.  Very glad it&#x27;s still available online.  The product works great for nail strength.</li>
            <li> ordered 2 separate times and all of the applicators were hard as a rock. to me this means that the item was old and expired</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but gave it a try. I am a chronic nail biter and have been my entire life. This strenghthened my nails and while you wont have amazing nails the first week, there is a significant growth, thanks to this stuff.  I am almost out and will buy more.</li>
            <li> This product worked for a short time but it wasn&#x27;t the greatest either but it might work for others and maybe not. You will have to try it and see what the results are.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> for some dumb reason i used it right before i got acrylics on and now after less then a week with the acrylics, i need fills!</li>
            <li> it does help your nails in a week i saw some difference</li>
            <li> So I was a nail biter and let me tell you, some of my nails were just an unpleasant sight. Some of my nail&#x27;s tips grew layered and my nails were quite short. I laid off the habit I decided to try this in hope I could grow better nails. I did exactly as the directions told me so and my goodness! In just a few days my nails were growing much faster and looked much healthier! The layered nail grew into a normal , strong nail and my nails look great! I am DEFINITELY getting another bottle!</li>
            <li> ......bottom line....you will be satisfied.  I was.</li>
            <li> I have always been a nail bitter always had small nails. Since i started using this product my nails have grown out beautifully. Took about a week and ahalf for my nails to fully grow out. Totally SATISFIED! !!! Wonderful investment</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because my nails were very short.I saw results in about 5 days,but very minimum results.If you need FAST results,dont buy this.As for strengthening my nails,that is a con of this product.My nails peel very easily and on the box it listed that this Growth treatment could help with that.It didn&#x27;t.Overall,I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again,But this does somewhat work!</li>
            <li> works!  that&#x27;s all there is,,,use it daily and it will work.  I have tried many many and this one is the best!  Highly recommend this product as I have had years of difficulty with my nails splitting at the tip and never getting any length, twisitng because they were so weak....no longer!  I have used this product of 2 years and no longer have any problems with my nails.  I now have to cut them twice per week because work requires trimmed nails and they grow so fast now and don&#x27;t rip off for any little injury as they did for years!</li>
            <li> It come over night... Got here super fast and I&#x27;ve only put it on for two days missed a day and used it this fourth day and my nails have a good length I can see the white part alot... I was a bad nail biter</li>
            <li> This is great to use if your nails are dry and crack a lot.  The aloe is very soothing.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Makes my nail grow. 10/10</li>
            <li> It works if you keep up with it every day. I saw noticeable growth while I used it until I got lazy , but that&#x27;s my fault.</li>
            <li> Love this.....My nails are stronger, not chipping GREAT PRODUCT...</li>
            <li> When I read on Amazon the label on the packaging, it said that it help your nails grow faster and better. When I first tried it on my own nails, it only made them grow better not faster. But it is still a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> I always have good luck with Nutra Nail products.  This one helps my nails growth back after deteriorating from neglect, my own.  Thanks, Nutra Nail!</li>
            <li> My brush was dry but i can truly say THIS WORKS!!! Glad i brought it :)</li>
            <li> I Like this product really well.  My nails now have a nice healthy sheen to them. I did not notice if they were growing any faster but they are definitely growing healthier.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and years and would recommend it to anyone who has problems growing their fingernails. If used as directed you will see the results that it says you will. I refuse to pay nail salons for nails when I can grow my own for less. I do receive compliments on my natural nails.</li>
            <li> I bought this prod because of the positive reviews, but I&#x27;m disappointed. It really a waste of money, I used it for 7 days two times day, but absolutely nothing happen, my nails still in the same health, no improvement !!!&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it doesn&#x27;t work for me!!or maybe it need more time, I will see what will happen in the next days ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update :&lt;br /&gt;After weeks, I can say now for sure that it works, I niticed that when I was using this product my nail was healthier, so I will change my rating from 2 to five stars !!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for two weeks now and no difference :(</li>
            <li> I use this as a cuticle oil, it is not a polish but more of an oil.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Okay, first of all, I have rock hard nails that grow so fast I am always cutting them. I don&#x27;t need harder nails. Unfortunately, one of my nails somehow got a fungus (I have no idea how, I wash my hangs about every 2-3 hours). I bought fungus nail stuff at the drug store and that stopped the fungus and prevented my nail from looking worse. Unfortunately, my nail had detached almost halfway down my nail bed and looked horrible. I got this product because I needed my nail to get healthy again and grow out so it would attach again. This helped a lot. My nail grew fast and stopped looking like it had pits in it. My nail had also thinned a lot which this stuff seemed to fix. I don&#x27;t know how much was just my nail healing on it&#x27;s own and how much was this product, but I would use it again. Apply it often though, keep the nutrients on your nail. In personal experience, green tea isn&#x27;t bad for ANYTHING.</li>
            <li> OMG I love it...I was Really scared that it wasn&#x27;t going to work but it does</li>
            <li> This product works and lasts pretty long. I use it several times a day and you will see growth in really two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Having painted nails and coating them with top coat and applying Nutra nail is fine together. After I paint them and let  set for 5 minutes I apply nutra nail. It helps with your cuticles and its none drying it moisturizes your nails. They get really long. So to prevent them from breaking cut them down and they will get thicker and never break.  Mine grew out 2inches then they started to break from cleaning and gardening work. Thumb nails seem to take forever to grow out.&lt;br /&gt;Keeping gloves on while washing dishes and cleaning is a big help to keeping your nails healthy and strong.&lt;br /&gt;Hope it works for you. I use to bite my nails and then years of acrylics that made my nail lift from my nail bed, fungus green growing under nail bed in the center of your nail bed so you can&#x27;t remove it till it grows out or you dig it out and then you are doing more damage to your nails. I became allergic and my hands were on fire from the product and worst the drill. As ugly as they were like you see in the pictures . I was determined to grow my own nails. On top of that spending $125 a week on nails only hair was $60 a week. I live in Hawaii. So it double anything here. Plus the tips right. it all adds up. I am amazed how I have such healthy pink nail bed nails. This product along with a vitamin e oil on your nails will help grow them. Also polish with garlic additives are great or make a bottle with vitamin e oil and the juice from the minced garlic jar and paint this on your nails you will be amazed how your nails will start to grow get whiter and thicker but it takes 6 month to a year. I been free and clear from fake nails since 2010.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  been using it for three days , and I can already see my nails growing. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that my nails dont grow evenly , one is longer than the rest . But the product does work.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t do  anything for my week nails and I used it exactly as directed</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a couple of years, it is amazing.  you can see within a couple of days that your nails are stronger.</li>
            <li> when used daily this stuff really works</li>
            <li> Leaves my cuticles and under the nails moisturized - just like a good hand lotion for dry hands. Loved this.</li>
            <li> I love this product by Nutranail.  The condition of my nails and cuticles have noticeably improved !!!  I don&#x27;t get hangnails anymore and I love the condition of my nails now.  I would definitely purchase this product again as well as recommend this for anyone experiencing problems with hangnails or dry and damaged cuticles. This is a miracle in a bottle and will be a staple for me in my nail care regimen!!!</li>
            <li> After a few days actual nail growth was noticable. Will do it for the 7 day and hope it will make them stronger then before</li>
            <li> Love this product-I have nails again!  I use more than twice a day-whenever I have the chance!  Will purchase again and again!!!! Best I have used and the price is great!!</li>
            <li> MY NAILS ARE VERY BRITTLE AND CHIP ALL THE TIME.I ORDERED THIS AND USED IT TWICE A DAY EVERYDAY AND I COULD TELL THE DIFFERENCE IN TWO DAYS.AND IT REALLY HEALS BRITTLES NAILS</li>
            <li> Just a quick note to say that this product actually works and works REALLY well.  Before I started using it my nails were extremely brittle and broke off constantly. Now they are long and very very strong.  I just apply it whenever I remember to or as a base coat when I put on polish.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now, it has not made my nails any stronger at all, it has not helped my cuticals any at all, and I cant tell any difference really, well I may not have as many chips, but my nails are still really weak and break super easy, and I have not grown them out any at all, sill extremely short (nail line or below nail line short), and I used as directed, applied 2 times a day everyday... at first I applied over a polish I had on, since it said it was fine to use over polish, it is NOT, because 2 days later all my polish was coming off, like all at once, in one big piece each nail, so don&#x27;t use over polish. next I took off the polish, filed and shaped my nails and cleaned them, left completely polish free, and used this for over 3 weeks, and nothing, so I give up, I have used over half the bottle, and no improvement really, mabey a little bit, like I said, not as many chips, but that&#x27;s about it, but its just not worth it, not the price,ordering, or the trouble of using, and not painting my nails for something that doesn&#x27;t really work!</li>
            <li> Does not work for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure results vary from person to person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this product worked wonders for me! I&#x27;ve always had short little nails and have struggled to grow them out. Within days of using this product I had noticeable results - nails had grown longer and were stronger, and the overall look of the nail was a lot nicer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to anyone who would like long and beautiful nails without having to spend a fortune on treatments.</li>
            <li> Great Seller, Fast Shipment, Very Pleased, Thanks, Paula</li>
            <li> My nails did not grow at all and it made my fingers look greasy.</li>
            <li> I thought this was the gloss Aloe formula.  But I think they all would work so I just kept it.  I have a bottle of these everywhere, my office, home, in the car.</li>
            <li> Love this. My nail biting habit has gone down lately.  My nails take abit of time to grow but it IS worth it :)</li>
            <li> I used this on one hand and not the other for a week. The hand I used it on grew longer than the other one.</li>
            <li> Helped my nails grow so well. I had a very bad problem in the past with biting my nails and this helped them grow fast and well.</li>
            <li> I love this item so much I never had nails before and I am in my late twenties thank you for this great product.</li>
            <li> After 10 days with taking a supplement here and there, my nails grew back so long and strong! Would recommend and buy again!</li>
            <li> I was expecting maybe a clear laquer and was surprised that this in an oil.  It dries though almost instantly and does not get oil all over everything.  The best thing is it does work.  My nails still break but before this all my nails were as short as they could be ( I dont bite my nails ever) and now I do have nails growing on all fingers.  I do alot of dishes and have my hands in water alot so it is hard on my nails.  I also dont remember to use this everyday and it is still working. It would be great if I did it as directed.</li>
            <li> I bought this when my friend told me about it, and it is amazing. Grew my nails so fast, and strong! I love it and i will buy it again soon!</li>
            <li> Totally are working for my nails. I been biting them for years, and they stopped growing and if I tried to grow them they grew thin. This is a great product and totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> I am 7 days in... former nail biter (MAN) and this product is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Seeing nails for the first time starting to grow and all bitten skin beginning to grow back nicely.&lt;br /&gt;I bought 2  of these because will use forever</li>
            <li> oily and does not come off - you have to wipe your nails clean of this stuff.  ??</li>
            <li> Made my nails grow long and strong!!! I&#x27;d like to suggest applying everyday for two weeks then, using the product and covering with nail polish. The one thing that truly makes me love this product is that al you have to do is massage the oil in, let it sit for eh, maybe five minuets and then you can paint and do nail designs right over it!!! I love this product, great buy!!!</li>
            <li> nail strengthening and growth.  I try never to be without one of Nutranail&#x27;s nail products as they have really improved my nails.</li>
