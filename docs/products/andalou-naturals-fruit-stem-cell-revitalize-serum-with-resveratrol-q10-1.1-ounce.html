            <li>Her face was glowing, oozing vitality, and very healthy looking.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing for the price.</li>
            <li>So,I just googled the brand and started my own research.  </li>
            <li>However, it seems to work nicely on my skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks Andalou for making safe wonderful products.</li>
            <li>This product is light but creamy, absorbs nicely and smells good.</li>
            <li>For my skin type (mature/normal/dry), I fine this product to be an extremely good value for the price.  </li>
            <li>It glides on smoothly, absorbs well, and has good ingredients for anti-aging (</li>
            <li>The scent is very, very, very light,</li>
            <li>Love this brand.</li>
            <li>I will say that it burns more than my vitamin C.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>You can really rub it in if you want, I have experienced no stinging, like with some serums that promise cell turnover.  </li>
            <li>but I like the way this feels better, almost like a lotion.  </li>
            <li>I have had fewer breakouts and my skin has become more evenly toned since adding this to my regemin.</li>
            <li>I heard about this product through Paula&#x27;s Choice beautypedia as a top 4 star serum.</li>
            <li>and I had thought the andalou was causing more irritation.  </li>
            <li>then the fruit stem cell serum is all I do and it is amazingly better.  </li>
            <li>Lovely hydration without feeling sticky tacky or shiny.</li>
            <li>My skin is plumped and glows more.</li>
            <li>I noticed a definite improvement and am very happy using this twice a day- morning and evening.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and the price is great.</li>
            <li>, it even smells slightly sweet like apples, and the ingredients are amazing.</li>
            <li>My skin stays beautiful and clear.</li>
            <li>I hope all the awesome ingredients on this serums are doing wonders for my skin in the long run.</li>
            <li>Very good for dry skin types.</li>
            <li>and I can tolerate this fine.</li>
            <li>All in all, perhaps fine for diff.</li>
            <li>Smooth and absorbs easily.</li>
            <li>It is cost effective, and leaves my skin feeling very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>There you will see all the available products listed along the 3 beauty line.  </li>
            <li>I do wear an additional light moisturizer over it, however.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to be used as a light mousturizer.  </li>
            <li>Has a lot of the same ingredients of pricey serums but at a great value.</li>
            <li>So happy to find it here with free shipping, my favorite skin care line by far, blows more expensive brands out of the water--initially takes a wk or 2 to notice the diff, exfoliating about twice a wk so product can penetrate-seller and product are great!</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>Had read review on Beautypedia giving it best rating in spite of fragrance noting it was very very little.</li>
            <li>It goes on light but with full coverage moisture.  </li>
            <li>and I am still sticking to my original review</li>
            <li>At first I was not too sure about this product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not doing anything special for me.</li>
            <li>I tried this product because I liked the way it&#x27;s made from natural ingredients with no manmade toxins...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Is nice and sheer and my skin absorbs it well.  </li>
            <li>The serum seems nice enough</li>
            <li>and so far I love it.</li>
            <li>After a day of use I fell in love and was anxious to test more of the available products.  </li>
            <li>I made sure to use alkaline water, because I live in a dry climate and the salty water was wreaking havoc on my skin and made the rosacea itch more.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t like it very much.  </li>
            <li>I use this first thing every morning after I have washed my face.  </li>
            <li>It really seems to noticeably brighten my complexion!</li>
            <li>No breakouts after first application.  </li>
            <li>I have oily skin so all of Andalou serums I&#x27;ve tried only work for me as a night mousturizer since they leave a shiny finish and are too hydrating to put spf or make up on top.  </li>
            <li>and it is not that expensive considering the awesome skin care I am getting!  </li>
            <li>It finally starts to face an hour in and is mostly gone within two hours I find.</li>
            <li>so I bowed to never wear again after first application.</li>
            <li>but I have to say this has been the only product I&#x27;ve used in many years that has made me look</li>
            <li>Love the price point on Amazon and will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>Now i only use it on my neck and chest and that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I am over 60 and have fair, dry, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The results are positive.  </li>
            <li>I really like the way this made my skin look and feels after just the first use.</li>
            <li>and I purchased another after it ran out because it not only works beautifully, but it feels terrific and has such a lovely coconut-fruity soft natural fragrance when it goes on.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t see much difference, but would try again</li>
            <li>I like that this is sold at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>but you really should give this a try.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and Andalou Naturals absorbs into the skin very well and does help with firming  and softening of the lines.</li>
            <li>so you must be fast applying from hand to skin.</li>
            <li>I was diagnosed and did a lot of research online of different ingredients were helping with their rosacea symptoms, such as aloe, sea buckthorn, rose hips, turmeric.  </li>
            <li>LOVE how I look and recently ran into someone I knew 15 years ago and got an &#x27;oh my gosh, you look exactly the same</li>
            <li>light on skin, however, didn&#x27;t see much difference in brown spots as expected..</li>
            <li>Well it certainly doesn&#x27;t smell very little as the fruity odor is overwhelming when you apply it.</li>
            <li>So far, I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I really like it so far</li>
            <li>I have normal to oily skin and spend a lot of time outdoors</li>
            <li>Now, I can&#x27;t attribute all of that compliment to this, but there has been no negative change since I started using this.  </li>
            <li>If you have normal to oily skin</li>
            <li>My first experience with the Andalou Naturals product line was the Daily Defense SPF moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I do love and use other Andalou products regularly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s this serum, the vit c or both in conjunction, but I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>My skin does retain the plumped up look of the fine lines and deeper wrinkles as long as I wear it being in my mid 40&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I have VERY DRY skin, so while my hands and face are moist (not wet), I smooth this on and follow with a homemade moisturizer for my lipid layer.  </li>
            <li>I first purchased this in a natural foods grocery store for double the $$.</li>
            <li>single pump does my freshly washed and toned, face and neck.  </li>
            <li>and I have occasion pimple if I have too many late nights or didn&#x27;t eat well.  </li>
            <li>I would suggest you go to Anadalou Natural website</li>
            <li>It does not have a loud smell and</li>
            <li>my old serum</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I was looking for something natural, without dimethicone and silica or anything in it that was man made as a wetting agent.</li>
            <li>As far as one bottle I did not notice any drastic changes.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m highly sensitive to fragrance</li>
            <li>It looked as if my skin had a natural glow.</li>
            <li>This serum has peptides and natural ingredients to moisturize and repair dryness and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>There is no artifical ingredients in this serum, just natural fruit acids and peptides that speeds up collagen of the face.</li>
            <li>what little smell it has, dissipates quickly.  </li>
            <li>I usually buy this at Whole Foods for about $25-$27!!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a rather thick serum which gets absorbed fast, b&amp;uacute;t for my face</li>
            <li>No more break outs, my face looks and feels supple, fresh and glows.</li>
            <li>kit - 5 products - for normal to combination skin&lt;br /&gt;Clarifying kit - 5 products - for active and oily skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up buying the Age Defying kit and the Clarifying kit.</li>

            <li> As far as one bottle I did not notice any drastic changes.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m highly sensitive to fragrance</li>
            <li> It looked as if my skin had a natural glow.</li>
            <li> This serum has peptides and natural ingredients to moisturize and repair dryness and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> There is no artifical ingredients in this serum, just natural fruit acids and peptides that speeds up collagen of the face.</li>
            <li> what little smell it has, dissipates quickly.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy this at Whole Foods for about $25-$27!!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a rather thick serum which gets absorbed fast, b&amp;uacute;t for my face</li>
            <li> No more break outs, my face looks and feels supple, fresh and glows.</li>
            <li> kit - 5 products - for normal to combination skin&lt;br /&gt;Clarifying kit - 5 products - for active and oily skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up buying the Age Defying kit and the Clarifying kit.</li>
            <li> I started using the Fruit Stem Cell serum after washing and within several days I was immediately showing much less redness, my skin softened, there is not near as much itching, all the dry skin disappeared.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who has sensentive skin who wants to use a serum but is not sure which one to use.</li>
            <li> My skin has been really dry and this seemed to do the trick.</li>
            <li> I am switching from expensive skincare product to much reasonably priced natural products because I want to know if it will work for me.  </li>
            <li> My skin is also very sensitive to harsh chemicals found in most \\&quot;popular\\&quot; skin care lines which often sting when applied, smell unpleasant and irritate my skin so bad causing more break</li>
            <li> Defying kit -5 products - for very dry, dry, premature</li>
            <li> The luminous eye serum cleared up my dry eyelids too!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used skin care products that cost between $100-250 for the last few years and not seen any difference.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way...</li>
            <li> and I cannot apply make up or any other cosmetic to my face until it dries.</li>
            <li> so this bottle will last at least 6 months for me.  </li>
            <li> I have some dark spots from acne scars that are fading.</li>
            <li> but it does slide down your hand when u pump it out</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to trying a few other items in this line.</li>
            <li> It does not feel sticky or heavy like other serums I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I went back to my expensive product for a year and a monthly visits to my esthetician for hardcore facial to cure my breakouts....  </li>
            <li> It smells slightly fruity</li>
            <li> Some may need less.  </li>
            <li> I have been using a little over a month and can tell a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little greasier than I&#x27;d thought it would be</li>
            <li> It takes a few minutes to go away</li>
            <li> Soaks into skin within a few minutes and your skin retains that hydrated feel for the duration of wear.</li>
            <li> The texture is thin serum like with the look of a lotion being yellow.</li>
            <li> Its not a light serum.</li>
            <li> There was not many products on that website and it has no price.  </li>
            <li> skintypes than mine, not sure though.</li>
            <li> However I was shocked and pleasantly surprised how it wore so well with my SPF and that I didn&#x27;t mind the fragrance after it settled down not noticing it at all within three hours.</li>
            <li> My skin was looking parched, not smooth and generally tired.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not good, it made me break out after day 1 and so on.</li>
            <li> Cold laser helps build collagen, break down scar tissue and drives the creams deeper into the skin.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any dramatic results from the product yet</li>
            <li> I am not impressed.  </li>
            <li> I also have a cold laser (LLLT), you can find them for around $200</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong!  </li>
            <li> shocked</li>
            <li> My eternal search was dampened when thinking I could just put vitamin E oil on my face and tried oil pulling system or whatever that was called, with disastrous outcome...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very unhappy with the company /product.</li>
            <li> She told me she stopped using her expensive cream which it states it contains gold in it!!!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like this product line. I have been using a little over a month and can tell a difference in my skin.  It feels and looks smoother. I recommend this line.</li>
            <li> So far, so good. I haven&#x27;t noticed any dramatic results from the product yet but I haven&#x27;t had any adverse reactions either. It&#x27;s a little greasier than I&#x27;d thought it would be but it doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out and I&#x27;m prone to break outs. It has a really great fruity smell too.</li>
            <li> I use this first thing every morning after I have washed my face.  It really seems to noticeably brighten my complexion!</li>
            <li> I like that&#x27;s it&#x27;s organic don&#x27;t see much difference, but would try again</li>
            <li> Love this brand. I have the morning Ultra Sheer SPF 18 Daily Defense Facial Lotion, the night cream, the repair mask, and now the serum.</li>
            <li> My first experience with the Andalou Naturals product line was the Daily Defense SPF moisturizer. After a day of use I fell in love and was anxious to test more of the available products.  I have normal to oily skin and spend a lot of time outdoors so my skin takes quite a beating. My skin is also very sensitive to harsh chemicals found in most \\&quot;popular\\&quot; skin care lines which often sting when applied, smell unpleasant and irritate my skin so bad causing more break outs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve been using the Revitalize Serum + Meyer Lemon Cleanser + Probiotic + C Renewal Cream for two weeks and it has changed my life!! No more break outs, my face looks and feels supple, fresh and glows. I&#x27;ve replaced all of my skin care products with Andalou - I&#x27;m Hooked for Life!</li>
            <li> light on skin, however, didn&#x27;t see much difference in brown spots as expected..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times I will say that it burns more than my vitamin C. I use skin medica TNS but I think adding fruit stem cells is a great addition to my regimen. I like that this is sold at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> For my skin type (mature/normal/dry), I fine this product to be an extremely good value for the price.  It glides on smoothly, absorbs well, and has good ingredients for anti-aging (if there really is such a thing!?).&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I would recommend this product.  It is cost effective, and leaves my skin feeling very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed.  It&#x27;s not doing anything special for me. I do love and use other Andalou products regularly.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel wonderful.  Is nice and sheer and my skin absorbs it well.  Will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> This is my 4th bottle . Love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very unhappy with the company /product. this received 5 stars from the author of don&#x27;t go to the cosmetic counter without me. shocked</li>
            <li> I am impressed with this &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; serum.  I am over 60 and have fair, dry, sensitive skin.  I use this after toner and before moisturizer (mine is a CC cream type of moisturizer)...this is wonderfully soothing and non greasy.  A little goes a long way...so this bottle will last at least 6 months for me.  It doesn&#x27;t get tacky, but is not slippery like silicon serums.  I actually like that.  All in all a very good product at an excellant price.  I am looking forward to trying a few other items in this line.</li>
            <li> I am switching from expensive skincare product to much reasonably priced natural products because I want to know if it will work for me.  My eternal search was dampened when thinking I could just put vitamin E oil on my face and tried oil pulling system or whatever that was called, with disastrous outcome... I went back to my expensive product for a year and a monthly visits to my esthetician for hardcore facial to cure my breakouts....  Then I come across this brand where my friend told me she tried it when visiting Wholefood. Her face was glowing, oozing vitality, and very healthy looking.  She told me she stopped using her expensive cream which it states it contains gold in it!!!  Oh dear. I went to Wholefood website and the only skincare for face was Anadalou Naturals. There was not many products on that website and it has no price.  So,I just googled the brand and started my own research.  I like the description of this product and reviews were positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fruit stem cell Revitalize Serum has a fruity scent but I don&#x27;t like it very much.  However, it seems to work nicely on my skin. No breakouts after first application.  My skin looked well rested and even toned the next morning.  Then I decided to buy the Brightening Kit and use them with this serum.  It has been almost 2 weeks. The results are positive.  My skin stays beautiful and clear. I still have the glow and people thought I have make-up on but I only have BB cream.... and mascara!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note, Revitalize Serum is from Age Defying line.  They have 3 kits:&lt;br /&gt;Age Defying kit -5 products - for very dry, dry, premature skin.&lt;br /&gt;Brightening kit - 5 products - for normal to combination skin&lt;br /&gt;Clarifying kit - 5 products - for active and oily skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up buying the Age Defying kit and the Clarifying kit. I have oily skin and I have occasion pimple if I have too many late nights or didn&#x27;t eat well.  I would suggest you go to Anadalou Natural website go to the tab \\&quot;Inspired Beauty\\&quot; then click on \\&quot;Customized my Routine\\&quot;.  There you will see all the available products listed along the 3 beauty line.  This brand seems to work for me, I hope it works for you too.</li>
            <li> So far, I really like this product.  It does not have a loud smell and what little smell it has, dissipates quickly.  It smells slightly fruity but sometimes, I smell nothing.  The scent is very, very, very light, almost nonexistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A single pump does my freshly washed and toned, face and neck.  Some may need less.  I have VERY DRY skin, so while my hands and face are moist (not wet), I smooth this on and follow with a homemade moisturizer for my lipid layer.  I do not feel the need to reapply throughout the day.  I try to use morning and night but sometimes I miss a treatment.  It goes on light but with full coverage moisture.  You can really rub it in if you want, I have experienced no stinging, like with some serums that promise cell turnover.  I am the poster child for sensitive skin and firmly believe, that when cell turnover happens in our youth, we can&#x27;t feel it and that&#x27;s how it should feel...painless without any stinging or tingling to burn my sensitive cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE how I look and recently ran into someone I knew 15 years ago and got an &#x27;oh my gosh, you look exactly the same, you look great&#x27;.  Now, I can&#x27;t attribute all of that compliment to this, but there has been no negative change since I started using this.  It seems to be working as well as my old serum but I like the way this feels better, almost like a lotion.  Sometimes, I don&#x27;t even put on my homemade lipid layer on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue using.  Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> The serum seems nice enough but I do not like the sticky feeling after application. It takes a few minutes to go away and I cannot apply make up or any other cosmetic to my face until it dries.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing for the price. I use this in the morning and prescription retin-A at night. I have had fewer breakouts and my skin has become more evenly toned since adding this to my regemin. I have sensitive skin and I can tolerate this fine. I do wear an additional light moisturizer over it, however.</li>
            <li> I heard about this product through Paula&#x27;s Choice beautypedia as a top 4 star serum. I was looking for something natural, without dimethicone and silica or anything in it that was man made as a wetting agent. I really like it so far, it even smells slightly sweet like apples, and the ingredients are amazing. I will definitely purchase this product again when I run out!</li>
            <li> I just recently was diagnosed with rosacea.  The itching and burning was intolerable.  I was using another product since I initially thought I was just having allergic reactions to foods and I had thought the andalou was causing more irritation.  Boy was I wrong!  I was diagnosed and did a lot of research online of different ingredients were helping with their rosacea symptoms, such as aloe, sea buckthorn, rose hips, turmeric.  I reviewed the ingredients in the andalou since it had been a while since I used them.  I stopped my Dove soap and went back to the Andalou Probiotic Milk Cleanser.  It immediately calmed my skin.  I made sure to use alkaline water, because I live in a dry climate and the salty water was wreaking havoc on my skin and made the rosacea itch more.  I started using the Fruit Stem Cell serum after washing and within several days I was immediately showing much less redness, my skin softened, there is not near as much itching, all the dry skin disappeared.  Not everyone may have the same experience as me but you really should give this a try.  The luminous eye serum cleared up my dry eyelids too!  I plan on trying the turmeric serum too!  The simple routine of using the cleanser and then the fruit stem cell serum is all I do and it is amazingly better.  Thanks Andalou for making safe wonderful products.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin so all of Andalou serums I&#x27;ve tried only work for me as a night mousturizer since they leave a shiny finish and are too hydrating to put spf or make up on top.  *If you have normal to oily skin I recommend this product to be used as a light mousturizer.  This product is light but creamy, absorbs nicely and smells good. The size is great for the price.  I hope all the awesome ingredients on this serums are doing wonders for my skin in the long run. As far as one bottle I did not notice any drastic changes.   I recommend to give it a try!</li>
            <li> I have been using Andalou Naturals for awhile now and I am very happy with the product.  I have very oily skin and Andalou Naturals absorbs into the skin very well and does help with firming  and softening of the lines.</li>
            <li> I have been using the ANDALOU line of skin care cos&#x27; it works. It is great for the silky feel of the skin without being greasy or cakey. I am just happy that AMAZON has this line on its products and it is not that expensive considering the awesome skin care I am getting!  I have made another order for this and I am still sticking to my original review - this is a great skin care product that does what it says: takes very good care of my skin!!</li>
            <li> Had read review on Beautypedia giving it best rating in spite of fragrance noting it was very very little. Well it certainly doesn&#x27;t smell very little as the fruity odor is overwhelming when you apply it. It finally starts to face an hour in and is mostly gone within two hours I find. I&#x27;m highly sensitive to fragrance so I bowed to never wear again after first application. However I was shocked and pleasantly surprised how it wore so well with my SPF and that I didn&#x27;t mind the fragrance after it settled down not noticing it at all within three hours. So I kept wearing and I will defiantly repurchase. Lovely hydration without feeling sticky tacky or shiny. Soaks into skin within a few minutes and your skin retains that hydrated feel for the duration of wear. It&#x27;s the only fragranced product I&#x27;ve ever worn that I haven&#x27;t stopped and the only one I don&#x27;t mind or that doesn&#x27;t give me a headache or allergy symptoms. Can&#x27;t attest to the multitude of anti aging claims it makes as I&#x27;ve only been using a month. But it pairs well with my prescription Tretinion tho I don&#x27;t wear it with it. It just doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin the morning after I use it. My skin does retain the plumped up look of the fine lines and deeper wrinkles as long as I wear it being in my mid 40&#x27;s. The texture is thin serum like with the look of a lotion being yellow. It&#x27;s not watery runny but it does slide down your hand when u pump it out so you must be fast applying from hand to skin. Pump works good too. No clogging even tho I&#x27;m low on the product now. Definitely will keep it in my rotation for anti aging.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this made my skin look and feels after just the first use. It looked as if my skin had a natural glow. I&#x27;m using this in the morning and so far I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used skin care products that cost between $100-250 for the last few years and not seen any difference. My skin was looking parched, not smooth and generally tired. I got this on sale on a whim and within two weeks I see a difference I haven&#x27;t seen in years. My skin is plumped and glows more. Nothing is a miracle but I have to say this has been the only product I&#x27;ve used in many years that has made me look better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it am and pm after cleansing and toner (so it absorbs deeper). I also have a cold laser (LLLT), you can find them for around $200 (Hammacher Schlemmer has a good one w/lifetime guarantee) that I am going to experiment with. Cold laser helps build collagen, break down scar tissue and drives the creams deeper into the skin. I am going to see if using it w/this product makes an ever bigger difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, very impressed and planning on switching over to all their products.</li>
            <li> will purchase this again.  Has a lot of the same ingredients of pricey serums but at a great value.</li>
            <li> I first purchased this in a natural foods grocery store for double the $$. Of course I returned it and repurchased from Amazon. I use this on my throat to help tighten my &amp;#34;turkey neck&amp;#34; which is at the beginning stages of sagging (I&#x27;m 45). I noticed a definite improvement and am very happy using this twice a day- morning and evening. Love the price point on Amazon and will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a really great serum. My oily, dehydrated skin with enlarged pores appears firmer and plumper after just one week of use. I use a vitamin c serum in the AM and this serum in the PM.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a rather thick serum which gets absorbed fast, b&amp;uacute;t for my face it&#x27;s not good, it made me break out after day 1 and so on. Now i only use it on my neck and chest and that&#x27;s okay. Will not repurchase because this serum doesn&#x27;t add anything visibly good to my skin. All in all, perhaps fine for diff. skintypes than mine, not sure though.</li>
            <li> Smooth and absorbs easily. My skin looks clearer and brighter!</li>
            <li> My skin has been really dry and this seemed to do the trick. It&#x27;s lightweight and absorbs quickly. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Andalou Naturals Revitalize feels great, smells wonderful and provides good results. I tried this product because I liked the way it&#x27;s made from natural ingredients with no manmade toxins... and I purchased another after it ran out because it not only works beautifully, but it feels terrific and has such a lovely coconut-fruity soft natural fragrance when it goes on. Absolutely wonderful!</li>
            <li> I usually buy this at Whole Foods for about $25-$27!!! So happy to find it here with free shipping, my favorite skin care line by far, blows more expensive brands out of the water--initially takes a wk or 2 to notice the diff, exfoliating about twice a wk so product can penetrate-seller and product are great!</li>
            <li> At first I was not too sure about this product but  within a couple of days you see a noticable difference to your skin. I would recommend this to anyone who has sensentive skin who wants to use a serum but is not sure which one to use.</li>
            <li> This serum has peptides and natural ingredients to moisturize and repair dryness and wrinkles. There is no artifical ingredients in this serum, just natural fruit acids and peptides that speeds up collagen of the face. The serum is somewhat like a moisturizer.Its not a light serum. Very good for dry skin types. The shipping was fast and the price is great. I recommend this product to all Amazon customers...</li>
            <li> I have been using this in conjunction with Paula&#x27;s Choice Vitamin C booster. It does not feel sticky or heavy like other serums I&#x27;ve used. My skin does look clearer and smoother. I have some dark spots from acne scars that are fading. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s this serum, the vit c or both in conjunction, but I am satisfied.</li>
