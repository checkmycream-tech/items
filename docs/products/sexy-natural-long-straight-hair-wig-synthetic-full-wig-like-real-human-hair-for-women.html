            <li>My wife looked amazing wearing it.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>I could kind of maneuver the hair around to suit my style and the curls are a nice touch.</li>
            <li>Arrived looking just as nice as it&#x27;s pictured here.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much, but it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li>Nice quality wig.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s flawless and natural looking!!!</li>
            <li>For a synthetic, this wig is absolutely wonderful and I would highly recommend any Kamo wig.</li>
            <li>I was super happy with the magenta</li>
            <li>Looks very nice, feels comfortable, and the curls are lovely.</li>
            <li>Thank you Kamo Direct, and Amazon for a delightful shopping experience.</li>
            <li>Actually a really nice quality, comes in a hairnet for safe keeping.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a synthetic wig to be both nice color AND able to use a curling iron</li>
            <li>It was amazing for my poison ivy costume :)</li>
            <li>Item arrived very quickly!</li>
            <li>Great color and exactly as it looked in the photos.  </li>
            <li>NICE color, nice fit:)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very nice, the color is exactly what i was looking for!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The color and style was perfect for my Black Widow costume and of good quality too.</li>
            <li>The styling made the wig look even better.</li>
            <li>I was a total hit and the wig worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>The wine color looks much more purple in person than it does online.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely in love with it.</li>
            <li>So wigs tend to stretch a bit more and show their netting when I put them on.</li>
            <li>Since I did not know if it was curling iron safe, it was a bit of a bear to style to keep it out of one&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li>This wig is nothing astounding but OK for the cheap price.  </li>
            <li>I would definelty buy it again :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this was a surprisingly great purchase and I would highly recommend the wine-red.</li>
            <li>and I was not disappointed!</li>
            <li>Wow great wig for the money.</li>
            <li>I used this wig to cosplay Ariel this last weekend at A-Kon, it was really fun and worked great!</li>
            <li>I will be trimming bangs onto it in the future, to make it more managable, but I had a great time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to cut, which I needed to in order for it to match the character.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It arrived very quickly in the mail.</li>
            <li>my first wig and it is spectacular in looks, quality and heightening my experience.</li>
            <li>Beautiful burgundy color, pretty curls and realistic hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit longer than it looks in the picture, but that worked out fine for me.</li>
            <li>In normal, soft light, it is the perfect color.</li>
            <li>Both in color and in fit.</li>
            <li>They are really fabulous wigs</li>
            <li>It also came in just 3 days after I ordered it, so it&#x27;s great if you need a wig on short notice.</li>
            <li>but it was ok thanks :)</li>
            <li>The color is pretty but it tangles easily and has issues with static.  </li>
            <li>Love this, a little darker then the picture but still beautiful</li>
            <li>It fits perfectly- snug without being too small for my head.</li>
            <li>The color is beautiful and the red is very much like in the photo.  </li>
            <li>The packaging is simply fabulous and you can tell that so much care was put into making sure it was going to arrive in the condition</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made, not possible to pass as real hair, perfect for cosplay but not everyday wear</li>
            <li>This wig is a really great quality for the price - true to color and very durable so far.</li>
            <li>Very good quality for little price.</li>
            <li>The color is true to picture.</li>
            <li>Really cool wig.</li>
            <li>put it on and it fit really nicely, as well as having enough length to accomodate the bit of styling i&#x27;ll have to do for the cosplay I bought it for!</li>
            <li>I love the length and how realistic it looks if you put it on correctly.</li>
            <li>It shipped surprisingly quickly, too.</li>
            <li>SUPER quickly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very pretty.</li>
            <li>I gave it four stars only because in bright light it is a lot more red and</li>
            <li>When I tried it on in very bright light, it was slightly shiny, but nothing that can&#x27;t be fixed.</li>
            <li>It does tangle easily, but a wig comb get those right out without much difficulty.  </li>
            <li>Amazing red wig.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>For the price and the fun it brought to me, I guess I shouldn&#x27;t complain.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it can be fixed with some wig conditioner though.</li>
            <li>The price was right too.</li>
            <li>Great wig for such a low price!</li>
            <li>Soft but tangles easily.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s great for costumes and comicon but not for everyday use because it&#x27;s very noticeable that it is a wig.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty color.</li>
            <li>Everyone thought it was real!</li>
            <li>I wish I could give more stars but this wig is pretty short.</li>
            <li>Exactly the color I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a fantastic buy!</li>
            <li>so I had to hot glue it on.</li>
            <li>and I hope the entire line is as fantastic as these two were!</li>
            <li>Co-workers thought that I&#x27;d dyed my real hair on Halloween!</li>
            <li>, i.e., it&#x27;s more red than ginger.</li>
            <li>The only adjustment that I had to make was to cut and style the bangs, which YouTube made pretty easy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The lacing can be easy to see, especially at the scalp.</li>
            <li>In the light the highlights of pink come about more than the red but in natural light</li>
            <li>Even fits my large head.</li>
            <li>Two large chunks were unattached to the seam</li>
            <li>A real deal for the prize I paid.</li>
            <li>I absolutely intend to use this wig again, as it worked so well.</li>
            <li>Looked real.  </li>
            <li>Because of the curls, this wig can get frizzy or tangled easily, but with proper maintenaince that can be fixed.</li>
            <li>True to the vibrant red color and style in the photo.</li>
            <li>then I recommend this in particular, if that&#x27;s not what you&#x27;re looking for</li>
            <li>The wig is very pretty and vibrant red.</li>
            <li>is my second Kamo wig and my review of that one was pretty much identical.</li>
            <li>Also where the part is you can see the wig cap very clearly.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have a friz problem until about half way through wearing it, and some light product fixed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Legit the only con I can see is that the wig here is more Ariel than Black Widow</li>
            <li>It was a bit more pink then I expected but it will work.</li>
            <li>My only problem is that it comes VERY tangled.</li>
            <li>I have a bigger head and a lot of hair, so I don&#x27;t really need to tighten it much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The wig is exactly as pictured; the red color the same as Manic Panic&#x27;s infra red.</li>
            <li>I generally buy my wigs at AnimeStuffStore, but this time I needed to save some money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a more burgundy-type red wig rather than orange, in case you were confused by the photo.</li>
            <li>The curls are slightly tight, but very bouncy.</li>
            <li>Only con so far is that I needed a little hairspray/spray conditioner to keep the frizz down after the first wear.</li>

            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a fantastic buy!</li>
            <li> so I had to hot glue it on.</li>
            <li> and I hope the entire line is as fantastic as these two were!</li>
            <li> Co-workers thought that I&#x27;d dyed my real hair on Halloween!</li>
            <li> , i.e., it&#x27;s more red than ginger.</li>
            <li> The only adjustment that I had to make was to cut and style the bangs, which YouTube made pretty easy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The lacing can be easy to see, especially at the scalp.</li>
            <li> In the light the highlights of pink come about more than the red but in natural light</li>
            <li> Even fits my large head.</li>
            <li> Two large chunks were unattached to the seam</li>
            <li> A real deal for the prize I paid.</li>
            <li> I absolutely intend to use this wig again, as it worked so well.</li>
            <li> Looked real.  </li>
            <li> Because of the curls, this wig can get frizzy or tangled easily, but with proper maintenaince that can be fixed.</li>
            <li> True to the vibrant red color and style in the photo.</li>
            <li> then I recommend this in particular, if that&#x27;s not what you&#x27;re looking for</li>
            <li> The wig is very pretty and vibrant red.</li>
            <li> is my second Kamo wig and my review of that one was pretty much identical.</li>
            <li> Also where the part is you can see the wig cap very clearly.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a friz problem until about half way through wearing it, and some light product fixed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Legit the only con I can see is that the wig here is more Ariel than Black Widow</li>
            <li> It was a bit more pink then I expected but it will work.</li>
            <li> My only problem is that it comes VERY tangled.</li>
            <li> I have a bigger head and a lot of hair, so I don&#x27;t really need to tighten it much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The wig is exactly as pictured; the red color the same as Manic Panic&#x27;s infra red.</li>
            <li> I generally buy my wigs at AnimeStuffStore, but this time I needed to save some money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a more burgundy-type red wig rather than orange, in case you were confused by the photo.</li>
            <li> The curls are slightly tight, but very bouncy.</li>
            <li> Only con so far is that I needed a little hairspray/spray conditioner to keep the frizz down after the first wear.</li>
            <li> It fits a little small but that was fine with</li>
            <li> Very thin and loose fitting.</li>
            <li> It came out of the package a little tangled and it had a really loud smell to it.  </li>
            <li> It was carefully packaged and it came with a hair net; saved me the trip to the beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long.</li>
            <li> would say it&#x27;s not quite as long as the photo makes it look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really thick, helping to hide the netting, and gave me a lush and natural look (Snape needed a wig like this but in black).</li>
            <li> It is a dark red, as described in the product information, and has curls just like in the picture.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite long on me; I&#x27;m about 5&#x27;6&amp;#34; and it came to my lower back once the curls relaxed out a little bit.  </li>
            <li> Would not be realistic looking to be worn seriously.</li>
            <li> The color is very dark red and the bangs are all jacked up.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pretty disappointed that the color of the wig is much darker than the photo.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if I will use it for that since his hair is a brighter red.</li>
            <li> If you try to restyle to cover that area other parts of the wig cap become visible</li>
            <li> Lemme&#x27; break it down for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is slightly shorter/curclier than what is depicted</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted a wig to play The Avengers Black Widow.</li>
            <li> not a bright clown car red at all.</li>
            <li> It is a little curlier than in the photo.</li>
            <li> but I combed through it a few times and got it to loosen up.</li>
            <li> I feel like I have to fuss with it constantly to keep it from looking tangled and crazy.  </li>
            <li> I have ridiculously thick hair.</li>
            <li> The wig is very thick.</li>
            <li> It is a bit thin</li>
            <li> The official wig was lame and I wanted something I could style.  </li>
            <li> It can be difficult, even reading reviews, to determine the quality.</li>
            <li> I think they may have shipped me the wrong color, it was magenta, or maybe the quality was that shabby.</li>
            <li> Has a tendency to get tangled, but it wasn&#x27;t very expensive</li>
            <li> Ugly, ugly, ugly.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed.</li>

            <li> The color is true to picture. It is slightly shorter/curclier than what is depicted but I combed through it a few times and got it to loosen up. Using it for my Melisandre costume and it looks so great I kind of just want to wear it out :p</li>
            <li> Love this, a little darker then the picture but still beautiful</li>
            <li> The wig fit well and looked great. Well worth the price. The styling made the wig look even better. I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> my first wig and it is spectacular in looks, quality and heightening my experience. it arrived on time and i would purchase this brand from 5this retailer again...i truly love it! it makes me feel more feminine while wearing it! Thank you Kamo Direct, and Amazon for a delightful shopping experience.</li>
            <li> Actually a really nice quality, comes in a hairnet for safe keeping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice, the color is exactly what i was looking for!&lt;br /&gt;I put it on and it fit really nicely, as well as having enough length to accomodate the bit of styling i&#x27;ll have to do for the cosplay I bought it for!</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig to jazz up some sexy lingerie that I was planning on wowing my husband with, and boy did I get a reaction!  He loved it!  That&#x27;s the only reason I gave it 5 stars. I already wear wigs on a regular basis, but this one needed A Lot of manipulating.  It came out of the package a little tangled and it had a really loud smell to it.  For the price and the fun it brought to me, I guess I shouldn&#x27;t complain.  I would order it again in a different color.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my Halloween costume</li>
            <li> Being a cosplayer I own a good 15 wigs, this wig is a good quality but I&#x27;m pretty disappointed that the color of the wig is much darker than the photo. I needed this for a female Sasori from naruto shippuden but I&#x27;m not sure if I will use it for that since his hair is a brighter red. If you&#x27;re looking for a maroon/burgundy wavy wig then I recommend this in particular, if that&#x27;s not what you&#x27;re looking for I suggest you keep looking.</li>
            <li> perfect for Poison Ivy cos play</li>
            <li> Great wig for such a low price! Looks very nice, feels comfortable, and the curls are lovely. Love it!</li>
            <li> The color and style was perfect for my Black Widow costume and of good quality too. People thought I had dyed my hair red.  A real deal for the prize I paid. It was carefully packaged and it came with a hair net; saved me the trip to the beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made, not possible to pass as real hair, perfect for cosplay but not everyday wear</li>
            <li> I used this wig to cosplay Ariel this last weekend at A-Kon, it was really fun and worked great! I was a total hit and the wig worked perfectly. I absolutely intend to use this wig again, as it worked so well. I will be trimming bangs onto it in the future, to make it more managable, but I had a great time.</li>
            <li> Amazing red wig. Both in color and in fit. Wore for a Poison Ivy costume, and won second place!</li>
            <li> Very pretty. Soft but tangles easily. The red is a bit darker than pictured.</li>
            <li> Amazing and beautiful!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted a wig to play The Avengers Black Widow. The official wig was lame and I wanted something I could style.  I was super happy with the magenta color- not a bright clown car red at all. While I knew nothing about styling a wig, Youtube educated me in about an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;This wig DOES style with a curling iron a low setting and LOTS of hair spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to cut, which I needed to in order for it to match the character.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a synthetic wig to be both nice color AND able to use a curling iron makes this a GOOD PURCHASE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lacing can be easy to see, especially at the scalp. It fits a little small but that was fine with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, YES I like this wig as a Cosplay accessory.</li>
            <li> I love the quality of this wig! In the light the highlights of pink come about more than the red but in natural light it&#x27;s flawless and natural looking!!! I love this product!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my cosplay costume!</li>
            <li> The bangs needed trimmed.  The color is beautiful and the red is very much like in the photo.  It does tangle easily, but a wig comb get those right out without much difficulty.  The price was right too.</li>
            <li> It was a bit more pink then I expected but it will work. It&#x27;s a pretty color. Since it&#x27;s for a costume it will do what it&#x27;s intended to do.</li>
            <li> Loved it. Everyone thought it was real!</li>
            <li> Wow great wig for the money. Even fits my large head.</li>
            <li> Thie wig actually looks nothing like the photo. Also where the part is you can see the wig cap very clearly. If you try to restyle to cover that area other parts of the wig cap become visible</li>
            <li> The wig is very pretty and vibrant red. I could kind of maneuver the hair around to suit my style and the curls are a nice touch. I wish I could give more stars but this wig is pretty short. If it was a blonde wig I would look like Goldie-locks. I did not anticipate on paying for a wig that was so short. It&#x27;s above my collar bone. Not to happy about that.</li>
            <li> This wig is beautiful and perfect! It is a dark red, as described in the product information, and has curls just like in the picture. I love the length and how realistic it looks if you put it on correctly. I got it for a Jessica Rabbit costume and I was not disappointed!</li>
            <li> Great color and exactly as it looked in the photos.  It&#x27;s quite long on me; I&#x27;m about 5&#x27;6&amp;#34; and it came to my lower back once the curls relaxed out a little bit.  The only adjustment that I had to make was to cut and style the bangs, which YouTube made pretty easy.</li>
            <li> The wine color looks much more purple in person than it does online.</li>
            <li> I used to not buy wigs because they are always too big for my head. This one fits PERFECT(d/t adjustable back!  NICE color, nice fit:)</li>
            <li> Beautiful wig! Great buy!</li>
            <li> Arrived looking just as nice as it&#x27;s pictured here. My wife looked amazing wearing it.</li>
            <li> Amazing. Fit perfectly. Exactly the color I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Color was not at all as advertised. Very thin and loose fitting.</li>
            <li> Ugly, ugly, ugly. Avoid.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this wig for my Ivy cosplay. It can be difficult, even reading reviews, to determine the quality. I generally buy my wigs at AnimeStuffStore, but this time I needed to save some money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading some reviews, I decided I would give it a shot.  It arrived very quickly in the mail. I opened it up and it was very nicely packaged and not at all tangled. In taking it out, I noticed it was truly a deep, wine-red color (I was terrified it might end up being fire engine red).  The curls are slightly tight, but very bouncy. The wig is very thick. When I tried it on in very bright light, it was slightly shiny, but nothing that can&#x27;t be fixed. In normal, soft light, it is the perfect color. I gave it four stars only because in bright light it is a lot more red and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this was a surprisingly great purchase and I would highly recommend the wine-red.</li>
            <li> Looks like the photo.</li>
            <li> Beautiful burgundy color, pretty curls and realistic hair. There is one kink in the big front curl, but I think I can work it out. Overall it&#x27;s a fantastic buy!</li>
            <li> I think they may have shipped me the wrong color, it was magenta, or maybe the quality was that shabby. I needed it for a costume party and couldn&#x27;t return it in time, otherwise I would have. Two large chunks were unattached to the seam so I had to hot glue it on. I was really disappointed.</li>
            <li> This wig is amaaaaazing. True to the vibrant red color and style in the photo. I have only used it once on a client but there was almost NO shedding or tangling and it was not overly shiny. For a synthetic, this wig is absolutely wonderful and I would highly recommend any Kamo wig. The packaging is simply fabulous and you can tell that so much care was put into making sure it was going to arrive in the condition that which it was shipped.&lt;br /&gt;This is my second Kamo wig and my review of that one was pretty much identical. They are really fabulous wigs and I hope the entire line is as fantastic as these two were!</li>
            <li> Very Nice, easy to style and brush out</li>
            <li> I literally JUST received this and already asking for a review! It took forever to get here. The color is very dark red and the bangs are all jacked up. It will do for Halloween but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> This wig is a really great quality for the price - true to color and very durable so far. I&#x27;m absolutely in love with it. It shipped surprisingly quickly, too. Only con so far is that I needed a little hairspray/spray conditioner to keep the frizz down after the first wear.</li>
            <li> Awesome quality at such a great price! I didn&#x27;t expect much, but it&#x27;s awesome. Co-workers thought that I&#x27;d dyed my real hair on Halloween!</li>
            <li> Lemme&#x27; break it down for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- GORGEOUS wig. Came with perfectly styled curls and bangs. I didn&#x27;t have a friz problem until about half way through wearing it, and some light product fixed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I have ridiculously thick hair. Like, Galadriel ain&#x27;t got nothin&#x27; on me. So wigs tend to stretch a bit more and show their netting when I put them on. This one didn&#x27;t (BOOYAH). It&#x27;s really thick, helping to hide the netting, and gave me a lush and natural look (Snape needed a wig like this but in black). The only problem with the net showing through was on the side, and pinning the hair in place solved the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s long. Yay! It came to my waist (5&#x27;6 slender woman).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Got here SUPER quickly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Legit the only con I can see is that the wig here is more Ariel than Black Widow, i.e., it&#x27;s more red than ginger. Not that big of an issue with me, but just so people know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUUUUUY THE PRECIOUS!</li>
            <li> Really cool wig. Has a tendency to get tangled, but it wasn&#x27;t very expensive so what can I expect?</li>
            <li> Perfect for my lite mermaid costume for this coming Halloween! Ordered August 5th, was delivered August 9th just as the delivery estimate said.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful but it&#x27;s a darker red than on the picture, it&#x27;s great for costumes and comicon but not for everyday use because it&#x27;s very noticeable that it is a wig.</li>
            <li> Everyone thought I was a girl!</li>
            <li> one of the best hair wigs i have ever bought, so many compliments, i want another just to have in my closet, for this price u can not ignore!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this wig to use for an Ariel cosplay, because I&#x27;m a kids&#x27; party entertainer. It fits perfectly- snug without being too small for my head. If you have a smaller head, there are hooks in the back for you to adjust it. The color look just like the picture. It&#x27;s a bit longer than it looks in the picture, but that worked out fine for me. It also came in just 3 days after I ordered it, so it&#x27;s great if you need a wig on short notice. My only problem is that it comes VERY tangled. I&#x27;m sure it can be fixed with some wig conditioner though. It&#x27;s shiny, but doesn&#x27;t look plastic-y, which is good. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this wig!</li>
            <li> Made a great Halloween costume accessory.</li>
            <li> Loved this wig.  Looked real.  Couldn&#x27;t have been happier with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a more burgundy-type red wig rather than orange, in case you were confused by the photo. It fits very well and the few times I&#x27;ve worn it, I haven&#x27;t had any issues with my hair or anything showing through it. It has a strap underneath it to tighten it a bit if you need. I have a bigger head and a lot of hair, so I don&#x27;t really need to tighten it much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say it&#x27;s not quite as long as the photo makes it look. It goes to the bottom of my shoulder blades.</li>
            <li> We got this for a poison ivy cos-play. It is a bit thin so i would not use it for daily wear but it did the job. Since I did not know if it was curling iron safe, it was a bit of a bear to style to keep it out of one&#x27;s face. The bangs need to be trimmed so you can see.</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved this wig! It was amazing for my poison ivy costume :)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t look like the pic when I put it on but it was ok thanks :)</li>
            <li> This wig is nothing astounding but OK for the cheap price.  The color is pretty but it tangles easily and has issues with static.  I feel like I have to fuss with it constantly to keep it from looking tangled and crazy.  It is a little curlier than in the photo.</li>
            <li> It was for a costume and it was perfect. Would not be realistic looking to be worn seriously.</li>
            <li> Used for an Ariel &amp;#34;Kiss the girl&amp;#34; costume. Worked perfectly, beautiful wig and curls! Item arrived very quickly!</li>
            <li> This wig is one of the best I own. The wig is exactly as pictured; the red color the same as Manic Panic&#x27;s infra red. Because of the curls, this wig can get frizzy or tangled easily, but with proper maintenaince that can be fixed. I would definelty buy it again :)</li>
            <li> Very good quality for little price.</li>
            <li> This was perfect for my Jessica Rabbit costume! It looked great. Nice quality wig.</li>
