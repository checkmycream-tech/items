            <li>This one lays light on the skin and keeps it fragrance.</li>
            <li>It smells good but doesnt even last 2 minutes</li>
            <li>people tell me how great a smile, and ask what it is That I&#x27;m wearing, I love to tell them it is cheap body spray, not even from Victoria&#x27;s Secret, but from CVS</li>
            <li>so if your not into that kind of scent then it definitely won&#x27;t be for u.</li>

            <li>this one smells exactly the same!!</li>
            <li>It is not overpowering by any means but has enough lasting effects to last most of the day.</li>
            <li>This girl was a checker at one of the stores we frequently shop at.</li>
            <li>She said that she hasn&#x27;t smelled that scent since she was 10 years old.</li>
            <li>She basically said it&#x27;s a scent for young girls and not for a mature woman like myself</li>
            <li>They may come in glass bottles and cost three times as much, but they all end up in the back of the cabint..</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s sweet, playful and non-offensive for casual and office wear</li>
            <li> It smells like you just ate cotton candy and happened to get it on your neck, wrists, and other pulse points.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> She repeated herself over &amp; over and never smiled so I soon realized she was not complimenting me.</li>
            <li> So subtle...</li>
            <li> Ever since Victoria&#x27;s Secret discontinued its Candy Baby scent, I have tried everything.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing the sand for about a decade and will be very sad if they stop making it… At least once or twice a week</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to wear it out of the house</li>

            <li> Yummm smells sooo good</li>
            <li> Smells soooo good! Very sweet smelling</li>
            <li> This stuff smells SOOOO good! It also blends with my body chemistry and seems to last all day. I love it! It smells just like my childhood &amp; carnival/fair memories that came to my town. So subtle...So wonderful! If anyone else doesn&#x27;t like it, why, they&#x27;re positively UN-AMERICAN! Lol!</li>
            <li> i love the scent and i received it super fast</li>
            <li> It smells good but doesnt even last 2 minutes</li>
            <li> I loooove it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had the Juicebar Cotton Candy perfume and it was discontinued... this one smells exactly the same!!</li>
            <li> I love this body spray, the scent lasts a long time and I get comments when I walk by, who smells good?! It is very sweet so if your not into that kind of scent then it definitely won&#x27;t be for u.</li>
            <li> This is the only scent that I can wear without getting a headache or be bothered by the smell all day. I LOVE it! It is a sweet candy smell and people think you have been in the kitchen making candy! It is not overpowering by any means but has enough lasting effects to last most of the day.</li>
            <li> Just what I hoped for and expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s sweet, playful and non-offensive for casual and office wear&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t last for more than a couple hours so that&#x27;s the reason for the four stars</li>
            <li> Like someone robbed the cotton candy man and gave it to you. Awesome sweet scent.</li>
            <li> This is one of my all time favorite scents. It&#x27;s hard to find in stores so I stock up on it whenever I find it somewhere. Smells just like Cotton Candy and when I&#x27;m wearing it I get compliments everywhere I go (mostly from adult women). I did have one negative comment on it recently from a young 20-something girl. This girl was a checker at one of the stores we frequently shop at. She asked if I was wearing a cotton candy scent and I said yes. She said that she hasn&#x27;t smelled that scent since she was 10 years old. She repeated herself over &amp; over and never smiled so I soon realized she was not complimenting me. She basically said it&#x27;s a scent for young girls and not for a mature woman like myself and my feelings got hurt. I&#x27;m afraid to wear it out of the house now so I just wear it at home...sniff.</li>
            <li> I love this body spray.</li>
            <li> If you love cotton candy, Youll love the smell of this smell good!</li>
