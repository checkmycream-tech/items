            <li>One wonderful thing about this wax is that it does get all the hair off where the wax is applied, but bear in mind it pulls at the skin too!   </li>

            <li>this wax works great.</li>
            <li>Baby oil works great.</li>
            <li>Baby oil works great.</li>
            <li>I love this wax already!!</li>
            <li>Very, very effective.</li>
            <li>And also very effective.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since most reviewers are very happy with this product i tend to think i don&#x27;t know what i&#x27;m doing rather</li>
            <li>None.. If you are going to try this wax, have the oil to remove it handy!</li>
            <li>I loved it.</li>
            <li>It is a good item but needs a lot of patience while using.</li>
            <li>This one is just as good as the others.</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>It a really good quality wax, and melts well in the gigi wax warmer.</li>
            <li>Looked good but didn&#x27;t work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It requires a good 20 minutes to heat up in the warmer.</li>
            <li>It takes a good 60 seconds before I can even feel if the wax is not tacky anymore.</li>
            <li>Good luck and happy money savings :)</li>
            <li>Good luck and happy money savings :)</li>
            <li>because I do wax almost every month.&lt;br /&gt;Super happy :-)</li>
            <li>am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>My best suggestion, if you are doing a brazilian, do 2 squares on your leg first.</li>
            <li>The first order I got was great!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love the kit and the wax!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I purchased it!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I purchased this refill because it is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>amazingly well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have no clue how this got so many good reviews.</li>
            <li>This one may be good for some but others work on me better.</li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;ve been using this wax on my own for about two years.</li>
            <li>Warm it to the viscosity of honey.</li>
            <li>What more can I say then buy it if your looking for good wax, this can is made for the gigi wax warmer</li>
            <li>So I took the wax out of the warmer &amp; put my honee wax to warm up as I did my arm pits.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Clean up on your heating unit or counter top/floor is best handled by pointing your blow dryer at the spot on high heat, melting the wax and wiping it up with a paper towel.</li>
            <li>I like this wax, no scent, easy to use, good grip.</li>
            <li>It gets much quicker as you get more experienced!</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s by far the best wax I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I have been getting professionally waxed at the salon for a year now, and doing it myself was the best decision ever.</li>
            <li>As with almost all professional products, some skill is needed for the best results.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s very important.</li>
            <li>Very very important.</li>
            <li>I have a wax warmer and the wax heats quickly to a nice consistency that is easy to work with.  </li>
            <li>but this wax has a strong hold and gets the job done effectively.</li>
            <li>excly like in picture, fast shipping, good quality, good price, I am happy with this product, very practic this product, easy to use.</li>
            <li>Cleans better than the salon for pennies.</li>
            <li>that just shows how much I love this product.</li>
            <li>i love this wax...</li>
            <li>Saving me money at the salon for sure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve waxed many times before</li>
            <li>I feel so smooth!</li>
            <li>I was used to getting waxed my whole body and was in great difficulty while i moved here because in asia, we just call a woman at home</li>
            <li>but I am glad it does what it says.</li>
            <li>but hygeine matters the most.</li>
            <li>There is no need to buy strips or run out and have to run to the store or order more.</li>
            <li>It seems to take the hair off better.</li>
            <li>Make sure you get a warmer and spatulas too, or else you will be S.O.L.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>It works SO much better than the strips, it removes hair from the root and not from the surface of the skin.</li>
            <li>I honestly love it, could not wait to get home and use it.</li>
            <li>I will get more,</li>
            <li>(well, yank off to be more precise!)</li>
            <li>I have bought 3 tubs and will continue to use unless someone says there is something better out there.</li>
            <li>Touch the top of the wax.</li>
            <li>This is the most pain-free type wax I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I kept myself in a self-indued semi-coma, sleeping the better part of 2 days with the help of Benadryl.</li>
            <li>I kept myself in a self-indued semi-coma, sleeping the better part of 2 days with the help of Benadryl.</li>
            <li>that just shows how much I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I loved it so much that I&#x27;m contemplating alternating between my own sugaring wax and this product.</li>
            <li>Much better than strips &amp; sugar wax.</li>
            <li>1/4 is MORE than</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still getting the hang of it, but I&#x27;m getting better and better.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to use this wax every where with out issue.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product and it really helps removing unwanted hair.</li>
            <li>I think I will order some more when I get the chance.</li>
            <li>prefer more flexible (elastic) wax which doesn&#x27;t break when you pull it off.</li>
            <li>Love this wax.  </li>
            <li>and I have tried many.</li>
            <li>It is okay</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many types/brands of wax over the years and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I was able to go over my skin again &amp; again w/ this wax</li>
            <li>Love the Gigi brand.</li>
            <li>Twist your applicator around and around to make sure to keep the wax on your applicator and not get those strings flying everywhere.</li>
            <li>The baby powder will make sure the wax adheres to the hair and not your skin.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>I strongly suggest to anyone using this product to prep the skin with oil, as it sticks to the skin very easily.  </li>
            <li>but i like that it doesn&#x27;t stick to the skin and hence very effective and gentle for the face.</li>
            <li>I tried many types and brands of waxes in my quest for easy home waxing.</li>
            <li>Clean up on skin is best left to the Gigi Wax remover lotion (trust me,</li>
            <li>Simply amazing, my guy is gonna LOVE the results ;)</li>
            <li>Works well, and gets out most of the hairs (I use it for my arms), I just use the cheap popsicle sticks you can buy around a 100 per box.</li>
            <li>The wax does not require muslin strips, which is nice, economically speaking.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Still trying to learn to wax right!!  </li>
            <li>Great price, almost painless, easy to use, and not messy at all</li>
            <li>Apply a good decent coat, let it sit in your skin a good 10 minutes, then jump in the shower and it comes off very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Apply a good decent coat, let it sit in your skin a good 10 minutes, then jump in the shower and it comes off very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Applied the oil very lightly ( if you apply too much the wax won&#x27;t stick) and then applied the wax in a nice medium coat.</li>
            <li>You do not use the cloth strips to remove the wax and it removes easily from the skin- something compared to candle wax after cooling.</li>
            <li>and it easily comes up without stretching like caramel or chipping.</li>
            <li>It takes almost all the hairs from the area and is really easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy for me to apply on my bikini area (and then some) and remove.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a strong wax</li>
            <li>Perfect in this economy, you get more waxes for less money!</li>
            <li>Smells fine, and is easy to remove after it dries.</li>
            <li>This is not as effective as hot wax</li>
            <li>I used the space saver warmer and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li>I am not a pro and everything worked fine.</li>
            <li>Second, make very sure that you have the oil to remove the wax handy.</li>
            <li>I use it with muslin strips and its easy almost pain free waxing.</li>
            <li>My armpits are mostly flaring around the edges -- where the hair was thickest and my skin the wrinkliest was luckily spared.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly, and gets the job done!</li>
            <li>This wax works great for both fine and coarse hair.</li>
            <li>It is slimy and greasy and a huge pain to work with.</li>
            <li>I grabs the hair and comed out easy and clean.</li>
            <li>The cheap fix to this is to use baby powder.</li>
            <li>this is great, especially when used with the warming kit that you can also get on amazon.</li>
            <li>and/or dermatologist as soon as I can get someone to fit me in.</li>
            <li>and/or dermatologist as soon as I can get someone to fit me in.</li>
            <li>For tender areas, I suggest a gin &amp; tonic 10 minutes before, plus Ambosol as a numbing agent- spread lightly.  </li>
            <li>Then I ended up scraping the rest off in the shower with a cheap razor.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re worried about the pain, the pre-epilation oil helps a great deal, you should be able to find a skin-numbing serum somewhere on this site, and a stiff drink always helps, too :)</li>
            <li>satisfied, this is exciting and fun!</li>
            <li>says ALOT about how much I believe in this wax!!!</li>
            <li>I tried this first on my arms, so I can get an idea of how to do it, and so far my arms look great</li>
            <li>The wax is very strong and you really do get it ALL off.</li>
            <li>Used this wax for years, best wax out there hands down!!</li>
            <li>sure you test the wax temp on your (oiled) wrist first.</li>
            <li>GiGi offers a nice array for all different skill levels, their microwave product a great.</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t realize you couldn&#x27;t put this in the microwave before I bought it, and I don&#x27;t have a warmer, so I placed a small pot of water on the stove, on the medium setting, and set the wax container inside and the wax melted perfectly after 3-5 min and stayed creamy until I was finished with it.</li>
            <li>I originally tried this product because I bought the gigi waxing kit which included this.</li>
            <li>I was realy excited when I ordered it but as soon as I applied it, the nightmare begun.</li>
            <li>bought the first tin with the Gigi warmer kit; I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It is so sticky that you need rubbing alcohol to clean your hands.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember seeing that you have to have a special warmer to use this thing.  </li>
            <li>Since I don&#x27;t have a special warmer, I put water in a pan on the stove and placed the pot of wax in that</li>
            <li>If you get a little wax on the floor of your bathroom (do your best to cover floor first, but</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s very happy with the quality of the hard wax, even though you have to buy the optional cloth strips separately.</li>
            <li>This wax was the best of the hard wax</li>
            <li>Clean up on this wax is pretty easy.</li>
            <li>Clean up on this wax is pretty easy.</li>
            <li>I am used to the pain, so good luck to those of you who are just starting out.</li>
            <li>I applied hydrocortisone to all irritated areas 4 times a day (sometimes more, if it was really itchy.)</li>
            <li>I applied hydrocortisone to all irritated areas 4 times a day (sometimes more, if it was really itchy.)</li>
            <li>(which I recommend if you&#x27;re starting out and need everything all at once for a good price)</li>
            <li>The wax goes on easy, dries fast, and pulls off amazingly smooth.  </li>
            <li>When it is completely hot, it is easy to put on.</li>
            <li>All it takes is a steady hand and patience. :)</li>
            <li>Melts quickly and removes all hair.</li>
            <li>After it&#x27;s cooled, flick an end and pull it off quickly.</li>
            <li>The strips make it much easier, just make sure to put the strips on right away</li>
            <li>Easy pizzy great hard wax</li>
            <li>This wax gets almost all on the first go, and if I need to do over a section I can, without fear of it ripping my skin off too!</li>
            <li>/&gt;For someone like me, I found the Gigi General Purpose Honee Wax is far more effective and user-friendly.</li>
            <li>Because I&#x27;m cheap and really wanted to find a use before tossing it.</li>
            <li>I was amazed how much hair came off leaving my skin feeling baby smooth.</li>
            <li>It took a day or so to calm.    </li>
            <li>I followed all the great reviews on here from everyday people</li>
            <li>only good thing about this wax is that while pulling the layer, it doesn&#x27;t hurt much.</li>
            <li>I did a much better job than any professional has done, and I even waxed one of my friends today, too.  </li>
            <li>I totally agree with Angela&#x27;s suggestions to always use the oil, let the wax on no longer than 20 secs, and most importantly - USE MUSLIM STRIPS.  </li>
            <li>I tried everything and the wax remover is worth the $$).&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works far better on my skin then any pre-wax oil.</li>
            <li>Received product fairly quickly, and used it today for the first time.  </li>
            <li>it does the job you looking for, along the strips, also from GIGI, and the small spatula, the perfect combination so far.</li>
            <li>but literally, pulling band aids hurt more than waxing with this wax and in general.</li>
            <li>I warm up the wax on high and then keep it just warm enough by switching between medium and low while using it.</li>
            <li>I tried SEVERAL times as so many other reviewers loved it</li>
            <li>You will know the wax is ready when you flick up at it quick with your finger</li>
            <li>Easy and not messy.</li>
            <li>This product is such a money saver compared to paying high prices for a salon wax and you tend to get better results!</li>
            <li>and she does the job in a very reasonable amount of money just like $10 for everything.</li>
            <li>Buy it with the set that has the lotion and spatulas (this is very much required because if u use ur knife...</li>
            <li>I like this one very much.</li>
            <li>Set it on High for 20 minutes if it&#x27;s a full can.</li>
            <li>Of course the wax is sticky but it works perfectly and a little planing up front goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to work with (so long as you have the proper heater), and I love not having to deal with stickiness and strips!  </li>
            <li>This is definitely beauty on a budget :)</li>
            <li>Too hot will burn the skin and leave it sore.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(Funny but true!)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love using this on coarse hairs.</li>
            <li>Also, you should be aware that the container is metal.</li>
            <li>Tried this first on my legs - it was a nightmare.</li>
            <li>This was my first time dong it.</li>
            <li>Be sure to use just enough so that it soaks into the skin, but doesn&#x27;t prevent the wax from grabbing onto your hair.</li>
            <li>The hardest part is getting up the courage to rip off the first piece of wax.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for anyone interested in waxing at home.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well for that.  </li>
            <li>It takes off most of the hair and any hair left pulls out easiy with tweezers.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not expensive at all to go to a salon for waxing.</li>
            <li>However after the first try I just tossed the wax away.</li>
            <li>This product works very well with the warmer!</li>
            <li>will definitely be ordering some more soon.</li>
            <li>Maybe, be a bit smarter than me and test it out on your leg or something first until you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>So much easier than the strips!</li>
            <li>The first time, it took me 3-4 hours, yikes.</li>
            <li>I am German-Irish; when it comes to the amount of hair on my legs and \\&quot;other\\&quot; body parts, I&#x27;m definitely more German, so I initially skipped doing any research and purchased the Hard Wax, assuming it would be best for someone with a lot of hair (and not as course as I thought).</li>
            <li>you must pull fast, very fast).</li>
            <li>Dosn&#x27;t take as long&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>wax removes hair pretty well, and does not hurt much, if done correctly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You can use it pretty much anywhere.</li>
            <li>Then tapped it on the lower end to make sure it was dry and picked it up.</li>
            <li>I typically create my own sugaring wax but this time around I ran out and needed a wax asap.</li>
            <li>really wanted to like this wax -- in fact, I liked it a lot the first few hours I got it and used it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this product 5 stars even though it is SUPER messy, maybe I just need more practice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all different kinds of wax and the GIGI Hard Wax is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Even though it felt like my skin was getting ripped off while I was doing it, probably incorrectly, my skin remained completely in tact and completely pain free once the hair was removed.</li>
            <li>Straight to the trash bin!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This wax works really well.  </li>
            <li>It works on legs also, but it really does the job with the bikini line and armpits.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very waxy and sticky</li>
            <li>(I also dropped the whole pot of wax as I was transporting it from the stove</li>
            <li>So, i WAS VERY WORRIED WHEN I CAME HERE..</li>
            <li>then I had some free time and thought lets try it out in my private part.</li>
            <li>I really like it that i can do it myseld.</li>
            <li>My skin felt way better then when I used the pink one.</li>
            <li>I find this much easier to use than the waxing with the strips.</li>
            <li>it works really well, but there is some sticky residue, so you should get the removal stuff with it.</li>
            <li>I never must have given much thought to what I was about to do - a self-brazilian wax-</li>
            <li>Really.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li>the whole can to be melted to wax any area anyways.</li>
            <li>also really like that I can turn my melting pot off and the wax can still be used for quite some time afterwards.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It took forever to harden and when it did, it didn&#x27;t come off much at all.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It heats up in about 15 minutes and is ready to go.  </li>
            <li>Keep twisting your applicator until you get it very close to the area you want to wax.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>I was honestly scared to ever wax again even though I used to wax some a few years ago.</li>
            <li>have trouble waxing under my arms and find this to be effective.</li>
            <li>Also this wax is good for stubborn or thick hairs.  </li>
            <li>It took a few tries to get the consistency right and to know when to pull but after that it&#x27;s been great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;PS - It was pretty effective in pulling out the hair (at least as effective as the sugar kind), but with all this trouble, I&#x27;m going to go back to the sugar next time.</li>
            <li>Make sure to exfoliate first then apply lightly pre wax oil or a little olive oil to the area you are waxing so the wax doesn&#x27;t stick to your skin, only the hair.</li>
            <li>After waxing be sure to use aloe vera gel or other cooling gel to reduce redness.</li>
            <li>It takes a minute or so to dry on the skin, but is easy to pull off</li>
            <li>The only brand i&#x27;ve had consistent success with in the pubic area, is this one.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still sticky, just push the wax back down and give it a couple of good pats.</li>
            <li>x back down and give it a couple of good pats.</li>
            <li>Any wax left over can be easily rubbed off with oil and a soft cloth.</li>
            <li>I am not new to waxing, but have always used Gigi&#x27;s soft waxes, for, well, ALMOST everywhere, the all purpose honee being my favorite.</li>
            <li>Even after getting the proper technique figured out, I couldn&#x27;t help but think that the Hard Wax is either better suited for those with courser hair or those with more waxing experience than me.</li>
            <li>I immediately covered the with a muslin cloth ( you can also use an old pillow case cut in strips) patted a few times and pulled in the opposite direction of hair growth - and it worked great.</li>
            <li>regular baby oil does WONDERS in removing the excess wax, but the cool thing about it is once the wax hardens, you can kinda just roll it off the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You wait for the wax to congeal and flick it with your finger to make sure it&#x27;s solid enough to pull off, and then pull off.</li>
            <li>but one hour later I was completely hair free.</li>
            <li>i decided that this particular wax is not for me.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and very course hair with sometimes 2-3 hair follicles growing together.</li>
            <li>It hurts only a little more than the salon, but only because you have to apply and yank off so many times.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this wax and the Gigi warmer.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I have high pain tolerance or something</li>
            <li>I have a high pain-tolerance, so waxing doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>Great product, a little messy but certainly works.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I barely felt the hair being taken off!</li>
            <li>It hardens in just a few quick minutes and comes off in one quick peel once you have mastered the technique.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supposed to be the hard kind that doesn&#x27;t require strips.</li>
            <li>I chose this wax just because it was hard and usually that&#x27;s the best type of wax to use.</li>
            <li>I had to end up using one of my more round butter knifes to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The wax that I spilled dried fast and was easy to pick up.  </li>
            <li>Getting the temp just right is key.</li>
            <li>I initially had it on high, but the wax gets just a liiiiiittle bit too hot for comfort.</li>
            <li>Since i was using it for the first time, i had a rough time removing the wax from my body as i wasnt aware of the thickness of the wax to be required to be pulled.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, so I need something gentle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s actually on my skin, it sticks on the skin very much, not just on the hairs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s the exact same product that I was already using.</li>
            <li>But definitely use oil first, apply that anywhere the wax is going to go, and even around the areas the wax is going to go.</li>
            <li>I bought this refill for a kit I bought for my significant other.</li>
            <li>This product works well for people with sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>no need to be a professional to do it!</li>
            <li>The only problem is if you get it too hot</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the best hard wax around, but it really does get the job done, although I feel that other waxes stick less to the skin after you remove it.</li>
            <li>I always wax the upper bikini area with no problems, but decided to try this one for the lower part since it has so many positive reviews (the wax..not my lower parts:)&lt;br /&gt;First, please know how to use hard, stripless wax.</li>
            <li>I prefer the all purpose body hard wax much better.</li>
            <li>I love Gigi Honee Wax, so I figured I&#x27;d give the hard wax a try.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine a more ineffective hard wax.</li>
            <li>The hard wax is definitely better than its counter part.</li>
            <li>Ok so I used the hard wax for the 1st time today.</li>
            <li>After using Sally Hansen Extra Strength Brazilian wax for years i found this wax to be kind of hard to use.</li>
            <li>The results after using are amazing and the wax lasts approximately 4-6 weeks.</li>
            <li>The product description was not overly clear to me as to whether I needed strips with this item or not, but it turns out that I did not.</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t do full-on brazilian at home because I&#x27;m a coward, but a regular bikini wax is very doable.</li>
            <li>I would also recommend getting the numbing spray for those really sensitive spots.</li>
            <li>You will see the difference in color and it will also allow you to do a trial run as far as thickness and technique.</li>
            <li>Where the wax is applied, all hairs are completely removed.</li>
            <li>I still had an inordinate amount of hair left (too much to tweeze it all)and 4 areas with bruised-looking burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I warmed it in the warmer and it took me nearly 15-20 mins to start melting.</li>
            <li>TIME Thoughto do it completely</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this wax doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>However, if you have sensitive skin, you will have to think about it or oil your skin sufficiently before waxing.</li>
            <li>I tried to at least use this stuff up waxing my own legs, and it was the most frustrating experience.</li>
            <li>and when it dries out completely it gets brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now, I have used Gigi microwave stripless wax, and it is nowhere near as sticky as this one.</li>
            <li>When I go to a professional salon, they use this wax for the bikini area.</li>
            <li>Purchased as an add-on to the professional kit.</li>
            <li>Make sure you apply in thick amounts.</li>
            <li>Keep them small and it will be easy to control.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li>no mess..</li>
            <li>Even the color  of the wax is different, it was light green before, this new Gigi is yellowish.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought that I should wait for all my hair to come back since i used the pre wax strips on stores such as walmart and target.</li>
            <li>good thing about hard wax is that it hurts MUCH MUCH less than sugar sticky type wax with strips.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t hurt half as much as at the salon, no skin pulled, done very thorough by myself.  </li>
            <li>I have a few suggestions: always use the oil, do not let the wax dry for too long (20 secs is good enough), and use muslin strips.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually never waxed myself, so this was probably a lot more painful that it would have been if I had more experience.</li>
            <li>Be careful and trim hair first.</li>
            <li>it sets really hard, very quickly</li>
            <li>The video I felt helped greatly even though maybe a little outdated.</li>
            <li>wait until it gets firm and then pull QUICKLY.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t pull off any of your skin and gets the hair right down to the follicle without ripping it at the skin like strip-waxing does.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s pretty self</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m new to waxing and ended up wasting it from improper technique, will buy more when I&#x27;m not too afraid to try waxing again, didn&#x27;t hurt as much as I thought</li>
            <li>It took me only 1/2 hour to do a full brazilian wax and the process was much less painful than what I experienced in the salon.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad that I made the purchase, it was both effective and (for me) less painful than standard (soft) waxing.</li>
            <li>Less likely to cause wax burn and grips the hair better than soft wax, so there are less ingrown hair problems as well.</li>
            <li>my skin is sensitive to regular wax  </li>
            <li>I repeated numerous times thinking it was the way I was applying and time setting, but each time left my legs red and without much hair being pulled off.</li>
            <li>can isn&#x27;t enough to do my legs so to save time &amp; money I used the honee (soft) wax.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>This hard wax is easy to use and relatively low pain.  </li>
            <li>Hot wax is must faster and less pain.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sooooo hard to clean up.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting it to be just as hurtful as other wax, but it actually didn&#x27;t really hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not completely brittle, but I find when it&#x27;s soft</li>
            <li>I rarely do reviews because I&#x27;m lazy, so to say I took my time out to write this review</li>
            <li>Then apply it about as thick as a banana skin and let it cool.</li>
            <li>I used this wax to wax my armpits, let the hair grow out a few centimeters and pulled the very few, fine hairs out with a tweezer!</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying hard wax on myself and I was quite surprised.</li>
            <li>First time is a bit painful but after that it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re not supposed to let it dry completely.</li>
            <li>A lot less messier and much easier.</li>
            <li>The wax dries off fast while applying, so could do it in small patches which took a lot of time to complete.</li>
            <li>My first experience with at-home waxing was with Gigi Brazilian Body Hard Wax, and it nearly made it my last.</li>
            <li>Because I had such a severe reaction to the main ingredient in the wax, which GiGi neglects to include in their extensive list of other warnings, I wanted to post my review here as well.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve applied this thinly with strips and it&#x27;s been fine.</li>
            <li>If the wax dries too much it will break off in little pieces and be torture.</li>
            <li>Consistanty  should be like honey, if its runny turn down the heat setting and let wax cool a little</li>

            <li> Very, very effective.</li>
            <li> And also very effective.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since most reviewers are very happy with this product i tend to think i don&#x27;t know what i&#x27;m doing rather</li>
            <li> None.. If you are going to try this wax, have the oil to remove it handy!</li>
            <li> I loved it.</li>
            <li> It is a good item but needs a lot of patience while using.</li>
            <li> This one is just as good as the others.</li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> It a really good quality wax, and melts well in the gigi wax warmer.</li>
            <li> Looked good but didn&#x27;t work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It requires a good 20 minutes to heat up in the warmer.</li>
            <li> It takes a good 60 seconds before I can even feel if the wax is not tacky anymore.</li>
            <li> Good luck and happy money savings :)</li>
            <li> Good luck and happy money savings :)</li>
            <li> because I do wax almost every month.&lt;br /&gt;Super happy :-)</li>
            <li> am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> My best suggestion, if you are doing a brazilian, do 2 squares on your leg first.</li>
            <li> The first order I got was great!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love the kit and the wax!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I purchased it!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> I purchased this refill because it is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> amazingly well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have no clue how this got so many good reviews.</li>
            <li> This one may be good for some but others work on me better.</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;ve been using this wax on my own for about two years.</li>
            <li> Warm it to the viscosity of honey.</li>
            <li> What more can I say then buy it if your looking for good wax, this can is made for the gigi wax warmer</li>
            <li> So I took the wax out of the warmer &amp; put my honee wax to warm up as I did my arm pits.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Clean up on your heating unit or counter top/floor is best handled by pointing your blow dryer at the spot on high heat, melting the wax and wiping it up with a paper towel.</li>
            <li> I like this wax, no scent, easy to use, good grip.</li>
            <li> It gets much quicker as you get more experienced!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s by far the best wax I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have been getting professionally waxed at the salon for a year now, and doing it myself was the best decision ever.</li>
            <li> As with almost all professional products, some skill is needed for the best results.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s very important.</li>
            <li> Very very important.</li>
            <li> I have a wax warmer and the wax heats quickly to a nice consistency that is easy to work with.  </li>
            <li> but this wax has a strong hold and gets the job done effectively.</li>
            <li> excly like in picture, fast shipping, good quality, good price, I am happy with this product, very practic this product, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Cleans better than the salon for pennies.</li>
            <li> that just shows how much I love this product.</li>
            <li> i love this wax...</li>
            <li> Saving me money at the salon for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waxed many times before</li>
            <li> I feel so smooth!</li>
            <li> I was used to getting waxed my whole body and was in great difficulty while i moved here because in asia, we just call a woman at home</li>
            <li> but I am glad it does what it says.</li>
            <li> but hygeine matters the most.</li>
            <li> There is no need to buy strips or run out and have to run to the store or order more.</li>
            <li> It seems to take the hair off better.</li>
            <li> Make sure you get a warmer and spatulas too, or else you will be S.O.L.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> It works SO much better than the strips, it removes hair from the root and not from the surface of the skin.</li>
            <li> I honestly love it, could not wait to get home and use it.</li>
            <li> I will get more,</li>
            <li> (well, yank off to be more precise!)</li>
            <li> I have bought 3 tubs and will continue to use unless someone says there is something better out there.</li>
            <li> Touch the top of the wax.</li>
            <li> This is the most pain-free type wax I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I kept myself in a self-indued semi-coma, sleeping the better part of 2 days with the help of Benadryl.</li>
            <li> I kept myself in a self-indued semi-coma, sleeping the better part of 2 days with the help of Benadryl.</li>
            <li> that just shows how much I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I loved it so much that I&#x27;m contemplating alternating between my own sugaring wax and this product.</li>
            <li> Much better than strips &amp; sugar wax.</li>
            <li> 1/4 is MORE than</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still getting the hang of it, but I&#x27;m getting better and better.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to use this wax every where with out issue.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product and it really helps removing unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> I think I will order some more when I get the chance.</li>
            <li> prefer more flexible (elastic) wax which doesn&#x27;t break when you pull it off.</li>
            <li> Love this wax.  </li>
            <li> and I have tried many.</li>
            <li> It is okay</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many types/brands of wax over the years and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I was able to go over my skin again &amp; again w/ this wax</li>
            <li> Love the Gigi brand.</li>
            <li> Twist your applicator around and around to make sure to keep the wax on your applicator and not get those strings flying everywhere.</li>
            <li> The baby powder will make sure the wax adheres to the hair and not your skin.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> I strongly suggest to anyone using this product to prep the skin with oil, as it sticks to the skin very easily.  </li>
            <li> but i like that it doesn&#x27;t stick to the skin and hence very effective and gentle for the face.</li>
            <li> I tried many types and brands of waxes in my quest for easy home waxing.</li>
            <li> Clean up on skin is best left to the Gigi Wax remover lotion (trust me,</li>
            <li> Simply amazing, my guy is gonna LOVE the results ;)</li>
            <li> Works well, and gets out most of the hairs (I use it for my arms), I just use the cheap popsicle sticks you can buy around a 100 per box.</li>
            <li> The wax does not require muslin strips, which is nice, economically speaking.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Still trying to learn to wax right!!  </li>
            <li> Great price, almost painless, easy to use, and not messy at all</li>
            <li> Apply a good decent coat, let it sit in your skin a good 10 minutes, then jump in the shower and it comes off very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Apply a good decent coat, let it sit in your skin a good 10 minutes, then jump in the shower and it comes off very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Applied the oil very lightly ( if you apply too much the wax won&#x27;t stick) and then applied the wax in a nice medium coat.</li>
            <li> You do not use the cloth strips to remove the wax and it removes easily from the skin- something compared to candle wax after cooling.</li>
            <li> and it easily comes up without stretching like caramel or chipping.</li>
            <li> It takes almost all the hairs from the area and is really easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy for me to apply on my bikini area (and then some) and remove.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a strong wax</li>
            <li> Perfect in this economy, you get more waxes for less money!</li>
            <li> Smells fine, and is easy to remove after it dries.</li>
            <li> This is not as effective as hot wax</li>
            <li> I used the space saver warmer and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li> I am not a pro and everything worked fine.</li>
            <li> Second, make very sure that you have the oil to remove the wax handy.</li>
            <li> I use it with muslin strips and its easy almost pain free waxing.</li>
            <li> My armpits are mostly flaring around the edges -- where the hair was thickest and my skin the wrinkliest was luckily spared.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly, and gets the job done!</li>
            <li> This wax works great for both fine and coarse hair.</li>
            <li> It is slimy and greasy and a huge pain to work with.</li>
            <li> I grabs the hair and comed out easy and clean.</li>
            <li> The cheap fix to this is to use baby powder.</li>
            <li> this is great, especially when used with the warming kit that you can also get on amazon.</li>
            <li> and/or dermatologist as soon as I can get someone to fit me in.</li>
            <li> and/or dermatologist as soon as I can get someone to fit me in.</li>
            <li> For tender areas, I suggest a gin &amp; tonic 10 minutes before, plus Ambosol as a numbing agent- spread lightly.  </li>
            <li> Then I ended up scraping the rest off in the shower with a cheap razor.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re worried about the pain, the pre-epilation oil helps a great deal, you should be able to find a skin-numbing serum somewhere on this site, and a stiff drink always helps, too :)</li>
            <li> satisfied, this is exciting and fun!</li>
            <li> says ALOT about how much I believe in this wax!!!</li>
            <li> I tried this first on my arms, so I can get an idea of how to do it, and so far my arms look great</li>
            <li> The wax is very strong and you really do get it ALL off.</li>
            <li> Used this wax for years, best wax out there hands down!!</li>
            <li> sure you test the wax temp on your (oiled) wrist first.</li>
            <li> GiGi offers a nice array for all different skill levels, their microwave product a great.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t realize you couldn&#x27;t put this in the microwave before I bought it, and I don&#x27;t have a warmer, so I placed a small pot of water on the stove, on the medium setting, and set the wax container inside and the wax melted perfectly after 3-5 min and stayed creamy until I was finished with it.</li>
            <li> I originally tried this product because I bought the gigi waxing kit which included this.</li>
            <li> I was realy excited when I ordered it but as soon as I applied it, the nightmare begun.</li>
            <li> bought the first tin with the Gigi warmer kit; I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It is so sticky that you need rubbing alcohol to clean your hands.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember seeing that you have to have a special warmer to use this thing.  </li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t have a special warmer, I put water in a pan on the stove and placed the pot of wax in that</li>
            <li> If you get a little wax on the floor of your bathroom (do your best to cover floor first, but</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s very happy with the quality of the hard wax, even though you have to buy the optional cloth strips separately.</li>
            <li> This wax was the best of the hard wax</li>
            <li> Clean up on this wax is pretty easy.</li>
            <li> Clean up on this wax is pretty easy.</li>
            <li> I am used to the pain, so good luck to those of you who are just starting out.</li>
            <li> I applied hydrocortisone to all irritated areas 4 times a day (sometimes more, if it was really itchy.)</li>
            <li> I applied hydrocortisone to all irritated areas 4 times a day (sometimes more, if it was really itchy.)</li>
            <li> (which I recommend if you&#x27;re starting out and need everything all at once for a good price)</li>
            <li> The wax goes on easy, dries fast, and pulls off amazingly smooth.  </li>
            <li> When it is completely hot, it is easy to put on.</li>
            <li> All it takes is a steady hand and patience. :)</li>
            <li> Melts quickly and removes all hair.</li>
            <li> After it&#x27;s cooled, flick an end and pull it off quickly.</li>
            <li> The strips make it much easier, just make sure to put the strips on right away</li>
            <li> Easy pizzy great hard wax</li>
            <li> This wax gets almost all on the first go, and if I need to do over a section I can, without fear of it ripping my skin off too!</li>
            <li> /&gt;For someone like me, I found the Gigi General Purpose Honee Wax is far more effective and user-friendly.</li>
            <li> Because I&#x27;m cheap and really wanted to find a use before tossing it.</li>
            <li> I was amazed how much hair came off leaving my skin feeling baby smooth.</li>
            <li> It took a day or so to calm.    </li>
            <li> I followed all the great reviews on here from everyday people</li>
            <li> only good thing about this wax is that while pulling the layer, it doesn&#x27;t hurt much.</li>
            <li> I did a much better job than any professional has done, and I even waxed one of my friends today, too.  </li>
            <li> I totally agree with Angela&#x27;s suggestions to always use the oil, let the wax on no longer than 20 secs, and most importantly - USE MUSLIM STRIPS.  </li>
            <li> I tried everything and the wax remover is worth the $$).&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works far better on my skin then any pre-wax oil.</li>
            <li> Received product fairly quickly, and used it today for the first time.  </li>
            <li> it does the job you looking for, along the strips, also from GIGI, and the small spatula, the perfect combination so far.</li>
            <li> but literally, pulling band aids hurt more than waxing with this wax and in general.</li>
            <li> I warm up the wax on high and then keep it just warm enough by switching between medium and low while using it.</li>
            <li> I tried SEVERAL times as so many other reviewers loved it</li>
            <li> You will know the wax is ready when you flick up at it quick with your finger</li>
            <li> Easy and not messy.</li>
            <li> This product is such a money saver compared to paying high prices for a salon wax and you tend to get better results!</li>
            <li> and she does the job in a very reasonable amount of money just like $10 for everything.</li>
            <li> Buy it with the set that has the lotion and spatulas (this is very much required because if u use ur knife...</li>
            <li> I like this one very much.</li>
            <li> Set it on High for 20 minutes if it&#x27;s a full can.</li>
            <li> Of course the wax is sticky but it works perfectly and a little planing up front goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to work with (so long as you have the proper heater), and I love not having to deal with stickiness and strips!  </li>
            <li> This is definitely beauty on a budget :)</li>
            <li> Too hot will burn the skin and leave it sore.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (Funny but true!)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love using this on coarse hairs.</li>
            <li> Also, you should be aware that the container is metal.</li>
            <li> Tried this first on my legs - it was a nightmare.</li>
            <li> This was my first time dong it.</li>
            <li> Be sure to use just enough so that it soaks into the skin, but doesn&#x27;t prevent the wax from grabbing onto your hair.</li>
            <li> The hardest part is getting up the courage to rip off the first piece of wax.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for anyone interested in waxing at home.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well for that.  </li>
            <li> It takes off most of the hair and any hair left pulls out easiy with tweezers.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not expensive at all to go to a salon for waxing.</li>
            <li> However after the first try I just tossed the wax away.</li>
            <li> This product works very well with the warmer!</li>
            <li> will definitely be ordering some more soon.</li>
            <li> Maybe, be a bit smarter than me and test it out on your leg or something first until you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> So much easier than the strips!</li>
            <li> The first time, it took me 3-4 hours, yikes.</li>
            <li> I am German-Irish; when it comes to the amount of hair on my legs and \\&quot;other\\&quot; body parts, I&#x27;m definitely more German, so I initially skipped doing any research and purchased the Hard Wax, assuming it would be best for someone with a lot of hair (and not as course as I thought).</li>
            <li> you must pull fast, very fast).</li>
            <li> Dosn&#x27;t take as long&#x3D;)</li>
            <li> wax removes hair pretty well, and does not hurt much, if done correctly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You can use it pretty much anywhere.</li>
            <li> Then tapped it on the lower end to make sure it was dry and picked it up.</li>
            <li> I typically create my own sugaring wax but this time around I ran out and needed a wax asap.</li>
            <li> really wanted to like this wax -- in fact, I liked it a lot the first few hours I got it and used it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this product 5 stars even though it is SUPER messy, maybe I just need more practice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all different kinds of wax and the GIGI Hard Wax is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Even though it felt like my skin was getting ripped off while I was doing it, probably incorrectly, my skin remained completely in tact and completely pain free once the hair was removed.</li>
            <li> Straight to the trash bin!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This wax works really well.  </li>
            <li> It works on legs also, but it really does the job with the bikini line and armpits.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very waxy and sticky</li>
            <li> (I also dropped the whole pot of wax as I was transporting it from the stove</li>
            <li> So, i WAS VERY WORRIED WHEN I CAME HERE..</li>
            <li> then I had some free time and thought lets try it out in my private part.</li>
            <li> I really like it that i can do it myseld.</li>
            <li> My skin felt way better then when I used the pink one.</li>
            <li> I find this much easier to use than the waxing with the strips.</li>
            <li> it works really well, but there is some sticky residue, so you should get the removal stuff with it.</li>
            <li> I never must have given much thought to what I was about to do - a self-brazilian wax-</li>
            <li> Really.</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> the whole can to be melted to wax any area anyways.</li>
            <li> also really like that I can turn my melting pot off and the wax can still be used for quite some time afterwards.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took forever to harden and when it did, it didn&#x27;t come off much at all.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It heats up in about 15 minutes and is ready to go.  </li>
            <li> Keep twisting your applicator until you get it very close to the area you want to wax.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> I was honestly scared to ever wax again even though I used to wax some a few years ago.</li>
            <li> have trouble waxing under my arms and find this to be effective.</li>
            <li> Also this wax is good for stubborn or thick hairs.  </li>
            <li> It took a few tries to get the consistency right and to know when to pull but after that it&#x27;s been great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;PS - It was pretty effective in pulling out the hair (at least as effective as the sugar kind), but with all this trouble, I&#x27;m going to go back to the sugar next time.</li>
            <li> Make sure to exfoliate first then apply lightly pre wax oil or a little olive oil to the area you are waxing so the wax doesn&#x27;t stick to your skin, only the hair.</li>
            <li> After waxing be sure to use aloe vera gel or other cooling gel to reduce redness.</li>
            <li> It takes a minute or so to dry on the skin, but is easy to pull off</li>
            <li> The only brand i&#x27;ve had consistent success with in the pubic area, is this one.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still sticky, just push the wax back down and give it a couple of good pats.</li>
            <li> x back down and give it a couple of good pats.</li>
            <li> Any wax left over can be easily rubbed off with oil and a soft cloth.</li>
            <li> I am not new to waxing, but have always used Gigi&#x27;s soft waxes, for, well, ALMOST everywhere, the all purpose honee being my favorite.</li>
            <li> Even after getting the proper technique figured out, I couldn&#x27;t help but think that the Hard Wax is either better suited for those with courser hair or those with more waxing experience than me.</li>
            <li> I immediately covered the with a muslin cloth ( you can also use an old pillow case cut in strips) patted a few times and pulled in the opposite direction of hair growth - and it worked great.</li>
            <li> regular baby oil does WONDERS in removing the excess wax, but the cool thing about it is once the wax hardens, you can kinda just roll it off the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You wait for the wax to congeal and flick it with your finger to make sure it&#x27;s solid enough to pull off, and then pull off.</li>
            <li> but one hour later I was completely hair free.</li>
            <li> i decided that this particular wax is not for me.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and very course hair with sometimes 2-3 hair follicles growing together.</li>
            <li> It hurts only a little more than the salon, but only because you have to apply and yank off so many times.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this wax and the Gigi warmer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I have high pain tolerance or something</li>
            <li> I have a high pain-tolerance, so waxing doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> Great product, a little messy but certainly works.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I barely felt the hair being taken off!</li>
            <li> It hardens in just a few quick minutes and comes off in one quick peel once you have mastered the technique.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to be the hard kind that doesn&#x27;t require strips.</li>
            <li> I chose this wax just because it was hard and usually that&#x27;s the best type of wax to use.</li>
            <li> I had to end up using one of my more round butter knifes to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The wax that I spilled dried fast and was easy to pick up.  </li>
            <li> Getting the temp just right is key.</li>
            <li> I initially had it on high, but the wax gets just a liiiiiittle bit too hot for comfort.</li>
            <li> Since i was using it for the first time, i had a rough time removing the wax from my body as i wasnt aware of the thickness of the wax to be required to be pulled.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so I need something gentle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s actually on my skin, it sticks on the skin very much, not just on the hairs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s the exact same product that I was already using.</li>
            <li> But definitely use oil first, apply that anywhere the wax is going to go, and even around the areas the wax is going to go.</li>
            <li> I bought this refill for a kit I bought for my significant other.</li>
            <li> This product works well for people with sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> no need to be a professional to do it!</li>
            <li> The only problem is if you get it too hot</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the best hard wax around, but it really does get the job done, although I feel that other waxes stick less to the skin after you remove it.</li>
            <li> I always wax the upper bikini area with no problems, but decided to try this one for the lower part since it has so many positive reviews (the wax..not my lower parts:)&lt;br /&gt;First, please know how to use hard, stripless wax.</li>
            <li> I prefer the all purpose body hard wax much better.</li>
            <li> I love Gigi Honee Wax, so I figured I&#x27;d give the hard wax a try.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine a more ineffective hard wax.</li>
            <li> The hard wax is definitely better than its counter part.</li>
            <li> Ok so I used the hard wax for the 1st time today.</li>
            <li> After using Sally Hansen Extra Strength Brazilian wax for years i found this wax to be kind of hard to use.</li>
            <li> The results after using are amazing and the wax lasts approximately 4-6 weeks.</li>
            <li> The product description was not overly clear to me as to whether I needed strips with this item or not, but it turns out that I did not.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t do full-on brazilian at home because I&#x27;m a coward, but a regular bikini wax is very doable.</li>
            <li> I would also recommend getting the numbing spray for those really sensitive spots.</li>
            <li> You will see the difference in color and it will also allow you to do a trial run as far as thickness and technique.</li>
            <li> Where the wax is applied, all hairs are completely removed.</li>
            <li> I still had an inordinate amount of hair left (too much to tweeze it all)and 4 areas with bruised-looking burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I warmed it in the warmer and it took me nearly 15-20 mins to start melting.</li>
            <li> TIME Thoughto do it completely</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this wax doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> However, if you have sensitive skin, you will have to think about it or oil your skin sufficiently before waxing.</li>
            <li> I tried to at least use this stuff up waxing my own legs, and it was the most frustrating experience.</li>
            <li> and when it dries out completely it gets brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now, I have used Gigi microwave stripless wax, and it is nowhere near as sticky as this one.</li>
            <li> When I go to a professional salon, they use this wax for the bikini area.</li>
            <li> Purchased as an add-on to the professional kit.</li>
            <li> Make sure you apply in thick amounts.</li>
            <li> Keep them small and it will be easy to control.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> no mess..</li>
            <li> Even the color  of the wax is different, it was light green before, this new Gigi is yellowish.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought that I should wait for all my hair to come back since i used the pre wax strips on stores such as walmart and target.</li>
            <li> good thing about hard wax is that it hurts MUCH MUCH less than sugar sticky type wax with strips.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t hurt half as much as at the salon, no skin pulled, done very thorough by myself.  </li>
            <li> I have a few suggestions: always use the oil, do not let the wax dry for too long (20 secs is good enough), and use muslin strips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually never waxed myself, so this was probably a lot more painful that it would have been if I had more experience.</li>
            <li> Be careful and trim hair first.</li>
            <li> it sets really hard, very quickly</li>
            <li> The video I felt helped greatly even though maybe a little outdated.</li>
            <li> wait until it gets firm and then pull QUICKLY.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull off any of your skin and gets the hair right down to the follicle without ripping it at the skin like strip-waxing does.</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s pretty self</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m new to waxing and ended up wasting it from improper technique, will buy more when I&#x27;m not too afraid to try waxing again, didn&#x27;t hurt as much as I thought</li>
            <li> It took me only 1/2 hour to do a full brazilian wax and the process was much less painful than what I experienced in the salon.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad that I made the purchase, it was both effective and (for me) less painful than standard (soft) waxing.</li>
            <li> Less likely to cause wax burn and grips the hair better than soft wax, so there are less ingrown hair problems as well.</li>
            <li> my skin is sensitive to regular wax  </li>
            <li> I repeated numerous times thinking it was the way I was applying and time setting, but each time left my legs red and without much hair being pulled off.</li>
            <li> can isn&#x27;t enough to do my legs so to save time &amp; money I used the honee (soft) wax.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> This hard wax is easy to use and relatively low pain.  </li>
            <li> Hot wax is must faster and less pain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sooooo hard to clean up.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting it to be just as hurtful as other wax, but it actually didn&#x27;t really hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not completely brittle, but I find when it&#x27;s soft</li>
            <li> I rarely do reviews because I&#x27;m lazy, so to say I took my time out to write this review</li>
            <li> Then apply it about as thick as a banana skin and let it cool.</li>
            <li> I used this wax to wax my armpits, let the hair grow out a few centimeters and pulled the very few, fine hairs out with a tweezer!</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying hard wax on myself and I was quite surprised.</li>
            <li> First time is a bit painful but after that it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re not supposed to let it dry completely.</li>
            <li> A lot less messier and much easier.</li>
            <li> The wax dries off fast while applying, so could do it in small patches which took a lot of time to complete.</li>
            <li> My first experience with at-home waxing was with Gigi Brazilian Body Hard Wax, and it nearly made it my last.</li>
            <li> Because I had such a severe reaction to the main ingredient in the wax, which GiGi neglects to include in their extensive list of other warnings, I wanted to post my review here as well.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve applied this thinly with strips and it&#x27;s been fine.</li>
            <li> If the wax dries too much it will break off in little pieces and be torture.</li>
            <li> Consistanty  should be like honey, if its runny turn down the heat setting and let wax cool a little</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s definitely a bit of a learning curve, but it&#x27;s worth the trouble of sticking with it!!</li>
            <li> than it&#x27;s a bad product, will have to revisit this review in few months when i&#x27;m more familiar with this wax.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I ordered a new batch a few months ago and each time I try to use it, it does not dry, it does not stick.</li>
            <li> Just put a big glab on and wait (not too long, as long as it&#x27;s still sticky but not wet) and pull off.</li>
            <li> Just turn off the switch (the space saver warmer only has an on/off switch) when it seems to get too hot, and turn it back on when the wax gets too thick.</li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;m going to try to put the baby oil on first before waxing since it&#x27;s hard to get the wax off after.</li>
            <li> Then apply the wax directly on the skin in the same direction of the hair growth, wait about 30 seconds or until slightly tacky, pulling the wax off in the opposite direction of the hair growth.</li>
            <li> - Took about 20-25 mins on high to heat wax, I then set it to medium for a few mins and did my waxing.  </li>
            <li> I am able to apply it in thin strips, and contrary to what I&#x27;ve read in other reviews, I do let it dry.</li>
            <li> So for larger areas like your legs, it&#x27;ll take a long time to do.</li>
            <li> The trick is to apply a thick layer and never let the wax get too hot.</li>
            <li> Brazilian wax goes on nicely, but very difficult to remove because you have to pick it off.</li>
            <li> So, after trying to pull it out with no luck, I heated up my soft wax and tried to wax it off that way, which removed about half of it.</li>
            <li> My entire face turned red, hot, and itchy, including my ears, behind my ears, and some of my neck.</li>
            <li> It also turns a dull, flat color when it is ready as well.</li>
            <li> This wax does NOT do very well on eyebrows/facial hair, but it&#x27;s called Brazilian Hard Wax for a reason, I suppose.     </li>
            <li> I normally use the hard wax for smaller areas like lip and under arms.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is important to have a towel to spread into the area where it will do the waxing, because when the wax falls to the ground or clothing is difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> But while it sets up it takes me that long to get the courage up to pull the strips.</li>
            <li> Use an old pot added a few cups of water and put the pot in.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not a professional, you may have ISSUES like I do.</li>
            <li> And if you wait too long to remove it, it will break into pieces.</li>
            <li> And if you wait too long to remove it, it will break into pieces.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the Hard Wax works well for others, but this was a \\&quot;hard\\&quot; lesson learned about following directions before embarking upon a new venture like this.</li>
            <li> I looked at a few youtube videos and read a few positive customer reviews about this product.</li>
            <li> The wax takes a long time to dry</li>
            <li> It is a little more difficult to use than thicker waxes.</li>
            <li> I have tried about 10 different kinds of wax for my little warmer and finally I found one I like.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like i&#x27;m using hard wax mixed with sticky soft wax</li>
            <li> Not sure how long i&#x27;m supposed to let it dry - very mixed suggestions in other reviews, but if it&#x27;s soft it sticks to my fingers</li>
            <li> I highly recommend getting the pre-epilation oil; makes the hard wax a dream to remove.</li>
            <li> If it gets too dry, you can&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li> if you miss a spot...) wait for it to dry then use windex.</li>
            <li> It still catches the hair but doesn&#x27;t make it so difficult to pull it off or clean</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;ve tried waxing my underarms previously with drug store waxes (sally Hansen, etc), my underarm hair laughed an evil laugh and clung tight.</li>
            <li> I keep my application sizes to the size of a quarter to about an inch wide by 3 inches long.</li>
            <li> Then turn the warmer down to low.</li>
            <li> It dries too fast and gets flaky, which is incredibly hard to get off!</li>
            <li> Compared to a previous wax I used last month (a sugar-based one using paper strips), this is a disaster.  </li>
            <li> used this on my bikini area, my underarms, and some very sensitive and tough to wax areas like my knees and the back of my knees.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It left behind too much hair down there for the pain that it caused.  </li>
            <li> After over 2 hours of torture, tons of wasted muslin, and an enormous mess, I finally finished the job...sort of.</li>
            <li> After using soft wax and strips for a while to remove armpit hair, I have found the hard wax to be cleaner and easier to use.</li>
            <li> It is similar, if not the same, to the hard wax used at salons.</li>
            <li> I am european and back there, hard wax is used all the time</li>
            <li> Spent an hour cleaning up my wax warmer, not even going to try cleaning up the can.</li>
            <li> a few weeks back, I bought Sally Hansen sugar wax from wegmans.</li>
            <li> However, having used it with strips in a few areas I can definitely say it makes life easier.</li>
            <li> Please spare yourself the pain and trouble and use a different brand!</li>
            <li> I was sent not real Gigi at all.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected..</li>
            <li> Discomfort is to be expected, but it&#x27;s relatively minimal.</li>
            <li> On the lowest setting of the Gigi warmer it is still very fluid and drips of the applicator which makes things messy.</li>
            <li> As a result, it&#x27;s even harder to get the rest of the wax</li>
            <li> Item was as expected and described.</li>
            <li> so it is less painful and very easy to learn how to do yourself.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Hard wax\\&quot; is exactly that- hard, non sticky wax.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s too long, you will cry as you pull the wax off, and it&#x27;ll be a tangled mess.)</li>
            <li> have a few pieces of wax left over on my legs because I applied the layer too thinly at the edges, but it is not hard to take it</li>
            <li> The wax doesn&#x27;t dry hard enough at all.</li>
            <li> i use it every where and its is cheaper due to the fact that u do not need mulim with it...</li>
            <li> I had wax from one end of the house to the other and my thigh was stuck to itself, my feet were stuck to the floor.</li>
            <li> I regret I didn&#x27;t buy the lotion and other products for before and after waxing.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, though pulls at the skin surface, the epilation of hair itself doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as other gel-type waxes.     </li>
            <li> compared to other waxes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> That strip can be used to remove other strips.</li>
            <li> Works without any other products.  </li>
            <li> Have tried homemade sugar wax, and other brands of wax that requires the strips of cloth...but it depends on your hair type and area.</li>
            <li> Although it may be hard to use, and somewhat painful, it is effective.  </li>
            <li> get bad rashes and angry, red, raised welts from most self-stick bandages and medical tape.</li>
            <li> I read a few reviews saying how bad the wax was - with hard wax you need to spread to the right consistency, let it cool slightly and pull it off before it gets to hard.  </li>
            <li> Hard wax is the only thing that has yet to irritate me skin.</li>
            <li> I compare it to the wax I used the time before last (which was a hard wax basically identical to this one), which I could heat up in the microwave.  </li>
            <li> This hard wax works just like the wax at a salon, and gives me the same results.</li>
            <li> Plus it saved me some cash on delivery fees because I got the body hard wax and the space saver warmer from the same seller.</li>
            <li> it is the only bikini wax that doesn&#x27;t tear my delicate skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the risk!&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> Since this is used without a strip, the wax layer that u apply on the skin should be thick enough to be pulled.</li>
            <li> The key is to put baby powder on area to be waxed spread thick amount of wax</li>
            <li> It should be thick enough to roll on your spatula, apply thickly, wait til it slightly hardens then flick it &amp; pull in the opposite direction.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it, but I find it a bit more painful to use than other hard waxes.</li>
            <li> Any oil will work really.&lt;br /&gt;-put down newspapers or you&#x27;ll have wax bits to scrape up.&lt;br /&gt;-listening to music helps the pain.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s too risky to try again down there &lt;^_^&gt;</li>
            <li> \\&quot;down there\\</li>
            <li> I wax myself, everything from the eyebrows down.</li>
            <li> Put down a lot of newspaper when using any wax.</li>
            <li> Put down a lot of newspaper when using any wax.</li>
            <li> I mean it didn&#x27;t even pull enough to make a difference!</li>
            <li> all my clients say that this wax hurts less and leaves less inflamed skin...</li>
            <li> The faster you get, the less you&#x27;ll have to change the heat.</li>
            <li> but the last couple cans of wax that I received were the most horrible I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Had it on medium heat for less than 10 minutes and used the wax no problem.</li>
            <li> Less mess.</li>
            <li> It takes so darn long when you can hardly see what you&#x27;re doing, even with mirrors propped at all sorts of angles.</li>
            <li> It makes the biggest mess I&#x27;ve ever seen...</li>
            <li> No cloth strips to mess with.  </li>
            <li> , I just used a small pot of boiling water, placed they wax can in the water and waited till It was melted every where except the center (you dont need</li>
            <li> With this product you save time, you eliminate the mess and you don&#x27;t even have to use the cloths.  </li>
            <li> This keeps the mess in the container.  </li>
            <li> No matter what I use (soap, hot or cold water, baby oil, fingernail polish), I can not get the wax off my fingernails.</li>
            <li> Just overall not a good product whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I have never waxed or been waxed but managed to do it with a minimum amount of mess.  </li>
            <li> After a few times, I got it down to 1.5 hours, not too shabby.</li>
            <li> Also, dont let the wax get too dry on the skin, because then it becomes brittle and hard to pull off.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviewers say, if you don&#x27;t wait for the right consistency it will dry too hard and flake or will come off in a gooey mess, both situations equally messy and painful.</li>
            <li> Its a lot less messy cuz you don&#x27;t have to use strips of fabric.</li>
            <li> I placed a thick strip and waited for about 15 seconds to let it dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really less trouble than it seems from the way I wrote it.     </li>
            <li> On my underarms I applied a little Neutrogena oil</li>
            <li> all.. to tell you a little about my history.</li>
            <li> To prevent the wax from sticking to your skin, put on a little bit of oil before you wax.</li>
            <li> but it does get a little sticky.</li>
            <li> It smells a little medicinal</li>
            <li> a few months with this sticky uncontrollable mess</li>
            <li> It does hurt a little.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I can do a little over 1 hour.</li>
            <li> Somewhere between 60-90 seconds, pull up a little lip of wax at the bottom from which you will pull.</li>
            <li> You may need to move the warmer setting from off to low to maintain the consistency you want: a very thick honey.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Luckily as a waxing noobie, I only practiced a little on 1 leg and then did both underarms and a bit on one side of my face before I got tired.</li>
            <li> That is absolutely not the GIGI Brazilian Hard Wax I used to buy before.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to remove their unwanted hair and isn&#x27;t afraid of feeling a bit pain.</li>
            <li> a few YouTube videos on how to use this wax (there are aestheticians that have turoruals).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had patches of skin missing.</li>
            <li> The warmer for the wax works well, the wax tore off tons of hair once I watched the video a few times and got the technique</li>

            <li> It made a mess!</li>
            <li> It makes the process much easier and much much less painful.  </li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t dry on skin, it remains sticky, it is very hard to remove.</li>
            <li> But a little bit pricy!..</li>
            <li> it was just a thick gooie mess.</li>
            <li> so you aren&#x27;t pulling your hair trying to get the end up to pull and to work in small sections.</li>
            <li> &quot; (on my legs, too) because of my ignorance, I finally sought advice on the internet to see what in the world I was doing wrong.</li>
            <li> I had no idea that usually the culprit is the sticky rosin or colophony which causes the reaction.</li>
            <li> You will need to purchase a wax warmer to use this wax, metallic container is not safe for the microwave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At one Brazilian a month, I usually buy about three to four cans a year.</li>
            <li> am still not sure if you&#x27;re supposed to use strips with it or not.</li>
            <li> I usually get 4 applications per jar</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt half as bad as soft wax.</li>
            <li> I found this wax to be very thin when heated to proper temperature.  </li>
            <li> , I got a little annoyed and discouraged when it started getting messy.</li>
            <li> The wax does need to be thick and you must work in small sections-</li>
            <li> Apply in small and thick patches.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, black body hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was the \\&quot;hard wax\\&quot;- what I have used before.</li>
            <li> Lo and behold, the Hard Wax is to be hand-pulled, NOT used with the strips.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for areas which are hard to wax, as well as the bikini area.  </li>
            <li> As hard as I tried, however, I couldn&#x27;t keep all the wax from getting into the pan.  </li>
            <li> I decided to invest in these products and ordered one gigi honeee combo along with the warmer and muslin roll as well as on e gigi hard wax tin.</li>
            <li> When the Brazilian hard cools and hardens, just rip off.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to stick it in the microwave or have the wax get hard while you are in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~</li>
            <li> I bought the Gigi Brazilian Waxing Kit about a year ago, which came with this hard body wax.</li>
            <li> I have used this hard body wax by GIGI and have never had any issues with it before...</li>
            <li> After the debacle with the GiGi creme wax, I must say that the GiGi Brazillian body hard wax is a wonderfull wax.  </li>
            <li> Hard wax doesn&#x27;t require muslin strips.</li>
            <li> Any wax that you drop on a hard surface will come off with your fingernails.</li>
            <li> , do NOT use Gigi Brazilian Hard Body</li>
            <li> That also happens to be *THE* #1 ingredient in this hard wax.</li>
            <li> The wax is hard wax</li>

            <li> Wax&#x3D; use strips!&lt;br /&gt;The hard wax in the 14oz</li>
            <li> I prefer the hard wax too the strips and</li>
            <li> Some reviewers have complained of it being brittle -</li>
            <li> At least not the one shipped to me.</li>
            <li> Any waxing is painful but compared to my experience a few weeks back, it was a walk in the park.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to peel up the edge of it to rip it off and even after I DID get it off, there was still quite a bit of wax left behind.</li>
            <li> I watched the video and read the booklet and had no idea what I was in for until it was too late</li>
            <li> I watched the video and read the booklet and had no idea what I was in for until it was too late</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s dangerous to microwave metal objects (could catch the entire microwave on fire).</li>
            <li> but I still never had it damage delicate skin.  </li>
            <li> This wax takes out almost every hair, and leaves my skin the least irritated of all the waxes I&#x27;ve tried so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I useda wood spatula and took a thick amount of wax.</li>
            <li> up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just put it on thick, let sit, flip up the end and pull off.</li>
            <li> For the negative comments about the wax does not work, I would say again layer a thick amount of wax.</li>
            <li> So I used it on my arm pits, applied it thickly, waited then flicked the end &amp; snatched off the hair.</li>
            <li> but the consistency wasn&#x27;t thick.</li>
            <li> The biggest complaint I&#x27;ve seen is that the wax sticks to everything and can be difficult to get off if you get it on other areas.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Removing it was ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I tried using it on my nether region several times, but it was so painful, and it didn&#x27;t remove the hair as well as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having an incredibly hard time with this product!  </li>
            <li> Buy Hard Brazilian Wax!</li>
            <li> Very hard to use and does not peel off correctly.</li>
            <li> 1st time I used it, I got a horrible one that&#x27;s still a dark brown scar, over a month later.</li>
            <li> Gigi Brazillian Hard wax, it is less painful and faster to get rid of hairs.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It should pour off your applicator not like syrup but very slow like honey.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> and it left a horrible mess on my kitchen appliances - something that would have been a non-issue if I was using the sugar-based wax. .</li>
            <li> Hate doing it myself, but can&#x27;t complain when this container lasts months and is less than half the price of 1 salon wax!</li>
            <li> So if you don&#x27;t want to buy the gigi wax heater you can always break the container (a little difficult) until the pieces of wax shatters, then microwave the pieces of wax in a container you don&#x27;t mind devoting to wax since its difficult to wash off.</li>
            <li> Do it in thin strips or patches, don&#x27;t just start spackling it on.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t recall seeing anywhere that muslin strips were not to be used with this type of wax, so after leaving strip after strip of wax behind on my nether regions and ending up burning myself</li>
            <li> if the layer applied is thin, the wax will not pull off the body and will remain stuck there.....</li>
            <li> but it is frustrating in the meantime.  </li>
            <li> This GIGI Brazillian Body Hard Wax is the worst type of wax that I&#x27;ve ever used, it&#x27;s so sticky and when it dries is hard to remove without leaving traces on the skin, and also is not gentle on the skin at all.</li>
            <li> I have used hard waxes before and I have never had such a horrible experience.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding a place that uses hard wax and when I did, they wanted $60 for a bikini wax!!!</li>
            <li> Sometimes if you have a real thin layer its hard to see (depending on skin tone)</li>
            <li> but I found it painful &amp; messy.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s too thick of a strip, then the PAIN will come!!  </li>
            <li> Changed rating from 3 stars to 2 because my experience with this product does not get any less annoying</li>
            <li> Neither way worked for me and it left my skin feeling awful for days.</li>
            <li> Wrong, wrong, wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t go wrong when buying a replacement.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a faint smell</li>
            <li> I had never used sugar wax before and boy was that a long, painful, horrific night!!!</li>
            <li> The stickiness was enought to make me so angry and frustrated that I wanted to cry.</li>
            <li> I was afraid buying these products online as i</li>
            <li> unhappy customer here...</li>
            <li> but I ill keep ith this one!</li>
            <li> Until then, I&#x27;ll be hoping Gigi makes a rosin-free hard wax, and staying away from people since I look blotchy, am still hairy, and smell horrible. :(</li>

            <li> Why after the bad leg experience?</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not so bad.</li>
            <li> I applied the wax as instructed and tried to pull off by hand, the wax cracked when trying to take it off and was painful.</li>
            <li> THE experience was painful</li>
            <li> It was awfully painful and it took longer to wax</li>
            <li> you discover this product, avoid trips to the aesthetic to make the painful waxing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I gave two stars because it&#x27;s painful on the bikini line (what I bought it for).</li>
            <li> :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The salon is expensive and annoying, the wax strips dosen&#x27;t works well, shaving: no way!</li>
            <li> It does smell like honey (I hate the smell of honey)</li>
            <li> Using this for Brazilian or bikini area is very very painful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Easy pizzy great hard wax</li>
            <li> I got this because it was cheaper than all of the others &amp; I was running low.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the exact same product that I was already using. However, the can was cracked at the bottom &amp; without realizing it, I heated it up. It made a mess! Spent an hour cleaning up my wax warmer, not even going to try cleaning up the can. Straight to the trash bin!&lt;br /&gt;I guess it got messed up somewhere during shipping.</li>
            <li> I purchased this refill because it is an amazing product. I initially bought the startup kit with the warmer. It took a while to go through all the wax. I do all my home self groomings and use this for my eyebrows and bikini area. I used to use it for my underarms and mustache, but purchased the flash &amp; go hair removal and haven&#x27;t had to worry about doing those waxes since. Great value also. Definitely beats going to the salon....even the el cheapo ones. And I wax my teenage twin daughters eyebrows as well. This is definitely beauty on a budget :)</li>
            <li> I like this wax, no scent, easy to use, good grip. Sometimes if you have a real thin layer its hard to see (depending on skin tone) but I ill keep ith this one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this wax for about 2 years now. It&#x27;s by far the best wax I&#x27;ve tried. There&#x27;s definitely a bit of a learning curve, but it&#x27;s worth the trouble of sticking with it!! I have very thick, black body hair. When I&#x27;ve tried waxing my underarms previously with drug store waxes (sally Hansen, etc), my underarm hair laughed an evil laugh and clung tight. I mean it didn&#x27;t even pull enough to make a difference! Lol. This wax gets almost all on the first go, and if I need to do over a section I can, without fear of it ripping my skin off too! I have very sensitive skin, so I need something gentle.&lt;br /&gt;A couple of tips:&lt;br /&gt;-Watch a few YouTube videos on how to use this wax (there are aestheticians that have turoruals).&lt;br /&gt;-Make sure you test the wax temp on your (oiled) wrist first. Too hot will burn the skin and leave it sore.&lt;br /&gt;-I use jojoba oil as a pre wax oil. No need to buy a pricey oil. Any oil will work really.&lt;br /&gt;-put down newspapers or you&#x27;ll have wax bits to scrape up.&lt;br /&gt;-listening to music helps the pain. (Funny but true!)&lt;br /&gt;-expect it to take a long time the first few times. It gets much quicker as you get more experienced!</li>
            <li> my skin is sensitive to regular wax  (I am African American). Hard wax is the only thing that has yet to irritate me skin. The results after using are amazing and the wax lasts approximately 4-6 weeks.</li>
            <li> This wax works really well.  It hardens in just a few quick minutes and comes off in one quick peel once you have mastered the technique.  Ovreall great product, along with the GIGI wax warmer.  Would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I love using this on coarse hairs. It works on legs also, but it really does the job with the bikini line and armpits. Very, very effective. Remember to have baby oil on hand to remove the wax residue/bits and also Tend Skin or an astringent (I use Neutrogena) after you&#x27;re all done. Some reviewers have complained of it being brittle - you&#x27;re not supposed to let it dry completely. You wait for the wax to congeal and flick it with your finger to make sure it&#x27;s solid enough to pull off, and then pull off. If it gets too dry, you can&#x27;t do that. Waxing the bikini line works well here but always remember to take care of the skin with the oil and astringent afterwards. The wax is very strong and you really do get it ALL off. (I don&#x27;t do full-on brazilian at home because I&#x27;m a coward, but a regular bikini wax is very doable. Be careful and trim hair first. If it&#x27;s too long, you will cry as you pull the wax off, and it&#x27;ll be a tangled mess.) This wax is not sticky/stringy.    This wax does NOT do very well on eyebrows/facial hair, but it&#x27;s called Brazilian Hard Wax for a reason, I suppose.     If you get a little wax on the floor of your bathroom (do your best to cover floor first, but if you miss a spot...) wait for it to dry then use windex. Spray it on, wait a minute or two, then push it off. This works!</li>
            <li> Lasts for... maybe 10 waxes? And also very effective.</li>
            <li> I found this wax to be very thin when heated to proper temperature.  I strongly suggest to anyone using this product to prep the skin with oil, as it sticks to the skin very easily.  It is a little more difficult to use than thicker waxes.</li>
            <li> Everything about this is great.I bought the warmer for it and the applicators and strips.The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it leaves some wax reside but for do it yourself at home?Just awsome.Cleans better than the salon for pennies.</li>
            <li> I am able to apply it in thin strips, and contrary to what I&#x27;ve read in other reviews, I do let it dry. It&#x27;s not completely brittle, but I find when it&#x27;s soft it tends to be stickier and goopier to get off. But definitely use oil first, apply that anywhere the wax is going to go, and even around the areas the wax is going to go. Do it in thin strips or patches, don&#x27;t just start spackling it on.  Also, you should be aware that the container is metal. I know with some waxes, people just microwave them. But that will not work on this container. At least not the one shipped to me. I assume they all are metal since you can buy a warmer for them as well. A double boiler method on the stove can also suffice though it&#x27;s not as convenient as the warmer.</li>
            <li> Took me some time to perfect the technique. Like the other reviewers say, if you don&#x27;t wait for the right consistency it will dry too hard and flake or will come off in a gooey mess, both situations equally messy and painful. Me personally, I have coarse hair: I use it for waxing everything and the bikini. Not brazillian; tried it once and it&#x27;s too risky to try again down there &lt;^_^&gt;</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t work at all. I tried it with and without cloth strips. Neither way worked for me and it left my skin feeling awful for days. I had patches of skin missing.</li>
            <li> Its a lot less messy cuz you don&#x27;t have to use strips of fabric. Dosn&#x27;t take as long&#x3D;) Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Tried this first on my legs - it was a nightmare. I applied the wax as instructed and tried to pull off by hand, the wax cracked when trying to take it off and was painful. I repeated numerous times thinking it was the way I was applying and time setting, but each time left my legs red and without much hair being pulled off. I decided to try it on my underarms. Why after the bad leg experience? Because I&#x27;m cheap and really wanted to find a use before tossing it. On my underarms I applied a little Neutrogena oil but you can use baby oil or even olive oil. Applied the oil very lightly ( if you apply too much the wax won&#x27;t stick) and then applied the wax in a nice medium coat. I immediately covered the with a muslin cloth ( you can also use an old pillow case cut in strips) patted a few times and pulled in the opposite direction of hair growth - and it worked great. I was amazed how much hair came off leaving my skin feeling baby smooth. There was almost no was left  to pull off by hand. Any wax left over can be easily rubbed off with oil and a soft cloth. This one is a keeper - but for specific areas.  Also used this with the Gigi warmer set to low.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Perfect in this economy, you get more waxes for less money! Would recommend to anyone! I would also recommend getting the numbing spray for those really sensitive spots.</li>
            <li> It took a few tries to get the consistency right and to know when to pull but after that it&#x27;s been great. Make sure to exfoliate first then apply lightly pre wax oil or a little olive oil to the area you are waxing so the wax doesn&#x27;t stick to your skin, only the hair. Then apply the wax directly on the skin in the same direction of the hair growth, wait about 30 seconds or until slightly tacky, pulling the wax off in the opposite direction of the hair growth. If the wax dries too much it will break off in little pieces and be torture. It helps to end the wax strip applied to the skin where there is no hair so you aren&#x27;t pulling your hair trying to get the end up to pull and to work in small sections. I use this product for my eyebrows,underarms and brazilian bikini wax and did about 8 treatments on myself.  After waxing be sure to use aloe vera gel or other cooling gel to reduce redness.This is the second container I&#x27;ve ordered.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews so for me to do this that just shows how much I love this product. I have a few suggestions: always use the oil, do not let the wax dry for too long (20 secs is good enough), and use muslin strips. The strips make it much easier, just make sure to put the strips on right away so it sticks to the wax. I am never shaving again and plan on waxing my legs and underarms now too.</li>
            <li> i love this wax...all my clients say that this wax hurts less and leaves less inflamed skin...i use it every where and its is cheaper due to the fact that u do not need mulim with it...great product!!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great! Saving me money at the salon for sure. I highly recommend this wax and the Gigi warmer.</li>
            <li> I have no clue how this got so many good reviews. I&#x27;ve waxed many times before and I thought I&#x27;d try the GiGi brand. It&#x27;s HORRIBLE!!! The wax doesn&#x27;t dry hard enough at all. It will not set! It&#x27;s like i&#x27;m using hard wax mixed with sticky soft wax it&#x27;s ridiculous. It didn&#x27;t take the hair out at the follicle so I have stubs of hairs and bits of wax everywhere. TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> All this wax did for me was to break off the hair to stubble.  I might as well have shaved.  Plus, it left bits all over my skin.  As an added treat, even though I used a collar on my wax warmer I&#x27;m going to need a crowbar to remove the can.</li>
            <li> a few weeks back, I bought Sally Hansen sugar wax from wegmans. I had never used sugar wax before and boy was that a long, painful, horrific night!!! I had wax from one end of the house to the other and my thigh was stuck to itself, my feet were stuck to the floor. The stickiness was enought to make me so angry and frustrated that I wanted to cry. I was honestly scared to ever wax again even though I used to wax some a few years ago. I bought this because it was the \\&quot;hard wax\\&quot;- what I have used before. \\&quot;Hard wax\\&quot; is exactly that- hard, non sticky wax. You do not use the cloth strips to remove the wax and it removes easily from the skin- something compared to candle wax after cooling. The wax does need to be thick and you must work in small sections- I tried 1x1 squares and pulled quickly (key point here- you must pull fast, very fast). You will know the wax is ready when you flick up at it quick with your finger and it easily comes up without stretching like caramel or chipping. It also turns a dull, flat color when it is ready as well. My best suggestion, if you are doing a brazilian, do 2 squares on your leg first. Do one, wait about a minute or so and apply another. You will see the difference in color and it will also allow you to do a trial run as far as thickness and technique. The video I felt helped greatly even though maybe a little outdated. Any waxing is painful but compared to my experience a few weeks back, it was a walk in the park.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years- it is the only bikini wax that doesn&#x27;t tear my delicate skin. The vendor I bought it from through Amazon shipped it in record time. Thank you!</li>
            <li> You definitely need some skill and experience when using this wax. I&#x27;ve actually never waxed myself, so this was probably a lot more painful that it would have been if I had more experience. Still, the wax is great. Where the wax is applied, all hairs are completely removed. Even though it felt like my skin was getting ripped off while I was doing it, probably incorrectly, my skin remained completely in tact and completely pain free once the hair was removed. I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing this wax again once I use what I have now. I feel so smooth!</li>
            <li> My first experience with at-home waxing was with Gigi Brazilian Body Hard Wax, and it nearly made it my last. I am German-Irish; when it comes to the amount of hair on my legs and \\&quot;other\\&quot; body parts, I&#x27;m definitely more German, so I initially skipped doing any research and purchased the Hard Wax, assuming it would be best for someone with a lot of hair (and not as course as I thought). Wrong, wrong, wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recall seeing anywhere that muslin strips were not to be used with this type of wax, so after leaving strip after strip of wax behind on my nether regions and ending up burning myself \\&quot;down there\\&quot; (on my legs, too) because of my ignorance, I finally sought advice on the internet to see what in the world I was doing wrong. Lo and behold, the Hard Wax is to be hand-pulled, NOT used with the strips. Even after getting the proper technique figured out, I couldn&#x27;t help but think that the Hard Wax is either better suited for those with courser hair or those with more waxing experience than me. It was difficult to peel up the edge of it to rip it off and even after I DID get it off, there was still quite a bit of wax left behind. After over 2 hours of torture, tons of wasted muslin, and an enormous mess, I finally finished the job...sort of. I still had an inordinate amount of hair left (too much to tweeze it all)and 4 areas with bruised-looking burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For someone like me, I found the Gigi General Purpose Honee Wax is far more effective and user-friendly. Perhaps the Hard Wax works well for others, but this was a \\&quot;hard\\&quot; lesson learned about following directions before embarking upon a new venture like this.</li>
            <li> Although it may be hard to use, and somewhat painful, it is effective.  I would recommend this product for areas which are hard to wax, as well as the bikini area.  Also this wax is good for stubborn or thick hairs.  The wax does not require muslin strips, which is nice, economically speaking.&lt;br /&gt;I have trouble waxing under my arms and find this to be effective.</li>
            <li> Very hard to use and does not peel off correctly.</li>
            <li> Just used this tonight.  I am regretting this purchase for 3 reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It&#x27;s sooooo hard to clean up.  I have it under my fingernails (from pulling up the strips) and on my legs at various spots where it simply didn&#x27;t pick up with the strips.  It&#x27;s very waxy and sticky and I don&#x27;t know how to get it off.  Compared to a previous wax I used last month (a sugar-based one using paper strips), this is a disaster.  The sugar-based one obviously just cleaned up like sugar does - with water.  No problem at all.  (What I didn&#x27;t like about the sugar one is the fact that you can&#x27;t reuse once you run out of paper strips unless you somehow buy extras.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)  You can&#x27;t heat it up in the microwave!  Did I miss something when I was reading the product description and reviews?  I don&#x27;t remember seeing that you have to have a special warmer to use this thing.  The reason you can&#x27;t put it in the microwave is because the container is made of metal.  I compare it to the wax I used the time before last (which was a hard wax basically identical to this one), which I could heat up in the microwave.  Since I don&#x27;t have a special warmer, I put water in a pan on the stove and placed the pot of wax in that (water did not exceed the height of the can obviously).  As hard as I tried, however, I couldn&#x27;t keep all the wax from getting into the pan.  (I also dropped the whole pot of wax as I was transporting it from the stove and it left a horrible mess on my kitchen appliances - something that would have been a non-issue if I was using the sugar-based wax. . .)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) No applicator!  Where was the applicator?  I had to end up using one of my more round butter knifes to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - It was pretty effective in pulling out the hair (at least as effective as the sugar kind), but with all this trouble, I&#x27;m going to go back to the sugar next time.</li>
            <li> Hey!! all.. to tell you a little about my history. I am an asian and recently moved to North America  permanently. I was used to getting waxed my whole body and was in great difficulty while i moved here because in asia, we just call a woman at home and she does the job in a very reasonable amount of money just like $10 for everything. So, i WAS VERY WORRIED WHEN I CAME HERE.. and after two months of research over the internet and on amazon, I decided to go with doing it myself and started searching products for it. I decided to invest in these products and ordered one gigi honeee combo along with the warmer and muslin roll as well as on e gigi hard wax tin. At first, I thought that I should wait for all my hair to come back since i used the pre wax strips on stores such as walmart and target. Bu then I had some free time and thought lets try it out in my private part. I warmed it in the warmer and it took me nearly 15-20 mins to start melting. I didnt wait for it to melt all the way and started while it was goouyey. I placed some paperss on the bathroom floor and used some baby powder on my private area before doing it. I useda wood spatula and took a thick amount of wax. You can just roll it if the wax dips and wax will be rolled on to spatula just like you roll pasta on fork. This was my first time dong it. I placed a thick strip and waited for about 15 seconds to let it dry.Then tapped it on the lower end to make sure it was dry and picked it up. it GRABED EVERY HAIR. THE experience was painful but i think we all need to sacrifice something to get something aand my hairs were not even grown to the required length. I was afraid buying these products online as i though that i dont end up wasting my money but I am glad it does what it says. The warmer was great too. I really like it that i can do it myseld. Will try the honeey wax in a while and let you all know about it too. You NEED ALOTT OF TIME Thoughto do it completely but hygeine matters the most. Over all..good product!!</li>
            <li> Getting the temp just right is key.</li>
            <li> But while it sets up it takes me that long to get the courage up to pull the strips. The product description was not overly clear to me as to whether I needed strips with this item or not, but it turns out that I did not. However, having used it with strips in a few areas I can definitely say it makes life easier. You definitely have to be patient though.</li>
            <li> My skin felt way better then when I used the pink one. I loved it. I grabs the hair and comed out easy and clean.</li>
            <li> I bought this refill for a kit I bought for my significant other. She&#x27;s very happy with the quality of the hard wax, even though you have to buy the optional cloth strips separately. Fits the GiGi warmer (also sold on Amazon) perfectly.</li>
            <li> I find this much easier to use than the waxing with the strips. When the Brazilian hard cools and hardens, just rip off. Consistanty  should be like honey, if its runny turn down the heat setting and let wax cool a little</li>
            <li> i recommend doing a shot before using this on your bikini region..... maybe two shots. it works really well, but there is some sticky residue, so you should get the removal stuff with it. (unless you like your bikini region to stick to your panties).&lt;br /&gt;I do my eyebrows and my friend&#x27;s with this stuff too. we&#x27;ve saved probably 100s by waxing at home. All it takes is a steady hand and patience. :)</li>
            <li> I wax myself, everything from the eyebrows down. This works great!! I have never had any problems with this wax. Just put a big glab on and wait (not too long, as long as it&#x27;s still sticky but not wet) and pull off. Doesn&#x27;t hurt half as bad as soft wax. Save your self tons of money by just waxing yourself.</li>
            <li> If you are trying to wax any part of your body, I would recommend this wax. There is no need to buy strips or run out and have to run to the store or order more. All you would need for this is applicators and a wax warmer so you don&#x27;t have to stick it in the microwave or have the wax get hard while you are in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ The biggest complaint I&#x27;ve seen is that the wax sticks to everything and can be difficult to get off if you get it on other areas. The cheap fix to this is to use baby powder. It still catches the hair but doesn&#x27;t make it so difficult to pull it off or clean up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just put it on thick, let sit, flip up the end and pull off. It couldn&#x27;t be easier to do a self waxing.</li>
            <li> I purchased this wax to use with my GiGi wax warmer kit. This hard wax works just like the wax at a salon, and gives me the same results. I warm up the wax on high and then keep it just warm enough by switching between medium and low while using it. The faster you get, the less you&#x27;ll have to change the heat. To prevent the wax from sticking to your skin, put on a little bit of oil before you wax. Be sure to use just enough so that it soaks into the skin, but doesn&#x27;t prevent the wax from grabbing onto your hair. I am used to the pain, so good luck to those of you who are just starting out. The hardest part is getting up the courage to rip off the first piece of wax. You won&#x27;t need muslin strips with this wax - just grab a hold and pull!</li>
            <li> I used this wax for a while but it does get a little sticky. I prefer the all purpose body hard wax much better. It seems to take the hair off better. This one may be good for some but others work on me better.</li>
            <li> I bought this item after reading the reviews. It is a good item but needs a lot of patience while using. &lt;br /&gt;Drawback&#x27;s: &lt;br /&gt;1) Since this is used without a strip, the wax layer that u apply on the skin should be thick enough to be pulled. if the layer applied is thin, the wax will not pull off the body and will remain stuck there.....and as per the instructions, it requires a wax pull off lotion which is not supplied with the box. Since i was using it for the first time, i had a rough time removing the wax from my body as i wasnt aware of the thickness of the wax to be required to be pulled. &lt;br /&gt;2) The wax dries off fast while applying, so could do it in small patches which took a lot of time to complete. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only good thing about this wax is that while pulling the layer, it doesn&#x27;t hurt much. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So if you plan to buy this one, don buy it alone. Buy it with the set that has the lotion and spatulas (this is very much required because if u use ur knife...u will just have to throw that).</li>
            <li> I used to get waxed at a salon, and this was the wax they used.  After about a year, I decided to do at-home waxing instead. Now, I&#x27;ve been using this wax on my own for about two years. It&#x27;s really easy to work with (so long as you have the proper heater), and I love not having to deal with stickiness and strips!  Smells fine, and is easy to remove after it dries.</li>
            <li> I bought the Gigi Brazilian Waxing Kit about a year ago, which came with this hard body wax. The first order I got was great! But I ordered a new batch a few months ago and each time I try to use it, it does not dry, it does not stick. It is slimy and greasy and a huge pain to work with. UGH</li>
            <li> Best wax. I have sensitive skin and this wax doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Great wax. Melts quickly and removes all hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried about 10 different kinds of wax for my little warmer and finally I found one I like. It is not stringy! YEA!!!! I like this one very much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having an incredibly hard time with this product!  It makes the biggest mess I&#x27;ve ever seen...takes my nail polish off as I try to pick it off.  From what I&#x27;ve read, it takes some practice to get the knack but it is frustrating in the meantime.  Customer service from this site was excellent.</li>
            <li> I have used this hard body wax by GIGI and have never had any issues with it before... but the last couple cans of wax that I received were the most horrible I have ever used. After using this product for over 3 years I was very disappointed. The wax does not harden, it is a bear to work with and I will be throwing it in the garbage can. I am assuming that they have changed their formula from what it used to be. Please spare yourself the pain and trouble and use a different brand! It&#x27;s not worth the risk!&lt;br /&gt;Very unhappy customer here...</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me at all! It never hardened like it said it would and wouldn&#x27;t come off with a strip either. it was just a thick gooie mess.</li>
            <li> I got some of this to try out and was impressed. I tried shaving and nair and this stuff blows those hair removals away.</li>
            <li> I just recieved this today with the warmer I bought and didn&#x27;t even hesitate to start heating it up. I never must have given much thought to what I was about to do - a self-brazilian wax- but one hour later I was completely hair free. This stuff worked SO awesome. I have been getting professionally waxed at the salon for a year now, and doing it myself was the best decision ever. I did a much better job than any professional has done, and I even waxed one of my friends today, too.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The good thing about hard wax is that it hurts MUCH MUCH less than sugar sticky type wax with strips. It doesn&#x27;t pull off any of your skin and gets the hair right down to the follicle without ripping it at the skin like strip-waxing does. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Buy this stuff. Really. Make sure you get a warmer and spatulas too, or else you will be S.O.L.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all different kinds of wax and the GIGI Hard Wax is by far the best. The trick is to apply a thick layer and never let the wax get too hot. So I&#x27;d suggest warming it up on the low setting even if it takes longer. Also, dont let the wax get too dry on the skin, because then it becomes brittle and hard to pull off.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for quite a while now and I love it. As with almost all professional products, some skill is needed for the best results. If you are a beginner at doing your own waxing this was may not be the best for you. GiGi offers a nice array for all different skill levels, their microwave product a great.</li>
            <li> After the debacle with the GiGi creme wax, I must say that the GiGi Brazillian body hard wax is a wonderfull wax.  This didn&#x27;t hurt half as much as at the salon, no skin pulled, done very thorough by myself.  The wax that I spilled dried fast and was easy to pick up.  The wax goes on easy, dries fast, and pulls off amazingly smooth.  What a great way to get quality at a bargain price.</li>
            <li> I bought this wax so I could save money and give myself bikini waxes.  This wax along with the Gigi wax warmer worked wonderfully.  I gave myself a cleaner wax than any professionals I&#x27;ve been to.  I did not need to go back and pluck missed hairs.</li>
            <li> this is the best wax i&#x27;ve used.   However, if you have sensitive skin, you will have to think about it or oil your skin sufficiently before waxing. I regret I didn&#x27;t buy the lotion and other products for before and after waxing. Please do buy it and don&#x27;t get red irritated skin like me. It took a day or so to calm.    One wonderful thing about this wax is that it does get all the hair off where the wax is applied, but bear in mind it pulls at the skin too!   Nonetheless, though pulls at the skin surface, the epilation of hair itself doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as other gel-type waxes.     I used the space saver warmer and it worked just fine. Plus it saved me some cash on delivery fees because I got the body hard wax and the space saver warmer from the same seller. Just turn off the switch (the space saver warmer only has an on/off switch) when it seems to get too hot, and turn it back on when the wax gets too thick. It&#x27;s really less trouble than it seems from the way I wrote it.     Good luck!</li>
            <li> I love it! It works SO much better than the strips, it removes hair from the root and not from the surface of the skin. Very happy with it!</li>
            <li> So I ordered this and got it within I&#x27;d say 3-4 days! I honestly love it, could not wait to get home and use it. I didn&#x27;t buy the warmer strictly because I didn&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d like the wax or not. I actually warmed the wax in boiled water. Use an old pot added a few cups of water and put the pot in. Had it on medium heat for less than 10 minutes and used the wax no problem. Applied with...wait for it... Popsicle sticks, no problem. I am not a pro and everything worked fine. I don&#x27;t know if I have high pain tolerance or something but literally, pulling band aids hurt more than waxing with this wax and in general. I used this wax to wax my armpits, let the hair grow out a few centimeters and pulled the very few, fine hairs out with a tweezer! No complaints whatsoever! Will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> A must product for brazillian waxing.&lt;br /&gt;I used to wax before but not the gigi wax. It was awfully painful and it took longer to wax everything.&lt;br /&gt;With Gigi Brazillian Hard wax, it is less painful and faster to get rid of hairs.&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy I found this product. This is my second purchase. I will get more, because I do wax almost every month.&lt;br /&gt;Super happy :-)</li>
            <li> Used this wax for years, best wax out there hands down!!</li>
            <li> I use all of the GiGi products for waxing. This one is just as good as the others. It is similar, if not the same, to the hard wax used at salons. When it is completely hot, it is easy to put on. It takes a minute or so to dry on the skin, but is easy to pull off (well, yank off to be more precise!) It smells a little medicinal but you get used to the smell. I would recommend this product for both bikini line and underarm.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t go wrong when buying a replacement. this is great, especially when used with the warming kit that you can also get on amazon.</li>
            <li> For the experienced waxer. Great results if you know what you&#x27;re doing</li>
            <li> I use this for waxing everything - face, armpits, privates.  It works well.  After using soft wax and strips for a while to remove armpit hair, I have found the hard wax to be cleaner and easier to use. I would recommend this for anyone interested in waxing at home. I have also seen this product at my local nail salon (for eyebrow/face waxing).</li>
            <li> That is absolutely not the GIGI Brazilian Hard Wax I used to buy before. This one doesn&#x27;t dry on skin, it remains sticky, it is very hard to remove. Even the color  of the wax is different, it was light green before, this new Gigi is yellowish. I dont know why there is such a difference between 2 cans of the same brand. May be they have changed the formula, may be I was sent not real Gigi at all.</li>
            <li> This is the olny wax I have ever tried for personal use.  Because it works well enough, I haven&#x27;t tried any others.  I have a wax warmer and the wax heats quickly to a nice consistency that is easy to work with.  I tried using it on my nether region several times, but it was so painful, and it didn&#x27;t remove the hair as well as I had hoped.  I tried SEVERAL times as so many other reviewers loved it I thought I just needed practice.  It left behind too much hair down there for the pain that it caused.  SO I now use it for my upper lip, chin and inbetween my eyebrows.  It works pretty well for that.  It takes off most of the hair and any hair left pulls out easiy with tweezers.  I have bought 3 tubs and will continue to use unless someone says there is something better out there.</li>
            <li> Hard wax doesn&#x27;t require muslin strips. Warm it to the viscosity of honey. Then apply it about as thick as a banana skin and let it cool. Touch the top of the wax. If it&#x27;s still sticky, let it set. After it&#x27;s cooled, flick an end and pull it off quickly. This is the most pain-free type wax I have ever used. Less likely to cause wax burn and grips the hair better than soft wax, so there are less ingrown hair problems as well. Works well for the face, under arms and bikini area. And as a bonus? Less mess. Any wax that you drop on a hard surface will come off with your fingernails.</li>
            <li> This product works well for people with sensitive skin! Works awesome and all my sisters were VERY happy! I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone, man or woman!</li>
            <li> I got this wax as part of the GiGi Brazilian Waxing kit, which comes with the warmer and some sticks in addition to this wax. Because I had such a severe reaction to the main ingredient in the wax, which GiGi neglects to include in their extensive list of other warnings, I wanted to post my review here as well. Bottom line is that if you are allergic to the adhesive on self-stick bandages/bandaids/medical tape, rosin, colophony, etc., you are also allergic to this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to like this wax -- in fact, I liked it a lot the first few hours I got it and used it. The warmer for the wax works well, the wax tore off tons of hair once I watched the video a few times and got the technique down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 3 hours later, however, I was in allergic contact dermatitis hell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get skin irritation, rashes, welts, etc. from bandaids, plasters, bandage adhesive, medical tape, or whatever else is similar, or rosin, colophony, etc., do NOT use Gigi Brazilian Hard Body Wax!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get bad rashes and angry, red, raised welts from most self-stick bandages and medical tape. I had no idea that usually the culprit is the sticky rosin or colophony which causes the reaction. That also happens to be *THE* #1 ingredient in this hard wax. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily as a waxing noobie, I only practiced a little on 1 leg and then did both underarms and a bit on one side of my face before I got tired. If I&#x27;d have gone for the gusto with an actual brazilian, I&#x27;d probably be writing this from the hospital. My entire face turned red, hot, and itchy, including my ears, behind my ears, and some of my neck. My armpits are mostly flaring around the edges -- where the hair was thickest and my skin the wrinkliest was luckily spared. My leg took a day to break out in a rash, but now I&#x27;ve got lots of mottled skin, red marks, and pinpricks that are probably from scratching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you wind up reacting to this wax, my advice is to self-medicate with Benadryl internally and hydrocortisone 1% topically. I kept myself in a self-indued semi-coma, sleeping the better part of 2 days with the help of Benadryl. I applied hydrocortisone to all irritated areas 4 times a day (sometimes more, if it was really itchy.) There are creams, sprays, liquid rollerballs, and cooling hydrocortisone forumlas -- I&#x27;ve been using various combinations of all 4 to keep my scratching to a minimum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be proceeding to an allergist and/or dermatologist as soon as I can get someone to fit me in. Until then, I&#x27;ll be hoping Gigi makes a rosin-free hard wax, and staying away from people since I look blotchy, am still hairy, and smell horrible. :( Hopefully my experience can help others avoid the same fate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gigi -- PLEASE start putting a disclaimer on your product that people with adhesive or rosin allergies should not use this stuff!

            <li> This wax is excellent. No need depilatory strips and you can do yourself in the comfort of your home.&lt;br /&gt;Once you discover this product, avoid trips to the aesthetic to make the painful waxing.&lt;br /&gt;It is important to have a towel to spread into the area where it will do the waxing, because when the wax falls to the ground or clothing is difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> I used to go to the salon to get waxed, but it is simply costly. I decided to do it myself. I looked at a few youtube videos and read a few positive customer reviews about this product. The key is to put baby powder on area to be waxed spread thick amount of wax wait until it gets firm and then pull QUICKLY. After rub baby oil to get rid of left over wax residue. If you are not a waxer or do not like the idea of getting waxed this product is NOT FOR YOU. My advice is to do your research and use your best judgement. For the negative comments about the wax does not work, I would say again layer a thick amount of wax. It does work!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected.. Didn&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li> I purchased this wax as a refill for the GIGI waxing kit I bought months ago. I love the kit and the wax! The wax is hard wax so it is less painful and very easy to learn how to do yourself. This product is such a money saver compared to paying high prices for a salon wax and you tend to get better results!</li>
            <li> I too never write reviews so for me to do this that just shows how much I love this product.  I totally agree with Angela&#x27;s suggestions to always use the oil, let the wax on no longer than 20 secs, and most importantly - USE MUSLIM STRIPS.  It makes the process much easier and much much less painful.  It took me only 1/2 hour to do a full brazilian wax and the process was much less painful than what I experienced in the salon.  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Good product.  No cloth strips to mess with.  For tender areas, I suggest a gin &amp; tonic 10 minutes before, plus Ambosol as a numbing agent- spread lightly.  The spray-on numbing agent these guys sell is so-so for effectiveness.</li>
            <li> This GIGI Brazillian Body Hard Wax is the worst type of wax that I&#x27;ve ever used, it&#x27;s so sticky and when it dries is hard to remove without leaving traces on the skin, and also is not gentle on the skin at all. I won&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It a really good quality wax, and melts well in the gigi wax warmer. What more can I say then buy it if your looking for good wax, this can is made for the gigi wax warmer but there is a microwaveable one which I haven&#x27;t tried but for all you wanting to try the wax but don&#x27;t have a wax warmer then get the microwaveable one. I would tell how much it last but I&#x27;m new to waxing and ended up wasting it from improper technique, will buy more when I&#x27;m not too afraid to try waxing again, didn&#x27;t hurt as much as I thought, I&#x27;m just a wimp to pain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a licensed esthetician and I&#x27;ve been doing brazilians for four years. I love Gigi Honee Wax, so I figured I&#x27;d give the hard wax a try. AWFUL. Breaks, crumbles, flakes. I tried to at least use this stuff up waxing my own legs, and it was the most frustrating experience. It ruined my mood and my day. I can&#x27;t imagine a more ineffective hard wax.</li>
            <li> I am european and back there, hard wax is used all the time and it&#x27;s not expensive at all to go to a salon for waxing. Sooooo much different here in the states. I had a hard time finding a place that uses hard wax and when I did, they wanted $60 for a bikini wax!!! So I was happy to find this. It works great and the quality is awesome. Great for home use</li>
            <li> I typically create my own sugaring wax but this time around I ran out and needed a wax asap. After reading some of the reviews I was nervous and hesitant to try the product. I am so glad that I made the purchase, it was both effective and (for me) less painful than standard (soft) waxing. I loved it so much that I&#x27;m contemplating alternating between my own sugaring wax and this product. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> exceeded expectations</li>
            <li> The salon is expensive and annoying, the wax strips dosen&#x27;t works well, shaving: no way! So, What can you do?! Buy Hard Brazilian Wax! I bout it with a wax heater by GIGI and I so happy, great seller, way that way. Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> Much better than strips &amp; sugar wax. A lot less messier and much easier. I&#x27;m so glad I purchased it!</li>
            <li> if this is brazilian wax, I am Giselle Bundchen. Just awful.I have been using wax for 20 years. I always bring my wax from abroad. I chose this wax just because it was hard and usually that&#x27;s the best type of wax to use. However after the first try I just tossed the wax away. It is like trying to wax yourself with chewing gum. It is so sticky that you need rubbing alcohol to clean your hands. Just awful.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I rarely do reviews because I&#x27;m lazy, so to say I took my time out to write this review says ALOT about how much I believe in this wax!!! Great price, almost painless, easy to use, and not messy at all compared to other waxes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;When you remove one strip, DONT THROW IT AWAY!! That strip can be used to remove other strips. Just apply shiney side to shiney side and DONT FORGET TO HOLD SKIN TAUGHT!! Make sure you apply in thick amounts. Other than that it&#x27;s pretty self explanatory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and regular baby oil does WONDERS in removing the excess wax, but the cool thing about it is once the wax hardens, you can kinda just roll it off the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah, I didnt buy the wax warmer either, I just used a small pot of boiling water, placed they wax can in the water and waited till It was melted every where except the center (you dont need the whole can to be melted to wax any area anyways. 1/4 is MORE than enough.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome AWESOME product. Simply amazing, my guy is gonna LOVE the results ;)</li>
            <li> Still learning how to use this wax. It&#x27;s supposed to be the hard kind that doesn&#x27;t require strips. However, I&#x27;ve applied this thinly with strips and it&#x27;s been fine. I&#x27;ll have to try and build it up.</li>
            <li> I removed the inner lining of my crock pot and heated the wax on low (in the tin, of course). I initially had it on high, but the wax gets just a liiiiiittle bit too hot for comfort. Otherwise, this does its job. Discomfort is to be expected, but it&#x27;s relatively minimal.</li>
            <li> excly like in picture, fast shipping, good quality, good price, I am happy with this product, very practic this product, easy to use. Love it</li>
            <li> After using Sally Hansen Extra Strength Brazilian wax for years i found this wax to be kind of hard to use. I decided to switch to this brand because it doesn&#x27;t require having a microwave like Sally Hansen wax and is a lot cheaper. You will need to purchase a wax warmer to use this wax, metallic container is not safe for the microwave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GIGI Brazilian wax goes on nicely, but very difficult to remove because you have to pick it off. Quite messy and sticky.  Not sure how long i&#x27;m supposed to let it dry - very mixed suggestions in other reviews, but if it&#x27;s soft it sticks to my fingers and when it dries out completely it gets brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since most reviewers are very happy with this product i tend to think i don&#x27;t know what i&#x27;m doing rather than it&#x27;s a bad product, will have to revisit this review in few months when i&#x27;m more familiar with this wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----------edit:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after a few months with this sticky uncontrollable mess i decided that this particular wax is not for me. Changed rating from 3 stars to 2 because my experience with this product does not get any less annoying</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still getting the hang of it, but I&#x27;m getting better and better.&lt;br /&gt;This wax removes hair pretty well, and does not hurt much, if done correctly.&lt;br /&gt;I have a few pieces of wax left over on my legs because I applied the layer too thinly at the edges, but it is not hard to take it off.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m satisfied, this is exciting and fun!</li>
            <li> Received product fairly quickly, and used it today for the first time.  I was very happy with the warmer - Took about 20-25 mins on high to heat wax, I then set it to medium for a few mins and did my waxing.  I had no issues with the warmer or the wax.  I read a few reviews saying how bad the wax was - with hard wax you need to spread to the right consistency, let it cool slightly and pull it off before it gets to hard.  No problems - worked great.  I am a very happy consumer.</li>
            <li> With this product you save time, you eliminate the mess and you don&#x27;t even have to use the cloths.  It takes almost all the hairs from the area and is really easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great product, a little messy but certainly works. Took every last hair! Cleanup was a pain but I can tell that with practice, it will go alot easier. Totally recommend</li>
            <li> This wax works great for both fine and coarse hair. I&#x27;ve been able to use this wax every where with out issue. I&#x27;m not left with any redness or welting or pain.  It does smell like honey (I hate the smell of honey) but it&#x27;s a faint smell so it&#x27;s not so bad.</li>
            <li> This product works very well with the warmer! I use the wax for my bikini area and I do it myself. While it takes awhile to do, it does work!</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying hard wax on myself and I was quite surprised. I was expecting it to be just as hurtful as other wax, but it actually didn&#x27;t really hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really like that I can turn my melting pot off and the wax can still be used for quite some time afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be ordering some more soon.</li>
            <li> I received this item on time. It&#x27;s a great product and it really helps removing unwanted hair. It does hurt a little. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to remove their unwanted hair and isn&#x27;t afraid of feeling a bit pain.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the best hard wax around, but it really does get the job done, although I feel that other waxes stick less to the skin after you remove it. I would recommend it, but I find it a bit more painful to use than other hard waxes.</li>
            <li> I give it a 5 because the wax worked well. I think I will order some more when I get the chance.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this wax. On the lowest setting of the Gigi warmer it is still very fluid and drips of the applicator which makes things messy. When it&#x27;s actually on my skin, it sticks on the skin very much, not just on the hairs. Moreover, it often breaks when I try to pull it off. As a result, it&#x27;s even harder to get the rest of the wax off.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer more flexible (elastic) wax which doesn&#x27;t break when you pull it off. I will not buy this wax anymore.</li>
            <li> This keeps the mess in the container.  I like that, but think it should come with instructions for beginners like me.</li>
            <li> Love this wax.  About rip my skin of everytime I wax, but it&#x27;s my fault.  Still trying to learn to wax right!!  If it&#x27;s too thick of a strip, then the PAIN will come!!  After you finally rip it off your skin! Finally realized I need to make them thinner. Only took about 2 years!  Hate doing it myself, but can&#x27;t complain when this container lasts months and is less than half the price of 1 salon wax!</li>
            <li> Works well, and gets out most of the hairs (I use it for my arms), I just use the cheap popsicle sticks you can buy around a 100 per box. Prior to purchasing I read reviews saying to microwave the wax, DO NOT MICROWAVE THIS! It&#x27;s in a metal container and it&#x27;s dangerous to microwave metal objects (could catch the entire microwave on fire). So if you don&#x27;t want to buy the gigi wax heater you can always break the container (a little difficult) until the pieces of wax shatters, then microwave the pieces of wax in a container you don&#x27;t mind devoting to wax since its difficult to wash off.</li>
            <li> I am not new to waxing, but have always used Gigi&#x27;s soft waxes, for, well, ALMOST everywhere, the all purpose honee being my favorite. I always wax the upper bikini area with no problems, but decided to try this one for the lower part since it has so many positive reviews (the wax..not my lower parts:)&lt;br /&gt;First, please know how to use hard, stripless wax. Maybe, be a bit smarter than me and test it out on your leg or something first until you get the hang of it. Now, I have used Gigi microwave stripless wax, and it is nowhere near as sticky as this one. Second, make very sure that you have the oil to remove the wax handy. That&#x27;s very important. Very very important. I placed a sticky glob of this wax on a quarter sized area, and it stuck. Like a glue ball. So, after trying to pull it out with no luck, I heated up my soft wax and tried to wax it off that way, which removed about half of it. Then I ended up scraping the rest off in the shower with a cheap razor. Never ever again. I would give this product no stars. None.. If you are going to try this wax, have the oil to remove it handy!</li>
            <li> The hard wax is definitely better than its counter part. I normally use the hard wax for smaller areas like lip and under arms. If you use it on larger areas (legs and such) it takes forever! Definitely watch a Youtube video about application procedures. You&#x27;ll save yourself a lot of time and pain.</li>
            <li> It is one of the best hair removal product.. no mess.. no need to be a professional to do it! But a little bit pricy!..</li>
            <li> This is the only wax I use on my body. I have used it for years. You can use it pretty much anywhere. The only problem is if you get it too hot it sets really hard, very quickly and then it breaks off in tiny pieces instead of in one continuous strip like you intended.</li>
            <li> This is the worst wax ever. I have used hard waxes before and I have never had such a horrible experience. Do not buy this, it is a waste of money. It dries too fast and gets flaky, which is incredibly hard to get off! I gave up an hour in.</li>
            <li> Looked good but didn&#x27;t work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would rather go with a different kind of wax - this one was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this product 5 stars even though it is SUPER messy, maybe I just need more practice. No matter what I use (soap, hot or cold water, baby oil, fingernail polish), I can not get the wax off my fingernails. I also didn&#x27;t realize you couldn&#x27;t put this in the microwave before I bought it, and I don&#x27;t have a warmer, so I placed a small pot of water on the stove, on the medium setting, and set the wax container inside and the wax melted perfectly after 3-5 min and stayed creamy until I was finished with it. I tried this first on my arms, so I can get an idea of how to do it, and so far my arms look great, I got a little annoyed and discouraged when it started getting messy. Next time I&#x27;m going to try to put the baby oil on first before waxing since it&#x27;s hard to get the wax off after.</li>
            <li> Does the job, I used to buy the wax strips and only got rid of 50% of body hair. First time is a bit painful but after that it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> This item is horrible. Does not not work for the intended use. If you want to go with a hair wax do not choose this product. One, maybe two stars max. Just overall not a good product whatsoever.</li>
            <li> The wax takes a long time to dry and it&#x27;s hard to grab it to yank it off so I won&#x27;t be getting it again</li>
            <li> I always get this type of wax for my underarms, eye brows and bikini line. It&#x27;s great! So much easier than the strips! I buy this here because it&#x27;s a bit cheaper than at the beauty store.</li>
            <li> I love this wax already!! The first time I used it, I barely felt the hair being taken off! Heats up quickly, and gets the job done!</li>
            <li> This is not as effective as hot wax but i like that it doesn&#x27;t stick to the skin and hence very effective and gentle for the face. Using this for Brazilian or bikini area is very very painful. I do not recommend it for that area. Hot wax is must faster and less pain.</li>
            <li> I gave two stars because it&#x27;s painful on the bikini line (what I bought it for). I followed all the great reviews on here from everyday people but I found it painful &amp; messy. It leaves pieces of wax in spots on the skin. I have to slather on lotion afterwards &amp; then pick, pick, pick, until it all comes off. I thought it would be cleaner &amp; easier than that but it&#x27;s not. If you&#x27;re not a professional, you may have ISSUES like I do. But I still use it when I need to &amp; it does seem the hair grows back slower. It does NOT prevent ingrowns though. 1st time I used it, I got a horrible one that&#x27;s still a dark brown scar, over a month later. I&#x27;m a fair-skinned Caucasian.</li>
            <li> I originally tried this product because I bought the gigi waxing kit which included this. (which I recommend if you&#x27;re starting out and need everything all at once for a good price) ANYWHOO, I&#x27;ve been buying this as a refill ever since. Great product.</li>
            <li> Bought this and the starter kit with warmer device, wooden spatulas, and lotions in order to save on Brazilian waxing. Yes, it takes me a lot longer than the 30 minutes at the salon, but if your priority is to save money, like $80 per Brazilian, then this wax is the way to go! The first time, it took me 3-4 hours, yikes. It hurts only a little more than the salon, but only because you have to apply and yank off so many times. It takes so darn long when you can hardly see what you&#x27;re doing, even with mirrors propped at all sorts of angles. After a few times, I got it down to 1.5 hours, not too shabby. Sometimes I can do a little over 1 hour. One can lasts about three Brazilian waxes for me. At one Brazilian a month, I usually buy about three to four cans a year. If you have the time, home Brazilians are a great bargain with this wax.</li>
            <li> I tried many types and brands of waxes in my quest for easy home waxing. This wax was the best of the hard wax no strip required variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you get the hang of the correct thickness of application and proper application temperature it works amazingly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a strong wax but I still never had it damage delicate skin.  Clean up on skin is best left to the Gigi Wax remover lotion (trust me, I tried everything and the wax remover is worth the $$).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean up on your heating unit or counter top/floor is best handled by pointing your blow dryer at the spot on high heat, melting the wax and wiping it up with a paper towel.</li>
            <li> Best wax I&#x27;ve used and I have tried many. I use it with muslin strips and its easy almost pain free waxing.</li>
            <li> Dear Lord, this is the worst wax ever. I used to give myself Brazilians and I bought it at a beauty store and thought it be like a salon wax. But no!!!! It took forever to harden and when it did, it didn&#x27;t come off much at all. Removing it was ridiculous. I wasted an hour of my life and $25ish. I&#x27;m writing Gigi and requesting an exchange.</li>
            <li> Not the greatest wax.  It is okay but I found that the wax doesn&#x27;t bond well with the hair at times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many types/brands of wax over the years and this is my favorite. I am no longer tempted to even try the next, newest type. I wax my underarms, legs and Brazilian areas myself and this just works best.</li>
            <li> This wax is the best wax I have ever used. I totally recommend this product[[ASIN:B0002XI30Y GIGI Brazillian Body Hard Wax]]</li>
            <li> Ok so I used the hard wax for the 1st time today. I thought I&#x27;d get my entire legs done but it just didn&#x27;t get the hair all off. So I used it on my arm pits, applied it thickly, waited then flicked the end &amp; snatched off the hair. I must say it worked beautifully. So for larger areas like your legs, it&#x27;ll take a long time to do. I&#x27;d recommend using the honee wax on legs, it&#x27;s faster &amp; all the hair comes off in bigger sections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok so I have the Gigi wax warmer. I actually set it to low for some hours and came back but the consistency wasn&#x27;t thick. So I took the wax out of the warmer &amp; put my honee wax to warm up as I did my arm pits. It should be thick enough to roll on your spatula, apply thickly, wait til it slightly hardens then flick it &amp; pull in the opposite direction. I was able to go over my skin again &amp; again w/ this wax bc it doesn&#x27;t rip off your skin. Then I started using my honee wax and just finished my legs &amp; thighs. Gigi Brazilian Hard Wax&#x3D; no strips, Gigi Honey All purpose Wax&#x3D; use strips!&lt;br /&gt;The hard wax in the 14oz can isn&#x27;t enough to do my legs so to save time &amp; money I used the honee (soft) wax.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck &amp; Happy Waxing.</li>
            <li> Item was as expected and described. Item was packaged and wrapped in plastic. I prefer the hard wax too the strips and this wax works great. Love the Gigi brand.</li>
            <li> I was realy excited when I ordered it but as soon as I applied it, the nightmare begun. It didn&#x27;t come out. I used the oil to remove it but it took a lot of rubbing and lots of oil and entire day to take it out. DO NOT EVER USE THIS!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same thing that Sally&#x27;s carries, but with a different label. I didn&#x27;t like either of them, they&#x27;re the same.&lt;br /&gt;I am still not sure if you&#x27;re supposed to use strips with it or not. It doesn&#x27;t seem to work well either way, although I like this line.</li>
            <li> Just what i needed to wax my self very happy with this wax ....</li>
            <li> it does the job you looking for, along the strips, also from GIGI, and the small spatula, the perfect combination so far.</li>
            <li> i guess there&#x27;s a reason why they sell a warmer for additional cost...but this wax has a strong hold and gets the job done effectively.</li>
            <li> Works without any other products.  It is the only wax we use in our household.  Easy and not messy. Thanks</li>
            <li> Have tried homemade sugar wax, and other brands of wax that requires the strips of cloth...but it depends on your hair type and area. The only brand i&#x27;ve had consistent success with in the pubic area, is this one.</li>
            <li> I have never waxed or been waxed but managed to do it with a minimum amount of mess.  Of course the wax is sticky but it works perfectly and a little planing up front goes a long way.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m currently on my second tin of this stuff. bought the first tin with the Gigi warmer kit; I absolutely love this stuff. It&#x27;s easy for me to apply on my bikini area (and then some) and remove. I highly recommend getting the pre-epilation oil; makes the hard wax a dream to remove. Otherwise you&#x27;re risking pulling skin up with your hair. I have a high pain-tolerance, so waxing doesn&#x27;t bother me. If you&#x27;re worried about the pain, the pre-epilation oil helps a great deal, you should be able to find a skin-numbing serum somewhere on this site, and a stiff drink always helps, too :)</li>
            <li> This hard wax is easy to use and relatively low pain.  It heats up in about 15 minutes and is ready to go.  I usually get 4 applications per jar</li>
            <li> When I go to a professional salon, they use this wax for the bikini area. They also charge $50+ for a bikini wax.&lt;br /&gt;Hoping to save money, I bought this wax and I do have to say, I&#x27;m impressed.&lt;br /&gt;I used this on my bikini area, my underarms, and some very sensitive and tough to wax areas like my knees and the back of my knees.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this product. I have very sensitive skin, and very course hair with sometimes 2-3 hair follicles growing together. This wax takes out almost every hair, and leaves my skin the least irritated of all the waxes I&#x27;ve tried so far.&lt;br /&gt;Tricks I have learned on using this:&lt;br /&gt;1. It requires a good 20 minutes to heat up in the warmer. Set it on High for 20 minutes if it&#x27;s a full can. Then turn the warmer down to low. Wait about 10 minutes, check consistency. You may need to move the warmer setting from off to low to maintain the consistency you want: a very thick honey. It should pour off your applicator not like syrup but very slow like honey.&lt;br /&gt;2. Twist your applicator around and around to make sure to keep the wax on your applicator and not get those strings flying everywhere. Keep twisting your applicator until you get it very close to the area you want to wax.&lt;br /&gt;3. Use baby powder or talcum powder before application. You don&#x27;t need to buy any fancy Gigi powder. It works far better on my skin then any pre-wax oil. The baby powder will make sure the wax adheres to the hair and not your skin.&lt;br /&gt;4. Apply in small and thick patches. Go big and regret it. I keep my application sizes to the size of a quarter to about an inch wide by 3 inches long. Keep them small and it will be easy to control.&lt;br /&gt;5. Someone said that you can pull this wax off after 20 seconds. No way. It takes a good 60 seconds before I can even feel if the wax is not tacky anymore. Somewhere between 60-90 seconds, pull up a little lip of wax at the bottom from which you will pull. If you pull it up and it&#x27;s still sticky, just push the wax back down and give it a couple of good pats. Count 30 seconds, then try pulling again.&lt;br /&gt;6. Put down a lot of newspaper when using any wax. It will save your surfaces and you a big headache.&lt;br /&gt;7. Clean up on this wax is pretty easy. Once it cools, it just breaks off. And if you wait too long to remove it, it will break into pieces. You will have to learn the correct timing for removal. Trial and error.&lt;br /&gt;8. Use baby oil for removal. You don&#x27;t need any fancy wax removers. Baby oil works great. Apply a good decent coat, let it sit in your skin a good 10 minutes, then jump in the shower and it comes off very easily.&lt;br /&gt;9. Never go out into sun, go tanning, go in chlorinated pool, or use harsh scrubs or soaps on your skin within 24 hours of waxing. Your skin needs time to recover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope these recommendations help. I know reading all the reviewers on Amazon has made my waxing experience way easier. Good luck and happy money savings :)x back down and give it a couple of good pats. Count 30 seconds, then try pulling again.&lt;br /&gt;6. Put down a lot of newspaper when using any wax.
