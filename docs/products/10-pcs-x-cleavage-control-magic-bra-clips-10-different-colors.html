            <li> I was worried that they would be poorly made or break easily</li>
            <li> its a little hard to put it on when i cant really reach my back, not really flexable in that area...  </li>
            <li> These are just as i expected.</li>
            <li> It is a bit small though not meant for big triple D cups</li>
            <li> BUT gatta watch out for little sharp areas.</li>
            <li> Also i found out that you have to losen your bra starps a little when you put these on so that it dosent dig in to your skin because the straps are tight.</li>
            <li> found couple where the finish edges are not smooth.</li>
            <li> Just a little too small.</li>
            <li> It makes your bra very tight and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> , unfortunately u need another person to help u out on putting this in..&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>

            <li> Simple design, awesome effect!</li>
            <li> primarily ordered to keep my straps on my shoulders.  Works well.</li>
            <li> Product as described.</li>
            <li> very flimsy as soon as I clip it on it either breaks or it hurts</li>
            <li> I got the package on time and no issues with the product.</li>
            <li> So far so good. These are sturdy and do the job, Fun colors.</li>
            <li> Very nice bundle. Saves me a lot of money from buying a couple for the same price at a shop. The color are nice and the plastic are made out good. its not thin or cheap. BUT gatta watch out for little sharp areas. found couple where the finish edges are not smooth. had to use a knife to scrape those areas and make it smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;needs getting used to though. its a little hard to put it on when i cant really reach my back, not really flexable in that area...  Also i found out that you have to losen your bra starps a little when you put these on so that it dosent dig in to your skin because the straps are tight.</li>
            <li> flimsy... does not work</li>
            <li> These are great little clips for keeping straps hidden while wearing sleeveless tops.  Great for keeping a more professional appearance when needed.</li>
            <li> 10 pcs x Cleavage Control Magic Bra Clips, best price, fast shipping. Works great because My wife likes it small and can change color with her clothings.</li>
            <li> Work great.... can be a  little tight on some bras, but other than that.. love it!</li>
            <li> Too small,next time will order larger</li>
            <li> Not used yet but am sure they will work for me.</li>

            <li> durable and work great</li>
            <li> These are just as i expected. I love all the colors and it is easy for me to put on and it slides up and down smoothly. I didn&#x27;t want to buy another bra just because I was wearing a razor back shirt. These are perfect</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how many women have trouble with their bra straps or bathing suit straps staying on their shoulders, but I do. These are life savers.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used yet but seem strong.</li>
            <li> i got it in no time and have been surprised at how useful they are&lt;br /&gt;no more getting in trouble at work for too much cleavage!</li>
            <li> Great to have around in a variety of colors.  Shared with my daughters and granddaughters and they agree.</li>
            <li> Does not work for someone with a C cup or larger. It makes your bra very tight and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> This is a great price for 10 clips!  I&#x27;ve always put off buying some of these but now I can&#x27;t live without them!  I was worried that they would be poorly made or break easily but I&#x27;ve abused them and I&#x27;m happy.  The variety of colors is nice as well.</li>
            <li> Just a little too small. Otherwise enchanted with the colors...would definitely purchase again.  Do you have them larger as I am a dd cup?</li>
            <li> These are great but mine broke</li>
            <li> Thank yoU!  Clips are great!</li>
