    <ol>
            <li>I will say that I am very happy that Amazon is beginning to advertise this and sell the product</li>

            <li>One of the best products I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>Great condition when received product!</li>
            <li>The product is great!</li>
            <li>I had a friend on Facebook selling this miracle cream with very impressive before and after photos</li>
            <li>and I figured I would be a perfect candidate.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had the chance to use it, but the face version is superb</li>
            <li>See plenty of Nerium &amp;#34;customers&amp;#34; photos with perfect results.</li>
            <li>(Photoshop is a wonderful tool)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a happy customer for over a year!</li>
            <li>Worked very good, hpy w/ results</li>
            <li>and I&amp;#34;m so impressed with how great it works.  </li>
            <li>Which is GREAT.</li>
            <li>Great shipping and timing.</li>
            <li>Works great with neoprene belt ...</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be returning it, and when my time comes, I plan to buried with a tube of this great stuff.</li>
            <li>Great cream.</li>
            <li>However, it was priced at a great price.</li>
            <li>It gives best results when applied twice a day in the beginning and after a warm bath.</li>
            <li>Product is working very nicely.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>Truly amazing product!</li>
            <li>As with most &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; creams, I saw marginal results at best.</li>
            <li>absorbs well and pleasant odor.</li>
            <li>Waiting for good results, hopefully.</li>
            <li>My arms are still jiggly, but the lotion feels good and I am still using it.</li>
            <li>I have seen others with good results</li>
            <li>However, I have heard good results from others who have been using it.</li>
            <li>good feeling on my skin</li>
            <li>Good luck imoisters.</li>
            <li>It was a good lotion for hydrating, however I did not seem any lifting.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to be a fan of Network Marketing to find good products which are distributed through the business model.</li>
            <li>or I would be more than happy to be your contact for buying this product.</li>
            <li>The seller was great with shipping, but the product itself is nothing more than just a lotion.</li>
            <li>While I still love capris, its great to be able to wear a nice pair of shorts again!</li>
            <li>I hope I was able to answer lots of the concerns on here!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>You can even get your product for free!!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>if you want to know for sure what you are putting on your skin buy from a Nerium Brand Partner, NOT from Amazon or EBay!</li>
            <li>This product is truly amazing</li>
            <li>and I have gotten amazing results.</li>
            <li>Fast &amp; good product!!</li>
            <li>I really liked the product.</li>
            <li>I liked the product</li>
            <li>Great stuff really works !!!</li>
            <li>If it were THAT easy everyone would be doing it &amp; it&#x27;d cost a lot more than this!</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a couple of months, and I can see a huge difference!</li>
            <li>This in itself is an important fact to know!</li>
            <li>I love my results.</li>
            <li>:) contact me and I&#x27;ll help you.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love Nerium</li>
            <li>LOVE this product....</li>
            <li>My favorite summer go-</li>
            <li>I would LOVE to say that this worked for me, but it just didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Maybe it takes more than one bottle?  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love the idea, but I haven&#x27;t observed results yet</li>
            <li>That works better.</li>
            <li>But I still hope I see better changes...</li>
            <li>All the way to the bank and our favorite charity.</li>
            <li>Love it, will never be without this product.</li>
            <li>I had better results with the EVELINE Cosmetics brand firming lotions.</li>
            <li>Sure notice a difference of tightening and smoothing.  </li>
            <li>It was a lot more</li>
            <li>Arrived and the bottle was very warm and the lotion sounded very watery.</li>
            <li>Again, this product really works and does amazing things to peoples skins!</li>
            <li>I have used many many cellulite creams and I&#x27;m amazed at how fantastic this works.  </li>
            <li>I Love this lotion, smell is great, no greasy feel, wish the tube was bigger!</li>
            <li>The math is easy...</li>
            <li>I received the product very quickly and I have noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>Great price... a lot lower than on the actually site.</li>
            <li>Its filled up to the brown line.  </li>
            <li>The skin is smooth, but any cheaper lotion could do that.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s a great 5-star product, but it&#x27;s only backed by the company if you buy from them.</li>
            <li>The firming cream is actually ok -- not a 5-star item, but worth a try.</li>
            <li>and you can participate in the Refer 3 program and get product for Free.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that this product needs to be in its original packaging.</li>
            <li>I noticed a significant difference in skin tone after a four week period of use.</li>
            <li>Not as excited about this one</li>
            <li>It was like water and not at all like the original.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s used right it works!</li>
            <li>I probably haven&#x27;t used enough of it to do some good, (I am 58 and have plenty of cellulite)</li>
            <li>It has a light fresh scent.</li>
            <li>used this product for 3 months and love love it, I made sure to take before and after photos because it&#x27;s too hard for me to remember if a crake, dryness, or sage is better or not,</li>
            <li>This person shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Because of the cost I was only able to try one tube, but I&#x27;ll add nobody can expect a pill or a cream to fix them magically.</li>
            <li>Using it mainly on my &amp;#34;bingo wings&amp;#34; and was amazed with how much better they look.</li>
            <li>Item received quickly and as shown</li>
            <li>I agreed to try it, though, because a friend recommended it highly, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m very aware of every lump on my legs.  </li>
            <li>Order from gotmyglow.nerium.com for real results!!</li>
            <li>Which is great for me because I have 6 children even though I&#x27;m a size 6 but was told I&#x27;d only be able to have surgery to tighten the loose skin in my belly.</li>
            <li>Ok....so there is a lot of good questions people have been asking on here about this product and a lot of them are unanswered.</li>
            <li>I know many people, including myself, that have bought products through Amazon and it was either altered or old...</li>
            <li>I was already using the face cream, which by the way is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I must be honest, one star only because I have just begun using the product</li>
            <li>When Brand Partners read this nonsense about how the product doesn&#x27;t work, we laugh....</li>
            <li>If it works it will be worth every penny.</li>
            <li>watery came right out the bottle</li>
            <li>The real product works, but to get a money back guarantee and great offers buy through a legit Nerium Rep.</li>
            <li>but it was better, but the extra hanging of skin it dramatically tightened that right up.</li>
            <li>I used  it exactly as prescribed on the bottle.....</li>
            <li>I even took several before photos to be sure.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through the first bottle of this stuff</li>
            <li>but the results wasn&#x27;t as fast as they explained it would be!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not looking any better a month later.</li>
            <li>, that is why I am interested in and purchased.  </li>
            <li>At a later date, I will be able to comment.</li>
            <li>It really does work!</li>
            <li>There are no guarantees about quality unless you buy it straight from the source!</li>
            <li>This product along with their facial products is nothing but a way to make their sellers wealthy.</li>
            <li>Once in the morning then again at night after a hot shower and exfoliating.</li>
            <li>Really does work!</li>
            <li>am 33 years old and eat clean, drink tons of water and work out vigorously almost every day.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;Finally... I am NOT a Nerium rep and I am NOT receiving any incentive for this positive review.</li>
            <li>so I go though it pretty fast.  </li>
            <li>It certainly doesn&#x27;t hold up to all the before &amp; after shots or positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I used it on my stomach after having 3 large boys.  </li>
            <li>I think once you stop your cellulite and firmness will go right back to the way it was before so in the long run it&#x27;s not cost effective</li>
            <li>Nerium Firm is amazing.</li>
            <li>I decided to sell the product myself BECAUSE it really works</li>
            <li>I believe any product takes a couple of months, to really see a difference.</li>
            <li>This product is not the real one.</li>
            <li>know they are really strict on things that have expiration</li>
            <li>and I can really see a difference in texture, tone, and also</li>
            <li>I do not think this is the real product</li>
            <li>Really worked for me.</li>
            <li>and my whole stomach is killing me.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t care so much for the product.  </li>
            <li>The product is very runny</li>
            <li>Really didn&#x27;t see a difference in my skin after using this.</li>
            <li>Worked very well for me.</li>
            <li>Thanks for shipping my order again.  </li>
            <li>I tried the whole thing in hopes it just needed time to work and at the end nothing, not change didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li>Really???</li>
            <li>I really do like this cream.  </li>
            <li>and yes my legs are so much smoother</li>
            <li>product box was damaged and product was really runny...</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li>But it did absolutely nothing at all.</li>
            <li>Over priced network marketing company representatives selling their free supplies to get back their investment because it does not work as advertised.</li>
            <li>There is no 30 day money back guarantee or 3 UR Free program when bought through Amazon or EBay like when you purchase through a Brand Partner.  </li>
            <li>This did absolutely nothing for that area.</li>
            <li>If it really didn&#x27;t work, then you did something incorrectly.  </li>
            <li>I really did not expect any results but thought I&#x27;d give it a try</li>
            <li>I think it really works on smoothing out cellultie on hamstrings and triceps.  </li>
            <li>The product goes way too fast for the amount of money...</li>
            <li>This product really works😃</li>
            <li>-- so I didn&#x27;t hold out much hope for the body cream.</li>
            <li>Using firming cream day n night really haven&#x27;t seen any difference..</li>
            <li>If you go to the website you will see thousands of pictures of real customers displaying their results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for two months now on my arms and legs and there really is a noticeable difference in skin texture and firmness-- surprising given the negative reaction I had to the face creams.</li>
            <li>The proprietary blend NAE-8 becomes inactive outside of its original packaging after 8-12 hours.</li>
            <li>This is a scam cause i bought as original and came in a different bottle nothing like in picture...</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t care for this as it seems watered down from the&lt;br /&gt;Neriums that I purchase direct from Nerium isn&#x27;t effective</li>
            <li>to, can&#x27;t live without product!</li>
            <li>OK I&#x27;m not going to post my pictures because I don&#x27;t want them &amp;#34;out there&amp;#34; but I&#x27;ve been using this for less than a week and my folded over</li>
            <li>but I do see less loss skin and my skin is much more smoother</li>
            <li>but mainly it firms</li>
            <li>After about 14 days of non-continuous use there was a highly visible difference.  </li>
            <li>I am sure it will take longer than a few weeks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a much better a product than the nerium firm.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure it was from the Nerium Firm until I stopped using it for a couple months.  </li>
            <li>still used lets see in few more days.</li>
            <li>Seeing overall improvement in skin texture..not overwhelming results, but hopeful with continued use it will be more dramatic..</li>
            <li>New product to me.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mean to bash, but the thing I love about Nerium is the real people.</li>
            <li>and I look exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>Had taken before pics on first day, could not tell ANY difference after all that hassel of following the process!</li>
            <li>Whether they are half used or been filled with water.</li>
            <li>As a direct Brand Partner for Nerium</li>
            <li>I have used the real one and its texture and smell is different.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t purchase mine from a rep because $70 is just too much money back guarantee or not.</li>
            <li>It must be sold directly from the Brand Partner.</li>
            <li>So far I like it.</li>
            <li>I will not waste my money again.</li>
            <li>I have had 2 kids that has left my belly with saggy skin that no matter how much time I spend in the gym I can&#x27;t got rid of.</li>
            <li>, I worked out, I completely changed my diet and...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had wrinkled, sagging skin all over my body since I was in my early 40&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I see tons of results - may be false - on Facebook with amazing results in two weeks.  </li>
            <li>I get mine directly from the company</li>
            <li>No difference so far.  </li>
            <li>I purchased direct from Nerium.  </li>
            <li>Started a week or so after receiving so haven&#x27;t had enough time really to tell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it as  directed for several weeks and absolutely nothing has happened.</li>
            <li>The product did not firm up areas I believed it would based on description of product.</li>
            <li>it came to me in on old beat up box.</li>
            <li>The cream was brown and old.  </li>
            <li>At 49 years old I had quit wearing shorts do to dimpling on my thighs.</li>
            <li>When I started up again, the rash came right back in the same place.  </li>
            <li>Plus, the tube seemed half full.</li>
            <li>The tube is only half full!</li>
            <li>My stomach was pretty &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; just had loose skin.</li>
            <li>In other words, with Nerium you can try the product for &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; and if you don&#x27;t like it you can return it in its original packaging to include the receipt and you have your MONEY BACK!</li>
            <li>I saw so many pics of successful results and mine is even worst.</li>
            <li>and you will be billed every month on the same day and sent a new product to continue using</li>
            <li>I love this company and it makes me sad to see people get our bottles but not our real product.&lt;br /&gt;Www.larskincare.nerium.com&lt;br /&gt;Lar.skincare@gmail.com</li>
            <li>If you are a potential customer, just know that by buying here you are losing out on the 100% money back guarantee, as well as other special offers, such as 2 for 1 until the end of May.</li>
            <li>I had absolutely no results from this product and talked to a rep for this product and thinks is was not the real product...</li>
            <li>but I barely see results</li>
            <li>The whole tube is empty with no results.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> or I would be more than happy to be your contact for buying this product.</li>
            <li> The seller was great with shipping, but the product itself is nothing more than just a lotion.</li>
            <li> While I still love capris, its great to be able to wear a nice pair of shorts again!</li>
            <li> I hope I was able to answer lots of the concerns on here!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> You can even get your product for free!!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> if you want to know for sure what you are putting on your skin buy from a Nerium Brand Partner, NOT from Amazon or EBay!</li>
            <li> This product is truly amazing</li>
            <li> and I have gotten amazing results.</li>
            <li> Fast &amp; good product!!</li>
            <li> I really liked the product.</li>
            <li> I liked the product</li>
            <li> Great stuff really works !!!</li>
            <li> If it were THAT easy everyone would be doing it &amp; it&#x27;d cost a lot more than this!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a couple of months, and I can see a huge difference!</li>
            <li> This in itself is an important fact to know!</li>
            <li> I love my results.</li>
            <li> :) contact me and I&#x27;ll help you.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I love Nerium</li>
            <li> LOVE this product....</li>
            <li> My favorite summer go-</li>
            <li> I would LOVE to say that this worked for me, but it just didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Maybe it takes more than one bottle?  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love the idea, but I haven&#x27;t observed results yet</li>
            <li> That works better.</li>
            <li> But I still hope I see better changes...</li>
            <li> All the way to the bank and our favorite charity.</li>
            <li> Love it, will never be without this product.</li>
            <li> I had better results with the EVELINE Cosmetics brand firming lotions.</li>
            <li> Sure notice a difference of tightening and smoothing.  </li>
            <li> It was a lot more</li>
            <li> Arrived and the bottle was very warm and the lotion sounded very watery.</li>
            <li> Again, this product really works and does amazing things to peoples skins!</li>
            <li> I have used many many cellulite creams and I&#x27;m amazed at how fantastic this works.  </li>
            <li> I Love this lotion, smell is great, no greasy feel, wish the tube was bigger!</li>
            <li> The math is easy...</li>
            <li> I received the product very quickly and I have noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> Great price... a lot lower than on the actually site.</li>
            <li> Its filled up to the brown line.  </li>
            <li> The skin is smooth, but any cheaper lotion could do that.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a great 5-star product, but it&#x27;s only backed by the company if you buy from them.</li>
            <li> The firming cream is actually ok -- not a 5-star item, but worth a try.</li>
            <li> and you can participate in the Refer 3 program and get product for Free.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that this product needs to be in its original packaging.</li>
            <li> I noticed a significant difference in skin tone after a four week period of use.</li>
            <li> Not as excited about this one</li>
            <li> It was like water and not at all like the original.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s used right it works!</li>
            <li> I probably haven&#x27;t used enough of it to do some good, (I am 58 and have plenty of cellulite)</li>
            <li> It has a light fresh scent.</li>
            <li> used this product for 3 months and love love it, I made sure to take before and after photos because it&#x27;s too hard for me to remember if a crake, dryness, or sage is better or not,</li>
            <li> This person shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Because of the cost I was only able to try one tube, but I&#x27;ll add nobody can expect a pill or a cream to fix them magically.</li>
            <li> Using it mainly on my &amp;#34;bingo wings&amp;#34; and was amazed with how much better they look.</li>
            <li> Item received quickly and as shown</li>
            <li> I agreed to try it, though, because a friend recommended it highly, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m very aware of every lump on my legs.  </li>
            <li> Order from gotmyglow.nerium.com for real results!!</li>
            <li> Which is great for me because I have 6 children even though I&#x27;m a size 6 but was told I&#x27;d only be able to have surgery to tighten the loose skin in my belly.</li>
            <li> Ok....so there is a lot of good questions people have been asking on here about this product and a lot of them are unanswered.</li>
            <li> I know many people, including myself, that have bought products through Amazon and it was either altered or old...</li>
            <li> I was already using the face cream, which by the way is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I must be honest, one star only because I have just begun using the product</li>
            <li> When Brand Partners read this nonsense about how the product doesn&#x27;t work, we laugh....</li>
            <li> If it works it will be worth every penny.</li>
            <li> watery came right out the bottle</li>
            <li> The real product works, but to get a money back guarantee and great offers buy through a legit Nerium Rep.</li>
            <li> but it was better, but the extra hanging of skin it dramatically tightened that right up.</li>
            <li> I used  it exactly as prescribed on the bottle.....</li>
            <li> I even took several before photos to be sure.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through the first bottle of this stuff</li>
            <li> but the results wasn&#x27;t as fast as they explained it would be!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not looking any better a month later.</li>
            <li> , that is why I am interested in and purchased.  </li>
            <li> At a later date, I will be able to comment.</li>
            <li> It really does work!</li>
            <li> There are no guarantees about quality unless you buy it straight from the source!</li>
            <li> This product along with their facial products is nothing but a way to make their sellers wealthy.</li>
            <li> Once in the morning then again at night after a hot shower and exfoliating.</li>
            <li> Really does work!</li>
            <li> am 33 years old and eat clean, drink tons of water and work out vigorously almost every day.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;Finally... I am NOT a Nerium rep and I am NOT receiving any incentive for this positive review.</li>
            <li> so I go though it pretty fast.  </li>
            <li> It certainly doesn&#x27;t hold up to all the before &amp; after shots or positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I used it on my stomach after having 3 large boys.  </li>
            <li> I think once you stop your cellulite and firmness will go right back to the way it was before so in the long run it&#x27;s not cost effective</li>
            <li> Nerium Firm is amazing.</li>
            <li> I decided to sell the product myself BECAUSE it really works</li>
            <li> I believe any product takes a couple of months, to really see a difference.</li>
            <li> This product is not the real one.</li>
            <li> know they are really strict on things that have expiration</li>
            <li> and I can really see a difference in texture, tone, and also</li>
            <li> I do not think this is the real product</li>
            <li> Really worked for me.</li>
            <li> and my whole stomach is killing me.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care so much for the product.  </li>
            <li> The product is very runny</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t see a difference in my skin after using this.</li>
            <li> Worked very well for me.</li>
            <li> Thanks for shipping my order again.  </li>
            <li> I tried the whole thing in hopes it just needed time to work and at the end nothing, not change didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> Really???</li>
            <li> I really do like this cream.  </li>
            <li> and yes my legs are so much smoother</li>
            <li> product box was damaged and product was really runny...</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> But it did absolutely nothing at all.</li>
            <li> Over priced network marketing company representatives selling their free supplies to get back their investment because it does not work as advertised.</li>
            <li> There is no 30 day money back guarantee or 3 UR Free program when bought through Amazon or EBay like when you purchase through a Brand Partner.  </li>
            <li> This did absolutely nothing for that area.</li>
            <li> If it really didn&#x27;t work, then you did something incorrectly.  </li>
            <li> I really did not expect any results but thought I&#x27;d give it a try</li>
            <li> I think it really works on smoothing out cellultie on hamstrings and triceps.  </li>
            <li> The product goes way too fast for the amount of money...</li>
            <li> This product really works😃</li>
            <li> -- so I didn&#x27;t hold out much hope for the body cream.</li>
            <li> Using firming cream day n night really haven&#x27;t seen any difference..</li>
            <li> If you go to the website you will see thousands of pictures of real customers displaying their results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for two months now on my arms and legs and there really is a noticeable difference in skin texture and firmness-- surprising given the negative reaction I had to the face creams.</li>
            <li> The proprietary blend NAE-8 becomes inactive outside of its original packaging after 8-12 hours.</li>
            <li> This is a scam cause i bought as original and came in a different bottle nothing like in picture...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t care for this as it seems watered down from the&lt;br /&gt;Neriums that I purchase direct from Nerium isn&#x27;t effective</li>
            <li> to, can&#x27;t live without product!</li>
            <li> OK I&#x27;m not going to post my pictures because I don&#x27;t want them &amp;#34;out there&amp;#34; but I&#x27;ve been using this for less than a week and my folded over</li>
            <li> but I do see less loss skin and my skin is much more smoother</li>
            <li> but mainly it firms</li>
            <li> After about 14 days of non-continuous use there was a highly visible difference.  </li>
            <li> I am sure it will take longer than a few weeks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a much better a product than the nerium firm.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure it was from the Nerium Firm until I stopped using it for a couple months.  </li>
            <li> still used lets see in few more days.</li>
            <li> Seeing overall improvement in skin texture..not overwhelming results, but hopeful with continued use it will be more dramatic..</li>
            <li> New product to me.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean to bash, but the thing I love about Nerium is the real people.</li>
            <li> and I look exactly the same.  </li>
            <li> Had taken before pics on first day, could not tell ANY difference after all that hassel of following the process!</li>
            <li> Whether they are half used or been filled with water.</li>
            <li> As a direct Brand Partner for Nerium</li>
            <li> I have used the real one and its texture and smell is different.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase mine from a rep because $70 is just too much money back guarantee or not.</li>
            <li> It must be sold directly from the Brand Partner.</li>
            <li> So far I like it.</li>
            <li> I will not waste my money again.</li>
            <li> I have had 2 kids that has left my belly with saggy skin that no matter how much time I spend in the gym I can&#x27;t got rid of.</li>
            <li> , I worked out, I completely changed my diet and...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had wrinkled, sagging skin all over my body since I was in my early 40&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I see tons of results - may be false - on Facebook with amazing results in two weeks.  </li>
            <li> I get mine directly from the company</li>
            <li> No difference so far.  </li>
            <li> I purchased direct from Nerium.  </li>
            <li> Started a week or so after receiving so haven&#x27;t had enough time really to tell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it as  directed for several weeks and absolutely nothing has happened.</li>
            <li> The product did not firm up areas I believed it would based on description of product.</li>
            <li> it came to me in on old beat up box.</li>
            <li> The cream was brown and old.  </li>
            <li> At 49 years old I had quit wearing shorts do to dimpling on my thighs.</li>
            <li> When I started up again, the rash came right back in the same place.  </li>
            <li> Plus, the tube seemed half full.</li>
            <li> The tube is only half full!</li>
            <li> My stomach was pretty &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; just had loose skin.</li>
            <li> In other words, with Nerium you can try the product for &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; and if you don&#x27;t like it you can return it in its original packaging to include the receipt and you have your MONEY BACK!</li>
            <li> I saw so many pics of successful results and mine is even worst.</li>
            <li> and you will be billed every month on the same day and sent a new product to continue using</li>
            <li> I love this company and it makes me sad to see people get our bottles but not our real product.&lt;br /&gt;Www.larskincare.nerium.com&lt;br /&gt;Lar.skincare@gmail.com</li>
            <li> If you are a potential customer, just know that by buying here you are losing out on the 100% money back guarantee, as well as other special offers, such as 2 for 1 until the end of May.</li>
            <li> I had absolutely no results from this product and talked to a rep for this product and thinks is was not the real product...</li>
            <li> but I barely see results</li>
            <li> The whole tube is empty with no results.</li>
            <li> Nerium International strictly forbids selling in any way other than directly from a Nerium Brand Partner.</li>
            <li> I am not a heavy person but due to age I have an increased amount of fat appearing on my legs.  </li>
            <li> I cannot give an accurate review…because results are not apparent for at least 3 months according to Nerium…we have only been using it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> The product also has a strange odor which interferes with personal Chanel body powder and perfume.</li>
            <li> but my daughter and I decided to go with a DIY version of seaweed, salt and olive oil that I believe will do the trick if used long enough.  </li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, and I am hypothyroid which causes the skin to be very dry.</li>
            <li> Then you at least know you&#x27;re getting the real thing.</li>
            <li> After giving birth to my third child, my stomach skin was very loose.  </li>
            <li> I also discovered through a research article written by a licensed esthetician that every other ingredient in this product is found in basic OTC skin products.  </li>
            <li> Besides, if a brand partner is unethical enough to sell it here, which is grounds for dismissal by the company, they may be filling the bottle with something other than NeriumFirm and selling it.  </li>
            <li> Per the directions, I applied Nerium morning and evening daily and see very minimal results if any at all.  </li>
            <li> 6 days later I took another pic, holy cow it was a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> Nerium Firm is the only Nerium product I&#x27;ve tried that actually comes close to doing what it&#x27;s advertised to do.</li>
            <li> If you do your due diligence, you will find that Nerium Firm is developed by a Cancer Research &amp; Development Co called Nerium Biotech, in Austin Texas.</li>
            <li> I read some ingredient reviews and discovered that one of the ingredients, Oleander, works by creating an allergic reaction on your skin, which creates swelling (thus reducing the appearance of wrinkles or loose skin.)  </li>
            <li> Also starting to use it on the other side so I can wear sleeveless blouses, and raise both arms!</li>
            <li> DO YOUR RESEARCH, smells bad and for the money you could buy several other products that work better.</li>
            <li> container was too small for the amount of money, I wanted to use on upper legs which is a bigger area</li>
            <li> Aloe vera and pain pills provided only slight relief.</li>
            <li> Not only did it not work, but I kinda felt like it made my stomach a little puffier or bloated looking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so obvious that these crazy claims are being made by someone being truly hurt by the success of Nerium AD.</li>
            <li> The prices on here for this product are the same, give or take a few dollars, as if you were a &amp;#34;preferred customer&amp;#34; through Nerium.</li>
            <li> But about the product, i used it faithfully a month, not much smoothing as I wanted</li>
            <li> And it feels and smells different than the nerium firm i purchased from the official site.</li>
            <li> I am curious to see how long this product lasts and disappointed that I did not do more research before buying this product.</li>
            <li> Anyway back to Nerium Firm, I had no skin reaction and it is definately helping.  </li>
            <li> One thing you should do is wet your skin before using it or the face creams.  </li>
            <li> not much has changed in appearance and I have been using almost three weeks</li>
            <li> Used it faithfully, on my thighs, for four weeks, tube is almost empty.</li>
            <li> Did not really see a difference.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no results.</li>
            <li> The texture and smell were not the same as previous purchases of Nerium Firm.</li>
            <li> My skin felt softer, but had shown no signs of other improvements.  </li>
            <li> This is the first lotion I&#x27;ve ever used( and used according to directions) that has made my skin worse!</li>
            <li> Not sure yet only been using it for 3 weeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Nerium night and day creams and can truthfully say that they&#x27;re the worst creams I&#x27;ve ever used on my face -- smelly, extremely drying, and completely ineffective</li>
            <li> The tube literally was half empty.</li>
            <li> I have seen results from people in a few weeks some people it takes a few months to see results everyone skin is different.</li>
            <li> You may be getting half empty bottles and/or contaminated product.  </li>
            <li> As far as how it did for my cellulite, I would have to say that while I did notice a small improvement after about a month of use, it was not enough to warrant the price and trying to remember not to put the lotion behind my knees to avoid the rash.</li>
            <li> Couple that with the blatantly photo-shopped before and after pics that several of their reps are producing on social media, and it is my opinion that this company possibly has questionable marketing ethics with an even more questionable phony product line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this daily for at least 6 weeks and see no improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, I expected much more!</li>
            <li> and this person has reviews for over a year and not shut down.</li>
            <li> There is a 30 day money back guarantee if you are not satisfied!</li>
            <li> I purchased and didn&#x27;t use right away because I was afraid of having a reaction and getting hives.  </li>
            <li> post-childbirth belly has shrunk to half.  </li>
            <li> Wetting your skin and applying the cream locks in the moisture and you use less product.</li>
            <li> I work out faithfully but have the typical sagging tummy skin.</li>
            <li> I used this product from the neck down as it was promised to help firm skin, treat cellulite etc..........</li>
            <li> The price was just a little too steep to use every night on my budget.  </li>
            <li> BUT there is a few things that you want to consider before you buy from the Amazon seller.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t expect to remove cellulite and firm skin but keep eating junk food and sitting on your bum slapping on cream to do ALL the work.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.....</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this pyramid scheme.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s useless, as far as my experience.  </li>
            <li> I have used this just a few weeks</li>
            <li> I know whose bellies I saw before and after NeriumFirm got results even in a few days.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have; sagging skin, just not that firm.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money like I did.</li>
            <li> I do notice a small difference after a week and a half</li>
            <li> Not good produkt for my skin became  very dry</li>
            <li> This was not a true Nerium product!  </li>
            <li> Nerium has a shelf life on its products, so, if this has been sitting in the warehouse OR a garage for a long time to extreme temperatures, then its rendered useless which can cause some people to breakout.</li>
            <li> I used the product for a month and noticed a difference went without for 2 weeks and had very little loss of change.</li>
            <li> Absolute junk that smells as bad as it works.</li>
            <li> , don&#x27;t really see any results and it smells bad also.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month, and I&#x27;m seeing small changes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t cosign those that say people who sell on Amazon are scamming with a fake product or using expired creams ONLY because I have a seller account on Amazon &amp; I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll recognize myself if this keeps</li>
            <li> Plus in the past I&#x27;ve had hives from some of the so called cellulite creams.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if its the cream or Pilates or a combination of both</li>
            <li> still have saggy skin, stretch marks, and cellulite, this is no magic product.</li>
            <li> They work hard for there money and ordering on Amazon hurts small business people.</li>
            <li> My body isn&#x27;t in bad shape, but I had just had a baby about six to seven month prior to ordering and all the things on the internet and at local spa&#x27;s that I had read about in my mind seem to be false.</li>
            <li> I would deff recommend trying at least once.</li>
            <li> Big disappointment.</li>
            <li> Twice a day and massaged it in for at least 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m guessing the negative reviews are about.  </li>
            <li> I can at least raise one arm without embarrassment.</li>
            <li> and  it takes at least 30 to 45 days to show any results.  </li>
            <li> It was all watery not the thick lotion that is from Nerium.  </li>
            <li> USPS is slow .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It had a slow reaction for me, it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li> It works, but slowly..</li>
            <li> Not Good, Didn&#x27;t get any results.</li>
            <li> I applied the Firm to my upper under arm on just my worst sagging side.</li>
            <li> I see improvement but not as dramatic as the pics I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I got a rash behind my knee while using this.  </li>
            <li> This is a fake</li>
            <li> To say it&#x27;s someone who joined the company &amp; getting rid of inventory they can&#x27;t sell, maybe but nothing is wrong with that.</li>
            <li> It is ILLEGAL for a Nerium Rep to sell the product this way.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> I only wish I had researched it BEFORE i used it and got this horrible rash all over</li>
            <li> Not happy about that!</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I didn&#x27;t notice a difference.</li>
            <li> Could be a fake.</li>
            <li> It also smells weird too, like plastic and chemicals.</li>
            <li> so I am stick with this expensive cream.</li>
            <li> Night cream burnt my face terribly and made it so dry</li>
            <li> SO disappointing.</li>
            <li> awful how can ppl cheat for that small amount </li>
            <li> Very expensive...</li>
            <li> I wanted so badly for this product to work.</li>
            <li> My issues aren&#x27;t that bad either.  </li>
            <li> It does not have a bad smell</li>
            <li> When I opened the cream it had a bad smell.  </li>
            <li> It did nothing for me. :(  </li>
            <li> I have not seen any results disappointed on product</li>
            <li> I am disappointed because I seen a lot of pictures with the product.</li>
            <li> All products sold here are either fake or expired!!</li>
            <li> I hate that is a runny cream</li>
            <li> I hate to admit</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Worked very good, hpy w/ results</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help anything.</li>
            <li> Ok....so there is a lot of good questions people have been asking on here about this product and a lot of them are unanswered. I will say that I am very happy that Amazon is beginning to advertise this and sell the product BUT there is a few things that you want to consider before you buy from the Amazon seller. I decided to sell the product myself BECAUSE it really works and I want to make people happy! As a direct Brand Partner for Nerium I will say the following:  1. Keep in mind that this product needs to be in its original packaging. The proprietary blend NAE-8 becomes inactive outside of its original packaging after 8-12 hours. This in itself is an important fact to know! 2. Amazon nor its seller guarantee a 30 day money back for this product. In other words, with Nerium you can try the product for &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; and if you don&#x27;t like it you can return it in its original packaging to include the receipt and you have your MONEY BACK! 3. Nerium has a shelf life on its products, so, if this has been sitting in the warehouse OR a garage for a long time to extreme temperatures, then its rendered useless which can cause some people to breakout. 4. The prices on here for this product are the same, give or take a few dollars, as if you were a &amp;#34;preferred customer&amp;#34; through Nerium. As a &amp;#34;preferred customer&amp;#34; all you do is enter your credit card and you will be billed every month on the same day and sent a new product to continue using OR you can sign up as a preferred customer buy the product and then cancel or personalize it to your personal need.  I have no reason to lie about this. So, you can take a risk buying from here or I would be more than happy to be your contact for buying this product. Just go to.... eogalan.nerium.com. I hope I was able to answer lots of the concerns on here! Again, this product really works and does amazing things to peoples skins!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month, and I&#x27;m seeing small changes. Which is GREAT. I believe any product takes a couple of months, to really see a difference. Ordering another one today... Great price... a lot lower than on the actually site.</li>
            <li> This product is not the real one. I have used the real one and its texture and smell is different. This is a fake</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Took 1/2 inch off my thighs in 2 weeks. Shrinks the cellulite. This is my 4th purchase of this product. This person shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought this and used as directed and saw zero results.  I sent a message to see if I could return it but can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Waiting for good results, hopefully.</li>
            <li> I used this faithfully for a month &amp; it did nothing.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase mine from a rep because $70 is just too much money back guarantee or not. I don&#x27;t cosign those that say people who sell on Amazon are scamming with a fake product or using expired creams ONLY because I have a seller account on Amazon &amp; I know they are really strict on things that have expiration and this person has reviews for over a year and not shut down. To say it&#x27;s someone who joined the company &amp; getting rid of inventory they can&#x27;t sell, maybe but nothing is wrong with that. But about the product, i used it faithfully a month, not much smoothing as I wanted but it was better, but the extra hanging of skin it dramatically tightened that right up. Which is great for me because I have 6 children even though I&#x27;m a size 6 but was told I&#x27;d only be able to have surgery to tighten the loose skin in my belly. Because of the cost I was only able to try one tube, but I&#x27;ll add nobody can expect a pill or a cream to fix them magically. You have to drink water, change your diet, exercise. This is an aid not a cure. You can&#x27;t expect to remove cellulite and firm skin but keep eating junk food and sitting on your bum slapping on cream to do ALL the work. If it were THAT easy everyone would be doing it &amp; it&#x27;d cost a lot more than this!</li>
            <li> My arms are still jiggly, but the lotion feels good and I am still using it. I am sure it will take longer than a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I use it morning and night and I can really see a difference in texture, tone, and also slimming areas.  I use it almost everywhere so I go though it pretty fast.  Wish they offered a larger size and it is definitely EXPENSIVE!!!  But, I like that it works.</li>
            <li> I do not think this is the real product</li>
            <li> It is ILLEGAL for a Nerium Rep to sell the product this way. It must be sold directly from the Brand Partner. This is not the same product or Nerium would have removed it. Do NOT trust this seller. If you don&#x27;t believe me and would like to try the REAL Nerium Firm, please see my page. There is a 30 day money back guarantee if you are not satisfied! it is akleinkauf dot nerium dot com</li>
            <li> It did nothing for me. :(  I was so hoping it would. Bummer!</li>
            <li> One of the best products I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! AND can only gaurentee results if bought from an Independent Brand Partner!!! I bought mine from nolessthanfab.nerium.com</li>
            <li> I think I am allergic</li>
            <li> watery came right out the bottle</li>
            <li> Great condition when received product!</li>
            <li> Really worked for me. Using it mainly on my &amp;#34;bingo wings&amp;#34; and was amazed with how much better they look. Now just have to exercise for the rest</li>
            <li> this is way over rated did not do any thing except moisture my skin just like 1.95 cream does</li>
            <li> No difference on me. Basically is just a lotion in a way.</li>
            <li> Did not see any improvement! Very expensive...for no results</li>
            <li> The tube literally was half empty. I don&#x27;t get it but feel ripped off.</li>
            <li> Waste of money..... The seller was great with shipping, but the product itself is nothing more than just a lotion. My body isn&#x27;t in bad shape, but I had just had a baby about six to seven month prior to ordering and all the things on the internet and at local spa&#x27;s that I had read about in my mind seem to be false.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for me..... Used it religiously.</li>
            <li> The product is great! I love my results. But do not!! Buy from Amazon or eBay. You don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s happened with these bottles. Whether they are half used or been filled with water. Buy from a brand partner so you can try the product with a 30 day money back guarantee if you don&#x27;t like it. You can even get your product for free!! I don&#x27;t mean to bash, but the thing I love about Nerium is the real people. :) contact me and I&#x27;ll help you. I love this company and it makes me sad to see people get our bottles but not our real product.&lt;br /&gt;Www.larskincare.nerium.com&lt;br /&gt;Lar.skincare@gmail.com&lt;br /&gt;Even if you just have questions. :)</li>
            <li> Truly amazing product!</li>
            <li> NeriumFirm does not work. Those pics that are posted all over Facebook are cake. I tried this to support a friend who is a Nerium Brand Partner. I followed the directions and used it faithfully for 5 months. There was zero change or result. Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this pyramid scheme.</li>
            <li> New product to me.  So far I like it.</li>
            <li> Great shipping and timing. I love Nerium but I thought this was for face and neck also.</li>
            <li> I have used this product as directed and i can not tell any difference. I will not waste my money again.</li>
            <li> This was not a true Nerium product!  It was all watery not the thick lotion that is from Nerium.  Do not buy off here to save money go to an actual distributor.</li>
            <li> I got this.. And have used it once and my whole stomach is killing me. And it feels and smells different than the nerium firm i purchased from the official site.</li>
            <li> Works great with neoprene belt ... Helps lose water weight as well</li>
            <li> Fast &amp; good product!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care so much for the product.  My skin felt softer, but had shown no signs of other improvements.  The product is very runny so it doesn&#x27;t last very long.  Pricey for what you get</li>
            <li> Overpriced and overrated</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any results, but I heard it worked so I am going to keep using it. Friends told me it takes about 3 months for results to show.</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t see a difference in my skin after using this. But everything work&#x27;s differently for everyone.</li>
            <li> I have only used this for about 2 weeks but see the results.  My skin looks firmer too.</li>
            <li> Worked very well for me. It smells horrible and takes a while to see results. I have had 2 kids that has left my belly with saggy skin that no matter how much time I spend in the gym I can&#x27;t got rid of. I would deff recommend trying at least once. It has helped me.</li>
            <li> This is the first lotion I&#x27;ve ever used( and used according to directions) that has made my skin worse! I&#x27;m very disappointed. I know a couple brand partners, and had considered signing, but I can&#x27;t promote a product that doesn&#x27;t work. Very disappointed. It certainly doesn&#x27;t hold up to all the before &amp; after shots or positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I tried two tubes and it did not make any noticeable difference.  I definitely did not see the results claimed by the advertising and supposed before and after pictures.  I don&#x27;t believe any non-medical topical cream can deliver the results claimed.  I just think the Salesforce is so aggressive and pumped that they see and promise results that just aren&#x27;t there.</li>
            <li> The tube is only half full! Its filled up to the brown line.  Big disappointment.</li>
            <li> This product simply put, DOES NOT WORK!!&lt;br /&gt;I am 33 years old and eat clean, drink tons of water and work out vigorously almost every day. I am about 5&#x27;4 and weigh between 110-115 with about 15-20% body fat.  After giving birth to my third child, my stomach skin was very loose.  My stomach was pretty &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; just had loose skin. I had a friend on Facebook selling this miracle cream with very impressive before and after photos and I figured I would be a perfect candidate. I ordered some from her, a licensed distributor (NOT FROM AMAZON.) I used  it exactly as prescribed on the bottle..... Twice a day and massaged it in for at least 30 seconds.  I wanted so badly for this product to work. I used it for 5 months and saw zero results. I even took several before photos to be sure.  Not only did it not work, but I kinda felt like it made my stomach a little puffier or bloated looking. I read some ingredient reviews and discovered that one of the ingredients, Oleander, works by creating an allergic reaction on your skin, which creates swelling (thus reducing the appearance of wrinkles or loose skin.)  I also discovered through a research article written by a licensed esthetician that every other ingredient in this product is found in basic OTC skin products.  Couple that with the blatantly photo-shopped before and after pics that several of their reps are producing on social media, and it is my opinion that this company possibly has questionable marketing ethics with an even more questionable phony product line. I am curious to see how long this product lasts and disappointed that I did not do more research before buying this product.</li>
            <li> Thanks for shipping my order again.  I appreciate the gift book as well.  I have not seen any results with the Nerium Firm,&lt;br /&gt; But hope it will work as well as Nerium AD.  It took 9 days before my order arrived. USPS is slow .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joyce Vowell</li>
            <li> This product is truly amazing I used the product for a month and noticed a difference went without for 2 weeks and had very little loss of change.</li>
            <li> This is a scam cause i bought as original and came in a different bottle nothing like in picture...awful how can ppl cheat for that small amount </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this daily for at least 6 weeks and see no improvement in my skin. Very disappointed. Will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Used this for 4 months!....ZERO results. I took pictures, I worked out, I completely changed my diet and...ab-so-lut-ely NOTHING. SO disappointing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s useless, as far as my experience.  As for it not being the &amp;#34;real deal&amp;#34;  I think that&#x27;s just baloney.  The ingredients are the ingredients.  This did not reduce my cellulite, nor did it provide any firming properties.  I used it as directed.  Now, all of a sudden Amazon&#x27;s seller&#x27;s email address is not valid??? Shocking!  Very disappointed all the way around.  I would not advise anyone to take a chance on this product.</li>
            <li> I Love this lotion, smell is great, no greasy feel, wish the tube was bigger! Maybe I use it too often!</li>
            <li> I have used many many cellulite creams and I&#x27;m amazed at how fantastic this works.  I am not a heavy person but due to age I have an increased amount of fat appearing on my legs.  I have used this just a few weeks and I&amp;#34;m so impressed with how great it works.  I will be buying this from now on.</li>
            <li> It was open and leaked inside the nerium packaging box...maybe the elevation</li>
            <li> I had absolutely no results from this product and talked to a rep for this product and thinks is was not the real product...very disappointment!!!</li>
            <li> OK I&#x27;m not going to post my pictures because I don&#x27;t want them &amp;#34;out there&amp;#34; but I&#x27;ve been using this for less than a week and my folded over post-childbirth belly has shrunk to half.  I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll recognize myself if this keeps up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, DO NOT buy this product on Amazon.  It costs $30 if you buy it from a brand partner (that&#x27;s how I got mine) and $68 on here. The math is easy... Besides, if a brand partner is unethical enough to sell it here, which is grounds for dismissal by the company, they may be filling the bottle with something other than NeriumFirm and selling it.  That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m guessing the negative reviews are about.  I can&#x27;t imagine that someone would have no effect from it.  People I know whose bellies I saw before and after NeriumFirm got results even in a few days.  Get it from the company so you can get a refund if you&#x27;re allergic to it or you don&#x27;t like the way it works.  Then you at least know you&#x27;re getting the real thing.</li>
            <li> Have been using for several months. I didn&#x27;t see any results yet</li>
            <li> I had my doubts that it would work for me. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, and I am hypothyroid which causes the skin to be very dry. I&#x27;ve had wrinkled, sagging skin all over my body since I was in my early 40&#x27;s (I&#x27;m now 76). So, I decided to do an experiment. I applied the Firm to my upper under arm on just my worst sagging side. After about 14 days of non-continuous use there was a highly visible difference.  I&#x27;m using it now as directed twice a day and am into my 4th week. I can at least raise one arm without embarrassment. I did purchase from a company representative, because that is the only way to get the 30 day money back guarantee if it didn&#x27;t work. I won&#x27;t be returning it, and when my time comes, I plan to buried with a tube of this great stuff. Also starting to use it on the other side so I can wear sleeveless blouses, and raise both arms!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through the first bottle of this stuff and I look exactly the same.  I&#x27;m beginning to think it&#x27;s all a scam.  I did buy another bottle and will try the second bottle as well.  However, I&#x27;m on my fourth week with no results.  I see tons of results - may be false - on Facebook with amazing results in two weeks.  I will say, however, you never see the face of the person, only the body part.  Could be anyone&#x27;s body parts and not necessarily the same two people.</li>
            <li> Those that are questioning whether it works, should be questioning what you actually got. I get mine directly from the company and I have gotten amazing results. I know many people, including myself, that have bought products through Amazon and it was either altered or old...but it was not the same. I don&#x27;t trust Amazon for products like this.</li>
            <li> Wife said it didn&#x27;t work for her.</li>
            <li> It had a slow reaction for me, it&#x27;s working but the results wasn&#x27;t as fast as they explained it would be!</li>
            <li> No difference so far.  Plus, the tube seemed half full.</li>
            <li> While it is possible it may work for others, it did not work for me, found at times it actually expanded the areas where it was applied, appearing as if I had gained weight,  I tried the whole thing in hopes it just needed time to work and at the end nothing, not change didn&#x27;t work for me.  It may work for others, but for me it was a loss of money.</li>
            <li> Not sure yet only been using it for 3 weeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Nerium night cream. It&#x27;s a much better a product than the nerium firm. I was not impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> I used this product from the neck down as it was promised to help firm skin, treat cellulite etc..........Well, it gave me a very painful rash that I still have today and I only used it a short while and have not used it in a month!! I bought it from a sales rep in person, not online.  My skin is inflamed, covered in a rash and sores.  Buyer beware, this stuff contains oleander, it is poison and was discovered because it is known to kill cancer cells!!! Really??? And we are putting it on our skin??  I only wish I had researched it BEFORE i used it and got this horrible rash all over and it&#x27;s not looking any better a month later.</li>
            <li> If I could give this zero stars I would. Noticed no difference. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Used the product twice daily for 3 weeks now, (once after showering) as directed. I work out daily, walk 5 miles, etc. Didn&#x27;t have; sagging skin, just not that firm. Haven&#x27;t seen any visible results? The product also has a strange odor which interferes with personal Chanel body powder and perfume.</li>
            <li> I really do like this cream.  I purchased direct from Nerium.  I&#x27;m always sceptical of what people post, as I was when I purchased this cream.  Plus in the past I&#x27;ve had hives from some of the so called cellulite creams.  I purchased and didn&#x27;t use right away because I was afraid of having a reaction and getting hives.  I was already using the face cream, which by the way is well worth the money.  Anyway back to Nerium Firm, I had no skin reaction and it is definately helping.  I didn&#x27;t take photos but I&#x27;m very aware of every lump on my legs.  I see some people saying it didn&#x27;t work for them but I can say it is helping me.  One thing you should do is wet your skin before using it or the face creams.  Wetting your skin and applying the cream locks in the moisture and you use less product.</li>
            <li> container was too small for the amount of money, I wanted to use on upper legs which is a bigger area then amount you get in bottle.</li>
            <li> Great stuff really works !!!</li>
            <li> Arrived and the bottle was very warm and the lotion sounded very watery. I called the manufacturer and they did say it was not a watery lotion and the composition may have been compromised.  Not happy about that!</li>
            <li> I must be honest, one star only because I have just begun using the product and  it takes at least 30 to 45 days to show any results.  I have seen others with good results, that is why I am interested in and purchased.  At a later date, I will be able to comment.</li>
            <li> I used it as directed... no difference...</li>
            <li> Improves the quality of your skin. It has dimished some wrinkles and lines.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product....</li>
            <li> My favorite summer go-to, can&#x27;t live without product!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to see results yet.</li>
            <li> I didnt see any change. The skin is smooth, but any cheaper lotion could do that.</li>
            <li> Not Good, Didn&#x27;t get any results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.... not extremely impressed... not much has changed in appearance and I have been using almost three weeks</li>
            <li> I noticed a significant difference in skin tone after a four week period of use.</li>
            <li> I purchased two bottles of this recently, and did notice some difference.  I probably haven&#x27;t used enough of it to do some good, (I am 58 and have plenty of cellulite) but my daughter and I decided to go with a DIY version of seaweed, salt and olive oil that I believe will do the trick if used long enough.  The price was just a little too steep to use every night on my budget.  However, I have heard good results from others who have been using it.</li>
            <li> Well, you know the rest.  I used it on my stomach after having 3 large boys.  I took before, after and everywhere in between pictures.  I used it for about 2 months. Doesn&#x27;t look one bit different. I would LOVE to say that this worked for me, but it just didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It seems alright but I haven&#x27;t noticed firming yet. I will have to continue use on it. absorbs well and pleasant odor.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have the results promised.  Maybe it takes more than one bottle?  My issues aren&#x27;t that bad either.  I see improvement but not as dramatic as the pics I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li> used this product for 3 months and love love it, I made sure to take before and after photos because it&#x27;s too hard for me to remember if a crake, dryness, or sage is better or not, and yes my legs are so much smoother I&#x27;d post photos if I could.  TAKE PHOTOS!!</li>
            <li> product box was damaged and product was really runny...have no idea if product is suppose to be like this</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had the chance to use it, but the face version is superb</li>
            <li> I do not see any difference or changes since using this product.</li>
            <li> Just started using. Will the 30 day guarentee apply</li>
            <li> It really does work! I have seen results from people in a few weeks some people it takes a few months to see results everyone skin is different. I really liked the product. I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I noticed no difference what so ever! Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> After spending $65 in this product, I should say that, my skin is saggier than ever and i feel betrayed. I saw so many pics of successful results and mine is even worst. I was so hopeful that this product will work but, oh well, not for me.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see any difference</li>
            <li> Nerium Firm is amazing. I have been using it for a couple of months, and I can see a huge difference! I love it.</li>
            <li> Started a week or so after receiving so haven&#x27;t had enough time really to tell. I can see an improvement though.</li>
            <li> good feeling on my skin</li>
            <li> I liked the product but unfortunately I didn&#x27;t notice a difference.</li>
            <li> From someone selling Nerium you will pay $100.  The product works wonders and one cannot beat the savings!</li>
            <li> Sadly, I got a rash behind my knee while using this.  It almost looked like poison oak and it was a while after I stopped using the cream that it went away.  I wasn&#x27;t sure it was from the Nerium Firm until I stopped using it for a couple months.  When I started up again, the rash came right back in the same place.  As far as how it did for my cellulite, I would have to say that while I did notice a small improvement after about a month of use, it was not enough to warrant the price and trying to remember not to put the lotion behind my knees to avoid the rash.</li>
            <li> Is 4 days a can&#x27;t belive how my legs changed</li>
            <li> Love the idea, but I haven&#x27;t observed results yet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it as  directed for several weeks and absolutely nothing has happened.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife only one saw allot of difference. No lying gonna buy another one for her would recommend if your women is working out. That works better.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any results disappointed on product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Nerium Brand Partner and this product is amazing....if you buy it from&lt;br /&gt;Nerium! There are no guarantees about quality unless you buy it straight from the source! It does not have a bad smell and I saw results myself within 5 days!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any results in the 2 week time frame, that they say you should notice???</li>
            <li> Per the directions, I applied Nerium morning and evening daily and see very minimal results if any at all.  Very disappointed, I expected much more!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much for me. Will not order again</li>
            <li> It works, but slowly..</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  Did not do anything.</li>
            <li> still used lets see in few more days.</li>
            <li> Great cream. The only thing no would change is the smell.</li>
            <li> Used it faithfully, on my thighs, for four weeks, tube is almost empty. Had taken before pics on first day, could not tell ANY difference after all that hassel of following the process! I was so hoping it would work. So disappointed !</li>
            <li> The texture and smell were not the same as previous purchases of Nerium Firm. Could be a fake.</li>
            <li> Does not work. Don&#x27;t bother</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any results yet and I&#x27;ve used it for 2 months now</li>
            <li> I used this product for 6 months. I figured I had to give it a chance and it wouldn&#x27;t happen overnight. But it did absolutely nothing at all. Don&#x27;t bother wasting your money by buying this. If I can give it no stars, I would.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t tighting faster I was told I would see results in a week I still have yet to see results</li>
            <li> Not so fond of the product.</li>
            <li> I love it! If it&#x27;s used right it works!</li>
            <li> Not as excited about this one</li>
            <li> Absolute junk that smells as bad as it works. Over priced network marketing company representatives selling their free supplies to get back their investment because it does not work as advertised. Product does not work period DO YOUR RESEARCH, smells bad and for the money you could buy several other products that work better.</li>
            <li> This product did not do anything for me save your money</li>
            <li> I order it on march 18 and sense then I been using it but I barely see results but I do see less loss skin and my skin is much more smoother But I still hope I see better changes... I hate that is a runny cream</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Nerium night cream and it smells terrible.  Thought I would try this, don&#x27;t really see any results and it smells bad also.</li>
            <li> Ive only been using for a month. Not sure if its the cream or Pilates or a combination of both</li>
            <li> BUYER BEWARE!  You do not know what you are getting unless you buy from a Nerium Independent Brand Partner.  Nerium Brand Partners DO NOT sell on Amazon or EBay.  Nerium Products found on Amazon or EBay are not fulfilled by Nerium International.  There is no 30 day money back guarantee or 3 UR Free program when bought through Amazon or EBay like when you purchase through a Brand Partner.  You may be getting half empty bottles and/or contaminated product.  Again, BUYER BRWARE..if you want to know for sure what you are putting on your skin buy from a Nerium Brand Partner, NOT from Amazon or EBay!</li>
            <li> The real product works, but to get a money back guarantee and great offers buy through a legit Nerium Rep. They work hard for there money and ordering on Amazon hurts small business people.</li>
            <li> As with most &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; creams, I saw marginal results at best. Sigh!</li>
            <li> If I could give this 0 stars I would! Went through 2 bottles on the area above my knees.  See plenty of Nerium &amp;#34;customers&amp;#34; photos with perfect results. (Photoshop is a wonderful tool) This did absolutely nothing for that area. This product along with their facial products is nothing but a way to make their sellers wealthy. Pyramid companies are a joke! I will never buy a Nerium product again.......I hate to admit but I got scammed.</li>
            <li> I received the product very quickly and I have noticed a difference. I have had to use it twice a day for about 2 months to see changes but it is helping.</li>
            <li> The product did not firm up areas I believed it would based on description of product. I will continue to use what I have hoping it will eventually work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so obvious that these crazy claims are being made by someone being truly hurt by the success of Nerium AD. When Brand Partners read this nonsense about how the product doesn&#x27;t work, we laugh.... All the way to the bank and our favorite charity. Good luck imoisters. If it really didn&#x27;t work, then you did something incorrectly.  God Bless ya.</li>
            <li> It was a good lotion for hydrating, however I did not seem any lifting. I used this just as the instructions told me. Once in the morning then again at night after a hot shower and exfoliating. The whole tube is empty with no results. I am disappointed because I seen a lot of pictures with the product. It seems like this product has a lot of mixed reviews. Some people said it was a holy grail product, and some said it was worthless.&lt;br /&gt;I still have saggy skin, stretch marks, and cellulite, this is no magic product.</li>
            <li> Received in a timely manner, but did not see that it has made any changes in my skin.</li>
            <li> I have gotten this i dont like it . It doesnt do nothing . Waste of money</li>
            <li> Nerium International strictly forbids selling in any way other than directly from a Nerium Brand Partner. If you are a potential customer, just know that by buying here you are losing out on the 100% money back guarantee, as well as other special offers, such as 2 for 1 until the end of May. You also don&#x27;t know how this product has been stored. Yes, it&#x27;s a great 5-star product, but it&#x27;s only backed by the company if you buy from them.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try on my &amp;#34;mommy tummy&amp;#34; from having 4 kiddo&#x27;s. I work out faithfully but have the typical sagging tummy skin. I really did not expect any results but thought I&#x27;d give it a try, it has a money back guarantee. If it works it will be worth every penny. I took my before pic and started using the cream twice daily as instructed. 6 days later I took another pic, holy cow it was a noticeable difference. It is actually smoothing out my tummy. How is it working? I have no earthly idea but it is so I&#x27;ll stick with it.&lt;br /&gt;Finally... I am NOT a Nerium rep and I am NOT receiving any incentive for this positive review.</li>
            <li> Really does work! Noticed a big improvement</li>
            <li> Product is working very nicely.</li>
            <li> Seeing overall improvement in skin texture..not overwhelming results, but hopeful with continued use it will be more dramatic..</li>
            <li> I think it really works on smoothing out cellultie on hamstrings and triceps.  Will definately order again once I am about to run out.</li>
            <li> Did not really see a difference.</li>
            <li> Love it, will never be without this product. I use it on my neck and face.</li>
            <li> I cannot give an accurate review…because results are not apparent for at least 3 months according to Nerium…we have only been using it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I did not like the smell but I used it anyway. After a month -- I saw no changes!  Nothing like all the before and after pictures they post.</li>
            <li> Used for a couple months and never saw any results. It also smells weird too, like plastic and chemicals. I had better results with the EVELINE Cosmetics brand firming lotions.</li>
            <li> The nerium firm is really helping the tops of my knees.  Haven&#x27;t used it anywhere else.  Sure notice a difference of tightening and smoothing.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> This gave my skin a horrible burn on my chest that looked and felt like a severe sunburn. Not only the skin burned, but the muscles ached. I contacted the seller weeks ago and have had no response. Goodbye money. Aloe vera and pain pills provided only slight relief. After using the cream for three days, the pain and the burning lasted a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still testing this product.  I will say that I think it is starting to work after 6 weeks of using twice a day.</li>
            <li> Terrible Terrible Terrible product. It was like water and not at all like the original. I just wanted to try it up ended up wasting time I just ended up ordering from a rep. It was a lot more but lesson learned you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t care for this as it seems watered down from the&lt;br /&gt;Neriums that I purchase direct from Nerium isn&#x27;t effective</li>
            <li> The product arrived later than suggested.  I received no receipt with my purchase.  However, it was priced at a great price.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t ever order this cream.. it came to me in on old beat up box. When I opened the cream it had a bad smell.  The cream was brown and old.  I had no way of printing a label so I am stick with this expensive cream.</li>
            <li> You have to use it 2 times a day! The product goes way too fast for the amount of money...I do notice a small difference after a week and a half and I will continue to use it for 30 days and I have been taking pictures. I do notice it has helped my cellulite a tad  but mainly it firms but I do notice a difference when I use it twice a day... I think once you stop your cellulite and firmness will go right back to the way it was before so in the long run it&#x27;s not cost effective</li>
            <li> This product really works😃</li>
            <li> Not good produkt for my skin became  very dry</li>
            <li> Nerium Firm is the only Nerium product I&#x27;ve tried that actually comes close to doing what it&#x27;s advertised to do. I&#x27;ve tried Nerium night and day creams and can truthfully say that they&#x27;re the worst creams I&#x27;ve ever used on my face -- smelly, extremely drying, and completely ineffective -- so I didn&#x27;t hold out much hope for the body cream. I agreed to try it, though, because a friend recommended it highly, and I&#x27;m glad I did. I&#x27;ve been using it for two months now on my arms and legs and there really is a noticeable difference in skin texture and firmness-- surprising given the negative reaction I had to the face creams. The firming cream is actually ok -- not a 5-star item, but worth a try. After another month or so of using it, I may have to raise my 3-star review to a 4.</li>
            <li> Bought 2 tubes and have been using twice a day. Absolutely no results. Did nothing.  Don&#x27;t waste your money like I did.</li>
            <li> All products sold here are either fake or expired!! The products do work and have actual scientific research to back it up!! I&#x27;ve been a happy customer for over a year! Order from gotmyglow.nerium.com for real results!!</li>
            <li> I hate the day n night cream . Night cream burnt my face terribly and made it so dry n wrinkled looking . Using firming cream day n night really haven&#x27;t seen any difference..</li>
            <li> Item received quickly and as shown</li>
            <li> have been using this product for 1 year. At 49 years old I had quit wearing shorts do to dimpling on my thighs. While I still love capris, its great to be able to wear a nice pair of shorts again! If you do your due diligence, you will find that Nerium Firm is developed by a Cancer Research &amp; Development Co called Nerium Biotech, in Austin Texas.
