            <li> I have had this set for many years, and really like it a lot. I recently ordered one for a client, and she really likes it too...her set was missing the little hose though, so I will have to get that. The only thing we don&#x27;t like is that the gold design on the cups comes off and gets all over your hands. They should just skip the gold design all together. I highly recommend this set, as it is durable and easy to use. The vacuum gun works very well (unlike a set from a different vendor).</li>
            <li> DISAPPOINTED!!! WILL NOT BUY AGAIN...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull vacuum as strong as old one that I had.  cable-to-cup interface should be better made (tighter).&lt;br /&gt;I liked the variety of cup sizes and the quality of the cups them selves.</li>
            <li> Solid. The pump is a little large, but I guess it must be, for the professional version</li>
            <li> Great stuff for regular use.</li>
            <li> Love this set i use it on my back,legs,thighs&lt;br /&gt;The cupping set is made of a hard durable plastic they suck all the air out of your body it even takes away your cellulite when you make massages with these cuppings and move them around your body the only thing I don&#x27;t like is the red marks you get that look like  bruses it doesn&#x27;t hurt they just look nasty.&lt;br /&gt;Other than than&lt;br /&gt;I recommend these cupping a 100% great ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜š</li>
            <li> Brand new. I haven&#x27;t used it yet but am looking forward to it</li>

            <li> I bought for hone use. The quality was great. The product is exactly what I expected. To enhance the offering I would encourage the seller to have a bit more information written in English, however this should not detract from the quality of the product.</li>

            <li> My husband and I have been using this for years. We needed a replacement since we misplaced our last set. It works really well and you can really see the skin suction into the cup and afterwards it does leave a red/pink mark or a purple one if you have a problem area. In our experience it really does improve circulation and increase the flow of qi. Give it a try!</li>
