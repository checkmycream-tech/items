            <li>The bottle sizes are great for medicine cabinets and traveling.</li>
            <li>People started telling me that I looked great.</li>
            <li>So if you don&#x27;t mind an additional swish with water when you&#x27;re all done, this is a great mouthwash.</li>
            <li>but I do know that this is great for rinsing out your mouth as well as your teethe feeling good.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.  </li>
            <li>rinse tastes a lot like hydrogen peroxide which can be a good, inexpensive rinse.</li>
            <li>it is a good mouthwash.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Whitening or not, this is a good mouthwash.</li>
            <li>It is a good alternative to alcohol based mouthwash for those who are looking for one.</li>
            <li>Hydrogen peroxide (yes, the stuff you use on wounds) is good for superficial stains between dental visits.  </li>
            <li>For the amount of effort and the whitening I&#x27;ve experienced this is a really easy habit to get into!</li>
            <li>- They look much better now!  </li>
            <li>so I kind of didn&#x27;t notice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m pretty happy with it, and expect to keep using it for its impact on my teeth and breath.</li>
            <li>and I knew that it foams more than others when you swish</li>
            <li>Sure.</li>
            <li>Love it when something works as promoted.  </li>
            <li>I love my espresso, but not the stains on my teeth.  </li>
            <li>The most noticeable difference is on the sides of my teeth and between the teeth.</li>
            <li>It looks much better now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>more than one may</li>
            <li>so you can keep the fresh-breath smell, this version may not be your favorite.</li>
            <li>(don&#x27;t even think about touching that comment, trolls!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>AND, as I&#x27;ve continued to use it, I can see I&#x27;m well on my way to the bright smile I&#x27;ve wanted for so long.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just like that this stuff does not absorb some potent ingredient into my tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After two weeks, I believe that my teeth are a tad bit whiter, but I am not 100% sure.  </li>
            <li>taste is okay.  </li>
            <li>My wife was more convinced of its whitening properties than</li>
            <li>The flavor is better, and it leaves my breath fresher for a longer period of time.  </li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t have the burn of Listerine, and my favorite flavor is the Arctic because it&#x27;s the most minty.</li>
            <li>The problem with tooth whiteners is that they use a concentrated hydrogen peroxide formula (for the most part).</li>
            <li>taste is OK.</li>
            <li>After using it over a week I could not really tell the difference, but I already use a whitening toothpaste, so I may not be the best person to judge how well this product works in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While this may not be at a professional whitening level, this rinse is a great addition to a dental care regime wanting a whitening boost.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a good product that seems best used in conjunction with Crest&#x27;s other whitening products if whiter teeth are what you&#x27;re really after.  </li>
            <li>I thought these are full sized, they are NOT!</li>
            <li>I love how clean the peroxide makes my mouth feel.</li>
            <li>does seem to effectively complement and maintain that whitening, along with freshening breath with a taste that isn&#x27;t exactly \\&quot;tasty\\&quot;, but quite tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sort of medicinally-minty - not bad, but not what I&#x27;d call refreshing either.</li>
            <li>love it becuse its very minty and give me good breath any time especially in the morning good even to put it in the office</li>
            <li>The minute rinse results in a mild foam that feels refreshing.  </li>
            <li>I got this for free from BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li>Great product and a terrific value.</li>
            <li>precisely, it seems to help maintain the whiteness of teeth.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s great to use before a big event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was comfortable to use and I quite like the foaming</li>
            <li>I love this mouth wash!&lt;br /&gt;So refreshing, and It really makes your teeth whiter!!&lt;br /&gt;im</li>
            <li>My experience with this Crest Rinse has been a good one so far, as it does seem to do what it promises - whiten teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my be unique</li>
            <li>My original review appears below.</li>
            <li>It turns out that there really is a significant difference.</li>
            <li>It does have a lot of other good things going for it though!</li>
            <li>clean teeth and clean mouth Feeling .</li>
            <li>However, I want them to look clean and</li>
            <li>Again, this and the rest of the 3D whitening line aren&#x27;t meant to replace a more professional whitening, but this is on par with any respectable whitening rinse or toothpaste.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Three teaspoons of this rinse swished around for sixty seconds will leave a mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li>Also, for others reading this, be sure to check out some of Morning&#x27;s other reviews and you&#x27;ll see that she doesn&#x27;t have much good to say about anything.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works great, but minus one for taste.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product now for more than a month and believe it or not my teeth are much whiter than before.  </li>
            <li>I thought these are full sized...\\&quot;</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re supposed to swish for a full 60 seconds</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually takes a good bit of effort to gargle for the required 60 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even without the intense mint burn of most washes it leaves your mouth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Afterward, my mouth feels clean and fresh with no lingering sourness.</li>
            <li>It is mild and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In fact, like most mouthwashes, the last 30 seconds is challenging because the mint starts to burn my tongue.</li>
            <li>I could not recommend this product more highly.</li>
            <li>On the flip side, expecting this mouthwash to work miracles on its own is probably not warranted--it needs to be used as part of a regular brushing and flossing routine to have full effectiveness.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom Line - Great at keeping teeth whiter, but unlikely to whiten teeth quickly on its own.</li>
            <li>So if I&#x27;m noticing a whiter smile in seven days, can you image how awesome it would be for someone without these icky habits?!</li>
            <li>- it keeps your breath fresh</li>
            <li>Eventually, my teenaged son complimented me on my smile.</li>
            <li>The crest whitening products boast a whiter smile in seven days.</li>
            <li>I like the idea whitening my smile while doing something I do every day anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth using if you&#x27;re a coffee drinker (like me).  </li>
            <li>&quot; (what a name, right?)</li>
            <li>They do look whiter right after I rinse</li>
            <li>It goes away quickly, and certainly by the time I eat or drink anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also did not make my mouth more sensitive (and some really do).</li>
            <li>If you prefer using something with a strong clean breath smell like Scope, where it&#x27;s the last thing you swish in your mouth</li>
            <li>So far I have seen a huge difference on my teeth.</li>
            <li>First of all, this product is not $30, it&#x27;s $22.33.</li>
            <li>But When I looked at at picture, sure enough my teeth are a lot whiter.</li>
            <li>There was some shading that was pretty aging.</li>
            <li>Personally, I have to believe the toothbrush is more to thank for this improvement than the mouthwash per se; but any additional help provided by the rinse is still an improvement.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll see a change immediately after the first use.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I love the way this rinse feels in my mouth -- the hydrogen peroxide solution definitely foams in the mouth as I swish it around, and feels as if it is preparing my gums and teeth for brushing.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t say if you should brush first or if you should use it just before bed.  </li>
            <li>I like this better than white strips because it works on your whole mouth - and it is much easier to use.  </li>
            <li>In the end this is a nice rinse that does not have the burn that Listerine and other non alcohol free ones have, and if it whitens my teeth that is an extra bonus!  </li>
            <li>but I saw results in a matter of days, particularly so in the first couple of hours afterwards</li>
            <li>The main reason I switched to this from my usual Listerine is because I read about a study that said whitening toothpastes had little effect but swishing 2x a day for a minute with a peroxide wash (like this) was not only more effective but as effective as using bleaching trays.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping to deployed environment.</li>
            <li>Really??</li>
            <li>It was very gradual</li>
            <li>So I didn&#x27;t see much whitening out of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one is a very \\&quot;soft\\&quot; mint flavor</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s absolutely no burn, that&#x27;s my favorite part.</li>
            <li>About 3 seconds after you spit, the taste will REALLY hit you.</li>
            <li>White Glamorous White Rinse feels as if it is working adequately; my mouth feels clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>The flavor is very clinical with its hydrogen peroxide-like taste -</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s when you really know it is working.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The hydrogen peroxide amps up the tooth sensitivity to the point where it can be very painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, there has also not been much in terms of results.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work miracles (and can&#x27;t do more than lighten up the yellow developed over time from drinking soda and coffee)</li>
            <li>taste is not bad, and not as sharp as some mouthwashes I&#x27;ve tried, and it leaves a clean, minty flavor in my mouth.</li>
            <li>How about the other ingredients for stain and tarter control, and the additives that makes it enjoyable to use and enhance your breath?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other 3D whitening products before, and this stands up respectably with the group.  </li>
            <li>I do wake up with a slightly different taste in my mouth  -- not a bad taste, but a lighter form of the whitening rinse.  </li>
            <li>As everyone here has stated the main ingredient is Hydrogen Peroxide.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using them for many years and tend to switch through different versions to try out different types.</li>
            <li>I thought this rinse worked well, with some notable and visible improvements (my teeth stain fairly easily) especially in combination with an electric toothbrush that I started to use around the same time.  </li>
            <li>Take a capfull of this Glamorous White Rinse and swish it for at least 30 seconds and your teeth feel great and the taste is not over powering.  </li>
            <li>though the whitening is the same as generics, 3D White is a much better mouthwash.  </li>
            <li>If the price is decent, I recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The Crest product is as high quality as I have seen in the category.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for several days and so far, there&#x27;s not been any significant tooth sensitivity</li>
            <li>I am a little bit of a coffee, tea and e-cig smoker so I may need more products to get the \\&quot;glamorous\\&quot; result as well.</li>
            <li>I am male 78 years old and those good old teeth have chewed a lot of steaks and other food</li>
            <li>The flavor is an improvement over other mouthwashes  since strong minty flavors make me gag.</li>
            <li>flavor is a 1000x better than harsh, alcohol based mouthwashes.  </li>
            <li>I usually use Crest no alcohol mouthwash, I have never used the whitening kind, but thought I would give it ago, since whenever I use the whitening strips, my teeth get sensitive.  </li>
            <li>products claim the results will be a dentist office white smile but seldom do they deliver, even when directions are followed to a \\&quot;T.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Though this product suggests to use it with 3D White toothpaste, of course, for a whiter smile, I drink my coffee</li>
            <li>, so I am not going to compare to a color strip with the micro-shades of white to see if my smile is brighter.</li>
            <li>only complaints are that I was not a fan of the taste (though I love the toothpaste from this same line) and here&#x27;s the big one:  it really burns on your tongue and gums.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think its capable of taking coffee or nicotine stained teeth and turning them white on their own, at least not without verylong term use.  </li>
            <li>I am not obsessed with having blinding white teeth.</li>
            <li>The taste is comparatively mild to other rinses and mouthwashes.  </li>
            <li>but I bought the 3d strips and 3d toothpaste and wanted to complete the whitening trio.</li>
            <li>So if you have sensitive teeth or gums this might not be for you.</li>
            <li>So far I like this</li>
            <li>I generally enjoy the minty fresh taste that mouthwash leaves behind.</li>
            <li>I drink coffee and smoke daily when deployed and still gives me such a clean white look to my teeth.</li>
            <li>I get sensitive teeth and gums after using whitening strips, so this much gentler rinse is a welcome addition to my oral hygiene routine since it promises to lengthen the time between each white strip treatment without those unpleasant side effects.</li>
            <li>However, I have heard negative things about whiteners in general (can make teeth overly sensitive) and hydrogen peroxide more specifically</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new to these types of whitening rinses, you&#x27;ll probably experience tooth sensitivity at the beginning -- I recommend using it every other day at first until you get used to it.</li>
            <li>I love my white teeth, I use Crest 3d White Glamorous white rinse with my White Glamorous tooth paste and my teeth are sooo white.  </li>
            <li>You can get a similar results just buying a bottle of Hydrogen Peroxide and swishing your mouth with it, but the high concentration Hydrogen Peroxide would cause for a lot of bubbling,</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never used it, you may notice some sloughing of the skin in your mouth for a while, which is normal and not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like the cheap generics, Crest 3D White has hydrogen peroxide as its active ingredient, which means that the whitening it does is the same.  </li>
            <li>do like this Crest rinse, and the peroxide in it will help whiten your teeth a little at a time (and clean them further)</li>
            <li>B00336EUTK Crest 3d White Professional Effects</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I have sensitive teeth, I can&#x27;t use products such as the strips and trays that use concentrated hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li>I.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works as a mouthwash, though, and is certainly cheaper than other whitening products.</li>
            <li>I am finally noticing significantly whiter and brighter teeth following the instructions for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li>The taste is a little sour at first -- much like fluoride, although in this case it&#x27;s the hydrogen peroxide that flavors it -- which gets overtaken by mint during the 60 seconds of swishing.</li>
            <li>It also leaves a slight \\&quot;filmy\\&quot; taste on my gums that I don&#x27;t like as much - akin to when I&#x27;ve gargled with baking soda and water.</li>
            <li>The results of using this rinse twice a day for seven days is not nearly as dramatic as using whitening strips; however, the rinse does help maintain whiteness and even improve it a little.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a viable option for those with sensitive teeth to get some (albeit limited) whitening without going through the pain of concentrated products.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s sort of medicinally-minty - not bad, but not what I&#x27;d call refreshing either.</li>
            <li> love it becuse its very minty and give me good breath any time especially in the morning good even to put it in the office</li>
            <li> The minute rinse results in a mild foam that feels refreshing.  </li>
            <li> I got this for free from BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li> Great product and a terrific value.</li>
            <li> precisely, it seems to help maintain the whiteness of teeth.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s great to use before a big event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was comfortable to use and I quite like the foaming</li>
            <li> I love this mouth wash!&lt;br /&gt;So refreshing, and It really makes your teeth whiter!!&lt;br /&gt;im</li>
            <li> My experience with this Crest Rinse has been a good one so far, as it does seem to do what it promises - whiten teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my be unique</li>
            <li> My original review appears below.</li>
            <li> It turns out that there really is a significant difference.</li>
            <li> It does have a lot of other good things going for it though!</li>
            <li> clean teeth and clean mouth Feeling .</li>
            <li> However, I want them to look clean and</li>
            <li> Again, this and the rest of the 3D whitening line aren&#x27;t meant to replace a more professional whitening, but this is on par with any respectable whitening rinse or toothpaste.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Three teaspoons of this rinse swished around for sixty seconds will leave a mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Also, for others reading this, be sure to check out some of Morning&#x27;s other reviews and you&#x27;ll see that she doesn&#x27;t have much good to say about anything.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works great, but minus one for taste.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product now for more than a month and believe it or not my teeth are much whiter than before.  </li>
            <li> I thought these are full sized...\\&quot;</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re supposed to swish for a full 60 seconds</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually takes a good bit of effort to gargle for the required 60 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even without the intense mint burn of most washes it leaves your mouth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Afterward, my mouth feels clean and fresh with no lingering sourness.</li>
            <li> It is mild and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In fact, like most mouthwashes, the last 30 seconds is challenging because the mint starts to burn my tongue.</li>
            <li> I could not recommend this product more highly.</li>
            <li> On the flip side, expecting this mouthwash to work miracles on its own is probably not warranted--it needs to be used as part of a regular brushing and flossing routine to have full effectiveness.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom Line - Great at keeping teeth whiter, but unlikely to whiten teeth quickly on its own.</li>
            <li> So if I&#x27;m noticing a whiter smile in seven days, can you image how awesome it would be for someone without these icky habits?!</li>
            <li> - it keeps your breath fresh</li>
            <li> Eventually, my teenaged son complimented me on my smile.</li>
            <li> The crest whitening products boast a whiter smile in seven days.</li>
            <li> I like the idea whitening my smile while doing something I do every day anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth using if you&#x27;re a coffee drinker (like me).  </li>
            <li> &quot; (what a name, right?)</li>
            <li> They do look whiter right after I rinse</li>
            <li> It goes away quickly, and certainly by the time I eat or drink anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also did not make my mouth more sensitive (and some really do).</li>
            <li> If you prefer using something with a strong clean breath smell like Scope, where it&#x27;s the last thing you swish in your mouth</li>
            <li> So far I have seen a huge difference on my teeth.</li>
            <li> First of all, this product is not $30, it&#x27;s $22.33.</li>
            <li> But When I looked at at picture, sure enough my teeth are a lot whiter.</li>
            <li> There was some shading that was pretty aging.</li>
            <li> Personally, I have to believe the toothbrush is more to thank for this improvement than the mouthwash per se; but any additional help provided by the rinse is still an improvement.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll see a change immediately after the first use.  </li>
            <li> First of all, I love the way this rinse feels in my mouth -- the hydrogen peroxide solution definitely foams in the mouth as I swish it around, and feels as if it is preparing my gums and teeth for brushing.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t say if you should brush first or if you should use it just before bed.  </li>
            <li> I like this better than white strips because it works on your whole mouth - and it is much easier to use.  </li>
            <li> In the end this is a nice rinse that does not have the burn that Listerine and other non alcohol free ones have, and if it whitens my teeth that is an extra bonus!  </li>
            <li> but I saw results in a matter of days, particularly so in the first couple of hours afterwards</li>
            <li> The main reason I switched to this from my usual Listerine is because I read about a study that said whitening toothpastes had little effect but swishing 2x a day for a minute with a peroxide wash (like this) was not only more effective but as effective as using bleaching trays.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping to deployed environment.</li>
            <li> Really??</li>
            <li> It was very gradual</li>
            <li> So I didn&#x27;t see much whitening out of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one is a very \\&quot;soft\\&quot; mint flavor</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s absolutely no burn, that&#x27;s my favorite part.</li>
            <li> About 3 seconds after you spit, the taste will REALLY hit you.</li>
            <li> White Glamorous White Rinse feels as if it is working adequately; my mouth feels clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> The flavor is very clinical with its hydrogen peroxide-like taste -</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when you really know it is working.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hydrogen peroxide amps up the tooth sensitivity to the point where it can be very painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, there has also not been much in terms of results.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work miracles (and can&#x27;t do more than lighten up the yellow developed over time from drinking soda and coffee)</li>
            <li> taste is not bad, and not as sharp as some mouthwashes I&#x27;ve tried, and it leaves a clean, minty flavor in my mouth.</li>
            <li> How about the other ingredients for stain and tarter control, and the additives that makes it enjoyable to use and enhance your breath?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other 3D whitening products before, and this stands up respectably with the group.  </li>
            <li> I do wake up with a slightly different taste in my mouth  -- not a bad taste, but a lighter form of the whitening rinse.  </li>
            <li> As everyone here has stated the main ingredient is Hydrogen Peroxide.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using them for many years and tend to switch through different versions to try out different types.</li>
            <li> I thought this rinse worked well, with some notable and visible improvements (my teeth stain fairly easily) especially in combination with an electric toothbrush that I started to use around the same time.  </li>
            <li> Take a capfull of this Glamorous White Rinse and swish it for at least 30 seconds and your teeth feel great and the taste is not over powering.  </li>
            <li> though the whitening is the same as generics, 3D White is a much better mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> If the price is decent, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The Crest product is as high quality as I have seen in the category.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for several days and so far, there&#x27;s not been any significant tooth sensitivity</li>
            <li> I am a little bit of a coffee, tea and e-cig smoker so I may need more products to get the \\&quot;glamorous\\&quot; result as well.</li>
            <li> I am male 78 years old and those good old teeth have chewed a lot of steaks and other food</li>
            <li> The flavor is an improvement over other mouthwashes  since strong minty flavors make me gag.</li>
            <li> flavor is a 1000x better than harsh, alcohol based mouthwashes.  </li>
            <li> I usually use Crest no alcohol mouthwash, I have never used the whitening kind, but thought I would give it ago, since whenever I use the whitening strips, my teeth get sensitive.  </li>
            <li> products claim the results will be a dentist office white smile but seldom do they deliver, even when directions are followed to a \\&quot;T.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Though this product suggests to use it with 3D White toothpaste, of course, for a whiter smile, I drink my coffee</li>
            <li> , so I am not going to compare to a color strip with the micro-shades of white to see if my smile is brighter.</li>
            <li> only complaints are that I was not a fan of the taste (though I love the toothpaste from this same line) and here&#x27;s the big one:  it really burns on your tongue and gums.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think its capable of taking coffee or nicotine stained teeth and turning them white on their own, at least not without verylong term use.  </li>
            <li> I am not obsessed with having blinding white teeth.</li>
            <li> The taste is comparatively mild to other rinses and mouthwashes.  </li>
            <li> but I bought the 3d strips and 3d toothpaste and wanted to complete the whitening trio.</li>
            <li> So if you have sensitive teeth or gums this might not be for you.</li>
            <li> So far I like this</li>
            <li> I generally enjoy the minty fresh taste that mouthwash leaves behind.</li>
            <li> I drink coffee and smoke daily when deployed and still gives me such a clean white look to my teeth.</li>
            <li> I get sensitive teeth and gums after using whitening strips, so this much gentler rinse is a welcome addition to my oral hygiene routine since it promises to lengthen the time between each white strip treatment without those unpleasant side effects.</li>
            <li> However, I have heard negative things about whiteners in general (can make teeth overly sensitive) and hydrogen peroxide more specifically</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to these types of whitening rinses, you&#x27;ll probably experience tooth sensitivity at the beginning -- I recommend using it every other day at first until you get used to it.</li>
            <li> I love my white teeth, I use Crest 3d White Glamorous white rinse with my White Glamorous tooth paste and my teeth are sooo white.  </li>
            <li> You can get a similar results just buying a bottle of Hydrogen Peroxide and swishing your mouth with it, but the high concentration Hydrogen Peroxide would cause for a lot of bubbling,</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used it, you may notice some sloughing of the skin in your mouth for a while, which is normal and not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like the cheap generics, Crest 3D White has hydrogen peroxide as its active ingredient, which means that the whitening it does is the same.  </li>
            <li> do like this Crest rinse, and the peroxide in it will help whiten your teeth a little at a time (and clean them further)</li>
            <li> B00336EUTK Crest 3d White Professional Effects</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I have sensitive teeth, I can&#x27;t use products such as the strips and trays that use concentrated hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li> I.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works as a mouthwash, though, and is certainly cheaper than other whitening products.</li>
            <li> I am finally noticing significantly whiter and brighter teeth following the instructions for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> The taste is a little sour at first -- much like fluoride, although in this case it&#x27;s the hydrogen peroxide that flavors it -- which gets overtaken by mint during the 60 seconds of swishing.</li>
            <li> It also leaves a slight \\&quot;filmy\\&quot; taste on my gums that I don&#x27;t like as much - akin to when I&#x27;ve gargled with baking soda and water.</li>
            <li> The results of using this rinse twice a day for seven days is not nearly as dramatic as using whitening strips; however, the rinse does help maintain whiteness and even improve it a little.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a viable option for those with sensitive teeth to get some (albeit limited) whitening without going through the pain of concentrated products.</li>
            <li> I have to say it does clean your mouth out very well withought the harsh buring tongue, that I usually get with other products.</li>
            <li> With this particular product you are paying a little extra for the convenience of the smaller bottles.</li>
            <li> but I could never make it past 30 seconds before the burning was too much</li>
            <li> The aftertaste does not last long and is bearable.  </li>
            <li> It is useful as a mouthwash, helps remove particles from the teeth and gums, and, though I noticed no remarkable difference in whiteness, seems to be beneficial in overall oral care.</li>
            <li> While that is very effective in beaching out tooth stains and discoloration, it is also horrible if you have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> product does leave a foamy aftertaste and feels like it is working a long time after swishing.</li>
            <li> For this reason, I&#x27;ve been using generics for a long time, and they work well.  </li>
            <li> I know my mouth felt clean, even if there was a bit of a weird aftertaste that isn&#x27;t there with non-whitening mouthwashes.  </li>
            <li> As far as the whitening power, I am just not sure.  </li>
            <li> but that is because my gums are so dark red.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed only a slight difference in whiteness, however, in seven days; in fourteen days, the difference is noticeable.</li>
            <li> I really like the taste of this mouthwash and it seems to work very well at killing bad breath and germs.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like green or blue mouthwashes,</li>
            <li> Well, in case you&#x27;re fortunate enough not to be either of these things, this bad habits cause harsh stains on the teeth.  </li>
            <li> and they are not pretty</li>
            <li> if you want to save more cash, buy this version: [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I had been using an ordinary Listerine-like product prior to trying the Crest Rinse.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no alcohol in the mix, but there still is some burning feeling when I use it due to the hydrogen peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I sometimes have trouble with dry mouth and also mouth sores due to medication.</li>
            <li> IF, however, this stuff wouldn&#x27;t have worked, it would be going directly down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a week I see less staining of my teeth from coffee and tea and no staining from the Multiprotection.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although it&#x27;s not fun to admit, it should be noted I am a smoker and a heavy dark soda drinker.  </li>
            <li> But keep your expectations as to the whitening effects pretty low, or you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not nearly as pleasant as a traditional mouthwash since the hydrogen peroxide taste comes through.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;I was a little hopeful about try a whitening rinse.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t take before and after pictures, but it did seem like my teeth were a little whiter after 7 - 10 days.  </li>
            <li> The mouthwash is not bad when you are rinsing, and does not seem any different than other mouthwashes, but when you spit it out you get a lingering aftertaste which is really nasty.  </li>
            <li> but after a few weeks&#x27; of using both it does leave my teeth noticeably</li>
            <li> After years of using alcohol heavy washes this one is a blessing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this for a few weeks, I am sorry to say that my teeth are the same cream color they were when I started.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would reorder.</li>
            <li> Also, I am not sure where you are paying $5 per gallon for gas.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that this could actually whiten teeth in 7 days as it claims, but it indeed worked for me.  </li>
            <li> have noticed a small difference in my teeth, they do appear whiter when I go to bed (after rinsing).  </li>
            <li> I have used a variety of mouthwashes; I usually use Listerine or Scope.</li>
            <li> in conjunction with my usual toothpaste, Sensodyne Plus Whitening, not the Crest 3D toothpaste recommended, as part of my oral care program: thorough flossing, rinsing for one minute, then brushing with an Oral B electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> so I am not sure if using it after I brush my teeth is countering the benefits of say fluoride.  </li>
            <li> Slamming the product because you are illiterate is a poor example of helping other consumers decide on products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Obviously the prior reviewer (\\&quot;Morning\\&quot;) that gave this procduct 1-Star can&#x27;t read, possesses pathetic math skills, and slept through chemistry in high school.</li>
            <li> Slow working teeth whiteners are hard to gauge.  </li>
            <li> The Hydrogen Peroxide will slowly whiten and provide additional cleaning to your teeth.</li>
            <li> The flavor it leaves behind in your mouth is unbearable.</li>
            <li> I hate going to the dentist, so I&#x27;m definitely not going in for optional services.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> foaminess caused by the peroxide is a little unpleasant to me.  </li>
            <li> It does seem to keep the bad breath at bay a little longer than some washes but that could be just me.</li>
            <li> Are they insane??</li>
            <li> stuff is disgusting.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using this product now for more than a month and believe it or not my teeth are much whiter than before.  I am male 78 years old and those good old teeth have chewed a lot of steaks and other food and they are not pretty - They look much better now!  Give it a try.</li>
            <li> I love my white teeth, I use Crest 3d White Glamorous white rinse with my White Glamorous tooth paste and my teeth are sooo white.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Made teeth look amazing !!!&lt;br /&gt;Very clean teeth and clean mouth Feeling .</li>
            <li> I love this mouth wash!&lt;br /&gt;So refreshing, and It really makes your teeth whiter!!&lt;br /&gt;im so purchasing this again !</li>
            <li> Teeth look whiter just after use of product, but yellow color returns after about an hour.  Not sure if I would reorder.</li>
            <li> love it becuse its very minty and give me good breath any time especially in the morning good even to put it in the office</li>
            <li> Fast shipping to deployed environment. Product is as advertised. I have used this product before and I knew that it foams more than others when you swish but I bought the 3d strips and 3d toothpaste and wanted to complete the whitening trio. So far I have seen a huge difference on my teeth. I drink coffee and smoke daily when deployed and still gives me such a clean white look to my teeth. I cant wait to continue using it when I get back. I do not drink coffee and seldom smoke when I am in the states. Good stuff.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Rip OFF!! I thought these are full sized, they are NOT! They are sample/travel size! So for $30 you get 0.375 gallons, that&#x27;s like $90 (NINETY DOLLARS) per gallon!! Are they insane?? We complain about gas at just $5 a gallon! And you can&#x27;t make gas at home, but you can make this. All it is is sweetened hydrogen peroxide! Next time I am just buying a 99 cent bottle of hydrogen peroxide and adding some splenda and mint flavor.</li>
            <li> I got this for free from BzzAgent.  That said, this is a product that I will go out and purchase.  It whitens my teeth and works great, even when not used every day.</li>
            <li> Great product and a terrific value. I highly recommend this product. The bottle sizes are great for medicine cabinets and traveling. The 6 bottles lasted me 5 months with once-per-day use. Can you get this product cheaper if you buy larger-sized bottles? Sure. With this particular product you are paying a little extra for the convenience of the smaller bottles. if you want to save more cash, buy this version: [[ASIN:B001F51QG6 Crest 3d White Glamorous White Rinse 32 Fl Oz (Pack of 3)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously the prior reviewer (\\&quot;Morning\\&quot;) that gave this procduct 1-Star can&#x27;t read, possesses pathetic math skills, and slept through chemistry in high school. These are NOT sample-size bottles, they are easy-to-handle 8oz. bottles. 6 of them. Morning states, \\&quot;Rip OFF!! I thought these are full sized...\\&quot; Well guess what Morning, it doesn&#x27;t matter what you thought, the description states, \\&quot;Crest 3d White Glamorous White Rinse 8 Fl Oz (Pack of 6) by Crest.\\&quot; So, reading comprehension is key when actually READING product description pages. Slamming the product because you are illiterate is a poor example of helping other consumers decide on products. Now, onto the math skills . . . Morning states, \\&quot;So for $30 you get 0.375 gallons, that&#x27;s like $90 (NINETY DOLLARS) per gallon!! First of all, this product is not $30, it&#x27;s $22.33. And six 8oz. bottles equals 48oz. There&#x27;s 128oz. in a gallon. At $22.33 that works out to $59.52 per gallon. Also, I am not sure where you are paying $5 per gallon for gas. And regarding your comment, \\&quot;...but you can make this. All it is is sweetened hydrogen peroxide! Really?? How about the other ingredients for stain and tarter control, and the additives that makes it enjoyable to use and enhance your breath? I hope you are not a school teacher (or an employee anywhere for that matter!). Also, for others reading this, be sure to check out some of Morning&#x27;s other reviews and you&#x27;ll see that she doesn&#x27;t have much good to say about anything.</li>
            <li> My experience with this Crest Rinse has been a good one so far, as it does seem to do what it promises - whiten teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More precisely, it seems to help maintain the whiteness of teeth.  I don&#x27;t think its capable of taking coffee or nicotine stained teeth and turning them white on their own, at least not without verylong term use.  If you&#x27;re looking for that, I suggest [[ASIN:B00336EUTK Crest 3d White Professional Effects Teeth Whitening Strips 20 Count]] or a similar product, which is what I used to help deal with the effect of years of coffee drinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;Glamorous White Rinse\\&quot; (what a name, right?) does seem to effectively complement and maintain that whitening, along with freshening breath with a taste that isn&#x27;t exactly \\&quot;tasty\\&quot;, but quite tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line - Great at keeping teeth whiter, but unlikely to whiten teeth quickly on its own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Crest&#x27;s 3d white rinse and toothpaste on and off for a while now. It doesn&#x27;t work miracles (and can&#x27;t do more than lighten up the yellow developed over time from drinking soda and coffee) but after a few weeks&#x27; of using both it does leave my teeth noticeably whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is not bad, and not as sharp as some mouthwashes I&#x27;ve tried, and it leaves a clean, minty flavor in my mouth. It also leaves a slight \\&quot;filmy\\&quot; taste on my gums that I don&#x27;t like as much - akin to when I&#x27;ve gargled with baking soda and water. It suggests just spitting it all out, but to eliminate that taste I&#x27;ll sometimes rinse with water. It goes away quickly, and certainly by the time I eat or drink anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty happy with it, and expect to keep using it for its impact on my teeth and breath.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that this could actually whiten teeth in 7 days as it claims, but it indeed worked for me.  My experience my be unique but I saw results in a matter of days, particularly so in the first couple of hours afterwards so it&#x27;s great to use before a big event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaints are that I was not a fan of the taste (though I love the toothpaste from this same line) and here&#x27;s the big one:  it really burns on your tongue and gums.  You&#x27;re supposed to swish for a full 60 seconds but I could never make it past 30 seconds before the burning was too much and I had to spit it out.  So if you have sensitive teeth or gums this might not be for you.</li>
            <li> Love it when something works as promoted.  I love my espresso, but not the stains on my teeth.  After a week of using this mouthwash after I finished my coffee I did have whiter teeth.  I like this better than white strips because it works on your whole mouth - and it is much easier to use.  One tip:  floss before using so you get the benefits of this product on the sides of your teeth, too.  A bonus - it keeps your breath fresh</li>
            <li> I found the taste to be neutral and I followed the directions. I am using this product before bed to  get some whitening. After breakfast I am using the Multiprotection Rinse to benefit my gums. I am hoping that if I am susceptible to the staining by the Multiprotection, that the White Rinse will counteract it. After a week I see less staining of my teeth from coffee and tea and no staining from the Multiprotection.</li>
            <li> I really like the taste of this mouthwash and it seems to work very well at killing bad breath and germs. As far as the whitening power, I am just not sure.  After using it over a week I could not really tell the difference, but I already use a whitening toothpaste, so I may not be the best person to judge how well this product works in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does leave a foamy aftertaste and feels like it is working a long time after swishing.</li>
            <li> I am not obsessed with having blinding white teeth. However, I want them to look clean and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This rinse tastes a lot like hydrogen peroxide which can be a good, inexpensive rinse. However, I have heard negative things about whiteners in general (can make teeth overly sensitive) and hydrogen peroxide more specifically (they may be a carcinogen).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not use this on a daily basis because I think there are healthier rinses out there, but I might use it occasionally.</li>
            <li> My original review appears below. It turns out that there really is a significant difference. People started telling me that I looked great. Eventually, my teenaged son complimented me on my smile. It was very gradual so I kind of didn&#x27;t notice. But When I looked at at picture, sure enough my teeth are a lot whiter. The most noticeable difference is on the sides of my teeth and between the teeth. There was some shading that was pretty aging. It looks much better now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;I was a little hopeful about try a whitening rinse. Who doesn&#x27;t want to look better?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this for a few weeks, I am sorry to say that my teeth are the same cream color they were when I started. They do look whiter right after I rinse but that is because my gums are so dark red. So I didn&#x27;t see much whitening out of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it is a good mouthwash. I sometimes have trouble with dry mouth and also mouth sores due to medication. This did not irritate my mouth at all. It also did not make my mouth more sensitive (and some really do). It was comfortable to use and I quite like the foaming action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whitening or not, this is a good mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I have been using this crest 3d white for awhile. I have to say it does clean your mouth out very well withought the harsh buring tongue, that I usually get with other products. My mouth feels great and my breath smells wonderful as well. I do know know about whitening but I do know that this is great for rinsing out your mouth as well as your teethe feeling good.</li>
            <li> As everyone here has stated the main ingredient is Hydrogen Peroxide. I am finally noticing significantly whiter and brighter teeth following the instructions for a few weeks now. The flavor is an improvement over other mouthwashes  since strong minty flavors make me gag. This one is a very \\&quot;soft\\&quot; mint flavor and I can handle that. It does seem to keep the bad breath at bay a little longer than some washes but that could be just me. I am a little bit of a coffee, tea and e-cig smoker so I may need more products to get the \\&quot;glamorous\\&quot; result as well. But still... I will continue to use this instead of the stronger/alcohol types since the hydrogen peroxide does make a big difference in whitening.</li>
            <li> We have used just about every mouth wash from Crest and Scope they make. We&#x27;ve been using them for many years and tend to switch through different versions to try out different types. This Crest 3D White mouthwash was one we&#x27;ve used off and on for a while. What causes the whitening effects is the Hydrogen Peroxide that&#x27;s included in the formula, which is also what&#x27;s used in Crest White Strips when you use then to whiten your teeth. You can get a similar results just buying a bottle of Hydrogen Peroxide and swishing your mouth with it, but the high concentration Hydrogen Peroxide would cause for a lot of bubbling, more than one may like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like this Crest rinse, and the peroxide in it will help whiten your teeth a little at a time (and clean them further), however I always feel the need to rinse my mouth out with after rinsing with this. It&#x27;s the only way to stop the tiny bubbling effects of the Hydrogen Peroxide in the formula. So if you don&#x27;t mind an additional swish with water when you&#x27;re all done, this is a great mouthwash. The Hydrogen Peroxide will slowly whiten and provide additional cleaning to your teeth. If you prefer using something with a strong clean breath smell like Scope, where it&#x27;s the last thing you swish in your mouth so you can keep the fresh-breath smell, this version may not be your favorite.</li>
            <li> After years of using alcohol heavy washes this one is a blessing. There&#x27;s absolutely no burn, that&#x27;s my favorite part. It does have a lot of other good things going for it though! Even without the intense mint burn of most washes it leaves your mouth feeling clean and fresh. I love how clean the peroxide makes my mouth feel. After using this wash and the Crest 3D White toothpaste I notices a difference in my teeth. It may not give you amazingly white toothpaste commercial teeth, but it definitely whitens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this mouthwash. I don&#x27;t foresee ever switching to another brand.</li>
            <li> As a regular cola, coffee and tea drinker, I definitely don&#x27;t expect miracles with a product like this.  Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1-It seems to help maintain my teeth against the onslaught of staining drinks I consume, but not necessarily whiten them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2-The flavor is a 1000x better than harsh, alcohol based mouthwashes.  It is mild and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3-The foaminess caused by the peroxide is a little unpleasant to me.  Having that frothy feeling in my mouth *almost* triggers a gag reflex.  (don&#x27;t even think about touching that comment, trolls!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good product that seems best used in conjunction with Crest&#x27;s other whitening products if whiter teeth are what you&#x27;re really after.  It is a good alternative to alcohol based mouthwash for those who are looking for one.</li>
            <li> I usually use Crest no alcohol mouthwash, I have never used the whitening kind, but thought I would give it ago, since whenever I use the whitening strips, my teeth get sensitive.  The mouthwash is not bad when you are rinsing, and does not seem any different than other mouthwashes, but when you spit it out you get a lingering aftertaste which is really nasty.  I deal with it (since you do not want to rinse your mouth with water or you will lose some of the benefits), I am assuming the aftertaste is from the whitening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed a small difference in my teeth, they do appear whiter when I go to bed (after rinsing).  The aftertaste does not last long and is bearable.  In the end this is a nice rinse that does not have the burn that Listerine and other non alcohol free ones have, and if it whitens my teeth that is an extra bonus!  So far I like this and I have never had an issue with a Crest mouthwash.</li>
            <li> The crest whitening products boast a whiter smile in seven days. I decided to use [[ASIN:B00336EUTA Crest Whitening Mouthwash]] in conjunction with the [[ASIN:B003CP12MU Crest Pro-Health Whitening Toothpaste]]. I like the idea whitening my smile while doing something I do every day anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is disgusting. It&#x27;s not that the taste is so gross; it&#x27;s that the aftertaste is gross. The flavor it leaves behind in your mouth is unbearable. I have used a variety of mouthwashes; I usually use Listerine or Scope. I generally enjoy the minty fresh taste that mouthwash leaves behind. That&#x27;s not the case with this mouth wash. About 3 seconds after you spit, the taste will REALLY hit you. You&#x27;ll be rushing for the water faucet. It&#x27;s actually takes a good bit of effort to gargle for the required 60 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my total shock, my teeth were whiter after ten days. (see photo) IF, however, this stuff wouldn&#x27;t have worked, it would be going directly down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great, but minus one for taste.</li>
            <li> I thought this rinse worked well, with some notable and visible improvements (my teeth stain fairly easily) especially in combination with an electric toothbrush that I started to use around the same time.  Personally, I have to believe the toothbrush is more to thank for this improvement than the mouthwash per se; but any additional help provided by the rinse is still an improvement.  On the flip side, expecting this mouthwash to work miracles on its own is probably not warranted--it needs to be used as part of a regular brushing and flossing routine to have full effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve tried a variety of teeth whitening products.  I hate going to the dentist, so I&#x27;m definitely not going in for optional services.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many products claim the results will be a dentist office white smile but seldom do they deliver, even when directions are followed to a \\&quot;T.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so with the [[ASIN:B001F51QG6 Crest 3D White Glamorous Rinse]]!  Within the seven days it promises, I had noticeably whiter teeth.  AND, as I&#x27;ve continued to use it, I can see I&#x27;m well on my way to the bright smile I&#x27;ve wanted for so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it&#x27;s not fun to admit, it should be noted I am a smoker and a heavy dark soda drinker.  Why do I mention this?  Well, in case you&#x27;re fortunate enough not to be either of these things, this bad habits cause harsh stains on the teeth.  So if I&#x27;m noticing a whiter smile in seven days, can you image how awesome it would be for someone without these icky habits?!</li>
            <li> This rinse does help whiten your teeth, although you shouldn&#x27;t expect drastic changes.  You&#x27;ll see a change immediately after the first use.  Then after a couple of weeks of regular use, you&#x27;ll notice your teeth are definitely whiter than when you began. It&#x27;s worth using if you&#x27;re a coffee drinker (like me).  If you&#x27;re new to these types of whitening rinses, you&#x27;ll probably experience tooth sensitivity at the beginning -- I recommend using it every other day at first until you get used to it.</li>
            <li> I definitely notice a difference in the whiteness of my teeth after using this product for several weeks. I used the Crest 3D White Glamorous White Rinse (what a name!) in conjunction with my usual toothpaste, Sensodyne Plus Whitening, not the Crest 3D toothpaste recommended, as part of my oral care program: thorough flossing, rinsing for one minute, then brushing with an Oral B electric toothbrush. I had been using an ordinary Listerine-like product prior to trying the Crest Rinse. First of all, I love the way this rinse feels in my mouth -- the hydrogen peroxide solution definitely foams in the mouth as I swish it around, and feels as if it is preparing my gums and teeth for brushing. Second, the result after three + weeks is defiitely whiter teeth after using twice a day. I could not recommend this product more highly.</li>
            <li> The taste is unbearable !!</li>
            <li> The Crest product is as high quality as I have seen in the category. It is useful as a mouthwash, helps remove particles from the teeth and gums, and, though I noticed no remarkable difference in whiteness, seems to be beneficial in overall oral care.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other 3D whitening products before, and this stands up respectably with the group.  While this may not be at a professional whitening level, this rinse is a great addition to a dental care regime wanting a whitening boost.  The minute rinse results in a mild foam that feels refreshing.  I found morning and night usage did indeed show results after seven days.  The taste is comparatively mild to other rinses and mouthwashes.  Again, this and the rest of the 3D whitening line aren&#x27;t meant to replace a more professional whitening, but this is on par with any respectable whitening rinse or toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This is one Crest Rinse product that I trust...some of the Pro-Health ones scare me now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3D White Glamorous White Rinse feels as if it is working adequately; my mouth feels clean and fresh. The flavor is very clinical with its hydrogen peroxide-like taste - I know how hydrogen peroxide tastes because I use it as a mouth rinse on occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is from the people who make Crest Whitestrips. I have used Whitestrips before and I did not notice a difference. Though this product suggests to use it with 3D White toothpaste, of course, for a whiter smile, I drink my coffee and I never have had pearly whites, so I am not going to compare to a color strip with the micro-shades of white to see if my smile is brighter. I just like that this stuff does not absorb some potent ingredient into my tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three teaspoons of this rinse swished around for sixty seconds will leave a mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> We use the Crest 3D toothpaste, so this was a must try.  I don&#x27;t like green or blue mouthwashes, always too minty.  Take a capfull of this Glamorous White Rinse and swish it for at least 30 seconds and your teeth feel great and the taste is not over powering.  I already have white teeth, so I can&#x27;t judge if it made them any brighter, but i do recommend it.</li>
            <li> Slow working teeth whiteners are hard to gauge.  After two weeks, I believe that my teeth are a tad bit whiter, but I am not 100% sure.  I should have taken a picture or somehow found a point of reference to compare by.  When I use strips alone, you can see the color change in a matter of days.  But these mouth rinses are judged in weeks, I believe.  My hope is that someone I only see once a week or once a month will say, \\&quot;Hey, are your teeth whiter?\\&quot;  That&#x27;s when you really know it is working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is okay.  I do wake up with a slightly different taste in my mouth  -- not a bad taste, but a lighter form of the whitening rinse.  The product doesn&#x27;t say if it helps fighting cavities so I am not sure if using it after I brush my teeth is countering the benefits of say fluoride.  Actually, the product instructs us to use it twice a day -- day and night.  It doesn&#x27;t say if you should brush first or if you should use it just before bed.  I think I might switch to using the product after dinner but before my nightly brush.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t take before and after pictures, but it did seem like my teeth were a little whiter after 7 - 10 days.  I know my mouth felt clean, even if there was a bit of a weird aftertaste that isn&#x27;t there with non-whitening mouthwashes.  My wife was more convinced of its whitening properties than I.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works as a mouthwash, though, and is certainly cheaper than other whitening products. We&#x27;d recommend giving it a shot.</li>
            <li> Like the cheap generics, Crest 3D White has hydrogen peroxide as its active ingredient, which means that the whitening it does is the same.  For this reason, I&#x27;ve been using generics for a long time, and they work well.  Hydrogen peroxide (yes, the stuff you use on wounds) is good for superficial stains between dental visits.  If you&#x27;ve never used it, you may notice some sloughing of the skin in your mouth for a while, which is normal and not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though the whitening is the same as generics, 3D White is a much better mouthwash.  The flavor is better, and it leaves my breath fresher for a longer period of time.  If the price is decent, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product actually workes, my family use it now</li>
            <li> The results of using this rinse twice a day for seven days is not nearly as dramatic as using whitening strips; however, the rinse does help maintain whiteness and even improve it a little. I get sensitive teeth and gums after using whitening strips, so this much gentler rinse is a welcome addition to my oral hygiene routine since it promises to lengthen the time between each white strip treatment without those unpleasant side effects. The taste is a little sour at first -- much like fluoride, although in this case it&#x27;s the hydrogen peroxide that flavors it -- which gets overtaken by mint during the 60 seconds of swishing. In fact, like most mouthwashes, the last 30 seconds is challenging because the mint starts to burn my tongue. Afterward, my mouth feels clean and fresh with no lingering sourness. I&#x27;ve noticed only a slight difference in whiteness, however, in seven days; in fourteen days, the difference is noticeable. I do like that the rinse gets everywhere in my mouth instead of the white strips which whiten only the front teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</li>
            <li> The main reason I switched to this from my usual Listerine is because I read about a study that said whitening toothpastes had little effect but swishing 2x a day for a minute with a peroxide wash (like this) was not only more effective but as effective as using bleaching trays. Hence, I now swish twice a day. And yes, I have seen results! This doesn&#x27;t have the burn of Listerine, and my favorite flavor is the Arctic because it&#x27;s the most minty. For the amount of effort and the whitening I&#x27;ve experienced this is a really easy habit to get into!</li>
            <li> The problem with tooth whiteners is that they use a concentrated hydrogen peroxide formula (for the most part). While that is very effective in beaching out tooth stains and discoloration, it is also horrible if you have sensitive teeth. The hydrogen peroxide amps up the tooth sensitivity to the point where it can be very painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have sensitive teeth, I can&#x27;t use products such as the strips and trays that use concentrated hydrogen peroxide. But the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in this rinse appears to be low enough that it does not cause a problem. I&#x27;ve been using it for several days and so far, there&#x27;s not been any significant tooth sensitivity impact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there has also not been much in terms of results. I think it has had some effect, but it&#x27;s nowhere close to what a strip-based whitener would do in the same time period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is OK. It&#x27;s not nearly as pleasant as a traditional mouthwash since the hydrogen peroxide taste comes through. It&#x27;s sort of medicinally-minty - not bad, but not what I&#x27;d call refreshing either. There&#x27;s no alcohol in the mix, but there still is some burning feeling when I use it due to the hydrogen peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a viable option for those with sensitive teeth to get some (albeit limited) whitening without going through the pain of concentrated products. But keep your expectations as to the whitening effects pretty low, or you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
