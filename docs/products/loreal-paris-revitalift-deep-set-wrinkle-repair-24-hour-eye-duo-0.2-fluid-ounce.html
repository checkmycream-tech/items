            <li>and I think you&#x27;ll be pleased!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very effective product.  </li>
            <li>Handy to take along!</li>
            <li>I think this is a good product, though sometimes it makes my eyes burn.</li>
            <li>Neither one of the 2 I purchased was any good</li>
            <li>This product is very good for that type of transient fine,</li>
            <li>Then I get them where my eye sockets are at the bottom of my eyes, they look like real fine hairline cracks.</li>
            <li>I liked it.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>price is a bit high, but the company puts out very good promotions on the product if you watch their website.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the results I would recomment this product.  </li>
            <li>I liked the consistency and it has a light scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a product i will buy again, mostly because of the retinol and because i have seen results with this product.</li>
            <li>Im the type of person that goes from product to product to see if something is better, but i may stick with this unless something that is proven to work better comes</li>
            <li>there is def more retinol in the roc.</li>
            <li>so i know that there is more retinol in the roc and will continue to use the roc.</li>
            <li>The best feature is the convenience of having both the day creme and the night creme in the same tube.  </li>
            <li>Price is better here then on the loreal website and target.</li>
            <li>I use the Olay Pro X skincare line, which is way better.</li>
            <li>Pretty good moisturizer for the eye area.</li>
            <li>For something more powerful expect to pay 4x more.</li>
            <li>fine line.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over 3 wks, I see no change in the wrinkles and fine lines.  </li>
            <li>While this is not a miracle cream, it does soften the appearance of fine lines.</li>
            <li>Its ok... not the best, not the worse.</li>
            <li>This was nothing special.</li>
            <li>i noticed that my eyes were no longer puffy when i woke up and the fine lines have softened quite a bit and that large crease that was forming i can no longer see.</li>
            <li>I will finish using it just to get my moneys worth but will not purchase it again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In terms of effects, I haven&#x27;t really notices any significant changes,.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I couldn&#x27;t tell that my skin was any firmer or more youthful looking after using it for over a month, but I couldn&#x27;t see any new lines either, and, as I mentioned, I very much appreciated the moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>this actually works ok for what it is..</li>
            <li>Moreover, I have an impression that it actually enhances my wrinkles, and I can see even more wrinkles than before.</li>
            <li>I like how easy it is to use and the double sided cap for AM and PM sides.</li>
            <li>I liked how it kept the eye area hydrated as it is very dry where I live.</li>
            <li>Although i do not have deep wrinkles, I do have fine lines.</li>
            <li>I am 50 and really starting to get fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed some improvement in my lines and also my whole eye area.  </li>
            <li>It is really convenient that it is all in one stick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to identify myself as a Bzz agent who is fortunate enough to try out this product and</li>
            <li>I also love the duo tube where your day cream is on one side and night cream on the other.  </li>
            <li>It made me much more likely to remember to use it consistently which I think is the key to reducing wrinkles.</li>
            <li>but not enough sleep and stress most likely takes part in the results i am getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It will not really show the results super fast like everyone wants, but keep using it</li>
            <li>so I was looking for something that would prevent development of new wrinkles and diminish the existing lines.</li>
            <li>and the sensitive eye cream does not seem to be sensitive cuz it still makes my eye area burn for about 5 mins.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin around the eyes and there was no burning or irritation.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very convenient to use and compact enough to carry in your purse.  </li>
            <li>and i was starting to get a crease under my one eye along with the other fine lines that i have.</li>
            <li>It actually looks like it enhances my new wrinkles insted of diminishing them.</li>
            <li>It promises great results so the disappointment is even bigger.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really have lines under around my eyes unless my skin is very dry</li>
            <li>The fine lines and puffiness under my eyes has decreased.</li>
            <li>Fine, probably unnecessary product.</li>

            <li> admit I didn&#x27;t pay much attention to the day or night aspect usually, and wore the night cream in the day and vice versa.  </li>
            <li> This answered my prayers though, and I feel a lot less self conscious.</li>
            <li> i guess that may also depend on how long you use this product.</li>
            <li> The downside is the expense for such a small amount: .2 fluid ounces for AM and .2 fluid ounces for PM.</li>
            <li> I have wrinkles that aren&#x27;t deep set but are noticeable, and after 4 weeks of use they are less noticeable</li>
            <li> I can certainly not tell anything that would make me recommend others to run out and purchase it.</li>

            <li> I think this product is simply not right for me.</li>
            <li> On top of that, after a while, it is hard to squeeze the content out of the container, very uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed a slight difference.</li>
            <li> I suppose it&#x27;s convenient to have AP and PM eye creams connected, but they don&#x27;t screw well together, and you get less than a typical .5oz jar of eye</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed the dried up vampire look when I use it.  </li>
            <li> Not a bad eye cream, but again the AM fluid smelled really bad, and i could not use that, but the PM fluid was not as bad.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it until it runs out, but if there is a difference, it is very slight.  </li>
            <li> - like lately with the heater going.</li>
            <li> My eyes still do look tired,</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m only 23, but hated it so much I seriously considered Botox!  </li>
            <li> I am really disappointed with this product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this in the stores anymore.  I bought two!  I like it that the AM has an SPF of 15, and the PM side alpha hydroxy</li>
            <li> I liked it. I was provided this product by the company to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit I didn&#x27;t pay much attention to the day or night aspect usually, and wore the night cream in the day and vice versa.  (My sleeping schedule is weird.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really have lines under around my eyes unless my skin is very dry - like lately with the heater going. Then I get them where my eye sockets are at the bottom of my eyes, they look like real fine hairline cracks. lol (I need a humidifier !) It helps! I haven&#x27;t noticed the dried up vampire look when I use it.  This product is very good for that type of transient fine, fine line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t tell that my skin was any firmer or more youthful looking after using it for over a month, but I couldn&#x27;t see any new lines either, and, as I mentioned, I very much appreciated the moisturizer.  It didn&#x27;t burn my eyes like some other products I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is a bit high, but the company puts out very good promotions on the product if you watch their website.</li>
            <li> I have been trying this item because I am a bzz agent.  Although i do not have deep wrinkles, I do have fine lines. I have noticed some improvement in my lines and also my whole eye area.  I am pleased with the results I would recomment this product.  I also love the duo tube where your day cream is on one side and night cream on the other.  Handy to take along!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product both day and night for about a month and I have noticed a slight difference. The fine lines and puffiness under my eyes has decreased. It is very easy to apply. It is really convenient that it is all in one stick.</li>
            <li> I used the Revitalift Deep Set Wrinkle Repair, 24 hour Eye Repair Duo for 8 weeks now. I took close up pictures of my eyes and face before I started and then again yesterday. What a difference it has made. I like how easy it is to use and the double sided cap for AM and PM sides. I liked the consistency and it has a light scent. I liked how it kept the eye area hydrated as it is very dry where I live. It also has SPF 15. The downside is the expense for such a small amount: .2 fluid ounces for AM and .2 fluid ounces for PM.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two weeks morning and night.  I don&#x27;t know that I would purchase it again. I will continue to use it until it runs out, but if there is a difference, it is very slight.  I am 50 and have some deep-set wrinkles around my eyes.  I can certainly not tell anything that would make me recommend others to run out and purchase it.</li>
            <li> this actually works ok for what it is..When i decided that i needed something for my eyes, my eyes were puffy every morning and i was starting to get a crease under my one eye along with the other fine lines that i have. Since i have started using this i noticed that my eyes were no longer puffy when i woke up and the fine lines have softened quite a bit and that large crease that was forming i can no longer see. It will not really show the results super fast like everyone wants, but keep using it and you will see the difference. It won&#x27;t take the wrinkles away completly but it did soften them up quite a bit. i guess that may also depend on how long you use this product. I have used it for a month so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My eyes still do look tired, but not enough sleep and stress most likely takes part in the results i am getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a product i will buy again, mostly because of the retinol and because i have seen results with this product. Im the type of person that goes from product to product to see if something is better, but i may stick with this unless something that is proven to work better comes along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ok so i am updateing my review. i stopped using the loreal brand and started using the ROC..You can def tell the diff. there is def more retinol in the roc. My face actually feels it. as with the loreal i never had a problem with sensitivity. so i know that there is more retinol in the roc and will continue to use the roc. i bought the set, serum, nite, day, eye, and wrinkle filler. you have to start out using it every other day if you are sensitive to retinol. and the sensitive eye cream does not seem to be sensitive cuz it still makes my eye area burn for about 5 mins. Anyway even though it still burns and tingles i still continue to use it so my face will adapt.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 3 wks, I see no change in the wrinkles and fine lines.  I will finish using it just to get my moneys worth but will not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed with this product. It promises great results so the disappointment is even bigger. I am 37 so I was looking for something that would prevent development of new wrinkles and diminish the existing lines. However, I see no results at all. Moreover, I have an impression that it actually enhances my wrinkles, and I can see even more wrinkles than before. On top of that, after a while, it is hard to squeeze the content out of the container, very uncomfortable to use. I will never buy it again. Not recommended at all!</li>
            <li> Hi!    I&#x27;d like to identify myself as a Bzz agent who is fortunate enough to try out this product and then buzz about it.  It&#x27;s a very effective product.  I have sensitive skin around the eyes and there was no burning or irritation.  I have wrinkles that aren&#x27;t deep set but are noticeable, and after 4 weeks of use they are less noticeable and I&#x27;ve received feedback from friends and relatives who have noticed a difference.  It&#x27;s very convenient to use and compact enough to carry in your purse.  One end of the tube is for morning use and the other end for nightly use.  Try this product out for yourself and I think you&#x27;ll be pleased!!</li>
            <li> L&#x27;oreal sent a sample to me to try for 8 weeks.  I am 50 and really starting to get fine lines around my eyes.  While this is not a miracle cream, it does soften the appearance of fine lines. The best feature is the convenience of having both the day creme and the night creme in the same tube.  It made me much more likely to remember to use it consistently which I think is the key to reducing wrinkles.</li>
            <li> When I received this product, the expiration date was about 3-4 months prior to when I ordered.  It also burned my under eye area.  I don&#x27;t think this had anything to do with the expiration date.  I think this product is simply not right for me. Everyone needs to try a product for themselves so I cannot recommend or not recommend this product.  However, I don&#x27;t recommend the seller as they sell expired products.</li>
            <li> Its ok... not the best, not the worse. For the price I would give it a try. For something more powerful expect to pay 4x more.</li>
            <li> Not a bad eye cream, but again the AM fluid smelled really bad, and i could not use that, but the PM fluid was not as bad.</li>
            <li> I use this every day.  I have no problem with makeup smoothing over this and it is lightweight and not greasy.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any improvement to my eyes. If any thing... I see deeper wrinkles come out and I am only 35.  It actually looks like it enhances my new wrinkles insted of diminishing them. I do not recomends this at all!</li>
            <li> I like L&#x27;Oreal products, but one cream seems to be the same as another.  This was nothing special.</li>
            <li> Pretty good moisturizer for the eye area. I&#x27;m 65, so guess some of these wrinkles are just here to stay. But this works as well as the more expensive department store brands... and I&#x27;ve tried them all!</li>
            <li> After a couple of weeks, no noticeable difference. Fine, probably unnecessary product. Price is better here then on the loreal website and target.</li>
            <li> I suppose it&#x27;s convenient to have AP and PM eye creams connected, but they don&#x27;t screw well together, and you get less than a typical .5oz jar of eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of effects, I haven&#x27;t really notices any significant changes,.I use the Olay Pro X skincare line, which is way better.</li>
            <li> I had puffy lower eyelids and I&#x27;m only 23, but hated it so much I seriously considered Botox!  This answered my prayers though, and I feel a lot less self conscious.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good product, though sometimes it makes my eyes burn. It does what it says so.</li>
            <li> The item I received was expired. Neither one of the 2 I purchased was any good</li>
