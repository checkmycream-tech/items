            <li>Absolutely the best professional hair dryer ever.&lt;br /&gt;Except for the filter screen kept falling off</li>
            <li>This Chi blow dryer is very light weight and powerful.</li>
            <li>It dries hair smooth ,frizZ free and makes blow out easier.and</li>
            <li>pain free One problem</li>
            <li>I have had this product for almost a year, it works great, BUT the mesh on the back has fallen off.</li>
            <li>My hair drys easily and quickly.  </li>
            <li>it is really light weight but powerful and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful and euronymic!  </li>
            <li>I first used this dryer at my hairdresser&#x27;s and fell it love with its lightweight and ease of use.</li>
            <li>like the product it does what it says; great for super curly hair, but the cover on the fan broke day one of use, so I would say it is super fragile.....</li>
            <li>Smooth hair eliminates having to use hot tools.</li>
            <li>Great little dryer</li>
            <li>WELL WORTH IT.</li>
            <li>i had first saw this dryer at a beauty supply store close to where i live and fell in love</li>
            <li>the color is better in person, it is more of a black cherry mat finish.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I have had 3 of these, the first 2 worked for 1 day each,</li>
            <li>I am a busy stylist and fell in luv with.this dryer at first</li>
            <li>It sheared off the top of my finger and half of my nail.  </li>
            <li>you can use them for different hair types if you&#x27;re a stylist or use the appropriate one for yourself if its for personal use.</li>
            <li>am now looking to purchase another new Hand Shot form someone.</li>
            <li>I cant live without it</li>
            <li>everyone has complemented on my new dryer.</li>
            <li>Easy to handle, handle less blow dryer.</li>
            <li>the barrel does not get hot even on high heat when used for a long time.</li>
            <li>is my second Hand Shot and my fifth Chi dryer and all have served me very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so much easier on the wrist than a regular blow dryer!!</li>
            <li>The company doesnt warranty any product purchased online, or any product over 1 year old.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not usre if it&#x27;s faster than my old one, but it&#x27;s easier to handle.</li>
            <li>This is my second time writing this review, as the first one disappeared mysteriously.</li>

            <li> This is the best hair dryer I have ever bought.  I have long thick fine wavy hair and I sometimes have a problem taming my wavy hair.  I can finally style the hair on the back on head without feeling strain in my arms.  This product dries my hair quickly and I can give myself a professional looking blow dry style in half the time it would normally takes me with my old hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This Chi blow dryer is very light weight and powerful. I have no complaints at all to give on this one. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy because you wont regret it. The 3 attachments work Perfectly. you can use them for different hair types if you&#x27;re a stylist or use the appropriate one for yourself if its for personal use. Just an overall excellent Product.</li>
            <li> Love the blow dyer.  It&#x27;s powerful and euronymic!  My only complaint is that the comb attachment pops off.  I wish the maker had made the lip or groove that it fits into a bit deeper, so that it won&#x27;t detach so easily.</li>
            <li> I have liked this dryer until this morning.  I did not know that the vent cap covering the motor had fallen off and my finger got caught in the motor. It sheared off the top of my finger and half of my nail.  Beware!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing dryer. I was able to give myself a salon quality blow out. Easy to handle, handle less blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair that is quite difficult to straighten, this blow dryer makes it seem like a walk in the park. I have never been so happy to spend 170 on anything before in my life!</li>
            <li> Love it. Easier to handle and easier to style the back of my head. Very lightweight also and of course takes up less room.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> For the cost, I expected a longer life span.  It started to spark and blow less air after 3 months.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best professional hair dryer ever.&lt;br /&gt;Except for the filter screen kept falling off and I was always replacing it .Now it has finally gone to hair dryer heaven. Due to burn up&lt;br /&gt;This is my second Hand Shot and my fifth Chi dryer and all have served me very well.&lt;br /&gt;I am now looking to purchase another new Hand Shot form someone.</li>
            <li> I first used this dryer at my hairdresser&#x27;s and fell it love with its lightweight and ease of use. The missing handle makes it less fatiguing on your wrist and easier to style the back of your head. I have less frizzies and quicker drying speed in stlying my hair than any other dryer that I have ever owned.  I have recommeded it to all my friends. One last comment LUV IT!!!!!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this and I loved it.  I love this blow dryer - it is awesome!  I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> like the product it does what it says; great for super curly hair, but the cover on the fan broke day one of use, so I would say it is super fragile.....</li>
            <li> Bought this for myself! I love it!! so much easier on the wrist than a regular blow dryer!! RECOMMEND!! GREAT product!! WELL WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> I am a busy stylist and fell in luv with.this dryer at first it was awkward now I cant live without it It dries hair smooth ,frizZ free and makes blow out easier.and pain free One problem this is my third dryer in year 1/2  The metal that covers the motor,keeps fallin out or off wish.they would find sumthin more durable love everything else about this unique awesome dryer</li>
            <li> This dryer was more expensive than any I&#x27;ve purchased before -- and given it&#x27;s for home/personal use, I considered it an investment.  My hair drys easily and quickly.  I like to keep my curls entact and this dryer helps with that immensely!  I&#x27;ve owned this dryer for about a year and love it!!!</li>
            <li> This is my second time writing this review, as the first one disappeared mysteriously. The company doesnt warranty any product purchased online, or any product over 1 year old. even if you purchase at a authorized store. I have had 3 of these, the first 2 worked for 1 day each, bad plug im guessing. The last one lasted just over 1 year until it began shooting flames out of the end. The company no longer has a repair facility so be cautious if you spend a ton of money on something you will be ultimately stuck with. Great little dryer if you have money to blow. Or if you are feeling really lucky, in hopes you won&#x27;t be a statistic with the mechanical failures.:(</li>
            <li> I have had this product for almost a year, it works great, BUT the mesh on the back has fallen off. I tried using it with the comb to straighten my hair (failure) to kept on falling off but since I have super curly hair I may not be the best measure. The defuser works great and it&#x27;s very light weight.</li>
            <li> best professional dryer I&#x27;ve ever had. Smooth hair eliminates having to use hot tools. Will never by anything but this dryer</li>
            <li> im a stylist and this dryer is amazing! im completely in love with it! im a bit wanky and have never held my blow dryers by the handle i always hold them by the barrel. i had first saw this dryer at a beauty supply store close to where i live and fell in love but then when i went back to get it they were not selling them any longer so i went to amazon in hopes of finding it. not only did i find it but it was less expensive than what they were selling for at the store. it is really light weight but powerful and easy to use. the barrel does not get hot even on high heat when used for a long time. everyone has complemented on my new dryer. couldnt have got myslef a better dryer, fits me perfect. the color is better in person, it is more of a black cherry mat finish. love!</li>
            <li> I adore this hairdyer. I&#x27;m not usre if it&#x27;s faster than my old one, but it&#x27;s easier to handle. It took me a couple of days to get use to the feel and handle of the dyer, but after that I fell in love with it!</li>
