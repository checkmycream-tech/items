            <li>When I first heard the meditation mp3, I laughed.</li>
            <li>If these masks had stayed on, they would not block out the light in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;After using the Crystal Rejuvenation mask, I am able to fall asleep faster and feel much more rested upon waking up.</li>

            <li>The ear plugs are comfortable too.</li>
            <li>This sleep mask is comfortable with adjustable straps and it comes with ear plugs.</li>
            <li>This sleep mask works well to block out the light, and it&#x27;s comfortable on my face.</li>
            <li>Can be used in traveling with our without the ear phone option, blocks all the light like for my bedroom</li>
            <li>There was a slip of paper inside box w/ mask, with a web address to become a free member.</li>
            <li>As it is, there is always light that comes in between the nose and cheek.</li>
            <li>The elastic has the ability to accommodate any head size; I have a tiny head so that was great</li>

            <li>The bright of the sun goes inside of our room since we only have blinds.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>If I had paid the full price, I would be upset.</li>
            <li>not waste your money or time, there are better and cheaper in amazon.</li>
            <li>got this with big discount in exchange of my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,</li>
            <li>For the price I pay and and sleep I get is well worth having it.  </li>
            <li>The sunlight was completely blocked but I was still able to get up on time.</li>
            <li>Its just right  for meBut</li>
            <li>I woke up later to realize I fell asleep and had the most peaceful sleep I ever had.  </li>
            <li>but this mask has been a life changer(sorry for the cliche) at first</li>
            <li>i wake up fresher and more energetic and i dont remember the last time i woke up in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li>I have even stopped needing as much caffeine in the morning as a result!  </li>
            <li>I thought it was a fluke at first, but now it has been a week</li>
            <li>It shipped fast and I used it the first night after receiving it.</li>
            <li>I have street light outside my window and it blocks out the light completely.</li>
            <li>Summer here in south Louisiana is really one of my problem.</li>
            <li>There really is something about the inserts that trigger lucid thoughts.</li>
            <li>ive tried a couple of sleeping masks before and honestly the were all the same, they helped but only so much.</li>
            <li>The advertising is very misleading for this product.  </li>
            <li>I would not have paid this much for a sleep mask if I had known that the relaxing music was a bit of a hoax.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re not getting much.</li>
            <li>Everything else is comfortable, but I am glad I only spent a dollar.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it is soft enough and works ok.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, it works ok.</li>
            <li>I use this mainly for travel.</li>
            <li>I do think the $29.99 price is a bit too high for what you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money!!</li>
            <li>Love them however feel as though they are a little pricey for what you get.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally sleep with a sleeping mask every night, but ever since I got this one-</li>
            <li>I really think it needs to be washed before wearing (hand wash), because it smells a little strong of a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>That said, the mask is interesting and comfortable enough in spite of it having very small magnets in it that stick out in bumps.</li>
            <li>and the magnets seemed to really work because I felt very awake and relaxed the next day.</li>
            <li>The inside lining of the mask is soft and luxurious.</li>
            <li>I especially like this mask because it conforms gently to my face.</li>
            <li>So far, my daughter has used this</li>
            <li>I was really surprised at that.</li>
            <li>The mask did come off while I was sleeping, but I am a wild sleeper, my fitted sheet comes off too.</li>
            <li>I was referred to this mask several months ago and it has completely changed</li>

            <li> I was rather disappointed in this mask. It&#x27;s very poorly made, as others said. Wish I had seen the reviews prior to purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;I think the title was rather deceptively written - I saw the &amp;#34;MP3&amp;#34; written in it and expected to see some sort of neat feature - nothing.</li>
            <li> I have not downloaded the mp3 audio, yet, but the mask is AMAZING!  I have trouble relaxing because I&#x27;m constantly doing something.  I put the mask on and within seconds I was so relaxed I thought I was floating.  I woke up later to realize I fell asleep and had the most peaceful sleep I ever had.  I don&#x27;t normally sleep with a sleeping mask every night, but ever since I got this one- I cannot see myself sleeping without it.</li>
            <li> This is very cheaply made.  I have no idea why they are even mentioning anything about the mp3 audio stuff.  I found it to be quite useless my self.  If I had not got this with a coupon to make it extremely cheap I would have asked for my money back immediately.  Do not waste your money!!</li>
            <li> Not worth it, cheaply made, no space for the nose.&lt;br /&gt;Way too expensive for what you are getting.&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste your money or time, there are better and cheaper in amazon. I do not understand why Bonus meditation mp3 is mentioned in the title, the box did not included anything related to mp3, it is a Fraudd.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely not buying from this seller again</li>
            <li> Summer here in south Louisiana is really one of my problem. The bright of the sun goes inside of our room since we only have blinds.&lt;br /&gt;When i have this sleep mask, it helped me a lot of my sleeping problem . It has 16 magnets that promotes circulations and puffy eyes. Its just right  for meBut prolonged used makes me uncomfortable since I&#x27;m not used to sleep mask. the Mp3 audio is not working. I did try my best to look how to do the player but it didn&#x27;t  work.&lt;br /&gt;I got this with big discount in exchange of my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,</li>
            <li> Mask is great! There really is something about the inserts that trigger lucid thoughts. Great to unwind your mind after a full stress-filled day .</li>
            <li> This is a nice sleep mask by Crystal Rejuvenation. It shipped fast and I used it the first night after receiving it. This mask is well constructed and put together nicely. The inside lining of the mask is soft and luxurious. The mask has adjustable straps to ensure a good, snug and comfortable fit. I especially like this mask because it conforms gently to my face. It blocks out all light, which is a necessity for me when I sleep. The ear plugs are comfortable too.This is a great mask and really does help to relax. Great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> This sleep mask is comfortable with adjustable straps and it comes with ear plugs. A few days after I received my sleep mask the company sends you a code to download the meditation music.  So far, my daughter has used this and she seems to fall asleep faster instead of twisting and turning and waiting a long time to fall asleep. Not a fan of the music but the sleep mask works great.</li>
            <li> ive tried a couple of sleeping masks before and honestly the were all the same, they helped but only so much. i reluctantly tried this one at the advice of a friend. i thot well if this one doesnt work either, atleast theres the money back guarantee. but this mask has been a life changer(sorry for the cliche) at first i thot maybe i was too tired thats y i slept well. but the difference in quality and quantity of sleep with and without this mask is amazing. i wake up fresher and more energetic and i dont remember the last time i woke up in the middle of the night. best money i ever spent !!</li>
            <li> Love them however feel as though they are a little pricey for what you get.</li>
            <li> I tried to get my Mp3 audio using the website listed on the slip of paper included with the mask and earplugs, but it seems the website is not there. That said, the mask is interesting and comfortable enough in spite of it having very small magnets in it that stick out in bumps. I was really surprised at that. The earplugs are nice foam and fit alright. While I don&#x27;t overly love the mask, I feel it fits right and blocks light, which is what I need it to do. I really think it needs to be washed before wearing (hand wash), because it smells a little strong of a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion.*</li>
            <li> MP3 audio....hmmm, I&#x27;m not seeing that feature! False advertising I would have to say. I will be returning this item.</li>
            <li> I use this mainly for travel. When i travel on the flight, i use this and makes the flight travel easier. I put this on and it just helps me relax. The music is soothing to hear when you are in a crowded place and traveling long distaces and .very helpful for red eye flights  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review</li>
            <li> This sleep mask works well to block out the light, and it&#x27;s comfortable on my face. The mask did come off while I was sleeping, but I am a wild sleeper, my fitted sheet comes off too. I don&#x27;t know what kind of ninja fight sequences I&#x27;m doing in my sleep, but I hope I&#x27;m winning. When I first heard the meditation mp3, I laughed. It&#x27;s not anything I was expecting, but I gave it a shot and I really liked it. I was asleep before the 20 minute mp3 finished. I do think the $29.99 price is a bit too high for what you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item received in exchange for review.

            <li> This mask was too tight on my head and gave me a headach</li>
            <li> The advertising is very misleading for this product.  The Mp3 Audio has to be downloaded on your phone or other device and then listened to through headphones.  I tried to go to the place to download it and the site had expired or could not be displayed.  Otherwise, it is soft enough and works ok.  Comes with ear plugs if you need them.  I would not have paid this much for a sleep mask if I had known that the relaxing music was a bit of a hoax.</li>
            <li> I was referred to this mask several months ago and it has completely changed how I sleep!&lt;br /&gt;I have tried several other types of sleeping masks before; I would always wake up in the middle of the night to find the mask had fallen off/come undone. If these masks had stayed on, they would not block out the light in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;After using the Crystal Rejuvenation mask, I am able to fall asleep faster and feel much more rested upon waking up. I have even stopped needing as much caffeine in the morning as a result!  The mask stays on all night and it helps totally relax the muscles in my face.  I am now one happy sleeper!</li>
            <li> Like they&#x27;re saying, great sleep on if you&#x27;re not getting much. I&#x27;ve slept better on days I sleep well and best on days I don&#x27;t get much sleep. For the price I pay and and sleep I get is well worth having it.  Meditation cd is good too. Can be used in traveling with our without the ear phone option, blocks all the light like for my bedroom I wake up at 4 in the morning because of the sunlight coming through my windows. Since I started using this mask I&#x27;ve never looked at the clock brie the alarm rings. It helps to relax your mind too. I&#x27;ve never noticed I was getting minor headaches, realized when they were gone after using this product.  I&#x27;m buying another one for my wife, she loved mine.</li>
            <li> This sleep mask provides the blackout that I need to go to sleep. I have street light outside my window and it blocks out the light completely. And it&#x27;s super comfortable - the best sleep mask I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> Where&#x27;s the Mp3 audio? There was a slip of paper inside box w/ mask, with a web address to become a free member. There is no such address. Also, the one on the SIDE OF BOX the mask came in also has a bad address. I only bought this one because of the magnets, and the Mp3 option included. Idk what to do now.</li>
            <li> I got this mask for a dollar in order to write feedback on it. The mask came in a box with a pair of ear plugs. I haven&#x27;t used the ear plugs, but that is not what this feedback is about. The mask is OK. It would be better if it had a space for your nose. As it is, there is always light that comes in between the nose and cheek. The only way to totally black it out is if you adjust it to be tight. Not just tight, but extra tight. You have to literally strangle your head to get total darkness. I feel like this could be resolved with the shape of the mask. Other than that, it works ok. Everything else is comfortable, but I am glad I only spent a dollar. If I had paid the full price, I would be upset.</li>
            <li> I was having an extremely difficult time sleeping all weekend! I decided to buy this because of a friend&#x27;s recommendation and all I can say is I was thankful to finally be able to get some good sleep! The sunlight was completely blocked but I was still able to get up on time. The elastic has the ability to accommodate any head size; I have a tiny head so that was great and the magnets seemed to really work because I felt very awake and relaxed the next day. I thought it was a fluke at first, but now it has been a week and I am still sleeping better every night!</li>
