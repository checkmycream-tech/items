            <li>We need gluten and allergen free toothpaste and this one works great.</li>
            <li>Packed nicely.  </li>
            <li>Really liked it.</li>
            <li>My wife loves this toothpaste and it&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s sold in a value pack.</li>
            <li>nice taste.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a nice flavor, a bit of baking soda bitterness with mint oil.</li>
            <li>but I can honestly say my teeth have never felt cleaner.</li>
            <li>It takes nice and seems to help with my recurring oral yeast infections.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this kind for over a year now.  </li>
            <li>Nice product I&#x27;ve used for years.</li>
            <li>I had tried the wintergreen (which is the kind pictured) and it is my #1 favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Best natural toothpaste ever!!!</li>
            <li>Really, the Desert Essence line of toothpastes are the best I&#x27;ve ever tried - nice taste, effective clean, great after-brush feeling.</li>
            <li>I love it because it still gives you a very bright, minty, just clean refreshed feeling.</li>
            <li>Now that the price is up to 3/$15, whole foods has a better deal!!!</li>
            <li>shipped quick, great item.  </li>
            <li>It tastes great and is a great healthier option then the major brands out there.  </li>
            <li>If you are going fluoride free this is a good choice</li>
            <li>This is the best natural toothpaste I have ever used.</li>
            <li>it has a fresh, minty taste, and does a great job.</li>
            <li>Nice mint flavor, and gets teeth very clean.  </li>
            <li>This is a good clean mouth experience.</li>
            <li>Good pack, good price, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>i love using this toothpaste for my tongue and mouth.</li>
            <li>I love the taste, the way my breath stays neutral longer, and how well it works despite not having SAS as an ingredient.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>But it is an OK substitute...</li>
            <li>Did some more research on curing the bacteria and came across tea tree oil toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I am forever going to use this toothpaste :)</li>
            <li>Love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>The baking soda makes a lot more suds and leaves a fresher taste.</li>
            <li>and I feel much more energized.</li>
            <li>: Great job of cleaning, freshens my breath very well, non-chemical formula&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>will order more for sure...</li>
            <li>I have used this brand for several years now and I am very happy with this product and you can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s price!</li>
            <li>I will never buy the store brands any more.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s herbal--</li>
            <li>We have reordered many times.</li>
            <li>An absolute great product .no more bleeding gums.</li>
            <li>; after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ran out of Crest and came to Amazon to buy some more.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Fluoride is not needed for a healthy mouth</li>
            <li>Love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Glad for this product.</li>
            <li>try be for buying more</li>
            <li>Tastes ok and does the job.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love DE products and trust them with my health.</li>
            <li>and I love them all.</li>
            <li>My family has been using this toothpaste for about 2 years and we all love it.</li>
            <li>So we bought this 3 pack &amp; we love it.</li>
            <li>I love the mint feeling it leaves after your finished your teeth and mouth</li>
            <li>This has been our favorite for years.</li>
            <li>I love not putting all those chemicals in my mouth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always 2/$10 at the Tribeca NY location :)</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terrible either</li>
            <li>ive tried many others like this</li>
            <li>So love it even more.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>it was substantially better than the rest.</li>
            <li>If they could only get rid of the carrageenan in it, it would be perfect!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m took off a star because it doesn&#x27;t taste as good as the wintergreen nor does it leave my mouth feeling as fresh as the wintergreen, which I would give 5 stars to.</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>&amp; I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li>My favorite toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Taste is good too, if it was a little more minty it would make it even better!!!</li>
            <li>I love the refreshing taste, it&#x27;s not too overwhelming, and it leaves my teeth feeling more clean than any leading brand I have ever tried!</li>
            <li>This is a gentle yet very effective toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Nice, fresh aftertaste and without harmful chemicals!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, clean &amp; non-chemically &amp; non-sugary tasting!</li>
            <li>Mouth feels very clean since i&#x27;ve started using this product.</li>
            <li>This tastes nice (minty) and no strange flavors and works great.</li>
            <li>Actually pretty good for hippie toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Love the tube it comes in, it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>Great natural toothpaste!</li>
            <li>my teeth and mouth feel clean!</li>
            <li>Great transaction, super fast, super safe!</li>
            <li>Love this fluoride free paste.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is chemical free.</li>
            <li>This one cleans well and works great with my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>Great and natural product</li>
            <li>my gum were hurting/bleeding and I tried all kind of pastes and mouth wash without success.</li>
            <li>Good abrasives for gently polishing teeth.</li>
            <li>Nice aftertaste and fresh breath.</li>
            <li>Tastes nice and leaves my teeth clean and breath fresh!</li>
            <li>is a very good, more than what is expected..</li>
            <li>This is the best toothpaste I have ever used and it only has stuff you need, minty fresh.</li>
            <li>It tastes fantastic, does a wonderful job, and has minimal ingredients.</li>
            <li>It has a fresh, natural taste and helped me get a great report at the dentist. :)</li>
            <li>The taste is pretty nice, too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the toothpaste works though, Desert Essence generally makes good products.</li>
            <li>Both have carageenan - which is fine by me in toothpaste.</li>
            <li>My husband thinks it needs a stronger mint flavor, but I think it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>I am pretty satisfied with it, if it had better taste it would get 5*</li>
            <li>Feels great to support a small, family-owned company that has a quality product for a fair price.</li>
            <li>i love the antibacterial nature of tea tree oil in keeping your mouth and breath fresh.</li>
            <li>(there&#x27;s a lesser favored wintergreen flavor, also.)</li>
            <li>After using this product for several months I have experienced a noticeable boost in clarity</li>
            <li>The toothpaste does a great job of cleaning with the proper toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Great tasting without the extra sugar!</li>
            <li>This product was recommended by my naturalistic physician for the gum sores I was getting in my mouth.</li>
            <li>And Colgate thought we wouldn&#x27;t notice a cheap ingredient like sodium saccharin?</li>
            <li>jason power smile was much better  .</li>
            <li>Snuck it by me because the description said SLS free but read the ingredients</li>
            <li>This toothpaste has a light, mint taste.</li>
            <li>Great taste and this toothpaste actually foams up!</li>
            <li>At first it was working pretty good</li>
            <li>far superior to anything you&#x27;ll find with a &amp;#34;brand&amp;#34; name.</li>
            <li>Makes my teeth feel clean and fresh and love the fact that there is tea tree oil in the mix.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so smooth and clean still after 2 meals, a cinnamon sugar donut, and a coffee.</li>
            <li>Price is excellent, I also like the new tubes, easier to extract the last drop.</li>
            <li>Not like the original one I had purchase.</li>
            <li>I got this in the mail today, and boy was I excited.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste helped turn it around, after you brush your mouth feels refreshed, like you know it&#x27;s clean.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel and look clean.  </li>
            <li>And it dose clean well.</li>
            <li>This one came closest to replicating the feel of Crest (which I used to use), and though it still doesn&#x27;t feel quite as squeaky clean as fluoridated toothpaste</li>
            <li>Clean minty taste that is not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t believe me, go read your toothpaste tube right now!</li>
            <li>So potent, you don&#x27;t need that much.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is the very best that I have ever used, It only takes just a pea-size on the toothbrush to completely clean and refresh your entire mouth, plus without the flouride....</li>
            <li>My mouth feels clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>This keeps my teeth clean and my breath fresh.</li>
            <li>Leaves mouth fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>It comes quickly when we order.</li>
            <li>Not just because it&#x27;s made with all natural ingredients, I love that it does a fantastic job of cleaning my teeth .  </li>
            <li>I almost never write reviews, but this toothpaste is worthy.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is OKAY, I believe the one with &amp;#34;neem&amp;#34; in it gets my teeth cleaner than this particular one.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; brand you get at the store are SUPER</li>
            <li>So far I am in love with it, and so greatful to finally have a good experience with toothpaste.</li>
            <li>It is a true and pure toxin free toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I decided to try a more natural toothpaste after recently trying to become more healthy.</li>
            <li>My favorite natural toothpaste!</li>
            <li>No strange aftertaste, good foaming, overall our family&#x27;s favorite.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for those of us who are a little more concerned about staying natural and not putting chemicals in our mouths.</li>
            <li>been using this for a while...an acquired taste , but well worth it to get used too..</li>
            <li>Maybe some people are more sensitive to fluoride than others, or maybe the conspiracy theories we&#x27;ve been hearing about are correct</li>
            <li>I love tea tree oil because it is a natural disinfectant and reduces tooth sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>This is the only toothpaste I use, it works great, has no harsh chemicals, sugars or flavoring.  </li>
            <li>from my own personal experience, I&#x27;ll recommended this to anyone who have gum issues.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a natural toothpaste you can&#x27;t do better than this.</li>
            <li>Keeps my mouth fresh and disinfected  with tea tree oil while not letting my teeth get stained with the help of baking soda on it.</li>
            <li>My wife and I both love how it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li>After trying to find a healthier toothpaste with no flouride this one is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>It leaves your mouth fresh</li>
            <li>tastes really fresh with no artificial toxic taste</li>
            <li>I have found the combination of these two products to be just as effective as when using the prior toothpaste.</li>
            <li>There were so many bubbles, and it left my mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li>Very minty and fresh tasting and gets my teeth really clean.</li>
            <li>My whole mouth feels clean after brushing with it and it being a vegan product</li>
            <li>Tried the wintergreen, and though good it is not worth replacing this one.</li>
            <li>I use this regularly and my overall dental health has improved greatly.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels just as clean &amp; the white paste on the tongue in the morning brushes off just as easily.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it costs more than the junk you buy off the shelves at your local discount store, but it&#x27;s well worth it.  </li>
            <li>We like Desert Essence toothpaste very much.</li>
            <li>but there is a special feeling of my mouth being clean in a pure and natural way.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>has this toothpaste been my whole life!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much cheaper than buying it 1 tube at a time!</li>
            <li>From the first time you brush your teeth with it, you notice a difference.</li>
            <li>after the first week of using this paste alone(no mouth wash solution) the bleeding and hurting are gone.</li>
            <li>I find the big brand name tartar-control toothpastes irritate my gums if I brush with them more than once a day.</li>
            <li>I received is exactly what is in the description, the Mint flavor.</li>
            <li>My teeth have become much more yellow while using this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>It is just fine Still need to use my Colgate to keep my teeth white and breath fresh.</li>
            <li>I have tried a variety of natural toothpastes and this so far is our favorite.  </li>
            <li>but good to alternate trough 3 different types of tooth paste and mouth wash... just to surprise the germs...</li>
            <li>This one is one of the best (my unhealthy husband prefers this one too) tasting natural toothpastes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used quite a few fluoride free toothpaste and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok a lot like baking soda (which I was not totally surprised)</li>
            <li>Love the fresh taste &amp; have recommended it to several friends looking for natural products.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use very much at all for it to be effective, so that helps offset the cost a little bit.</li>
            <li>Leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean; I have repurchased several times, and have no complaints.</li>
            <li>I looked into a few products with tea tree oil (soap, shampoo, cream for external wounds, and toothpaste), and this brand toothpaste was pretty much the only product that I liked (flavor and/or smell wise) and appeared to be pretty good (at least in terms of my dentist&#x27;s report on gum disease and enamel buildup.)  </li>
            <li>This does not taste like the popular brands; the taste is rather bland</li>
            <li>A nice change from the typical brands of toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Taste fine and texture is fine, a little bit crummy.</li>
            <li>We have finally found our favorite natural toothpaste and refuse to use anything else!</li>
            <li>The toothpaste is very high quality</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I still really like the natures gate stuff too.</li>
            <li>Our whole family switched to this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice the tea tree that much at all.</li>
            <li>The primary uses of tea tree oil have historically capitalized on the antiseptic and anti-inflammatory actions, antimicrobial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this tooth paste!</li>
            <li>I really like this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I like how its organic, everything now and days has way to much added nonsense.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the taste of soda</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be purchasing more here in the near future.</li>
            <li>and alternative medicines such as tea tree (Melaleuca) oil have become increasingly popular in recent decades.</li>
            <li>My girl 10 years old has brases and has some occasional oral irritation, but tell you the truth Colgate does better keeping it under control.</li>
            <li>We tried Tom&#x27;s and a few others from the organic food store, but to be honest there was something off about every one of them.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I dip it in baking soda for deep clean.</li>
            <li>Clean feeling and local manufacturer!</li>
            <li>The wife has been on a fluoride-free kick lately, so naturally changing toothpaste was first on the list.</li>
            <li>Just be aware that you are ordering a 3 pack of the Mint flavor w/ tea tree oil--not the Wintergreen w/ neem and tea tree oil that is pictured (they&#x27;ve since fixed the picture).</li>
            <li>It tastes ok the mint is not very strong.</li>
            <li>I love how the consistency is the same for any big brand.</li>
            <li>Been using various flavors of this product for six months now, and I can definitely tell that my gums are healthier and my mouth feels better.</li>
            <li>Was interesting getting used to the fact that it had not sweet flavor just mint.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended (mouthwash as well).</li>
            <li>Other natural products I&#x27;ve tried sometimes fall a little flat - this stuff tastes great and gives a thorough cleaning!</li>
            <li>Colgate ruined that product with its new main ingredient; greed.</li>
            <li>My teeth are sensitive and this product really helps with sensitivity even though it isn&#x27;t advertised for that.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find that my teeth seemed much cleaner after I started using Desert Essence.</li>
            <li>I have had a low grade abscess for several years - the dentist has not been able to clear it up.</li>
            <li>(fluoride is an industrial waste product....), but I do love this toothpaste and recommend it to others trying to get away from chemicals in their lives.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite toothpaste since I tried it a few months ago</li>
            <li>I am a smoker and heavy coffee drinker and noticed that it removes much better the tobacco and coffee stains on my teeth.</li>
            <li>I am one the last tube right now, as soon as i am done with it  i will buy the one with neem.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel just as smooth as with any other paste; however, the biggest difference is the subdued minty affect of this paste (I am NOT referring to sweetness).</li>
            <li>We now live where we purchase on line in stead of from a store.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now buying the 3 pack since I have now found my new toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other natural brands, but they just didn&#x27;t make my teeth feel clean or freshen my breath very well.  </li>
            <li>I used to use crest whitestrips a couple years ago, but stopped since it was making my teeth very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>It just has a clean minty taste without the sweetness of typical toothpastes.</li>
            <li>The dentist was surprised with the improvement.</li>
            <li>it really surprised me.</li>
            <li>Now that I switched over to a natural toothpaste, I don&#x27;t get that reaction anymore.</li>
            <li>Also meets all my criteria for a product like this: No fluoride, anti-bacterial action, and not produced in China.</li>
            <li>I am over 50, developed some gum issues.</li>
            <li>So far Desert Essence has done me well.</li>
            <li>All natural.</li>
            <li>so far, this exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>I looked for an all natural toothpaste with no chemicals and found this one.</li>
            <li>So much nicer than the regular brands.  </li>
            <li>I like it because it&#x27;s natural and doesn&#x27;t contain floride</li>
            <li>, my daughter likes it because It doesn&#x27;t burn her mouth like the old brands.</li>
            <li>Very picky about toothpaste, and this is my second order of 3.  </li>
            <li>But when I got home I looked in the mirror and realized it must be this toothpaste naturally whitening my teeth.  </li>
            <li>All natural, no harsh chemicals that eat through your enamel and make your gums recede.  </li>
            <li>I like it...not sweet, a little zippy...</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>I am a huge proponent of scrubbing the entire tongue extremely well to get all the white paste off.</li>
            <li>The less intense taste compared to regular toothpaste takes about a week to get used to, but now that I have, whenever I use regular toothpaste I cringe at the powerful mint and chemical taste.</li>
            <li>Much prefer this to other natural brands!</li>
            <li>I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of random chemicals, and that it still has enough flavor for good breath.</li>
            <li>I worry about the effects of ingesting any amount of triclosan (which almost all major brand toothpastes contain)</li>
            <li>:) No fluoride or other industrial waste chemicals in it.</li>
            <li>I found that even though it is not real minty, it still cleans my teeth &amp; tongue as well as the previous toothpaste I was using that did have a strong mintiness.</li>
            <li>Also, the flavor and foam is exactly like a conventional toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I have tried several natural toothpastes.</li>
            <li>I am working on putting only natural things in my system.  </li>
            <li>My 10 year old son had yellow teeth.</li>
            <li>There is no reason for him this young to have yellow teeth.</li>
            <li>No regrets</li>
            <li>After researching about 8 different natural toothpastes, I just purchased &amp; tried this product today.</li>
            <li>Especially if one has sensitive skin as I do.  </li>
            <li>I began using this toothpaste about six months ago and my recent Dental checkup and cleaning showed a marked reduction in plaque buildup.  </li>
            <li>It definitely gives your mouth that just-out-of-the-dentist clean feeling and the paste has just the right amount of mint (it&#x27;s not overwhelmingly minty or bitter like other natural toothpastes).</li>
            <li>Yes it&#x27;s costlier than other grocery store brands, but in this case you really get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li>I really like toothpastes that contain baking soda due to</li>
            <li>But to me out worth sacrificing a little treat for overall health.</li>
            <li>Leaves teeth feeling clean and the ingredient list is preferable to those toothpastes commonly found at the grocery stores.</li>
            <li>and they had switched to various types of different, natural toothpastes.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste since trying to go as natural as possible with all of our household products last january.  </li>

            <li> My wife loves this toothpaste and it&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s sold in a value pack.</li>
            <li> nice taste.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a nice flavor, a bit of baking soda bitterness with mint oil.</li>
            <li> but I can honestly say my teeth have never felt cleaner.</li>
            <li> It takes nice and seems to help with my recurring oral yeast infections.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this kind for over a year now.  </li>
            <li> Nice product I&#x27;ve used for years.</li>
            <li> I had tried the wintergreen (which is the kind pictured) and it is my #1 favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Best natural toothpaste ever!!!</li>
            <li> Really, the Desert Essence line of toothpastes are the best I&#x27;ve ever tried - nice taste, effective clean, great after-brush feeling.</li>
            <li> I love it because it still gives you a very bright, minty, just clean refreshed feeling.</li>
            <li> Now that the price is up to 3/$15, whole foods has a better deal!!!</li>
            <li> shipped quick, great item.  </li>
            <li> It tastes great and is a great healthier option then the major brands out there.  </li>
            <li> If you are going fluoride free this is a good choice</li>
            <li> This is the best natural toothpaste I have ever used.</li>
            <li> it has a fresh, minty taste, and does a great job.</li>
            <li> Nice mint flavor, and gets teeth very clean.  </li>
            <li> This is a good clean mouth experience.</li>
            <li> Good pack, good price, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> i love using this toothpaste for my tongue and mouth.</li>
            <li> I love the taste, the way my breath stays neutral longer, and how well it works despite not having SAS as an ingredient.  </li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> But it is an OK substitute...</li>
            <li> Did some more research on curing the bacteria and came across tea tree oil toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I am forever going to use this toothpaste :)</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> The baking soda makes a lot more suds and leaves a fresher taste.</li>
            <li> and I feel much more energized.</li>
            <li> : Great job of cleaning, freshens my breath very well, non-chemical formula&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> will order more for sure...</li>
            <li> I have used this brand for several years now and I am very happy with this product and you can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s price!</li>
            <li> I will never buy the store brands any more.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s herbal--</li>
            <li> We have reordered many times.</li>
            <li> An absolute great product .no more bleeding gums.</li>
            <li> ; after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ran out of Crest and came to Amazon to buy some more.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Fluoride is not needed for a healthy mouth</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Glad for this product.</li>
            <li> try be for buying more</li>
            <li> Tastes ok and does the job.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I love DE products and trust them with my health.</li>
            <li> and I love them all.</li>
            <li> My family has been using this toothpaste for about 2 years and we all love it.</li>
            <li> So we bought this 3 pack &amp; we love it.</li>
            <li> I love the mint feeling it leaves after your finished your teeth and mouth</li>
            <li> This has been our favorite for years.</li>
            <li> I love not putting all those chemicals in my mouth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always 2/$10 at the Tribeca NY location :)</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not terrible either</li>
            <li> ive tried many others like this</li>
            <li> So love it even more.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> it was substantially better than the rest.</li>
            <li> If they could only get rid of the carrageenan in it, it would be perfect!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m took off a star because it doesn&#x27;t taste as good as the wintergreen nor does it leave my mouth feeling as fresh as the wintergreen, which I would give 5 stars to.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> &amp; I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> My favorite toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Taste is good too, if it was a little more minty it would make it even better!!!</li>
            <li> I love the refreshing taste, it&#x27;s not too overwhelming, and it leaves my teeth feeling more clean than any leading brand I have ever tried!</li>
            <li> This is a gentle yet very effective toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Nice, fresh aftertaste and without harmful chemicals!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, clean &amp; non-chemically &amp; non-sugary tasting!</li>
            <li> Mouth feels very clean since i&#x27;ve started using this product.</li>
            <li> This tastes nice (minty) and no strange flavors and works great.</li>
            <li> Actually pretty good for hippie toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Love the tube it comes in, it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great natural toothpaste!</li>
            <li> my teeth and mouth feel clean!</li>
            <li> Great transaction, super fast, super safe!</li>
            <li> Love this fluoride free paste.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is chemical free.</li>
            <li> This one cleans well and works great with my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Great and natural product</li>
            <li> my gum were hurting/bleeding and I tried all kind of pastes and mouth wash without success.</li>
            <li> Good abrasives for gently polishing teeth.</li>
            <li> Nice aftertaste and fresh breath.</li>
            <li> Tastes nice and leaves my teeth clean and breath fresh!</li>
            <li> is a very good, more than what is expected..</li>
            <li> This is the best toothpaste I have ever used and it only has stuff you need, minty fresh.</li>
            <li> It tastes fantastic, does a wonderful job, and has minimal ingredients.</li>
            <li> It has a fresh, natural taste and helped me get a great report at the dentist. :)</li>
            <li> The taste is pretty nice, too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the toothpaste works though, Desert Essence generally makes good products.</li>
            <li> Both have carageenan - which is fine by me in toothpaste.</li>
            <li> My husband thinks it needs a stronger mint flavor, but I think it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I am pretty satisfied with it, if it had better taste it would get 5*</li>
            <li> Feels great to support a small, family-owned company that has a quality product for a fair price.</li>
            <li> i love the antibacterial nature of tea tree oil in keeping your mouth and breath fresh.</li>
            <li> (there&#x27;s a lesser favored wintergreen flavor, also.)</li>
            <li> After using this product for several months I have experienced a noticeable boost in clarity</li>
            <li> The toothpaste does a great job of cleaning with the proper toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Great tasting without the extra sugar!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my naturalistic physician for the gum sores I was getting in my mouth.</li>
            <li> And Colgate thought we wouldn&#x27;t notice a cheap ingredient like sodium saccharin?</li>
            <li> jason power smile was much better  .</li>
            <li> Snuck it by me because the description said SLS free but read the ingredients</li>
            <li> This toothpaste has a light, mint taste.</li>
            <li> Great taste and this toothpaste actually foams up!</li>
            <li> At first it was working pretty good</li>
            <li> far superior to anything you&#x27;ll find with a &amp;#34;brand&amp;#34; name.</li>
            <li> Makes my teeth feel clean and fresh and love the fact that there is tea tree oil in the mix.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so smooth and clean still after 2 meals, a cinnamon sugar donut, and a coffee.</li>
            <li> Price is excellent, I also like the new tubes, easier to extract the last drop.</li>
            <li> Not like the original one I had purchase.</li>
            <li> I got this in the mail today, and boy was I excited.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste helped turn it around, after you brush your mouth feels refreshed, like you know it&#x27;s clean.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel and look clean.  </li>
            <li> And it dose clean well.</li>
            <li> This one came closest to replicating the feel of Crest (which I used to use), and though it still doesn&#x27;t feel quite as squeaky clean as fluoridated toothpaste</li>
            <li> Clean minty taste that is not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe me, go read your toothpaste tube right now!</li>
            <li> So potent, you don&#x27;t need that much.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is the very best that I have ever used, It only takes just a pea-size on the toothbrush to completely clean and refresh your entire mouth, plus without the flouride....</li>
            <li> My mouth feels clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> This keeps my teeth clean and my breath fresh.</li>
            <li> Leaves mouth fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> It comes quickly when we order.</li>
            <li> Not just because it&#x27;s made with all natural ingredients, I love that it does a fantastic job of cleaning my teeth .  </li>
            <li> I almost never write reviews, but this toothpaste is worthy.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is OKAY, I believe the one with &amp;#34;neem&amp;#34; in it gets my teeth cleaner than this particular one.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; brand you get at the store are SUPER</li>
            <li> So far I am in love with it, and so greatful to finally have a good experience with toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It is a true and pure toxin free toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I decided to try a more natural toothpaste after recently trying to become more healthy.</li>
            <li> My favorite natural toothpaste!</li>
            <li> No strange aftertaste, good foaming, overall our family&#x27;s favorite.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for those of us who are a little more concerned about staying natural and not putting chemicals in our mouths.</li>
            <li> been using this for a while...an acquired taste , but well worth it to get used too..</li>
            <li> Maybe some people are more sensitive to fluoride than others, or maybe the conspiracy theories we&#x27;ve been hearing about are correct</li>
            <li> I love tea tree oil because it is a natural disinfectant and reduces tooth sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> This is the only toothpaste I use, it works great, has no harsh chemicals, sugars or flavoring.  </li>
            <li> from my own personal experience, I&#x27;ll recommended this to anyone who have gum issues.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a natural toothpaste you can&#x27;t do better than this.</li>
            <li> Keeps my mouth fresh and disinfected  with tea tree oil while not letting my teeth get stained with the help of baking soda on it.</li>
            <li> My wife and I both love how it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li> After trying to find a healthier toothpaste with no flouride this one is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> It leaves your mouth fresh</li>
            <li> tastes really fresh with no artificial toxic taste</li>
            <li> I have found the combination of these two products to be just as effective as when using the prior toothpaste.</li>
            <li> There were so many bubbles, and it left my mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Very minty and fresh tasting and gets my teeth really clean.</li>
            <li> My whole mouth feels clean after brushing with it and it being a vegan product</li>
            <li> Tried the wintergreen, and though good it is not worth replacing this one.</li>
            <li> I use this regularly and my overall dental health has improved greatly.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels just as clean &amp; the white paste on the tongue in the morning brushes off just as easily.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it costs more than the junk you buy off the shelves at your local discount store, but it&#x27;s well worth it.  </li>
            <li> We like Desert Essence toothpaste very much.</li>
            <li> but there is a special feeling of my mouth being clean in a pure and natural way.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> has this toothpaste been my whole life!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much cheaper than buying it 1 tube at a time!</li>
            <li> From the first time you brush your teeth with it, you notice a difference.</li>
            <li> after the first week of using this paste alone(no mouth wash solution) the bleeding and hurting are gone.</li>
            <li> I find the big brand name tartar-control toothpastes irritate my gums if I brush with them more than once a day.</li>
            <li> I received is exactly what is in the description, the Mint flavor.</li>
            <li> My teeth have become much more yellow while using this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It is just fine Still need to use my Colgate to keep my teeth white and breath fresh.</li>
            <li> I have tried a variety of natural toothpastes and this so far is our favorite.  </li>
            <li> but good to alternate trough 3 different types of tooth paste and mouth wash... just to surprise the germs...</li>
            <li> This one is one of the best (my unhealthy husband prefers this one too) tasting natural toothpastes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used quite a few fluoride free toothpaste and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok a lot like baking soda (which I was not totally surprised)</li>
            <li> Love the fresh taste &amp; have recommended it to several friends looking for natural products.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use very much at all for it to be effective, so that helps offset the cost a little bit.</li>
            <li> Leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean; I have repurchased several times, and have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I looked into a few products with tea tree oil (soap, shampoo, cream for external wounds, and toothpaste), and this brand toothpaste was pretty much the only product that I liked (flavor and/or smell wise) and appeared to be pretty good (at least in terms of my dentist&#x27;s report on gum disease and enamel buildup.)  </li>
            <li> This does not taste like the popular brands; the taste is rather bland</li>
            <li> A nice change from the typical brands of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Taste fine and texture is fine, a little bit crummy.</li>
            <li> We have finally found our favorite natural toothpaste and refuse to use anything else!</li>
            <li> The toothpaste is very high quality</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I still really like the natures gate stuff too.</li>
            <li> Our whole family switched to this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice the tea tree that much at all.</li>
            <li> The primary uses of tea tree oil have historically capitalized on the antiseptic and anti-inflammatory actions, antimicrobial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this tooth paste!</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I like how its organic, everything now and days has way to much added nonsense.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the taste of soda</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be purchasing more here in the near future.</li>
            <li> and alternative medicines such as tea tree (Melaleuca) oil have become increasingly popular in recent decades.</li>
            <li> My girl 10 years old has brases and has some occasional oral irritation, but tell you the truth Colgate does better keeping it under control.</li>
            <li> We tried Tom&#x27;s and a few others from the organic food store, but to be honest there was something off about every one of them.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I dip it in baking soda for deep clean.</li>
            <li> Clean feeling and local manufacturer!</li>
            <li> The wife has been on a fluoride-free kick lately, so naturally changing toothpaste was first on the list.</li>
            <li> Just be aware that you are ordering a 3 pack of the Mint flavor w/ tea tree oil--not the Wintergreen w/ neem and tea tree oil that is pictured (they&#x27;ve since fixed the picture).</li>
            <li> It tastes ok the mint is not very strong.</li>
            <li> I love how the consistency is the same for any big brand.</li>
            <li> Been using various flavors of this product for six months now, and I can definitely tell that my gums are healthier and my mouth feels better.</li>
            <li> Was interesting getting used to the fact that it had not sweet flavor just mint.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended (mouthwash as well).</li>
            <li> Other natural products I&#x27;ve tried sometimes fall a little flat - this stuff tastes great and gives a thorough cleaning!</li>
            <li> Colgate ruined that product with its new main ingredient; greed.</li>
            <li> My teeth are sensitive and this product really helps with sensitivity even though it isn&#x27;t advertised for that.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find that my teeth seemed much cleaner after I started using Desert Essence.</li>
            <li> I have had a low grade abscess for several years - the dentist has not been able to clear it up.</li>
            <li> (fluoride is an industrial waste product....), but I do love this toothpaste and recommend it to others trying to get away from chemicals in their lives.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite toothpaste since I tried it a few months ago</li>
            <li> I am a smoker and heavy coffee drinker and noticed that it removes much better the tobacco and coffee stains on my teeth.</li>
            <li> I am one the last tube right now, as soon as i am done with it  i will buy the one with neem.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel just as smooth as with any other paste; however, the biggest difference is the subdued minty affect of this paste (I am NOT referring to sweetness).</li>
            <li> We now live where we purchase on line in stead of from a store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now buying the 3 pack since I have now found my new toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other natural brands, but they just didn&#x27;t make my teeth feel clean or freshen my breath very well.  </li>
            <li> I used to use crest whitestrips a couple years ago, but stopped since it was making my teeth very sensitive.  </li>
            <li> It just has a clean minty taste without the sweetness of typical toothpastes.</li>
            <li> The dentist was surprised with the improvement.</li>
            <li> it really surprised me.</li>
            <li> Now that I switched over to a natural toothpaste, I don&#x27;t get that reaction anymore.</li>
            <li> Also meets all my criteria for a product like this: No fluoride, anti-bacterial action, and not produced in China.</li>
            <li> I am over 50, developed some gum issues.</li>
            <li> So far Desert Essence has done me well.</li>
            <li> All natural.</li>
            <li> so far, this exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I looked for an all natural toothpaste with no chemicals and found this one.</li>
            <li> So much nicer than the regular brands.  </li>
            <li> I like it because it&#x27;s natural and doesn&#x27;t contain floride</li>
            <li> , my daughter likes it because It doesn&#x27;t burn her mouth like the old brands.</li>
            <li> Very picky about toothpaste, and this is my second order of 3.  </li>
            <li> But when I got home I looked in the mirror and realized it must be this toothpaste naturally whitening my teeth.  </li>
            <li> All natural, no harsh chemicals that eat through your enamel and make your gums recede.  </li>
            <li> I like it...not sweet, a little zippy...</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I am a huge proponent of scrubbing the entire tongue extremely well to get all the white paste off.</li>
            <li> The less intense taste compared to regular toothpaste takes about a week to get used to, but now that I have, whenever I use regular toothpaste I cringe at the powerful mint and chemical taste.</li>
            <li> Much prefer this to other natural brands!</li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of random chemicals, and that it still has enough flavor for good breath.</li>
            <li> I worry about the effects of ingesting any amount of triclosan (which almost all major brand toothpastes contain)</li>
            <li> :) No fluoride or other industrial waste chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> I found that even though it is not real minty, it still cleans my teeth &amp; tongue as well as the previous toothpaste I was using that did have a strong mintiness.</li>
            <li> Also, the flavor and foam is exactly like a conventional toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I have tried several natural toothpastes.</li>
            <li> I am working on putting only natural things in my system.  </li>
            <li> My 10 year old son had yellow teeth.</li>
            <li> There is no reason for him this young to have yellow teeth.</li>
            <li> No regrets</li>
            <li> After researching about 8 different natural toothpastes, I just purchased &amp; tried this product today.</li>
            <li> Especially if one has sensitive skin as I do.  </li>
            <li> I began using this toothpaste about six months ago and my recent Dental checkup and cleaning showed a marked reduction in plaque buildup.  </li>
            <li> It definitely gives your mouth that just-out-of-the-dentist clean feeling and the paste has just the right amount of mint (it&#x27;s not overwhelmingly minty or bitter like other natural toothpastes).</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s costlier than other grocery store brands, but in this case you really get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li> I really like toothpastes that contain baking soda due to</li>
            <li> But to me out worth sacrificing a little treat for overall health.</li>
            <li> Leaves teeth feeling clean and the ingredient list is preferable to those toothpastes commonly found at the grocery stores.</li>
            <li> and they had switched to various types of different, natural toothpastes.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste since trying to go as natural as possible with all of our household products last january.  </li>
            <li> I will never go back to any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve used before Desert Essence Natural Tea Tree.</li>
            <li> The natural ingredients listed seem to be truly natural, not just chemicals hiding behind natural sounding ingredients, unlike Tom&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The other day I was talking with someone and they, out of the blue, said my teeth were so white.  </li>
            <li> Taste is appealing, doesn&#x27;t have any toxic chemicals like the main stream crap.</li>
            <li> Beforehand I was experiencing mental &amp;#34;cloudiness&amp;#34; and fatigue constantly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple natural/fluoride-free toothpastes in the past and always end up going back to Colgate Total paste.</li>
            <li> bought three tubes in the garbage now it gave me canker sores, dry mouth ,and chapped lips  .</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pH neutralizing properties, &amp; this is one of a small handful of natural pastes that contain it.</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers that the mintiness doesn&#x27;t last as long as &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; pastes but if that means less sugar and a healthier mouth, so be it</li>
            <li> The flavor isn&#x27;t bad, though I don&#x27;t think it is my favorite either.</li>
            <li> If I have a canker sore, instead of taking 2 or more weeks to heal they are gone within a week and they don&#x27;t get as painful.  </li>
            <li> NO FLOURIDE and NO label on this product telling you to contact a poison control center if you ingest it.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste helped but is certainly not the cure for my condition.</li>
            <li> Not too sweet, very minty, and doesn&#x27;t have any of the bad things they put in beauty products these days!</li>
            <li> and I hated them all, they never made my mouth feel clean, i highly recommend this toothpaste!</li>
            <li> when I had my six month check-up at the dentist - after only a few weeks of use, my regular hygienist noticed how much less plaque there was on my teeth in the usual spots it builds.</li>
            <li> so i use this toothpaste for other areas within my mouth.</li>
            <li> Eliminating gluten from my diet has helped extremely.</li>
            <li> There were a lot of people saying the Crest ProHealth and other toothpastes with whatever chemicals are in them</li>
            <li> I was told that SAS causes canker sores to get worse or heal slower and this prompted me to try new toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Although I do not have problems with bad breath, this lack of minty affect may be intimidating for some who rely upon a strong minty smell to cover remaining oral odors.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little bitter</li>
            <li> I mean the overall mintiness that I feel during &amp; after brushing; it is very minimal.</li>
            <li> My teeth always had these weird stains on them and my mouth never felt really &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I have brushed with this toothpaste everyday for the past 3 years and have not had a cavity in that time period.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick like regular toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Taste has a slight mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once you become accustomed to using a natural product like this you will not go back to the artificially flavored, chemical laden mainstream alternatives.</li>
            <li> Well doing a little research, almost all toothpaste brands have titanium dioxide in them for the whitening.</li>
            <li> A little too foamy though.</li>
            <li> A refreshingly clean tasting toothpaste without artificial harmful ingredients!.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Jason&#x27;s (however they spell it) and a few others but eventually found this flavor</li>
            <li> We use it everyday and night.</li>
            <li> This brand was one that a few people had switched to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cleans well and doesn&#x27;t have that long lasting artificial aftertaste Colgate or Crest have.  </li>
            <li> I even tried raw 30% hydrogen peroxide for 2 weeks with not conclusive results.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste because it doesn&#x27;t have all the bad stuff in it.  </li>

            <li> I am not sure what is hype here about.</li>
            <li> Lately I used to get an unpleasant reaction using conventional toothpaste from the big brands.</li>
            <li> Works well except after a while my teeth start to get dull and I use a flouride</li>
            <li> Unlike the ones with the hard chemicals I don&#x27;t have an allergic reaction that causes me to drool for 3 minutes after it leaves my mouth.</li>
            <li> PLAQUE!!!&lt;br /&gt;AND THAT WILL ELIMINATE A HOST OF SERIOUS ORAL PROBLEMS</li>
            <li> as is is not good for some glands in the body.</li>
            <li> HARD ON LIVER AND CAN BUILD A SERIOUS TOXICITY REACTION!</li>
            <li> If you are addicted to refined sugars you will find the taste takes some time to gets used to).</li>
            <li> My dentist was floored after I started using this and wanted to know the secret...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie the taste is not great.</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;m not accidently getting a lot of weird chemicals in my mouth.  </li>

            <li> How stupid do they think we are?</li>
            <li> and it was disgusting because I had gotten used to this brand.</li>
            <li> , then I learned the truth about fluoride and about products that are tested on animals (horrific).  </li>
            <li> The store Brand name toothpaste leave my mouth always tasting terrible, so I would use mouth wash just to get rid of the toothpaste taste.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this toothpaste! I was initially looking for fluoride-free and tried this one in mint.  Leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean; I have repurchased several times, and have no complaints.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is great! My teeth feel so smooth and clean still after 2 meals, a cinnamon sugar donut, and a coffee. It&#x27;s as if I just got my teeth cleaned at the dentist. Also, the flavor and foam is exactly like a conventional toothpaste.</li>
            <li> The best toothpaste on the planet! Get some NOW!!!</li>
            <li> I like the taste and I believe it is good for my gums</li>
            <li> Great natural toothpaste! Mouth feels very clean since i&#x27;ve started using this product. Must buy for those looking for a good tooth paste.</li>
            <li> i love using this toothpaste for my tongue and mouth. i was recommended by my dentist to continue to use brand name toothpaste for the fluoride benefits. so i use this toothpaste for other areas within my mouth. i love the antibacterial nature of tea tree oil in keeping your mouth and breath fresh. everyone should have this along with the mouthwash as a part of their regular routine.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste because it doesn&#x27;t have all the bad stuff in it.  Since, I&#x27;ve been using I have not had a cavity when I go to the dentist.</li>
            <li> Great price for the 3-pack</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through 13 tubes of this stuff.  Much prefer this to other natural brands!</li>
            <li> Love this fluoride free paste. After a while of usage my teeth are whiter than ever also.</li>
            <li> If you are going fluoride free this is a good choice</li>
            <li> I looked into a few products with tea tree oil (soap, shampoo, cream for external wounds, and toothpaste), and this brand toothpaste was pretty much the only product that I liked (flavor and/or smell wise) and appeared to be pretty good (at least in terms of my dentist&#x27;s report on gum disease and enamel buildup.)  My wife likes it too, especially the version with mint flavor (there&#x27;s a lesser favored wintergreen flavor, also.)</li>
            <li> I was told that SAS causes canker sores to get worse or heal slower and this prompted me to try new toothpaste.  I&#x27;ve tried Jason&#x27;s (however they spell it) and a few others but eventually found this flavor and I will never change again.  If I have a canker sore, instead of taking 2 or more weeks to heal they are gone within a week and they don&#x27;t get as painful.  I love the taste, the way my breath stays neutral longer, and how well it works despite not having SAS as an ingredient.  Tried the wintergreen, and though good it is not worth replacing this one.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.  Cleans well and doesn&#x27;t have that long lasting artificial aftertaste Colgate or Crest have.  The price is good.  Packed nicely.  Fast delivery. Recommended!</li>
            <li> Leaves teeth feeling clean and the ingredient list is preferable to those toothpastes commonly found at the grocery stores.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Like receiving three at one time.</li>
            <li> Excellent toothpaste. totally hooked. Please don&#x27;t change the formula or anything.</li>
            <li> Toothpaste doesn&#x27;t taste very good, sort of that medicinal lightly minty flavor.  I&#x27;m sure the toothpaste works though, Desert Essence generally makes good products.</li>
            <li> Although it will take another 5 months or so for me to get to a dentist to see any improvement, It does make you realize how much chemical is in everyday pastes. I agree with other reviewers that the mintiness doesn&#x27;t last as long as &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; pastes but if that means less sugar and a healthier mouth, so be it</li>
            <li> NO FLOURIDE and NO label on this product telling you to contact a poison control center if you ingest it. Don&#x27;t believe me, go read your toothpaste tube right now! How stupid do they think we are?</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, clean &amp; non-chemically &amp; non-sugary tasting!</li>
            <li> We have been using this toothpaste for 10 years. It works great, no floride. We now live where we purchase on line in stead of from a store. It comes quickly when we order.</li>
            <li> At first it was working pretty good but then I noticed my teeth started to turn yellow. &#x3D;/</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste I have ever used.....far superior to anything you&#x27;ll find with a &amp;#34;brand&amp;#34; name.</li>
            <li> Not like the original one I had purchase. But it is an OK substitute...If you want an alternative to floride toothpaste this could be it...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple natural/fluoride-free toothpastes in the past and always end up going back to Colgate Total paste. I worry about the effects of ingesting any amount of triclosan (which almost all major brand toothpastes contain) thus, I gave this product a try. This is the best natural toothpaste I have ever used. It definitely gives your mouth that just-out-of-the-dentist clean feeling and the paste has just the right amount of mint (it&#x27;s not overwhelmingly minty or bitter like other natural toothpastes). I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this tooth paste before.  It has helped to reduce a couple of deep pockets  I had.  The dentist was surprised with the improvement.</li>
            <li> I have had a low grade abscess for several years - the dentist has not been able to clear it up. After a week of using this toothpaste, the infection is gone.</li>
            <li> Cleans well, great pricing. The flavor isn&#x27;t bad, though I don&#x27;t think it is my favorite either. Very good deal.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste, it&#x27;s not too over powering and the 3 pack is the best deal!</li>
            <li> This is a gentle yet very effective toothpaste. My teeth are sensitive and this product really helps with sensitivity even though it isn&#x27;t advertised for that. This is my choice toothpaste for life.</li>
            <li> Really liked it. Was interesting getting used to the fact that it had not sweet flavor just mint. My mouth feels a lot cleaner and for longer. I love the fact that it is chemical free.</li>
            <li> been using this for a while...an acquired taste , but well worth it to get used too..</li>
            <li> Works great!!! Taste is good too, if it was a little more minty it would make it even better!!! But nonetheless totally satisfied!!</li>
            <li> I got this in the mail today, and boy was I excited. I couldn&#x27;t wait to brush my teeth. The minty flavor is so tasty. There were so many bubbles, and it left my mouth feeling clean. I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this toothpaste and it&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s sold in a value pack.</li>
            <li> Where? has this toothpaste been my whole life! I have recently been dealing with tooth aches and  sensative teeth, and have been switching back and fourth with diffrent toothpaste hoping to relive my pain. I did alot of research on my teeth came to find out that I have earlie signs of gingavitis. Did some more research on curing the bacteria and came across tea tree oil toothpaste. Read alot of reviews from ppl and Dentist who recommanded the toothpaste, so I gave it a shot and OMG! in just two uses my teeth no longer hurt and it&#x27;s been a week now my gingavits is curing! can&#x27;t believe the wonders this toothpaste is doing for my mouth. I am forever going to use this toothpaste :)</li>
            <li> Excellent !! I thought flavor was no going to be good, bit it really surprised me.</li>
            <li> Big fan. Great price. So potent, you don&#x27;t need that much. Don&#x27;t like all the stuff put into store bought.</li>
            <li> great non-toxic toothpaste. It&#x27;s has a EWG score of just 1 (http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/product/516049/Desert_Essence_Natural_Tea_Tree_Oil_%26_Neem_Toothpaste%2C_Wintergreen/)</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste.  I love how the consistency is the same for any big brand.</li>
            <li> I prefer this toothpaste to the natures gate brand. The baking soda makes a lot more suds and leaves a fresher taste. I still really like the natures gate stuff too. Both have carageenan - which is fine by me in toothpaste. It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m frosting my cake with it.</li>
            <li> Great alternative to fluoride toothpaste. The less intense taste compared to regular toothpaste takes about a week to get used to, but now that I have, whenever I use regular toothpaste I cringe at the powerful mint and chemical taste. After using this product for several months I have experienced a noticeable boost in clarity and I feel much more energized. Beforehand I was experiencing mental &amp;#34;cloudiness&amp;#34; and fatigue constantly. Maybe some people are more sensitive to fluoride than others, or maybe the conspiracy theories we&#x27;ve been hearing about are correct (fluoride is an industrial waste product....), but I do love this toothpaste and recommend it to others trying to get away from chemicals in their lives.</li>
            <li> I have tried a variety of natural toothpastes and this so far is our favorite.  No strange aftertaste, good foaming, overall our family&#x27;s favorite.</li>
            <li> I love tea tree oil because it is a natural disinfectant and reduces tooth sensitivity.  This toothpaste is a good bargain, tastes good, and keeps my mouth healthy.</li>
            <li> I have tried several natural toothpastes. This one cleans well and works great with my sensitive teeth. It tastes ok the mint is not very strong.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste does a great job of cleaning with the proper toothbrush. Lately I used to get an unpleasant reaction using conventional toothpaste from the big brands. Now that I switched over to a natural toothpaste, I don&#x27;t get that reaction anymore. I feel great after using it. I would recommend this product to EVERYONE.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Great job of cleaning, freshens my breath very well, non-chemical formula&lt;br /&gt;Cons: None</li>
            <li> Great tasting without the extra sugar!</li>
            <li> I like it...not sweet, a little zippy...but good to alternate trough 3 different types of tooth paste and mouth wash... just to surprise the germs...</li>
            <li> Really, the Desert Essence line of toothpastes are the best I&#x27;ve ever tried - nice taste, effective clean, great after-brush feeling. Also meets all my criteria for a product like this: No fluoride, anti-bacterial action, and not produced in China. Been using various flavors of this product for six months now, and I can definitely tell that my gums are healthier and my mouth feels better. Will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I am over 50, developed some gum issues. This toothpaste helped turn it around, after you brush your mouth feels refreshed, like you know it&#x27;s clean. Love this toothpaste!</li>
            <li> So far Desert Essence has done me well.</li>
            <li> This is the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used. Very minty and fresh tasting and gets my teeth really clean. Big tube; lasts for months.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something different than the toothpaste with chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;This is a very good, more than what is expected.. will order more for sure...</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my naturalistic physician for the gum sores I was getting in my mouth. I was diagnosed from a Oral Surgeon with Benign Mucus Membrane Pemphigoid. (sores,lesion,blister in my mouth) This toothpaste helped but is certainly not the cure for my condition. Eliminating gluten from my diet has helped extremely. I will never go back to any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve used before Desert Essence Natural Tea Tree. I prefer Winter mint over Mint.</li>
            <li> I am working on putting only natural things in my system.  This does not taste like the popular brands; the taste is rather bland but there is a special feeling of my mouth being clean in a pure and natural way.</li>
            <li> nice taste.  cleans great.  switched from Toms of Maine.</li>
            <li> This is the only toothpaste I use, it works great, has no harsh chemicals, sugars or flavoring.  I have used this brand for several years now and I am very happy with this product and you can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s price!</li>
            <li> I bought one to try out and I loved it.  My whole mouth feels clean after brushing with it and it being a vegan product just clenched it for me.  I&#x27;m now buying the 3 pack since I have now found my new toothpaste.  I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Not just because it&#x27;s made with all natural ingredients, I love that it does a fantastic job of cleaning my teeth .  I know I&#x27;m not accidently getting a lot of weird chemicals in my mouth.  My mouth feels clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Great product, nice taste, not too overwhemling as some tea-tree products can be. Love the tube it comes in, it&#x27;s easy to use. The natural ingredients listed seem to be truly natural, not just chemicals hiding behind natural sounding ingredients, unlike Tom&#x27;s. Colgate ruined that product with its new main ingredient; greed. And Colgate thought we wouldn&#x27;t notice a cheap ingredient like sodium saccharin? Silver lining is that I found this excellent product and I won&#x27;t be using anything else :)</li>
            <li> I think this is the best toothpaste on the market! I will never buy the store brands any more. This is a good clean mouth experience. No sugar no garbage!</li>
            <li> Healthy mouth without the stuff you don&#x27;t need!</li>
            <li> All natural. Works great. Tastes good (advisory: If you are addicted to refined sugars you will find the taste takes some time to gets used to). Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this refreshing toothpaste perfect for those who do not wish to poison their bodies with Fluoride.  Price is excellent, I also like the new tubes, easier to extract the last drop.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of problems with my gums being irritated and it had gotten to the point where I dreaded brushing my teeth because my gums would bleed and I&#x27;d always end up feeling injured, even though I was using a big name &amp;#34;sensitive/gum health&amp;#34; toothpaste. I started using this and the bleeding has greatly reduced and my husband loves it, too. I love that it&#x27;s herbal-- I prefer taking advantage of the healing properties in things from the earth before chemicals any day. I buy this several tubes at a time now from Amazon- it&#x27;s much cheaper than buying it 1 tube at a time!</li>
            <li> We use it everyday and night. Great toothpaste and refreshing taste. We have reordered many times.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality product and love the flavor.</li>
            <li> I bought these to have on hand for my family that has to have everything gluten-free</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only toothpaste I&#x27;ve used for years now.  Great product and great value purchased here.</li>
            <li> Good toothpaste without toxic chemicals. I like 3 packs as they last a while. Our whole family switched to this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> An absolute great product .no more bleeding gums. Best toothpaste ever!</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;d been using Crest ProHealth toothpaste. My teeth always had these weird stains on them and my mouth never felt really &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ran out of Crest and came to Amazon to buy some more. I noticed a few negative reviews and checked them out. There were a lot of people saying the Crest ProHealth and other toothpastes with whatever chemicals are in them were staining their teeth and they had switched to various types of different, natural toothpastes. This brand was one that a few people had switched to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked up this 3-pack and couldn&#x27;t be happier. From the first time you brush your teeth with it, you notice a difference. Your mouth has a &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feeling that can only be described as &amp;#34;right out of the dentist&#x27;s chair.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice flavor, a bit of baking soda bitterness with mint oil. Best of all, it doesn&#x27;t stain my teeth like the chemical toothpastes do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a 3-pack and 2 of them are already gone, given to friends and family to try out. I&#x27;ll be purchasing more here in the near future.</li>
            <li> Love the way this toothpaste makes the pearly whites feel! And you can sleep well knowing you&#x27;re not putting anything bad in your body.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for awhile. Love it. Will not use anything else. Sometimes I dip it in baking soda for deep clean.</li>
            <li> My dentist is impressed with how healthy my gums have become since switching to Desert Essence toothpaste. Awesome product, awesome service, reasonably priced from a very happy customer.</li>
            <li> A very good natural toothpaste with a great taste.</li>
            <li> I bought this in a 3 pack for value purposes not realizing that it did not contain neem. The toothpaste is very high quality but I am stuck with 3 toothpastes that I will never use. I tried it but I need the neem, so there does not seem any point in using it. I will have it out for guests and probably use the two unopened ones for stocking stuffers...</li>
            <li> A nice change from the typical brands of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the best tasting toothpaste I have tasted but I can honestly say my teeth have never felt cleaner. I</li>
            <li> Excellent choice... I have brushed with this toothpaste everyday for the past 3 years and have not had a cavity in that time period. Fluoride is not needed for a healthy mouth</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste i have used!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is the very best that I have ever used, It only takes just a pea-size on the toothbrush to completely clean and refresh your entire mouth, plus without the flouride....as is is not good for some glands in the body.</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste. you can brush your teeth and then eat no problem. dosent leave a fake mint taste just refreshed</li>
            <li> I am so happy to find a great gluten free toothpaste. It tastes fantastic, does a wonderful job, and has minimal ingredients. I will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> This is my regular toothpaste. I don&#x27;t notice the tea tree that much at all. To me, this is the closest you&#x27;ll get to a regular mint toothpaste without unwanted chemicals.</li>
            <li> Pleasant minty taste --- my teeth and mouth feel clean! And, I don&#x27;t have to worry when my kids swallow a bit of this toothpaste....no yucky fluoride!</li>
            <li> I use this tooth paste all the time.  It&#x27;s a great cleaner.  Doesn&#x27;t taste bad.</li>
            <li> Works well except after a while my teeth start to get dull and I use a flouride one maybe twice a week bc of that.</li>
            <li> I almost never write reviews, but this toothpaste is worthy. It will be my regular brand from now on. I love the refreshing taste, it&#x27;s not too overwhelming, and it leaves my teeth feeling more clean than any leading brand I have ever tried!</li>
            <li> so far, this exceeded my expectations. my gum were hurting/bleeding and I tried all kind of pastes and mouth wash without success. I even tried raw 30% hydrogen peroxide for 2 weeks with not conclusive results. after the first week of using this paste alone(no mouth wash solution) the bleeding and hurting are gone. my breath is fresher. from my own personal experience, I&#x27;ll recommended this to anyone who have gum issues.</li>
            <li> Good toothpaste - I guess this was a 3 pkg offer so I will have a supply for months. Taste has a slight mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read about benefits of Tea Tree oil (Melaleuca) online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complementary and alternative medicines such as tea tree (Melaleuca) oil have become increasingly popular in recent decades. This essential oil has been used for almost 100 years in Australia. The primary uses of tea tree oil have historically capitalized on the antiseptic and anti-inflammatory actions, antimicrobial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many dental care experts advocate brush and floss your teeth twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with ALL products read label and instructions before using&lt;br /&gt;Always rinse well after using the toothpaste (just like all toothpaste- rinse well).</li>
            <li> Very good. Tastes great.</li>
            <li> I found this product while searching for a toothpaste that does not contain a lot of chemicals and artificial ingredients. I find the big brand name tartar-control toothpastes irritate my gums if I brush with them more than once a day. I was pleasantly surprised to find that my teeth seemed much cleaner after I started using Desert Essence. I got further confirmation when I had my six month check-up at the dentist - after only a few weeks of use, my regular hygienist noticed how much less plaque there was on my teeth in the usual spots it builds. I highly recommend this tooth paste!</li>
            <li> My 10 year old son had yellow teeth. There is no reason for him this young to have yellow teeth. Well doing a little research, almost all toothpaste brands have titanium dioxide in them for the whitening. Found out if you are allergic to this, it will cause your teeth to be yellow. I looked for an all natural toothpaste with no chemicals and found this one. Guess what, my sons teeth are white again. Will continue to buy this toothpaste. Pays to read the labels. Glad for this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste.  My husband thinks it needs a stronger mint flavor, but I think it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I like this toothpaste.  It&#x27;s thick like regular toothpaste.  Has the same white texture.  Doesn&#x27;t bother my skin.</li>
            <li> It takes nice and seems to help with my recurring oral yeast infections.  Will buy again.  On my 3rd tube.</li>
            <li> bought three tubes in the garbage now it gave me canker sores, dry mouth ,and chapped lips  . jason power smile was much better  . try be for buying more</li>
            <li> So much nicer than the regular brands.  Highly recommended (mouthwash as well).</li>
            <li> Snuck it by me because the description said SLS free but read the ingredients and there it is. Shame on Dessert Essence!</li>
            <li> I like this toothpaste.  Tastes ok and does the job.</li>
            <li> Excellent toothpaste, good flavor too!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years and absolutely love it. It just has a clean minty taste without the sweetness of typical toothpastes. If you&#x27;re looking for a natural toothpaste you can&#x27;t do better than this.</li>
            <li> I love DE products and trust them with my health. This one is one of the best (my unhealthy husband prefers this one too) tasting natural toothpastes. While not my favorite, this one comes in quite close!</li>
            <li> Great and natural product</li>
            <li> The key to this toothpaste is NO sucralose. I do not support toothpaste brands that promote washing your teeth with sugar. Keeps my mouth fresh and disinfected  with tea tree oil while not letting my teeth get stained with the help of baking soda on it.</li>
            <li> Best natural toothpaste ever!!!</li>
            <li> Happy with purchase will reorder</li>
            <li> Pleasant and refreshing mint taste with great cleaning power.  Once you become accustomed to using a natural product like this you will not go back to the artificially flavored, chemical laden mainstream alternatives.</li>
            <li> Taste is appealing, doesn&#x27;t have any toxic chemicals like the main stream crap.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is OKAY, I believe the one with &amp;#34;neem&amp;#34; in it gets my teeth cleaner than this particular one. I am one the last tube right now, as soon as i am done with it  i will buy the one with neem.</li>
            <li> I cannot handle any form of sugar including the stuff the leading brands put in theirs.&lt;br /&gt;This works for me.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite toothpaste since I tried it a few months ago and I don&#x27;t want to use anything else now. I bought their mouthwash and floss because the toothpaste was so good and I love them all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok a lot like baking soda (which I was not totally surprised) I usually use Kiss my face but it tripled in price on here</li>
            <li> Great product delivered on time!</li>
            <li> Cleans well, but doesn&#x27;t freshen up your mouth like crest.</li>
            <li> This was my second order of this toothpaste.  My wife and I both love how it&#x27;s natural and you&#x27;re not brushing your teeth with things your mouth should never touch.  I will definitely keep reordering this!</li>
            <li> This is the best toothpaste I have ever used and it only has stuff you need, minty fresh. Great transaction, super fast, super safe!</li>
            <li> This is the only toothpaste that I&#x27;ll use, however, it&#x27;s actually cheaper at Sprout&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> shipped quick, great item.  alot of tooth paste for the price.  said to help gum problems and it is working.</li>
            <li> i heard about this from my dentist! So far I am in love with it, and so greatful to finally have a good experience with toothpaste.</li>
            <li> My family has been using this toothpaste for about 2 years and we all love it. I like it because it&#x27;s natural and doesn&#x27;t contain floride, my daughter likes it because It doesn&#x27;t burn her mouth like the old brands. This keeps my teeth clean and my breath fresh. The best part for me is knowing there aren&#x27;t harmful chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> After trying to find a healthier toothpaste with no flouride this one is my favorite so far. I have tried several.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste since trying to go as natural as possible with all of our household products last january.  it has a fresh, minty taste, and does a great job.</li>
            <li> Me and my husband hate the toothpaste with a bunch of fluoride &amp; artificial flavor crap. So we bought this 3 pack &amp; we love it. This will be our regular purchase now,.. I have not seen these in stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good purchase. Good quality for good money! No regrets</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste without flouride.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste has a light, mint taste. It is a safer alternative than fluoride toothpastes. A little too foamy though. It could do without the foaming agent. Good product.</li>
            <li> Only toothpaste that helped with plaque buildup for me and helped my teeth shine.  My dentist was floored after I started using this and wanted to know the secret... she now recommends it to all her patients.  If you have problems with plaque and tartar buildup give it a try!</li>
            <li> I am not sure what is hype here about. It is just fine Still need to use my Colgate to keep my teeth white and breath fresh. Taste fine and texture is fine, a little bit crummy. My girl 10 years old has brases and has some occasional oral irritation, but tell you the truth Colgate does better keeping it under control.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used quite a few fluoride free toothpaste and this is my favorite. It is a true and pure toxin free toothpaste. A lot of them are bogus like toms of Maine (don&#x27;t get that stuff). It leaves your mouth fresh and I&#x27;ve noticed after a month or two of use tgat my teeth have gotten whiter</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste in the world for getting that gnarly taste out of your mouth in the morning! :) No fluoride or other industrial waste chemicals in it. Good abrasives for gently polishing teeth. Works well with an ultrasonic brush. Nice aftertaste and fresh breath.</li>
            <li> Actually pretty good for hippie toothpaste. I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of random chemicals, and that it still has enough flavor for good breath.</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste!  It works wonderfully.  My teeth feel and look clean.  It&#x27;s a great breath freshener as well.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other natural brands, but they just didn&#x27;t make my teeth feel clean or freshen my breath very well.  I have been using this kind for over a year now.  It is an actual paste too, as opposed to a gel.</li>
            <li> Amazing Product!! Not only cleans your teeth but heals sensituve teeth!! The seller provided excellent delivery service!!</li>
            <li> We have finally found our favorite natural toothpaste and refuse to use anything else!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is awesome. I just got my 2nd triple pack of it. I love the mint feeling it leaves after your finished your teeth and mouth feel so refreshed its amazing. I like how its organic, everything now and days has way to much added nonsense. Without a doubt would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This has been our favorite for years. We need gluten and allergen free toothpaste and this one works great. The kids use it too with no complaints.</li>
            <li> Nice product I&#x27;ve used for years.</li>
            <li> Best stuff around. You will not be disappointed with this toothpaste. Let&#x27;s simplify!</li>
            <li> We like Desert Essence toothpaste very much.</li>
            <li> Great  product ,,I loved them ,,good seller.</li>
            <li> Since I have been using this toothpaste, I have not had any sores in my mouth.  My teeth feel cleaner and are whiter.  I love not putting all those chemicals in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Now that the price is up to 3/$15, whole foods has a better deal!!! It&#x27;s always 2/$10 at the Tribeca NY location :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand of toothpaste for over a year and I love it. My daughters (4yrs and 2yrs) also use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ran out once I used my husband&#x27;s regular toothpaste and it was disgusting because I had gotten used to this brand. The &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; brand you get at the store are SUPER sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dental hygienist also uses this brand!</li>
            <li> Basically - cleans the teeth. I don&#x27;t really like the taste of soda but it&#x27;s not a big issue. I am a smoker and heavy coffee drinker and noticed that it removes much better the tobacco and coffee stains on my teeth. I am not visiting my dentist for polishing anymore. I am pretty satisfied with it, if it had better taste it would get 5* but as I said - not a big issue..</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.  It tastes great and is a great healthier option then the major brands out there.  This came in 2 days like it was supposed to and just in time before I ran out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie the taste is not great. It&#x27;s not terrible either but it&#x27;s a little bitter i guess i would say. But to me out worth sacrificing a little treat for overall health. And it dose clean well.</li>
            <li> Not too sweet, very minty, and doesn&#x27;t have any of the bad things they put in beauty products these days!</li>
            <li> Great taste and this toothpaste actually foams up! ive tried many others like this and I hated them all, they never made my mouth feel clean, i highly recommend this toothpaste!</li>
            <li> Very picky about toothpaste, and this is my second order of 3.  Nice mint flavor, and gets teeth very clean.  The other day I was talking with someone and they, out of the blue, said my teeth were so white.  I had not noticed.  I used to use crest whitestrips a couple years ago, but stopped since it was making my teeth very sensitive.  But when I got home I looked in the mirror and realized it must be this toothpaste naturally whitening my teeth.  So love it even more.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Sometimes you feel like you have to pick health and beauty products out of a hat. I chose this one based on the ingredients and was very impressed with the product. Makes my teeth feel clean and fresh and love the fact that there is tea tree oil in the mix.</li>
            <li> I use this regularly and my overall dental health has improved greatly. I no longer have any type of swollen gums and I don&#x27;t have to worry about using flouride.</li>
            <li> My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t find this sooner!  All natural, no harsh chemicals that eat through your enamel and make your gums recede.  I love this stuff.  Yes it&#x27;s costlier than other grocery store brands, but in this case you really get what you pay for.  Your dentist will also be glad you switched!</li>
            <li> Great product! Tastes nice and leaves my teeth clean and breath fresh!</li>
            <li> tastes really fresh with no artificial toxic taste</li>
            <li> The wife has been on a fluoride-free kick lately, so naturally changing toothpaste was first on the list. We tried Tom&#x27;s and a few others from the organic food store, but to be honest there was something off about every one of them. This one came closest to replicating the feel of Crest (which I used to use), and though it still doesn&#x27;t feel quite as squeaky clean as fluoridated toothpaste it was substantially better than the rest. The taste is pretty nice, too.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Taste good, cleans good</li>
            <li> Tastes is good and I use it on both electric and manual brush twice a day.</li>
            <li> My favorite natural toothpaste! If they could only get rid of the carrageenan in it, it would be perfect!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for about 7 months. Just had my dental check-up &amp; no cavities. Love the fresh taste &amp; have recommended it to several friends looking for natural products.</li>
            <li> I try to not use artificial ingredients in my food or products I use. I switched from &amp;#34;Tom&#x27;s of Maine&amp;#34; toothpaste when I noticed artificial sweeteners used. This tastes nice (minty) and no strange flavors and works great.</li>
            <li> Good toothpaste. Leaves mouth fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item because it was the best deal on this brand of toothpaste. I had tried the wintergreen (which is the kind pictured) and it is my #1 favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I received is exactly what is in the description, the Mint flavor. I&#x27;m took off a star because it doesn&#x27;t taste as good as the wintergreen nor does it leave my mouth feeling as fresh as the wintergreen, which I would give 5 stars to. Just be aware that you are ordering a 3 pack of the Mint flavor w/ tea tree oil--not the Wintergreen w/ neem and tea tree oil that is pictured (they&#x27;ve since fixed the picture).</li>
            <li> TEA TREE OIL TOOTHPASTE IF BRUSHED MORNING AND EVENING EVERY DAY... WILL ELIMINATE PLAQUE!!!&lt;br /&gt;AND THAT WILL ELIMINATE A HOST OF SERIOUS ORAL PROBLEMS THAT PLAQUE CAUSES!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEVER... INGEST... HARD ON LIVER AND CAN BUILD A SERIOUS TOXICITY REACTION!</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste!  It has a fresh, natural taste and helped me get a great report at the dentist. :)</li>
            <li> Very nice toothpaste.  I will be reordering.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste. Unlike the ones with the hard chemicals I don&#x27;t have an allergic reaction that causes me to drool for 3 minutes after it leaves my mouth. Also, it keeps my teeth cleaner! I do not get fuzzy slipper teeth at the end of the day anymore even after eating sweets. Love this product.</li>
            <li> July 8, 2013: After researching about 8 different natural toothpastes, I just purchased &amp; tried this product today. I really like toothpastes that contain baking soda due to it&#x27;s pH neutralizing properties, &amp; this is one of a small handful of natural pastes that contain it. My teeth feel just as smooth as with any other paste; however, the biggest difference is the subdued minty affect of this paste (I am NOT referring to sweetness). By affect I mean the overall mintiness that I feel during &amp; after brushing; it is very minimal. Although I do not have problems with bad breath, this lack of minty affect may be intimidating for some who rely upon a strong minty smell to cover remaining oral odors. I will continue using this, in addition to Dioxirinse, &amp; see if I like it. I am always on the look out for products made by companies who do not test on animals - that is my #1 priority.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;July 29, 2013: ***Update***  I have been using this product for about a month now &amp; I am pleased with it. I found that even though it is not real minty, it still cleans my teeth &amp; tongue as well as the previous toothpaste I was using that did have a strong mintiness. My mouth feels just as clean &amp; the white paste on the tongue in the morning brushes off just as easily.  I am a huge proponent of scrubbing the entire tongue extremely well to get all the white paste off. In the morning, I brush with this product twice, thoroughly scrubbing my tongue both times; I then rinse with Dioxirinse. In the evening I brush only once &amp; also use the Dioxirinse. I have found the combination of these two products to be just as effective as when using the prior toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Especially if one has sensitive skin as I do.  I received quite promptly as well.</li>
            <li> Yes, it costs more than the junk you buy off the shelves at your local discount store, but it&#x27;s well worth it.  I used Crest Extra Whitening for years, and had tried several others here and there (Colgate, Aquafresh, etc.), then I learned the truth about fluoride and about products that are tested on animals (horrific).  I tried this, and my teeth are whiter and cleaner than they were when using Crest or any of the others.  You don&#x27;t need to use very much at all for it to be effective, so that helps offset the cost a little bit.</li>
            <li> I began using this toothpaste about six months ago and my recent Dental checkup and cleaning showed a marked reduction in plaque buildup.  The store Brand name toothpaste leave my mouth always tasting terrible, so I would use mouth wash just to get rid of the toothpaste taste.  I only use a water rinse with the Desert Essence because all I taste is the mint flavor not the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> My favorite toothpaste.  Clean minty taste that is not overpowering.  No gum damaging fluoride.</li>
            <li> Clean feeling and local manufacturer!</li>
            <li> Good pack, good price, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste I have found! Nice, fresh aftertaste and without harmful chemicals!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It&#x27;s great for those of us who are a little more concerned about staying natural and not putting chemicals in our mouths. I love it because it still gives you a very bright, minty, just clean refreshed feeling. Other natural products I&#x27;ve tried sometimes fall a little flat - this stuff tastes great and gives a thorough cleaning!</li>
            <li> A refreshingly clean tasting toothpaste without artificial harmful ingredients!. A welcome change from the Tom&#x27;s of Maine I have used for years. Feels great to support a small, family-owned company that has a quality product for a fair price.</li>
            <li> I decided to try a more natural toothpaste after recently trying to become more healthy. My teeth have become much more yellow while using this toothpaste. I also don&#x27;t like that it contains carageenan. I don&#x27;t understand why everyone likes this product.</li>
