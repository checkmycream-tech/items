            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>this is a great pair of tweezers</li>
            <li>It plucks hairs with great force and good control.  </li>
            <li>The square tip is the best for accurate grooming.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how good these are compared to your 1$ walmart rage inducing no grips.</li>
            <li>I had thought I lost my good tweezers but did find them after I purchased these.</li>
            <li>These are as good as the pair which was lost.  </li>
            <li>Good tweezers.  </li>
            <li>good buy</li>
            <li>[They don&#x27;t make good screw drivers]</li>

            <li>I love these tweezers!  </li>
            <li>My favorite twizzers!</li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>It works great and so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really have the best grip to them when trying to grab a hold of something whether it be a splinter or an eyebrow</li>
            <li>These are very well made, and they are perfect for what I wanted.</li>
            <li>She liked the tightness of the tweezers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as great at plucking as I had hoped, but at the cheap price it does the trick most of the time.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would be able to get a good grip of each hair and to my surprise it grabbed every hair that needed to go.  </li>
            <li>easy to use, good quality.</li>
            <li>Made very cheaply, scratches you.</li>
            <li>Okay</li>
            <li>I could tell the minute I picked them up - they&#x27;ve changed their supplier for sure and decided to cut costs because now they are Dollar Store quality.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable to hold and use!  </li>
            <li>I love the handle and the accuracy you get with this implement.</li>
            <li>I love that they have a square tip and not a slanted tip.  </li>
            <li>Love the blunt tip.</li>
            <li>This is an item not found in most drug stores or retailers.  </li>
            <li>The square tip is so much better than the slant tip.</li>
            <li>Wish I had 10 more.  </li>
            <li>Cheap to own.  </li>
            <li>i love these tweezers better than any on market</li>
            <li>I love these tweezers .</li>
            <li>Specifically tweezers with square tips I have not been able to find any in stores anywhere  </li>
            <li>I purchased 2 and will need to order more soon.  </li>
            <li>I like the square tip tweezers better than pointed ones.  </li>
            <li>and they were priced better than at Walmart.</li>
            <li>I love Revlon tweezers.</li>
            <li>I prefer the angled tip slightly better, but this still gets the job done.</li>
            <li>When you need a tweezer, these will work okay.</li>
            <li>Even better than the one I&#x27;ve had for 30 years and have been trying to replace four about 10.  </li>
            <li>Tried these because the ones I&#x27;ve been trying from the drug stores just don&#x27;t hold on to the eyebrow hairs well enough to pluck them.&lt;br /&gt;These work GREAT!  </li>
            <li>Good tweezers, solid and good quality.</li>
            <li>The square tip works fine for gripping that stray hair and yanking it out.  </li>
            <li>Revlon makes very high quality products and this is a good example of that.</li>
            <li>Too much hassle to return so will keep as a backup in case I lose the good ones.</li>
            <li>The handles make it so much easier to get a good grip on finer hairs.</li>
            <li>I loved my first pair, but they were sacrificed for a worthy cause.</li>
            <li>Just not wanting to deal with online returns.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and we were given a free night&#x27;s stay at the hotel for all the hassle.</li>
            <li>So cheap, no edge to it at all.</li>
            <li>according to sale its &amp;#34;not available for return&amp;#34; &amp; its so cheaply made I bent it just opening the package.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the old fashioned scissor type tweezers.  </li>
            <li>(p.s. - I bought mine in the original Revlon package at CVS Drugstore)</li>
            <li>Oh, and the price was right, too!</li>
            <li>but that seems to be true.  </li>
            <li>I have found others at local stores that were too flimsy to do any good.  </li>
            <li>Not a bad item just not what I&#x27;m used too.</li>
            <li>The tweezers came quickly and were just what I wanted.</li>
            <li>BUT, I made that decision too quickly.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and would highly recommend it to you.  </li>
            <li>Cheap reproduction of what I originally purchased in local drugstore many years ago.</li>
            <li>Not as good as I expected</li>
            <li>You have to think tweezers don´t last forever, but this are good for 1-2 years, way better than any other model in the market, they maintain the alignment and the grip and they´re cheap.</li>
            <li>I own and LOVE the ones in this picture, and was buying another for a friend who was actually trying to upgrade from their junky current pair.  </li>
            <li>Much easier to use in your hand and the old style grabs better</li>
            <li>I lose tweezers constantly because I use them for so many purposes.  </li>
            <li>I  grabbed  on the first try.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad they still make this simple and practical product.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy them again when I need more.</li>
            <li>Over many years, I have had several pairs of tweezers of all values.  </li>
            <li>I received the older, less precise, more cheaply made version of tweezers, that even at a glance are not remotely like the tweezers pictured.  </li>
            <li>As with all Revlon beauty tools, these are well made of stainless steel, have no rough edges, and are balanced perfectly to fit a woman&#x27;s hand.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t get the short hairs or fine hairs.  </li>
            <li>Out of all the tweezers that I&#x27;ve used, I really like this one.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>but it does not bend, its straight lines like a scissors.</li>
            <li>I am so much contented every time I use it.  </li>
            <li>These were a gift for someone else, and she really likes the way they handle.  </li>
            <li>Glad I have my old pair back -</li>
            <li>Would not recommend to purchase this particular one.</li>
            <li>Finally found a &amp;#34;scissors&amp;#34; shaped tweezer with a fine enough point to do the job.  </li>
            <li>and I guess I&#x27;ll have to start looking for a new brand -</li>
            <li>The new scissors tweezers does NOT work.</li>
            <li>They were brand new in the package.</li>
            <li>After visiting several local drugstores, grocery stores, and \\&quot;big box\\&quot; stores, I wasn&#x27;t able to locate a pair of square tip tweezers.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re about the same price as can be found at Walmart though, so didn&#x27;t give them a higher recommendation.</li>
            <li>CHEAPLY MADE in the extreme!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also glad I bought this because straight tip tweezers are hard to find and its inexpensive too!</li>
            <li>I lost my old revlon tweezer that was of a much thicker material, this one is not that same thickness and quality</li>
            <li>but I miss the old design.  </li>
            <li>This is a simple, well designed product that does the job very well.  </li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t like the old ones were made and don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li>Then when I really NEED a pair (for actual tweezing), I can never find them.  </li>
            <li>All perform equally well, but all are straight edge.  </li>
            <li>As far as  hair removal it works fine as long as one is patient and careful.</li>
            <li>I bought multiple tweezers when my level of frustration with a slanted-tip tweezer hit a high point.  </li>
            <li>However, this new pair is rough on the handle, which sort of digs into my thumb.</li>

            <li> I missplaced my Perfectweeze tweezers that I&#x27;ve had for years recently, and I finally broke down and bought a new pair.  </li>
            <li> Couldnt find the flat tip anywhere in stores, they all sell slant tip.</li>

            <li> Unfortunately there comes a time in a woman&#x27;s life when she starts growing a mustache and beard, so that&#x27;s what I use these for.  I only like the tweezers with the scissor style handle, plain tweezers are tough to grab a single strand of hair with. The square tip works fine for gripping that stray hair and yanking it out.  I haven&#x27;t seemed to have any trouble with the tips not clamping together. I carry this in my pack cuz I never know when I&#x27;m gonna look in a mirror and see a hair sprouting out and have to get rid of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have a pair of these with the slant tip in my bathroom drawer.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the old fashioned scissor type tweezers.  Ends too blunt.  Not a bad item just not what I&#x27;m used too.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this because of the scissor like handles.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would be able to get a good grip of each hair and to my surprise it grabbed every hair that needed to go.  I lost my old revlon tweezer that was of a much thicker material, this one is not that same thickness and quality but it works well enough that it doesn&#x27;t matter that it isn&#x27;t.  My old tweezer was over 15 years old and the quality of a lot of things have downgraded, its unfortunate but that seems to be true.  I&#x27;m also glad I bought this because straight tip tweezers are hard to find and its inexpensive too!</li>
            <li> Will actually grab those tiny tough ear hairs that my wife is constantly complaining about (yes, I am an old man).</li>
            <li> Okay but I miss the old design.  Much easier to use in your hand and the old style grabs better</li>
            <li> Good tweezers, solid and good quality.</li>
            <li> What can I say? These things tweeze and tweeze perfectly just as the name advertises. Very little squeezing force is required so getting grips and slipping will be a non-issue with these. I literally just wrote a five star review for a pair of TWEEZERS. That&#x27;s how good these are compared to your 1$ walmart rage inducing no grips.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really have the best grip to them when trying to grab a hold of something whether it be a splinter or an eyebrow</li>
            <li> The tips of the tweezers are too thick which make skin pinching a problem. As far as  hair removal it works fine as long as one is patient and careful.</li>
            <li> After visiting several local drugstores, grocery stores, and \\&quot;big box\\&quot; stores, I wasn&#x27;t able to locate a pair of square tip tweezers. For some reason (the majority of women prefer them?), slant tip tweezers abound. For me, square tip tweezers work best. Rather than search another store, I simply looked the item up on Amazon. The Revlon Perfectweeze with square tip is, indeed, perfect for me. I like the easy-to-use handles on this tweezer. I purchased two as this brand and type of tweezer seem very hard to find. Oh, and the price was right, too!</li>
            <li> I missplaced my Perfectweeze tweezers that I&#x27;ve had for years recently, and I finally broke down and bought a new pair.  What a disappointment!  CHEAPLY MADE in the extreme!  I could tell the minute I picked them up - they&#x27;ve changed their supplier for sure and decided to cut costs because now they are Dollar Store quality. I finally found my lost pair and compared them side by side - what a difference.  Glad I have my old pair back - and I guess I&#x27;ll have to start looking for a new brand - after probably close to 20 years of sticking with this product. (p.s. - I bought mine in the original Revlon package at CVS Drugstore)</li>
            <li> Out of all the tweezers that I&#x27;ve used, I really like this one.  It&#x27;s comfortable to hold and use!  I have three of these already.</li>
            <li> I love this product and would highly recommend it to you.  I love the handle and the accuracy you get with this implement.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old one and it is awful. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this to use as a tweezer.</li>
            <li> I bought two. One didn&#x27;t line up at all. The quality is not there. :-(</li>
            <li> This style works best for me</li>
            <li> I love these tweezers!  I love that they have a square tip and not a slanted tip.  I would recommend them to anyone!</li>
            <li> This is a simple, well designed product that does the job very well.  I have used Revlon products for years and have been very satisfied.</li>
            <li> These are well made and so the job well. My only problem is my fingers are a little big for the holes so I can&#x27;t get a great grip on them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as great at plucking as I had hoped, but at the cheap price it does the trick most of the time.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I expected</li>
            <li> Great. Love the blunt tip.</li>
            <li> This item actually works, unlike some other variations.  The square tip is the best for accurate grooming.</li>
            <li> You have to think tweezers don´t last forever, but this are good for 1-2 years, way better than any other model in the market, they maintain the alignment and the grip and they´re cheap.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t like the old ones were made and don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> Great tool for plucking and contouring eyebrows.  This is an item not found in most drug stores or retailers.  The square tip is so much better than the slant tip.</li>
            <li> The item in the picture is not what was delivered.  I received the older, less precise, more cheaply made version of tweezers, that even at a glance are not remotely like the tweezers pictured.  I own and LOVE the ones in this picture, and was buying another for a friend who was actually trying to upgrade from their junky current pair.  Unbelievably, the ones they sent were the junky ones she already has!  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Wish I had 10 more.  Cheap to own.  Miss it when it is someplace else.  Need to have one in every car and every other location.</li>
            <li> I lose tweezers constantly because I use them for so many purposes.  Then when I really NEED a pair (for actual tweezing), I can never find them.  Therefore, I bought 10 pair and put small key chains on them to help me keep up with them,.  Small thing, I guess, but I haven&#x27;t lost a single pair yet, and I still have quite a stash of these in my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> this thing is great!  It plucks hairs with great force and good control.  I have found others at local stores that were too flimsy to do any good.  I bought the Revlon, and it works.</li>
            <li> The tweezers I received are not the same as the picture on line.</li>
            <li> I could not find this product in any store in my area.  I had seen a YouTuber use it to put on fake eyelashes, and that was what I wanted it for.  It works great and so easy to use.</li>
            <li> i love these tweezers better than any on market</li>
            <li> THIS DEVICE IS GREAT TO REMOVE A SPLINTER OR PIECE OF GLASS FROM YOUR HAND OR FOOT WITHOUT LOSING ONE&#x27;S GRIP  ON  IT</li>
            <li> Cheap reproduction of what I originally purchased in local drugstore many years ago. I had thought I lost my good tweezers but did find them after I purchased these. Too much hassle to return so will keep as a backup in case I lose the good ones. Would not recommend to purchase this particular one.</li>
            <li> I love these tweezers . It plucks  every hair I  grabbed  on the first try. Handles are sturdy. Great product</li>
            <li> I was ecstatic that Amazon carried these specific Revlon tweezers.  Specifically tweezers with square tips I have not been able to find any in stores anywhere  I purchased 2 and will need to order more soon.  Thanks</li>
            <li> One of the worst tweezer I ever bought. Couldn&#x27;t pluck out a single hair. Gave up after 5min. Completely useless.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 pair of these because I have owned a pair for years that I love...but everyone in the house was borrowing them so I could never find them.  Unfortunately these are NOT the same quality at all.  The tips do not meet at the edge -- I cannot tweeze anything with them!</li>
            <li> I bought multiple tweezers when my level of frustration with a slanted-tip tweezer hit a high point.  All perform equally well, but all are straight edge.  I had a pair just like this 25 years ago which my daughter swiped when she left home for college, and had not found another pair until now (she still has the pair she took!)  These are as good as the pair which was lost.  I recommend them.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal for a very good tweezer! Revlon makes very high quality products and this is a good example of that. If you want a strong tweezer that stays in your hands easily while using them, this is the product for you!!!</li>
            <li> I just opened and tried to use the Revlon Perfectweeze, Square Tip. The new scissors tweezers does NOT work. The tweezers is so loose that couldn&#x27;t even pulled one strand of hair on the eyebrow. WASTE of MONEY. VERY DISAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li> I loved my first pair, but they were sacrificed for a worthy cause. My husband used them, at my direction, when a hotel bathroom locked malfunctioned, locking him inside. The hotel engineer couldn&#x27;t even save him, but my tweezers did. Loved those things! So multifunctional ;) However, this new pair is rough on the handle, which sort of digs into my thumb. Also, the tweezing portion doesn&#x27;t seem to have the same precision. They are so bad that I went bad to my old pair, the damaged pair. I may purchase another pair from a local store though. Just not wanting to deal with online returns.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and we were given a free night&#x27;s stay at the hotel for all the hassle.</li>
            <li> LOOOOSEY. SHAKY. SORRY.</li>
            <li> I find it difficult to find tweezers that actually clam onto hairs and these seem to do the job, would buy again.</li>
            <li> I wanted some tweezers with handles and I came across the Revlon tweezers. The tweezers are inexpensive and work well. Because they were inexpensive I bought two pair. I recommend them.</li>
            <li> I lost my pair of Tweezers so I bought these. I&#x27;m glad they still make this simple and practical product.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t get the short hairs or fine hairs.  I do not use them for plucking hairs anymore, it is too frustrating.</li>
            <li> I HATE the tweezers with the angled tips - I don&#x27;t know why, but I have an easier time with the square tip. The problem is that you cannot find them in the stores. These are very well made, and they are perfect for what I wanted. I will definitely buy them again when I need more.</li>
            <li> I like the square tip tweezers better than pointed ones.  I bought two and they were priced better than at Walmart.</li>
            <li> I had ordered a sguare tip tweezer and received a slant tip tweezer. It was not returnable.</li>
            <li> seems like a knockoff. Not remotely the quality of the Revlon one I owned previously. It&#x27;s not polished at the tips, or even finished well, so it&#x27;s sharp, and stabs. And has a really poor joint connection. It seems like it&#x27;s going to fall apart in a few uses. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the seller or the product. Awful. And not worth it to send it back, because it&#x27;s not technically defective. Totally disappointed.</li>
            <li> Made very cheaply, scratches you.</li>
            <li> I love Revlon tweezers. I prefer the angled tip slightly better, but this still gets the job done. The handles make it so much easier to get a good grip on finer hairs.</li>
            <li> So cheap, no edge to it at all.</li>
            <li> When you need a tweezer, these will work okay. They&#x27;re about the same price as can be found at Walmart though, so didn&#x27;t give them a higher recommendation.</li>
            <li> Over many years, I have had several pairs of tweezers of all values.  I love the square tip and the price was great.</li>
            <li> The tweezers came quickly and were just what I wanted. They were brand new in the package. I&#x27;m happy with this product!</li>
            <li> Still the best tweezers ever.</li>
            <li> Not as pictured cos appears to have a bend in pic but it does not bend, its straight lines like a scissors. Im throwing it away cos according to sale its &amp;#34;not available for return&amp;#34; &amp; its so cheaply made I bent it just opening the package.</li>
            <li> The package I received looks different from the picture. As a result, I judged too soon, and thought that it was ot what I wanted.  BUT, I made that decision too quickly.  Very nice Tweezers!</li>
            <li> Good tweezers.  Does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> This is great!  I am so much contented every time I use it.  I&#x27;m planning to order this again next time!  I will recommend this to my friends in the future.</li>
            <li> Finally found a &amp;#34;scissors&amp;#34; shaped tweezer with a fine enough point to do the job.  Even better than the one I&#x27;ve had for 30 years and have been trying to replace four about 10.  YEA!!</li>
            <li> These are sold where I work but even with my discount I cannot get them at this price.  Thank you Amazon.com.  As with all Revlon beauty tools, these are well made of stainless steel, have no rough edges, and are balanced perfectly to fit a woman&#x27;s hand.</li>
            <li> These were a gift for someone else, and she really likes the way they handle.  She liked the tightness of the tweezers.</li>
            <li> this is a great pair of tweezers</li>
            <li> The tweezer works like it should but I wish the metal was a little thicker. It doesn&#x27;t always keep a grasp on the hair being tweezed which slides through it some of the time.</li>
            <li> easy to use, good quality. Couldnt find the flat tip anywhere in stores, they all sell slant tip. good buy</li>
            <li> My favorite twizzers! So hard to find! Love them!</li>
            <li> Tried these because the ones I&#x27;ve been trying from the drug stores just don&#x27;t hold on to the eyebrow hairs well enough to pluck them.&lt;br /&gt;These work GREAT!  No misses.</li>
            <li> I have used t hese tweezers for years and only had to replace them as I had used them for something olther than what they were designed for! My bad!  [They don&#x27;t make good screw drivers]</li>
