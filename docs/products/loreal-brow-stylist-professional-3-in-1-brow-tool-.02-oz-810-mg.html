            <li>But all in all I think it&#x27;s great and lasted quite a while for the price!</li>
            <li>it.the tweezers are perfect size for a purse.</li>
            <li>The pencil is L&#x27;Oreal and its just not that great</li>
            <li>Great color.</li>
            <li>I thought I would try it because of the great price.  </li>
            <li>the color and texture are good.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, this is a good product.</li>
            <li>Love the built-in tools!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind because it&#x27;s very cheap</li>
            <li>The design is less than perfect, but it is a good start.</li>
            <li>It looks very good and fairly natural.</li>
            <li>I am neither overly pleased or displeased with this product.</li>
            <li>Pencil\\&quot; which is actually more a paste or crayon than powder, to color the hairs of my eyebrows as that&#x27;s the effect I want, not the artificial-looking, drawn-on-the-skin type of eyebrow.</li>
            <li>(Yeah I know - more information than you wanted.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>Over all good product but don&#x27;t like the tweezers very much.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this again.</li>
            <li>applies nicely, stays on, looks your own natural eye brow</li>
            <li>i was concerned about ordering a certain color without seeing it in person, i am glad i did, and the color was spot on.</li>
            <li>This is a very soft pencil that rubs on very smoothly.</li>
            <li>a product.&lt;br /&gt;The price was right.</li>
            <li>It also comes with tiny tweezers and those are pretty handy.</li>
            <li>I used to use Clinique eye brow pencil in Soft Blonde that i loved</li>
            <li>Super fast delivery.</li>
            <li>The tweezers do work but they are very hard to use, you are better off buying a better pair of tweezers, but the eyebrow pencil is fine.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Color is exactly like picture</li>
            <li>I first put moisturizer on the area then use the \\&quot;Brow Powder</li>
            <li>It makes your eyebrows look very defined.</li>
            <li>, minus five stars would be more like it.</li>
            <li>I find this product works very well to do just that,</li>
            <li>I got the Dark Blonde and it looks good on me.</li>
            <li>The back part of the pencil that is gold isn&#x27;t full of pigment.</li>
            <li>In this brand I bought the 351 Blonde color which is actually sort of light brown so that my eyebrows come out of the invisible category.</li>
            <li>I like the way it feels but it requires a sharpening after every use because of how soft it is.</li>
            <li>This results in it breaking off frequently.</li>
            <li>Very orange-toned for a blonde.</li>
            <li>It is hard to find a pencil with light colours, this one works.  </li>
            <li>Finally an actual blonde color for natural blondes!!</li>
            <li>(right now it&#x27;s on for a little over $1...).</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s useless for me, and I don&#x27;t use the brush, but the blonde pencil is great and is a little darker than my hair which I like</li>
            <li>I used to have a boyfriend who tweezed his until he got quite old, then it looked as though he got new eyebrows - white hair and monstrous dark red eyebrows.</li>
            <li>In fact, the whole pencil broke in half.  </li>
            <li>Matches my oddly colored brows very well.</li>

            <li> Impossible to sharpen to useable fine point; used a couple of different size sharpeners and crayon only crumbles or breaks off.</li>
            <li> This is a very soft pencil that rubs on very smoothly. I like the way it feels but it requires a sharpening after every use because of how soft it is. I don&#x27;t mind because it&#x27;s very cheap (right now it&#x27;s on for a little over $1...). The tweezers don&#x27;t grip my eyebrow hairs so it&#x27;s useless for me, and I don&#x27;t use the brush, but the blonde pencil is great and is a little darker than my hair which I like (I&#x27;m a dirty blonde).    edit, update:  I&#x27;ve had it for 4 months and it probably has another couple of months left in it. I use it almost everyday. I recently bought another in case I run out soon. But all in all I think it&#x27;s great and lasted quite a while for the price!</li>
            <li> Finally an actual blonde color for natural blondes!!</li>
            <li> I do like the eyebrow pencil and the brush. The tweezers do work but they are very hard to use, you are better off buying a better pair of tweezers, but the eyebrow pencil is fine. I got the Dark Blonde and it looks good on me. I used to use Clinique eye brow pencil in Soft Blonde that i loved but it&#x27;s expensive so i bought this instead. The eyebrow pencil is creamy like gel or a liquid eyeliner. It looks very good and fairly natural. It makes your eyebrows look very defined. Over all good product but don&#x27;t like the tweezers very much.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this again.(:</li>
            <li> the color and texture are good.  The only drawback is that you have to sharpen it.  This results in it breaking off frequently.</li>
            <li> Mine was broken when it arrived to me and it was broken inside the sealed factory package. I didn&#x27;t put up a fuss about it because I could still use it. Problem is that everytime I use it it is rough on my skin it pulls at my eyebrow hairs and skin and it takes a lot just to get a spec of color to show up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I buy it again? That would be a BIG no.</li>
            <li> It was broke in half soon as I opened it. One part wouldn&#x27;t come off the other side. If I could, I would give this a negative five star rate. Again,DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> I am neither overly pleased or displeased with this product. The design is less than perfect, but it is a good start.</li>
            <li> i was concerned about ordering a certain color without seeing it in person, i am glad i did, and the color was spot on.</li>
            <li> Very orange-toned for a blonde.</li>
            <li> The pencil was greasy, coming off on my eyebrow hairs. The company emailed me if I were not satisfied to let them know and they sent me another pencil, which was slightly less greasy. Its not their fault. The pencil is L&#x27;Oreal and its just not that great a product.&lt;br /&gt;The price was right.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  Super fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This is a piece of junk!  It can&#x27;t be sharpened because it just breaks.  In fact, the whole pencil broke in half.  The tweezer is a joke.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I didn&#x27;t have to give it one star, minus five stars would be more like it.</li>
            <li> applies nicely, stays on, looks your own natural eye brow</li>
            <li> Color is exactly like picture</li>
            <li> Great color. Love the built-in tools!</li>
            <li> Breaks when I sharpen it.</li>
            <li> Stupid product. who needs a tweezers on the other end of a brow pencil. I thought it was a brush. Stupid me!</li>
            <li> Does not last all day........and it is bit to greasy for my taste.  No comparison to CLINIQUE.  I thought I would try it because of the great price.  Just not for me.</li>
            <li> The back part of the pencil that is gold isn&#x27;t full of pigment. The actual pencil is shorter than any eyeliner I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find a pencil with light colours, this one works.  I do not need all the rest of the 3/1</li>
            <li> In this brand I bought the 351 Blonde color which is actually sort of light brown so that my eyebrows come out of the invisible category. I first put moisturizer on the area then use the \\&quot;Brow Powder Pencil\\&quot; which is actually more a paste or crayon than powder, to color the hairs of my eyebrows as that&#x27;s the effect I want, not the artificial-looking, drawn-on-the-skin type of eyebrow. I find this product works very well to do just that, I mean color the individual hairs for a natural look so I don&#x27;t look eyebrowless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product comes with a brush and a tweezer. I might use that tweezer for something else but I like my somewhat bushy eyebrows and don&#x27;t have the stomach to tweeze them anyway. Yikes. I used to have a boyfriend who tweezed his until he got quite old, then it looked as though he got new eyebrows - white hair and monstrous dark red eyebrows. (Yeah I know - more information than you wanted.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this is a good product.</li>
            <li> Matches my oddly colored brows very well. I like it. It also comes with tiny tweezers and those are pretty handy.</li>
            <li> this is my 2nd one I bought. I love it.the tweezers are perfect size for a purse.</li>
