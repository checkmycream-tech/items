            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to start up</li>

            <li>It comes with pretty much everything you need to get started, which is awesome.</li>

            <li>I had to really figure out how to get the different tools off and on</li>
            <li>With this tool I get a professional looking result at home.</li>
            <li>I  was pleasantly surprised at the amount of equipment that I received in this kit.</li>
            <li>no problems so far.</li>
            <li>I work in a factory and use a sander all day everyday and 60 grit will grind down a thick piece of plastic in no time so start of with 240 first lol,</li>

            <li> but Im sure I won&#x27;t be the only one, I burned my cuticle like a bad little rug burn</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I had to really figure out how to get the different tools off and on but once I got it, it was easy to use.</li>
            <li> more then expected great</li>
            <li> Everything met my expectations.</li>
            <li> It took me a few minutes to figure it all out and I do like it.  The only thing is I wish it would have had a longer cord.  But over all I do like it and not as powerful as I would have thought it would be but It came as it was suppose to and I enjoy it.</li>
            <li> It was everything I was hoping for! I received it 8 days after I purchased it and it got here in perfect condition with everything shown in the picture. The quality is good as well. It gets the job done and has a lot of bits. The wire is a bit short, but other than that, I loved it. I&#x27;d recommend this product for any beginner at DIY mani/pedis. 👏😄</li>
            <li> Very good. It was what i expected. I would recomend it. Although the ac adapter could have been a little longer.</li>
            <li> Works great only problem is short cord. I added an extension cord</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I was trying to do my own acrylic nails without this tool before. I would have to file for a solid week before each nail was somewhat even. With this tool I get a professional looking result at home. This thing is a life and time saver. yes it does get a little warm when I use it for a long time(more than 10 minutes) but I usually take a break in between, especially from breathing in the file shavings.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase it came with all the things shown in the picture and works great I would definitely recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> I  was pleasantly surprised at the amount of equipment that I received in this kit. There are rotary drill bits, mini sanding bands of various grits and regular nail files included. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The cord is short but product works  as descibed. changing the drill bits are a little hard to do. But overall its works good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a novice in nails but at least the plug needs to stay in the device. The drill plug is poorly made and will not stay plugged. I do not recommend.!!!</li>
            <li> Very bad instructions.  Product didn&#x27;t work as stated.</li>
            <li> no problems so far. it&#x27;s just a starter for now. I will probably order another one soon. Good for beginners.</li>
            <li> The product stoped working after just one day, I like that it camevwith so many accesories, but now I can&#x27;t use any of them.</li>
            <li> Good everything in The picture. What i have packging was fast delivery</li>
            <li> Not worth buying at all. The drill bits won&#x27;t stay in place and the charger quit working after just two uses. Just a heads up I wouldn&#x27;t spend my money on this kind of drill</li>
            <li> Great for a first time user. I am glad I got this one to practice with until I really know what I am doing and can upgrade to a more powerful one.</li>
            <li> This is n awesome deal all that for that price !! This is amazing now it feels like I have my own nail salon right in my own bedroom. Must have!!!</li>
            <li> It came pretty fast. I think that it works great and it&#x27;s very easy to use. It comes with pretty much everything you need to get started, which is awesome. You can&#x27;t beat what you are getting for the price. The only thing I wish I could change would be to make the power cord longer. Other than that, this is a great buy.</li>
            <li> Great for the price. Little tip though to get the cord to stay in unscrew the little pink bolt on the bottom it stops the plug from going all the way in</li>
            <li> I am very new at acrylics and I know this product is not nearly as professional as others but it&#x27;s perfect for at home, I have no complaints so far. I liked all the extras compared to all the other ones of this on amazon and ebay. The adapter plug is for the US unlike some others. The drill bits all do fit as well unlike what some people say, just read the directions, it&#x27;s simple. One thing I thought I warn people is that that actual sandpaper mini belts are no joke. I used a random one that came in one of the plastic cases ( not from the extras in the labeled baggies) and it hurts like h***. I obviously did not use it correctly but Im sure I won&#x27;t be the only one, I burned my cuticle like a bad little rug burn and I somehow hurt the nail itself ( underneath) may have got too hot. Those sandpaper belts come in 240 150 and 60 grit. I work in a factory and use a sander all day everyday and 60 grit will grind down a thick piece of plastic in no time so start of with 240 first lol, that&#x27;s all bc it did hurt. But that&#x27;s my fault, VERY PLEASED!</li>
            <li> I was so anxious to get my nail drill only to be disappointed when it arrived. I found that the cord had a shortage in it the first time I used it straight out of the box. I haven&#x27;t been able to start up my in home business do to this.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girl for use at work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this product,  it came super fast..  I ordered it on Saturday and it arrived here on Monday. This is my first nail drill...  I think it&#x27;s perfect for beginners like myself. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
