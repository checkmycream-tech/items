    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>and I have seen a great improvement of these marks!</li>
            <li>I think its one of the best in its category</li>
            <li>, your skin look great...</li>
            <li>Great Seller recommended 100%.</li>
            <li>Also, the the &amp;#34;Oily Skin&amp;#34; cream works great as my skin never felt oily or looked greasy at all.</li>
            <li>Love this product!!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as good as people say, I didn&#x27;t see any change whatsoever</li>
            <li>The product is good, but I ordered Oily skin, which was circled on the invoice included with the product.</li>
            <li>I have olive skin tone and am somewhat fair skin color.</li>
            <li>While it is good to use a sun screen with a product like this, I did not want one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was a great buy and glad I did too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s glowing, it&#x27;s smooth, and beautiful color.\\</li>
            <li>We all can&#x27;t avoid most cancer causing environments, products, anything!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>This cream works wonders and smells amazing</li>
            <li>Product came in a nice packaging and just in time to use.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t expect much to happen, but now I am clearly happy with this product!!</li>
            <li>Ambi is the best ever, it really works.</li>
            <li>Love Love it!</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;So while the price is great, the downside (aggravated pores) doesn&#x27;t make it worth it.</li>
            <li>So far GREAT!</li>
            <li>So far very happy with this item, goes on cleanly and not greasy, hoping it will do fade job!</li>
            <li>I love it ðŸ’›</li>
            <li>It smells okay,</li>
            <li>It looks to me as though the alpha hydroxy acids (AHA) are a relatively safe bet for evening out skin pigmentation.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always best to make informed decisions, especially when it comes to your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will admit when you have something nice, we humans have a thing of ruining something that&#x27;s going smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff, but it started to smell like garlic.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the Ambi Fade Cream, it&#x27; actually works.  </li>
            <li>It had a hole at the top of the bottle</li>
            <li>(btw, Proactiv Refining mask-sulfur treatment is the BEST overnight spot treatment for spots, and worth the price as it lasts me a whole year).</li>
            <li>When my package arrived to me I opened it to find at the top was punctured and leaking up a brown liquid.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this face cream.</li>
            <li>You will love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It does get bonus points for smelling pretty good though and it is cheaper than the products that worked for me.  </li>
            <li>The downsides are that the product leaves a greasy feel and does not have a terribly pleasant smell, but until one of the main skincare manufacturers comes up with something that leaves me feeling confident during the day, I just keep re-ordering Ambi.</li>
            <li>This product is the best for fading dark marks,i noticed results in 3 weeks :)</li>
            <li>easily, and bumps appear disrupting the even texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>The cream is actually very light and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I had a good result but after that I bought new ambi fade cream</li>
            <li>As it is, though, it goes on smoothly and easily and doesn&#x27;t make me too shiny.</li>
            <li>so often I applied this cream around them 3 times a day, (after I eat) and then in 1 week, I do notice they were fading and around my mouth was smooth.</li>
            <li>One age spot on my face disappeared after 2 weeks (light brown)</li>
            <li>If you use an alpha hydroxy acid first, you will smooth the skin and make more receptive to the Ambi.  </li>
            <li>On my 4th/5th week I can say there has been significant improvement on my blemishes.</li>
            <li>The cream isn&#x27;t sticky, it goes on smooth and absorbs quickly into your skin, it works for me.</li>
            <li>The Campaign for Safe Cosmetics has also highlighted concerns.[6]&lt;br /&gt;Numerous studies have revealed that hydroquinone can cause exogenous ochronosis, a disfiguring disease in which blue-black pigments are deposited onto the skin.[5][7]&lt;br /&gt;While using hydroquinone as lightening agent can be effective with proper use, it can also cause skin sensitivity.</li>
            <li>You might also want to see the Wikipedia article titled \\&quot;Skin Lightening\\&quot; for a good overview of safety and risks of various ingredients.</li>
            <li>Thanks for keeping your top selling techniques to satisfy a customer.</li>
            <li>I would recommend using the whole line together :)</li>
            <li>I think if I were more intentional about it, the results would be a bit more obvious.</li>
            <li>But the first thing in your mind should be is pre-caution!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it will do!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I got the kind for oily skin, because it STILL leaves a little bit of a shine, so</li>
            <li>OMG this stuff is truly amazing I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 6 days</li>
            <li>Its so light and nongreasey and absorbs into the skin very well.</li>
            <li>my face had gotten like 3 shades darker than the rest of my body; now the dark marks are fading beautifully, my skin is getting so much softer, and now I&#x27;m like just a shade away from evening out my face and neck to the rest of my body.</li>
            <li>This is not an instant blemish snapper, it takes time to work but it does deliver nice results.</li>
            <li>DO not pick your face and go through being so conscious keeping on putting more Hydroquinone</li>
            <li>Daily, diligent application is required for the cream to be effective.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin, still suffer from adult acne (more of ocassional flare-ups than widespread acne), but as a result I still lack the clear skin I would love to have.</li>
            <li>once absorbed it does not interfere with makeup at all.&lt;br /&gt;There IS an anoying smell to it</li>
            <li>worth the break outs</li>
            <li>actually am not that thrilled with the product.  </li>
            <li>Okay so even as a child I had zits and oily skin filled with blackheads starting at about age 9 or 10.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, higher concentrations (up to 4%) should be prescribed and used with caution.ng hydroquinone as lightening agent can be effective with proper use, it can also cause skin sensitivity.</li>
            <li>Unless you&#x27;re looking to smell like the cheap roses your high school boyfriend stole from Krogers for you, please don&#x27;t buy this tube of lies.</li>
            <li>Ambi fade cream is a great product for African American Women.</li>
            <li>This stuff really work !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be using this more religiously again though once the weather cools, but during the humid summer months, my face just can&#x27;t handle too many lotion-y products, so I currently only use this at night.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad they have it cheaper on amazon bc at my local drug stores its 14 bucks .</li>
            <li>Otherwise, higher concentrations (up to 4%) should be prescribed and used with caution.</li>
            <li>Made me break out the first time I used it</li>
            <li>And if u read on the back it says \\&quot;discontinue after 3 months if it doesn&#x27;t work\\&quot; in so many words.</li>
            <li>First of all, it contains sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Keeps the skin soft and blemish free</li>
            <li>I want women or men too to know that I have always had to wear foundation, whether its just a slightly tinted BB cream, full coverage non noncomedogenic (always good for sensitive acne-prone skin), or just a matte powder, ALWAYS worn because of my acne scars.</li>
            <li>Although I have heard mixed reviews -- most of which were positive, I have not noticed any change in my skin after using this product.</li>
            <li>I have dark marks on my skin from acne and this fade cream is amazing.</li>
            <li>It must be very toxic in some way.  </li>
            <li>and it really does work.  </li>
            <li>my skin looks very radient and glowing.</li>
            <li>so much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what the heck happen, but no one wants to</li>
            <li>I really recommend purchasing this product if you suffer from acne scaring or/and hyper-pigmentation.</li>
            <li>I have not begun using the product, so I can&#x27;t say much about its effectiveness or any results that seen in my skin.</li>
            <li>cost too much, get it at Walmart much cheaper...</li>
            <li>I absolutely cannot recommend this product.</li>
            <li>All I really wanted was hydroquinone</li>
            <li>But I really like this product</li>
            <li>I use the whole Ambi line.</li>
            <li>I was able to use this product for about a week before I had to give up due to the excruciating headaches it gave me.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many other creams over the years and they did not help.</li>
            <li>While Wikipedia is not the final word on anything, it&#x27;s not a bad place to start.</li>
            <li>but at least it&#x27;s a far more pleasant experience now than my previous hydroquinone product.    </li>
            <li>Ambi, on the other hand, is what I apply and it interacts with my skin (tan/olive color) in  way that manages to make my face look more energized and brighter and somehow blend in the flaws a little better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try Black Opal EVEN TRUE TRI-COMPLEX TONECORRECT FADE GEL next because I think gel might be better than cream for my skin.</li>
            <li>Spots make me look older.</li>
            <li>It seems more like this cream just prevents scars and current pimples from becoming worse, and perhaps even fades them a bit more, but it doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as the expensive doctor&#x27;s office kind I had tried before.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I like the tubes so much better than any little goopy jars.</li>
            <li>They sent Normal skin.</li>
            <li>An old doctor boyfriend told me that his mother used this stuff long term and got skin cancers where she had used it, but I thought it would be okay for short term use.  </li>
            <li>Keep out of the sun for it is very sensitive from you decreasing your melanin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had very sensitive oily skin, so when puberty hit I looked like a spokeskid for proactiv</li>
            <li>My previous experience with a hydroquinone/acne scar reduction/&#x27;bleaching&#x27; cream wasn&#x27;t the best: it was expensive and foul-smelling.</li>
            <li>Black and white bleaching cream works faster and better.</li>
            <li>I would steer clear of it.  </li>
            <li>It also does not cause my sensitive skin to flare up.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li>My wife is a professional hair dresser</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m optimistic with the changes I&#x27;ve had and for the price</li>
            <li>and it makes my skin look youthful and feeling soft.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m an adult</li>
            <li>idk im still waiting for the results it lightened it up but is not gone completely..</li>
            <li>you have to make sure u use it everyday, i use it at night only.</li>
            <li>I would recommend for those willing to commit to a product for at least 2 months for FULL results.&lt;br /&gt;**update</li>
            <li>realized after even more usuage that my skin began to be irritated and I started to develope these small white heads - after I stopped using this product - the white heads stopped ... very stange.</li>
            <li>I have had acne for years and this cream only lightens your regular skin tone making the dark spots look more pronounced.</li>
            <li>but I have very sensitive, very oily, and stubborn facial skin and only benzoyl peroxide 10% works for me</li>
            <li>Oh and you must use it every single day twice a day to see positive results consistency is the key for this particular product.</li>
            <li>Using a daily sunscreen with a high PPD (</li>
            <li>Using a daily sunscreen with a high PPD (</li>
            <li>My experience with this Fade cream is that, it really goes a long way for me</li>
            <li>Within a month you will have noticed a significant different in any dark spots you may have.  </li>
            <li>, I am oily-skinned of course, that&#x27;s why I chose this, but at first my main concern for a long time was these discolorations around my mouth where it looked like acid drooled down my lips,</li>
            <li>It generally takes 4 to six weeks to see a noticeable lightening of the area treated but here-</li>
            <li>(I have light skin, but suffered small facial-side of left cheek burns-in a car</li>
            <li>This conclusion was reached based on the extent of absorption in humans and the incidence of neoplasms in rats in several studies where adult rats were found to have increased rates of tumours, including thyroid follicular cell hyperplasias, anisokaryosis, mononuclear cell leukemia, hepatocellular adenomas and renal tubule cell ademonas.</li>
            <li>I also have somewhat sensitive skin in that my pores get irritated (instant whiteheads!)</li>
            <li>My nose is particularly sensitive and I simply cannot wear this product.</li>
            <li>I use this cream at night before going to bed and during my morning routine only on the dark spots, once absorbed I layer a 40SPF sunscreen before going with makeup and blah blah...</li>
            <li>After using many brands and products that just made the spots darker or worse</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t regard Ambi as an acne cream at all and at night, I apply a normal acne cream, but during the day, I found those other acne treatments just left my skin looking dry, dead and all flaws seemed really prominent.</li>
            <li>IDK what they&#x27;re on, you can hardly smell anything, and it smells light and flowery, no weird residue, blends in with skin after a few moments.</li>
            <li>After using for several weeks my arms developed white spots that have lasted for over one year.  </li>
            <li>I cannot wait to see what continuous use of the product will do for my skin, and another positive element that the product brought me is less acne breakouts, and my skin is smoother.</li>
            <li>I have no issue with hydroquinone despite the bad press because it is really the only effective ingedient that fades skin</li>
            <li>the really dark one is much much lighter.  </li>
            <li>The other similar products that I&#x27;ve used work much better/faster so that there is a noticeable difference after a week or so of use.  </li>
            <li>I hate seeing women with beautiful skin and mine still being oily and scarred.</li>
            <li>I really love the consistency its not to thick and not watery at all  and unlike similar  creams that have a weird smell this cream has a lovey light floral smell I truly recommend this cream</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine how bad it would be if I&#x27;d gotten the kind for normal skin.</li>
            <li>I decided to look up the main active ingredient, hydroquinone and below is an excerpt.</li>
            <li>I only used a little bit on a brown spot on my nose, but that was enough to really affect me.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product thinking \\&quot;maybe\\&quot; as there was bad and good reviews.</li>

            <li> my face had gotten like 3 shades darker than the rest of my body; now the dark marks are fading beautifully, my skin is getting so much softer, and now I&#x27;m like just a shade away from evening out my face and neck to the rest of my body.</li>
            <li> This is not an instant blemish snapper, it takes time to work but it does deliver nice results.</li>
            <li> DO not pick your face and go through being so conscious keeping on putting more Hydroquinone</li>
            <li> Daily, diligent application is required for the cream to be effective.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, still suffer from adult acne (more of ocassional flare-ups than widespread acne), but as a result I still lack the clear skin I would love to have.</li>
            <li> once absorbed it does not interfere with makeup at all.&lt;br /&gt;There IS an anoying smell to it</li>
            <li> worth the break outs</li>
            <li> actually am not that thrilled with the product.  </li>
            <li> Okay so even as a child I had zits and oily skin filled with blackheads starting at about age 9 or 10.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, higher concentrations (up to 4%) should be prescribed and used with caution.ng hydroquinone as lightening agent can be effective with proper use, it can also cause skin sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;re looking to smell like the cheap roses your high school boyfriend stole from Krogers for you, please don&#x27;t buy this tube of lies.</li>
            <li> Ambi fade cream is a great product for African American Women.</li>
            <li> This stuff really work !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be using this more religiously again though once the weather cools, but during the humid summer months, my face just can&#x27;t handle too many lotion-y products, so I currently only use this at night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad they have it cheaper on amazon bc at my local drug stores its 14 bucks .</li>
            <li> Otherwise, higher concentrations (up to 4%) should be prescribed and used with caution.</li>
            <li> Made me break out the first time I used it</li>
            <li> And if u read on the back it says \\&quot;discontinue after 3 months if it doesn&#x27;t work\\&quot; in so many words.</li>
            <li> First of all, it contains sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Keeps the skin soft and blemish free</li>
            <li> I want women or men too to know that I have always had to wear foundation, whether its just a slightly tinted BB cream, full coverage non noncomedogenic (always good for sensitive acne-prone skin), or just a matte powder, ALWAYS worn because of my acne scars.</li>
            <li> Although I have heard mixed reviews -- most of which were positive, I have not noticed any change in my skin after using this product.</li>
            <li> I have dark marks on my skin from acne and this fade cream is amazing.</li>
            <li> It must be very toxic in some way.  </li>
            <li> and it really does work.  </li>
            <li> my skin looks very radient and glowing.</li>
            <li> so much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the heck happen, but no one wants to</li>
            <li> I really recommend purchasing this product if you suffer from acne scaring or/and hyper-pigmentation.</li>
            <li> I have not begun using the product, so I can&#x27;t say much about its effectiveness or any results that seen in my skin.</li>
            <li> cost too much, get it at Walmart much cheaper...</li>
            <li> I absolutely cannot recommend this product.</li>
            <li> All I really wanted was hydroquinone</li>
            <li> But I really like this product</li>
            <li> I use the whole Ambi line.</li>
            <li> I was able to use this product for about a week before I had to give up due to the excruciating headaches it gave me.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many other creams over the years and they did not help.</li>
            <li> While Wikipedia is not the final word on anything, it&#x27;s not a bad place to start.</li>
            <li> but at least it&#x27;s a far more pleasant experience now than my previous hydroquinone product.    </li>
            <li> Ambi, on the other hand, is what I apply and it interacts with my skin (tan/olive color) in  way that manages to make my face look more energized and brighter and somehow blend in the flaws a little better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try Black Opal EVEN TRUE TRI-COMPLEX TONECORRECT FADE GEL next because I think gel might be better than cream for my skin.</li>
            <li> Spots make me look older.</li>
            <li> It seems more like this cream just prevents scars and current pimples from becoming worse, and perhaps even fades them a bit more, but it doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as the expensive doctor&#x27;s office kind I had tried before.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like the tubes so much better than any little goopy jars.</li>
            <li> They sent Normal skin.</li>
            <li> An old doctor boyfriend told me that his mother used this stuff long term and got skin cancers where she had used it, but I thought it would be okay for short term use.  </li>
            <li> Keep out of the sun for it is very sensitive from you decreasing your melanin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had very sensitive oily skin, so when puberty hit I looked like a spokeskid for proactiv</li>
            <li> My previous experience with a hydroquinone/acne scar reduction/&#x27;bleaching&#x27; cream wasn&#x27;t the best: it was expensive and foul-smelling.</li>
            <li> Black and white bleaching cream works faster and better.</li>
            <li> I would steer clear of it.  </li>
            <li> It also does not cause my sensitive skin to flare up.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li> My wife is a professional hair dresser</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m optimistic with the changes I&#x27;ve had and for the price</li>
            <li> and it makes my skin look youthful and feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m an adult</li>
            <li> idk im still waiting for the results it lightened it up but is not gone completely..</li>
            <li> you have to make sure u use it everyday, i use it at night only.</li>
            <li> I would recommend for those willing to commit to a product for at least 2 months for FULL results.&lt;br /&gt;**update</li>
            <li> realized after even more usuage that my skin began to be irritated and I started to develope these small white heads - after I stopped using this product - the white heads stopped ... very stange.</li>
            <li> I have had acne for years and this cream only lightens your regular skin tone making the dark spots look more pronounced.</li>
            <li> but I have very sensitive, very oily, and stubborn facial skin and only benzoyl peroxide 10% works for me</li>
            <li> Oh and you must use it every single day twice a day to see positive results consistency is the key for this particular product.</li>
            <li> Using a daily sunscreen with a high PPD (</li>
            <li> Using a daily sunscreen with a high PPD (</li>
            <li> My experience with this Fade cream is that, it really goes a long way for me</li>
            <li> Within a month you will have noticed a significant different in any dark spots you may have.  </li>
            <li> , I am oily-skinned of course, that&#x27;s why I chose this, but at first my main concern for a long time was these discolorations around my mouth where it looked like acid drooled down my lips,</li>
            <li> It generally takes 4 to six weeks to see a noticeable lightening of the area treated but here-</li>
            <li> (I have light skin, but suffered small facial-side of left cheek burns-in a car</li>
            <li> This conclusion was reached based on the extent of absorption in humans and the incidence of neoplasms in rats in several studies where adult rats were found to have increased rates of tumours, including thyroid follicular cell hyperplasias, anisokaryosis, mononuclear cell leukemia, hepatocellular adenomas and renal tubule cell ademonas.</li>
            <li> I also have somewhat sensitive skin in that my pores get irritated (instant whiteheads!)</li>
            <li> My nose is particularly sensitive and I simply cannot wear this product.</li>
            <li> I use this cream at night before going to bed and during my morning routine only on the dark spots, once absorbed I layer a 40SPF sunscreen before going with makeup and blah blah...</li>
            <li> After using many brands and products that just made the spots darker or worse</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t regard Ambi as an acne cream at all and at night, I apply a normal acne cream, but during the day, I found those other acne treatments just left my skin looking dry, dead and all flaws seemed really prominent.</li>
            <li> IDK what they&#x27;re on, you can hardly smell anything, and it smells light and flowery, no weird residue, blends in with skin after a few moments.</li>
            <li> After using for several weeks my arms developed white spots that have lasted for over one year.  </li>
            <li> I cannot wait to see what continuous use of the product will do for my skin, and another positive element that the product brought me is less acne breakouts, and my skin is smoother.</li>
            <li> I have no issue with hydroquinone despite the bad press because it is really the only effective ingedient that fades skin</li>
            <li> the really dark one is much much lighter.  </li>
            <li> The other similar products that I&#x27;ve used work much better/faster so that there is a noticeable difference after a week or so of use.  </li>
            <li> I hate seeing women with beautiful skin and mine still being oily and scarred.</li>
            <li> I really love the consistency its not to thick and not watery at all  and unlike similar  creams that have a weird smell this cream has a lovey light floral smell I truly recommend this cream</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine how bad it would be if I&#x27;d gotten the kind for normal skin.</li>
            <li> I decided to look up the main active ingredient, hydroquinone and below is an excerpt.</li>
            <li> I only used a little bit on a brown spot on my nose, but that was enough to really affect me.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking \\&quot;maybe\\&quot; as there was bad and good reviews.</li>
            <li> 5 stars for fading action, 1 for the cream that carries the active ingredients.</li>
            <li> It does alright on bleaching the dark marks and is much cheaper than proactiv dark spot corrector but made me break out</li>
            <li> I have not even been able to use the product because I&#x27;m afraid that it may be tainted.</li>
            <li> At the bottom of any article is a long reference list you can explore.</li>
            <li> It has done wonders for the dark spots that I have developed due to my acne scars healing.</li>
            <li> The dark spots are actually less noticeable and are clearly fading.</li>
            <li> 2 months later no change to dark spot</li>
            <li> I have black marks bc of stubbing and not goood razor blades from shaving when I was younger</li>
            <li> In the past few days of me using this, it is helping so much</li>
            <li> I just cant stop, therefore as a result I have a lot of scaring especially around the hairline, sideburns, and chin, and a few on my nose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while..and seen a difference at first, then it seemed as if my dark spots was getting worse.</li>
            <li> As it is, I feel like it helps prevent current pimples from become horribly dark marks, but the dark dark marks I&#x27;ve had forever from cystic acne as a teenager are still visible.</li>
            <li> In the United States, topical treatments usually contain up to 2% in hydroquinone.</li>

            <li> Worked on some discoloration I had on my cheeks due to shaving, my girlfriend recommended it to me, and I have to say it works.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll just use the cream on my forehead every other day.</li>
            <li> Ambi works extremely well for dark spots and patches.  </li>
            <li> The stars assigned for this review are my version of an average.</li>
            <li> remove some dark spots from sun damage and freckles that have begun to cluster on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> give 3 starts because my dark spots have not gone yet</li>
            <li> I use it to fade scars, and when I notice a dark spot somewhere.</li>
            <li> I had dark spots on my legs and ambi cleared them up.</li>
            <li> It does appear to be fading the dark spots.</li>
            <li> Clears the dark spots.</li>
            <li> made this video after doctor recommended that I use Ambi for my dark spots.</li>
            <li> but slowly and does not entirely remove dark areas.</li>
            <li> However after 1 month I notices SOME fading, the dark spots around my eyes are not as dark as they used to be, hence are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Overall, I have no complaints about this product, and I will be using it on my stretch marks I have on my sides from excessive weight gain yaay for me!</li>
            <li> , however, instructions say to give it 3 months before completly give up, and in that case it would only mean that I need a mor concentrated (AKA dermatologically prescribed) product.  </li>
            <li> In about 2 weeks, my skin looked like it had a blur like everything is in a mirage with my other dark spots from pimple trouble.  </li>
            <li> $ less on amazon</li>
            <li> 2006, the United States Food and Drug Administration revoked its previous approval of hydroquinone and proposed a ban on all over-the-counter preparations.[5]</li>
            <li> Another down side to it was that a smelled just a little</li>
            <li> I takes an awful long time to work (like many months), so you must be diligent.</li>
            <li> I hope to still use it for a little longer too.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works a little but not as well as I hoped.</li>
            <li> Takes a few weeks, but be patient.  </li>
            <li> (Remember, \\&quot;carcinogenic\\&quot; and \\&quot;neoplasms\\&quot; are terms associated with cancer, and skin cancer can be deadly.)</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years now.</li>
            <li> version because I have combination skin (dry cheeks-oily T-zone) and thought it would be less greasy and irritating.</li>
            <li> I only use it at night because it sits on my face weird</li>
            <li> I am seeing some small bumps on my forehead, so I stopped one day and they&#x27;ve already cleared up.</li>
            <li> Instead, Ambi fade cream is crazy cheap and doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all.</li>
            <li> I would recommend people to at least give it a try.</li>
            <li> Even with regular cleansing (religious about this), toner to close pores, and weekly exfoliating, my pores reacted very badly to this</li>
            <li> I mean..</li>
            <li> but the worse part was that I broke out a little too!</li>
            <li> and she had a very hard time finding this product.</li>
            <li> and I bought a &amp;#34;lightening cream&amp;#34; with all kinds of extra crap.</li>
            <li> After 2 months I did see the dark spots on my face start to fade, but my face also broke out so badly that I had to stop using the product.</li>
            <li> I guess I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> weird smell, but l like it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Further, Porcelana created faster results and doesn&#x27;t smell bad.....</li>
            <li> I suffer with acne and have gotten into the bad habit of popping my pimples</li>
            <li> my acne was so bad.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed by product.</li>
            <li> No bueno :(</li>
            <li> Now I hate it.</li>
            <li> I had terrible sun damage on the lower part of my face, and some on my forehead as well.  </li>
            <li> It smells terrible.</li>
            <li> This made me break out terribly</li>
            <li> Why oh why do all creams and beauty products have some awful perfume to them.</li>
            <li> Perfumes are terrible for the skin and nose.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff really work ! Omg. Within two weeks my darks spots started to lighten up ! I love it ðŸ’›</li>
            <li> I bought this fade cream because I needed a cream that would help even out my skin without breaking me out. I use it on my face and neck. After 8 weeks of rigorous use, I noticed a humongous difference. my face had gotten like 3 shades darker than the rest of my body; now the dark marks are fading beautifully, my skin is getting so much softer, and now I&#x27;m like just a shade away from evening out my face and neck to the rest of my body. This product does not control oil nor does it stop your face from getting oily while you have it on.  It smells okay, it&#x27;s not anything that wouldn&#x27;t go away if you washed it. The cream isn&#x27;t sticky, it goes on smooth and absorbs quickly into your skin, it works for me. I know it prolly wouldn&#x27;t work for everyone but I have very sensitive, very oily, and stubborn facial skin and only benzoyl peroxide 10% works for me but it dries up my skin so I&#x27;m glaaaad I found this product. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> so ive used this product for about 2 weeks. i have to say its doing the job. ive never had acne problems and not almost at 30 this happened,. maybe stres or diet i dont know but i needed something to work. after readin reviews i decided to go for it.  you have to make sure u use it everyday, i use it at night only.</li>
            <li> I was able to use this product for about a week before I had to give up due to the excruciating headaches it gave me.  I only used a little bit on a brown spot on my nose, but that was enough to really affect me.  About a week later, I did see that it had faded my brown spot, so it does work, I just couldn&#x27;t deal with the headaches.  It must be very toxic in some way.  I would steer clear of it.  An old doctor boyfriend told me that his mother used this stuff long term and got skin cancers where she had used it, but I thought it would be okay for short term use.  I guess I was wrong.  I am trying the Niacin products now, and so far, no headaches or anything alarming.</li>
            <li> I picked this stuff up at the dollar store for $4.50.  Started using it for my sun spots and it really does work.  Takes a few weeks, but be patient.  It also does not cause my sensitive skin to flare up.  And you can&#x27;t beat the price.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It  works just as it said. I hope to still use it for a little longer too.&lt;br /&gt;It was a great buy and glad I did too.</li>
            <li> My previous experience with a hydroquinone/acne scar reduction/&#x27;bleaching&#x27; cream wasn&#x27;t the best: it was expensive and foul-smelling. Instead, Ambi fade cream is crazy cheap and doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all. I&#x27;m really glad I got the kind for oily skin, because it STILL leaves a little bit of a shine, so I can&#x27;t imagine how bad it would be if I&#x27;d gotten the kind for normal skin. As it is, though, it goes on smoothly and easily and doesn&#x27;t make me too shiny. It&#x27;s too soon to know yet how well it&#x27;s working (you&#x27;re supposed to wait two months before evaluating results) but at least it&#x27;s a far more pleasant experience now than my previous hydroquinone product.    update: I&#x27;ve been using this (I&#x27;ll admit though, not religiously) for several months. I only use it once a day, not twice. I think if I were more intentional about it, the results would be a bit more obvious. As it is, I feel like it helps prevent current pimples from become horribly dark marks, but the dark dark marks I&#x27;ve had forever from cystic acne as a teenager are still visible. It seems more like this cream just prevents scars and current pimples from becoming worse, and perhaps even fades them a bit more, but it doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as the expensive doctor&#x27;s office kind I had tried before. I&#x27;ll be using this more religiously again though once the weather cools, but during the humid summer months, my face just can&#x27;t handle too many lotion-y products, so I currently only use this at night.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 months now in my bikini area bc I have black marks bc of stubbing and not goood razor blades from shaving when I was younger and now ive been living with the consequences .... this product works miracles! I&#x27;ve heard about it on tv I haven&#x27;t tried any of the soaps . I&#x27;m glad they have it cheaper on amazon bc at my local drug stores its 14 bucks . 10 $ less on amazon I&#x27;m sold !</li>
            <li> While Wikipedia is not the final word on anything, it&#x27;s not a bad place to start. Even my pharmacology professor uses it for drug research. At the bottom of any article is a long reference list you can explore. I decided to look up the main active ingredient, hydroquinone and below is an excerpt. (Remember, \\&quot;carcinogenic\\&quot; and \\&quot;neoplasms\\&quot; are terms associated with cancer, and skin cancer can be deadly.) You might also want to see the Wikipedia article titled \\&quot;Skin Lightening\\&quot; for a good overview of safety and risks of various ingredients. It looks to me as though the alpha hydroxy acids (AHA) are a relatively safe bet for evening out skin pigmentation. I have blotches too, so I know what it&#x27;s like. It&#x27;s always best to make informed decisions, especially when it comes to your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excerpt from Wikipedia on \\&quot;Hydroquinone\\&quot;: In human medicine, hydroquinone is used as a topical application in skin whitening to reduce the color of skin as it does not have the same predisposition to cause dermatitis as metol does. This use is banned in some countries, including the member states of the European Union under Directive 76/768/EEC:1976.[3][4]&lt;br /&gt;In 2006, the United States Food and Drug Administration revoked its previous approval of hydroquinone and proposed a ban on all over-the-counter preparations.[5] The FDA stated that hydroquinone cannot be ruled out as a potential carcinogen. This conclusion was reached based on the extent of absorption in humans and the incidence of neoplasms in rats in several studies where adult rats were found to have increased rates of tumours, including thyroid follicular cell hyperplasias, anisokaryosis, mononuclear cell leukemia, hepatocellular adenomas and renal tubule cell ademonas. The Campaign for Safe Cosmetics has also highlighted concerns.[6]&lt;br /&gt;Numerous studies have revealed that hydroquinone can cause exogenous ochronosis, a disfiguring disease in which blue-black pigments are deposited onto the skin.[5][7]&lt;br /&gt;While using hydroquinone as lightening agent can be effective with proper use, it can also cause skin sensitivity. Using a daily sunscreen with a high PPD (persistent pigment darkening) rating reduces the risk of further damage. Hydroquinone is sometimes combined with alpha hydroxy acids that exfoliate the skin to quicken the lightening process. In the United States, topical treatments usually contain up to 2% in hydroquinone. Otherwise, higher concentrations (up to 4%) should be prescribed and used with caution.ng hydroquinone as lightening agent can be effective with proper use, it can also cause skin sensitivity.

In the United States, topical treatments usually contain up to 2% in hydroquinone. Otherwise, higher concentrations (up to 4%) should be prescribed and used with caution.</li>
            <li> I would recommend buying from this person. Product came in a nice packaging and just in time to use. Thanks for keeping your top selling techniques to satisfy a customer.</li>
            <li> Although I have heard mixed reviews -- most of which were positive, I have not noticed any change in my skin after using this product.</li>
            <li> Worked on some discoloration I had on my cheeks due to shaving, my girlfriend recommended it to me, and I have to say it works.</li>
            <li> This product works! but slowly and does not entirely remove dark areas. It evens out skin tone making for a clearer complexion.</li>
            <li> After using many brands and products that just made the spots darker or worse I purchased this. On my 4th/5th week I can say there has been significant improvement on my blemishes. I had some on both my cheeks. They are *almost* completly gone and my skin looks very radient and glowing. I am hoping that with continued usuage my blemishes will be completly gone. This is not an instant blemish snapper, it takes time to work but it does deliver nice results. I would recommend for those willing to commit to a product for at least 2 months for FULL results.&lt;br /&gt;**update&lt;br /&gt;I realized after even more usuage that my skin began to be irritated and I started to develope these small white heads - after I stopped using this product - the white heads stopped ... very stange. It does deliver results but I suggest if you purchase this item use it with caution!</li>
            <li> I had terrible sun damage on the lower part of my face, and some on my forehead as well.  I&#x27;ve been using this product twice a day for about a month, and people are starting to notice how well this has worked!!</li>
            <li> My experience with this Fade cream is that, it really goes a long way for me, I am oily-skinned of course, that&#x27;s why I chose this, but at first my main concern for a long time was these discolorations around my mouth where it looked like acid drooled down my lips, so often I applied this cream around them 3 times a day, (after I eat) and then in 1 week, I do notice they were fading and around my mouth was smooth. In about 2 weeks, my skin looked like it had a blur like everything is in a mirage with my other dark spots from pimple trouble.  Then in a month I haven&#x27;t had acne problems because of this, and my mother looked at me while I was having a conversation with her and she got quiet while noticing my complexion. She goes \\&quot;Wow, your skin look great... It&#x27;s glowing, it&#x27;s smooth, and beautiful color.\\&quot; I didn&#x27;t know so I looked in the mirror and started to be self-conscious about my skin. I will admit when you have something nice, we humans have a thing of ruining something that&#x27;s going smoothly.  DO not pick your face and go through being so conscious keeping on putting more Hydroquinone, I know that it&#x27;s a cancerous chemical bleach, but it depends on how you use it well. Keep out of the sun for it is very sensitive from you decreasing your melanin. We all can&#x27;t avoid most cancer causing environments, products, anything! But the first thing in your mind should be is pre-caution!</li>
            <li> This product is the best for fading dark marks,i noticed results in 3 weeks :)</li>
            <li> I tried the cream for a couple days, maybe a week. But I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell. It smells terrible. I had to mix it with another lotion to tolerate the smell.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as good as people say, I didn&#x27;t see any change whatsoever, so I went to the store and bought Porcelana. (daytime cream with suncreen). I like Porcelana  so much better.&lt;br /&gt;Further, Porcelana created faster results and doesn&#x27;t smell bad..... So NO, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend Ambi. (I have light skin, but suffered small facial-side of left cheek burns-in a car accident.)&lt;br /&gt; If I don&#x27;t use a fade cream, the scars &amp; darkness reappears, so for me, Porcelana works for my purpose, Ambi didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I like it because its for oily skin</li>
            <li> Item as promised. Fast shipping. Great Seller recommended 100%. Thank you.</li>
            <li> The product does as advertised. It generally takes 4 to six weeks to see a noticeable lightening of the area treated but here-in lies the rub (pun intended). Daily, diligent application is required for the cream to be effective. Upon stopping the treatment the spot will reappear, keep in mind to always have some on hand to keep the blemishes at bay.</li>
            <li> Made me break out the first time I used it and now I never want to use it again. Also not too fond of the smell.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, but it started to smell like garlic. I don&#x27;t know what the heck happen, but no one wants to but dang garlic lotion on their face</li>
            <li> My wife is a professional hair dresser and she had a very hard time finding this product. Thank you Amazon. U guys/women ROCK! ðŸ˜‰</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the Ambi Fade Cream, it&#x27; actually works.  Within a month you will have noticed a significant different in any dark spots you may have.  Also, the the &amp;#34;Oily Skin&amp;#34; cream works great as my skin never felt oily or looked greasy at all.</li>
            <li> It had a hole at the top of the bottle</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years now. I have oily skin, still suffer from adult acne (more of ocassional flare-ups than widespread acne), but as a result I still lack the clear skin I would love to have. I don&#x27;t regard Ambi as an acne cream at all and at night, I apply a normal acne cream, but during the day, I found those other acne treatments just left my skin looking dry, dead and all flaws seemed really prominent. Ambi, on the other hand, is what I apply and it interacts with my skin (tan/olive color) in  way that manages to make my face look more energized and brighter and somehow blend in the flaws a little better. The downsides are that the product leaves a greasy feel and does not have a terribly pleasant smell, but until one of the main skincare manufacturers comes up with something that leaves me feeling confident during the day, I just keep re-ordering Ambi.</li>
            <li> The stars assigned for this review are my version of an average. Here is why:&lt;br /&gt;Since a minimum of 3 months is the standard in order to see results, I didn&#x27;t expect anything just yet. However,I have been using this product for 1 week, and have begun to see results already. I bought it to diminish/ remove some dark spots from sun damage and freckles that have begun to cluster on my cheeks. The dark spots are actually less noticeable and are clearly fading. No luck on the freckles yet, but it has only been 7 days. I have no issue with hydroquinone despite the bad press because it is really the only effective ingedient that fades skin discoloration.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the &amp;#34;for oily skin&amp;#34; version because I have combination skin (dry cheeks-oily T-zone) and thought it would be less greasy and irritating. The cream is actually very light and absorbs quickly. I don&#x27;t have acne-prone skin at all. I get occasional red spots on my chin around my period, but that&#x27;s it (btw, Proactiv Refining mask-sulfur treatment is the BEST overnight spot treatment for spots, and worth the price as it lasts me a whole year). I also have somewhat sensitive skin in that my pores get irritated (instant whiteheads!) easily, and bumps appear disrupting the even texture of my skin. That said, Ambi is a nightmare on pores! Even with regular cleansing (religious about this), toner to close pores, and weekly exfoliating, my pores reacted very badly to this product.&lt;br /&gt;So while the price is great, the downside (aggravated pores) doesn&#x27;t make it worth it. 5 stars for fading action, 1 for the cream that carries the active ingredients. I&#x27;m going to try Black Opal EVEN TRUE TRI-COMPLEX TONECORRECT FADE GEL next because I think gel might be better than cream for my skin.</li>
            <li> Ambi fade cream is a great product for African American Women. It has done wonders for the dark spots that I have developed due to my acne scars healing. I have been using it for about 10 days and I have seen a great improvement of these marks! I cannot wait to see what continuous use of the product will do for my skin, and another positive element that the product brought me is less acne breakouts, and my skin is smoother. Love Love it! Oh and you must use it every single day twice a day to see positive results consistency is the key for this particular product. Overall, I have no complaints about this product, and I will be using it on my stretch marks I have on my sides from excessive weight gain yaay for me!</li>
            <li> I have been using this fading cream for a month now. I did not have the results some people had in 1 week. Maybe because my spots have some &amp;#34;hormonal&amp;#34; background on them (pregnancy). However after 1 month I notices SOME fading, the dark spots around my eyes are not as dark as they used to be, hence are less noticeable. That said, I still see them. I use this cream at night before going to bed and during my morning routine only on the dark spots, once absorbed I layer a 40SPF sunscreen before going with makeup and blah blah... once absorbed it does not interfere with makeup at all.&lt;br /&gt;There IS an anoying smell to it but after 2 min it goes away.&lt;br /&gt;I give 3 starts because my dark spots have not gone yet, however, instructions say to give it 3 months before completly give up, and in that case it would only mean that I need a mor concentrated (AKA dermatologically prescribed) product.  So far I&#x27;m optimistic with the changes I&#x27;ve had and for the price I would recommend people to at least give it a try.</li>
            <li> 2 months later no change to dark spot</li>
            <li> I suffer with acne and have gotten into the bad habit of popping my pimples I just cant stop, therefore as a result I have a lot of scaring especially around the hairline, sideburns, and chin, and a few on my nose. So I decided to purchase AMBI and see whether it would help in fading out the scars. OMG this stuff is truly amazing I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 6 days and Ive already seen results. Its so light and nongreasey and absorbs into the skin very well. I really recommend purchasing this product if you suffer from acne scaring or/and hyper-pigmentation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of this for years. I use it to fade scars, and when I notice a dark spot somewhere. It lightens gradually enough so you know when to stop. Its also a big tube, so it last a while.</li>
            <li> Used this product faithfully twice a day. After 2 months I did see the dark spots on my face start to fade, but my face also broke out so badly that I had to stop using the product.</li>
            <li> I have not begun using the product, so I can&#x27;t say much about its effectiveness or any results that seen in my skin. I can say however, that the service of this distributor is subpar. When my package arrived to me I opened it to find at the top was punctured and leaking up a brown liquid. I have not even been able to use the product because I&#x27;m afraid that it may be tainted.</li>
            <li> One age spot on my face disappeared after 2 weeks (light brown) the really dark one is much much lighter.  Didn&#x27;t expect much to happen, but now I am clearly happy with this product!!</li>
            <li> cost too much, get it at Walmart much cheaper...</li>
            <li> I have had acne for years and this cream only lightens your regular skin tone making the dark spots look more pronounced. Stopped using after a month.</li>
            <li> It works, but you have to be patient.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin glow! I will never go without!</li>
            <li> I have tried many other creams over the years and they did not help. Ambi is the best ever, it really works. I had dark spots on my legs and ambi cleared them up. Consistency is the key.</li>
            <li> After using for several weeks my arms developed white spots that have lasted for over one year.  Never use and go out in the sun.  I regret using this product.  Spots make me look older.</li>
            <li> This made me break out terribly and I didn&#x27;t notice a difference after a month.&lt;br /&gt;No worth the break outs</li>
            <li> It does alright on bleaching the dark marks and is much cheaper than proactiv dark spot corrector but made me break out</li>
            <li> Ambi works extremely well for dark spots and patches.  If you use an alpha hydroxy acid first, you will smooth the skin and make more receptive to the Ambi.  Please DO wear sunblock all the time. I keep a spray can of Neutrogena in the car.  I find that the smell fades in about 10 minutes.  I use the formula for oily skin and get no break outs. Reduces Rosacea.  Use on elbows, hands, legs, aging skin between the breasts and on upper chest. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like about any fade creme is that it can stain clothing.  And that is the thing that keeps me breaking the regime.  I like the tubes so much better than any little goopy jars.</li>
            <li> Cheaper at corner drug store by a couple of bucks, but that is my problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually am not that thrilled with the product.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything.  The other similar products that I&#x27;ve used work much better/faster so that there is a noticeable difference after a week or so of use.  This doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything.  It does get bonus points for smelling pretty good though and it is cheaper than the products that worked for me.  Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> The product is good, but I ordered Oily skin, which was circled on the invoice included with the product. They sent Normal skin. I kept it because I wanted to get started with the treatment. I was disappointed. It does appear to be fading the dark spots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while..and seen a difference at first, then it seemed as if my dark spots was getting worse. And if u read on the back it says \\&quot;discontinue after 3 months if it doesn&#x27;t work\\&quot; in so many words. Sooo...I mean..I guess everyone is different though.</li>
            <li> I use this product to even out my skin tone and get rid of my tan. I only have been using this for a week and when I put it on in 3 days I saw my skin tone evening out and my tan disappearing.  When I used this after a swimming tan my tan went away the next day! Love it!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed by product. I have olive skin tone and am somewhat fair skin color. I used product nightly for over a month and didn&#x27;t see any results to some of the brown spots I have. Another down side to it was that a smelled just a little but the worse part was that I broke out a little too! No bueno :(</li>
            <li> I only use it at night because it sits on my face weird but it works.</li>
            <li> Love this product!! I have been using ambi for a  while now and it makes my skin look youthful and feeling soft. I even have my teenage daughters using it up. I can&#x27;t keep it around. Clears the dark spots.</li>
            <li> weird smell, but l like it.</li>
            <li> Before 2012, I was used to use this ambi fAde cream. I had a good result but after that I bought new ambi fade cream it does pigmented my skin for over time I use. It does work like the way I used before. Now I hate it. I think the company changed the ingredient of the ambi fade cream. Therefore it&#x27;s no longer working on my skin I guess. Becareful!!! So I do not recommend .</li>
            <li> I absolutely cannot recommend this product. First of all, it contains sunscreen. While it is good to use a sun screen with a product like this, I did not want one. Sunscreens are oily and make me break out like nothing else. I have resolved to wearing hats for sun protection and giant sunglasses. The product should have been labeled &amp;#34;hydroquinone with sunscreen&amp;#34;. There is no mention of a sunscreen in the product in the description here.&lt;br /&gt;Second, the smell. Why oh why do all creams and beauty products have some awful perfume to them. Perfumes are terrible for the skin and nose. My nose is particularly sensitive and I simply cannot wear this product. I applied a tiny smear to my forehead and I had to wash my face within five minutes because I was getting a headache from the smell. Horrid.&lt;br /&gt;I suppose i am at fault some here. All I really wanted was hydroquinone and I bought a &amp;#34;lightening cream&amp;#34; with all kinds of extra crap. I threw this stuff out. Unless you&#x27;re looking to smell like the cheap roses your high school boyfriend stole from Krogers for you, please don&#x27;t buy this tube of lies.</li>
            <li> Okay so even as a child I had zits and oily skin filled with blackheads starting at about age 9 or 10. I&#x27;ve always had very sensitive oily skin, so when puberty hit I looked like a spokeskid for proactiv my acne was so bad. Nothing worked to help minimize the pimples, so I popped a lot of them OOPS. Now that I&#x27;m an adult I hate seeing women with beautiful skin and mine still being oily and scarred. I bought this product thinking \\&quot;maybe\\&quot; as there was bad and good reviews. So far GREAT! I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day, and I can already see my skin getting brighter, and my scars are fading after only 4 days!!!! I am seeing some small bumps on my forehead, so I stopped one day and they&#x27;ve already cleared up. I think I&#x27;ll just use the cream on my forehead every other day. I want women or men too to know that I have always had to wear foundation, whether its just a slightly tinted BB cream, full coverage non noncomedogenic (always good for sensitive acne-prone skin), or just a matte powder, ALWAYS worn because of my acne scars. In the past few days of me using this, it is helping so much I don&#x27;t even check my foundation anymore during the day! Hopefully soon enough I won&#x27;t have to wear any at all. (A girl can dream) But I really like this product, some women say it smells funky? IDK what they&#x27;re on, you can hardly smell anything, and it smells light and flowery, no weird residue, blends in with skin after a few moments. I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> http://youtu.be/2W6Fx3btoVY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made this video after doctor recommended that I use Ambi for my dark spots. I will have before and after videos showing the results I get with Ambi.[[ASIN:B000GD92PU Ambi Skincare Fade Cream, Oily Skin, 2 oz (57 g)]]</li>
            <li> def worked for a acne scar,,any otha scar idk im still waiting for the results it lightened it up but is not gone completely..im a keep using and hope for betta results</li>
            <li> So far very happy with this item, goes on cleanly and not greasy, hoping it will do fade job!</li>
            <li> It works a little but not as well as I hoped. Black and white bleaching cream works faster and better.</li>
            <li> Keeps the skin soft and blemish free</li>
            <li> This cream works wonders and smells amazing I really love the consistency its not to thick and not watery at all  and unlike similar  creams that have a weird smell this cream has a lovey light floral smell I truly recommend this cream I think its one of the best in its category</li>
            <li> I takes an awful long time to work (like many months), so you must be diligent.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this face cream. I have been using it for about 3 years now. I stopped using it for awhile and saw a drastic change in my skin. I started back using it and use it every morning and night. I have dark marks on my skin from acne and this fade cream is amazing. It does exactly what it says it will do! Takes about two weeks to see a difference in your skin. I use the whole Ambi line. You will love this stuff. I would recommend using the whole line together :)</li>
