            <li>I usually love the Escada fragrances from this line.</li>

            <li>So glad I can find it on here and get if for much cheaper than the department stores had me paying!  &lt;</li>
            <li>I am so excited to have found it here</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite perfume ever!</li>
            <li>I bought this back in 2008, and loved the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Which is how I learned to pair them with my own natural scents.</li>
            <li>and it was shipped quickly and arrived packed</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as fresh &amp; sweet like the others.</li>
            <li>I see the price here has become MUCH more reasonable since my first review.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;ll help u pick the right fragrances.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume and will continue ordering it from this merchant as long as it is available thank you AAA perfume merchant</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick and the product is the \\&quot;real deal.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I wore this today and really enjoyed the tiny wafts of it all day , just right for the office.</li>
            <li>U should try to get to know your own type of natural smell from various parts of your body &amp; tie them together to have your own personal scent profile.</li>
            <li>So far it has been working fine for me</li>
            <li>I have been buying it since it first came out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my first time using this perfume, but my first time buying it from here</li>
            <li>This is my second review if a different size bottle of this cologne and it smells great but is very scarce.</li>
            <li>I can actually smell this after I put it on for awhile (unlike most things I&#x27;ve tried).  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t find this perfume in any stores, thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>and it shipped fast!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>less than half the cost was awesome.</li>
            <li>I like certain notes in fragrances.</li>
            <li>the shipping was soooo fast</li>
            <li>She loves it and thanks me</li>
            <li>and I am so amazed with how much money</li>
            <li>With this purchase, the spray was light to almost like it did not spray on me and the scent was not quite the same...</li>
            <li>This was better than expected and 100% authentic.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a generic, sweet-</li>
            <li>Could not find Moonsparkle without the $ being sky high.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>It smells good enough to eat and last long on my skin!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my everyday favorite.</li>
            <li>There are some perfumes that are worth big money-</li>
            <li>With the one I use to buy at the department stores I use to spray 2x and would last me the entire day and the spray was strong.</li>
            <li>She dearly loves it, says it&#x27;s right up there with a big fattening desert rating.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying a new scent for 2011 and this is the one I&#x27;ve selected because it&#x27;s not overpowering</li>
            <li>On Amazon, I found the exact same size of bottle for $42!!!</li>
            <li>the cost of what I paid for the perfume nearly a year ago at a uppity department store.  </li>
            <li>Moon Sparkle smells a bit uninviting &amp; almost masculine.</li>
            <li>You can wear it anywhere as it is not too loud or offensive.</li>
            <li>I had some when it first came out and had trouble finding it again at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>My natural smell releases sweetness ( no arrogance; only truth) resembling raspberry &amp; strawberry.</li>
            <li>I can barely smell it</li>
            <li>It seems as though it is an imitation of the real Moon Sparkle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so hard to find now at a reasonable price!!</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find now at a reasonable price!!</li>
            <li> like it was diluted and not last very long.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume in the entire world, sadly it seems there are only a few left.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this perfume for a long time ...</li>
            <li> She has been searching for this perfume for over a year now while trying to squeeze out any last remaining drops from her empty bottle.</li>
            <li> I beleive it was the 2007 Limited Edition.</li>
            <li> Other sellers over priced this product.</li>
            <li> but I do wonder if it is watered down.</li>
            <li> it (w/free shipping) for nerely half</li>
            <li> I previously bought this for USD90.00 at a retail store so to get it for</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stupid expensive now compared to what it was when it first came out, but to me, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> So the barginista in me did a little research to see if I could get my hands on it online.  </li>
            <li> I wear it almost everyday, and I always get compliments.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for this scent for a few years.  </li>

            <li> Could not find Moonsparkle without the $ being sky high. Was so happy to see it back on Amazon. It&#x27;s my everyday favorite.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Escada Moonsparkle.  It is perfect girly light grown up version of cotton candy.  Everytime I wear it, I&#x27;m asked about it.  I was down to merely fumes when I learned the scent had been discontinued. So the barginista in me did a little research to see if I could get my hands on it online.  A came aross it (w/free shipping) for nerely half the cost of what I paid for the perfume nearly a year ago at a uppity department store.  I could buy two for the price of one.  At that rate, it was worth waiting 4 days (ordered on a Thursday afternoon, received Monday)!  Item packaged well and as described.  Give it a try, you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Its smells nice in the bottle but not when you smell like it.Some guys will like it, the guy who bought it for me couldnt stop smelling it.</li>
            <li> Authentic product. Very sweet frag, reminds me of grape bubble yum. If really sweet girly scents are your thing, you&#x27;ll definitely enjoy this. Good staying power for an EDT.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product expecting to wait 6 days but i got it in 3 days!!! the shipping was soooo fast i am very pleased with this seller. As far as the product goes it IS 100% authentic!!! and at such a great price who wouldnt order agian?? I love this perfume and will continue ordering it from this merchant as long as it is available thank you AAA perfume merchant, i couldn&#x27;t ask for a better seller or perfume!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this fragrance as a gift for my 18 year old granddaughter, who is the world&#x27;s best critic on fragrances.  If you don&#x27;t believe me, just ask her!  She dearly loves it, says it&#x27;s right up there with a big fattening desert rating.</li>
            <li> Delicious cotton candy smell...light and fruity! I think this scent has been discontinued so I had to jump on getting another bottle.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this perfume! I have been buying it since it first came out. The scent is so light and airy. Since it is not sold in department stores anymore I always buy it from Amazon. You can&#x27;t beat the prices!</li>
            <li> My daughter requested this as a birthday gift, and Amazon&#x27;s seller had the best price by far, waaaaay better than department stores. Delivery was quick and the product is the \\&quot;real deal.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I bought this as wedding gift for a friend.  She loves it and thanks me everytime i talk to her.  Highly recommended</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not my first time using this perfume, but my first time buying it from here and I am so amazed with how much money I saved!Shipment was really fast and product&#x27;s in excellent condition when i received it. Keep up the good work! I am surely going to get another one!</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite perfume ever! I am allergic to a lot of scents and this one does not bother me.  I get numerous compliments on this fragrance.  I can no longer find it in stores, so this was a pleasant surprise!  So glad I can find it on here and get if for much cheaper than the department stores had me paying!  &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying a new scent for 2011 and this is the one I&#x27;ve selected because it&#x27;s not overpowering and I can use it  every day.</li>
            <li> very happy with my purchase.  difficult to find item and it was shipped quickly and arrived packed well.  would buy it again from same co. through Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume in the entire world, sadly it seems there are only a few left. The product arrived promptly and as described.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my granddaughter who \\&quot;suggested\\&quot; it as a gift idea.     I later asked what she thought of it, and she replied, \\&quot;Fantastic!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I have been after this for a while. I have ordered this before with no prevails, this time it was wonderful to be able to get my wife what she wanted!</li>
            <li> I had wanted this perfume for a while, but never bought it because it was too expensive. However, this price is probably the best one out there for its size. Love the perfume! I wear it almost everyday, and I always get compliments.</li>
            <li> When this item was in department stores, I bought and used it a lot and have been looking for it. Now that I found it, it is not the same. The scent is not quite there. It seems as though it is an imitation of the real Moon Sparkle. With the one I use to buy at the department stores I use to spray 2x and would last me the entire day and the spray was strong. With this purchase, the spray was light to almost like it did not spray on me and the scent was not quite the same...like it was diluted and not last very long. I&#x27;m a little disappointed since I have been looking for this product since they came out of season on the shelves of the department stores.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite perfume of all time!!! I beleive it was the 2007 Limited Edition. I received it as a gift for either my birthday or Christmas. My parents got me the lotion/perfume set! Love it! Well....the 3.3 oz by itself was $85!! On Amazon, I found the exact same size of bottle for $42!!! I just love a good deal or bargain!</li>
            <li> This is my second review if a different size bottle of this cologne and it smells great but is very scarce.</li>
            <li> I bought this back in 2008, and loved the fragrance. I was very happy to see Escada made it available once again. Definitely a sexy, and flirty fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love this scent on my girl. Smells so good I&#x27;d eat her if I could lol Great for the summer time</li>
            <li> This was discontinued so I haven&#x27;t been able to find it anywhere...until now. This was better than expected and 100% authentic.&lt;br /&gt;Great purchase.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this perfume! It&#x27;s my favorite scent! A fruity blend with just enough of a hint of grown up to be acceptable for women &amp; teens! It&#x27;s so hard to find now at a reasonable price!! I miss it &amp; want it!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing! !!! I love this and I&#x27;m so grateful you sell it on here!! Thanks!!! No complaints!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents. Very sweet scent.  I had been looking for this scent for a few years.  I was so happy to find it again at a good price.</li>
            <li> I can actually smell this after I put it on for awhile (unlike most things I&#x27;ve tried).  It is very nice.</li>
            <li> Great product and the best price I could find! Couldn&#x27;t find this perfume in any stores, thanks Amazon! Very fresh and fruity scent, my wife gets compliments on it all the time.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume! I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on it. A lot of perfumes give me a headache but this one never does.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t buy this on amazon. i got a better price on ebay.. sorry!!! but this scent is AMAZING!!!!!! smells sooooo good. i have a lot of different perfumes and my bf LOVES it, it&#x27;s one of the few he took the effort to comment on.</li>
            <li> Love it... I have been looking for this perfume for a long time ... Great price...will buy again...</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite perfume.  It isn&#x27;t overwhelming, even to people with scent sensitivities.  I have ordered this a number of times because I can no longer find it in stores…  It&#x27;s stupid expensive now compared to what it was when it first came out, but to me, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Came on time and was perfect for my wife&#x27;s birthday.</li>
            <li> I usually love the Escada fragrances from this line. Like &amp;#34;Sexy Grafitti&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Rockin&#x27; Rio&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Island Kiss&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Ocean Lounge&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Taj Sunset&amp;#34;, etc. This one kinda stinks. It&#x27;s not as fresh &amp; sweet like the others. My natural smell releases sweetness ( no arrogance; only truth) resembling raspberry &amp; strawberry. So, these amp that up. Moon Sparkle smells a bit uninviting &amp; almost masculine. It just doesn&#x27;t boast the delicacy of &amp;#34;lady-ism&amp;#34; I like. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again but u can try it for yourself. U should try to get to know your own type of natural smell from various parts of your body &amp; tie them together to have your own personal scent profile. That&#x27;ll help u pick the right fragrances. I like certain notes in fragrances. Which is how I learned to pair them with my own natural scents. Although so e perfumes have some of the notes I like, not all work together. I like fragrances to enhance my naturals &amp; leave lasting but unobtrusive throes.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST PERFUME I HAVE EVER SMELLED IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.</li>
            <li> This is a generic, sweet- smelling fragrance that reminds me of several others on the market. You can wear it anywhere as it is not too loud or offensive. Or memorable. There are some perfumes that are worth big money- this is not one of them.&lt;br /&gt;Update 11/6/12- I wore this today and really enjoyed the tiny wafts of it all day , just right for the office. I see the price here has become MUCH more reasonable since my first review. 4 and 1/2 stars. Enjoy.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume! I had some when it first came out and had trouble finding it again at a reasonable price.I am so excited to have found it here and it shipped fast! It smells good enough to eat and last long on my skin!</li>
            <li> Smells so good. So far it has been working fine for me but I do wonder if it is watered down. I can barely smell it but I&#x27;ve been wearing it for about 7 hours.</li>
            <li> Great find! This made the perfect birthday gift for my wife! She has been searching for this perfume for over a year now while trying to squeeze out any last remaining drops from her empty bottle. She was so upset when it was discovered that this perfume line was discontinued and is still shocked that I found it. I may look into purchasing all in stock for reserve because of how happy it made her that I found it! More shipping options would have made the purchase perfect but in the end, a happy wife is a happy life! Thank you!</li>
            <li> The best perfume I have ever owned!!!!!  It is one you repeat. I previously bought this for USD90.00 at a retail store so to get it for less than half the cost was awesome. It is subtle yet it stands out. It is somewhat fruity and floral to some extent so one may think day time is appropriate BUT try it at night!!!</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find this stuff for years and it smells amazing!!! I get so many compliments on it &amp; the price is awesome!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much! Other sellers over priced this product. I couldn&#x27;t find it any where anymore! This is my all time favorite perfume and I&#x27;m so happy to have it back! Will definitely buy again if still in stock when mine is gone!</li>
