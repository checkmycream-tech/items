    <ol>
            <li>/&gt;A truly wonderful line.</li>
            <li>Wonderful stuff</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful either way!</li>
            <li>Great slip, moisture, and suftness!</li>
            <li>If you dye or use heat on your hair often than this product will be your best friend.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s perfect</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s great for a splurge to treat yourself and your hair!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!!!</li>
            <li>Choose either fragrance, they&#x27;re both great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even used it as a leave-in conditioner because it smells so great</li>
            <li>love this to the max!!</li>
            <li>( weight and thickness helps style the curls better, also great for detangling in the shower!)</li>
            <li>So, either one smells good, and you can pick which you prefer, berry or floral-tropical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it all smells GOOD.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s good stuff</li>
            <li>I thought this would be a good DC...</li>
            <li>Anything that is too light for me is perfect for him.</li>
            <li>The Good--</li>
            <li>Makes a good rinse-out conditioner to</li>
            <li>But Curl Rehab is pretty good at detangling but not the best.  </li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>:) The pre-treatment could have helped with the results, but I tend to do oil treatments almost everytime before I wash my hair now, and I never get results like this!</li>
            <li>smells amazing,</li>
            <li>I did not experience the amazing results everyone else writes about, but I this</li>
            <li>The curl definition and the softness is amazing.</li>
            <li>it is nice product.</li>
            <li>It detangles very well and smells awesome if you like light foody scents.  </li>
            <li>I love this excellent deep conditioner, too pricey</li>
            <li>Despite all the rave reviews from people who love this product, it doesn&#x27;t work for my hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to stop touching my hair.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Check out more of my product reviews at [...]</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>I tried Biolage years ago when I first went natural and it is still the best detangling for me.</li>
            <li>strongly recommend the Curls in a Bottle by Curl Junkie to go with this product.</li>
            <li>CIAB made my clumps and curls stay beautifully formed (even when I finger combed, they REFORMED), and this Curl Rehab kept my uberdry hair moisturized enough not to decurl into a frizz-bomb.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product for deep conditioning!</li>
            <li>had intended to get this strawberry scent (which I&#x27;ve heard rave reviews about), but by accident I got the gardenia coconut one, which has a fragrance much more pleasant than I expected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for detangling your hair and comes in a nice, thick consistency the color of oatmeal.</li>
            <li>Rather, mashed bananas and something else sweet.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s smells good enough to eat!</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know the right hair product could make a girl so excited and overjoyed - of course</li>
            <li>I got very hot doing this.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve never spent my whole life looking for a good hair product either, though.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price tag.</li>
            <li>every week and my hair is getting healthier, more soft and shinning.</li>
            <li>, then I put the conditioner on very damp hair (so the conditioner was able to get really soaked up by my hair.)</li>
            <li>and I may have to go back to my original love, Biolaging Detangling Conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Used it for the first time and really think it might be worth the splurge!</li>
            <li>If you can afford it, and you want happy curls, get the Daily Fix for washing, the Smoothing Conditioner to rinse out, the Curl Rehab to leave in (and deep treat), and the CIAB to define curls.</li>
            <li>I tried this conditioner for a month and it worked, my hair is very soft, not hard any more.</li>
            <li>The strawberry ice cream scent is exactly as billed so if you don&#x27;t like that, you won&#x27;t like this.</li>
            <li>Very conditioning!</li>
            <li>I sat in a hot bath while doing all this to get my body temp up</li>
            <li>Then I put my cap on again and a hot towel from the drier and sat in the tub for twenty minutes or so.  </li>
            <li>This is my 2nd favorite of the CJ conditioners.  </li>
            <li>This really does smell like strawberry ice cream!</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing without being greasy; exactly as designed.</li>
            <li>Well, today, I have very nice third day hair (and for you air-drying or Pixie-curl-diffusing/scrunching curly-heads, you know how hard it is to have nice second day,</li>
            <li>you try this use more jojobo oil because aloe can dry hair out.)</li>
            <li>I have super curly/kinky hair and this leaves it soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I used it as a conditioner wash as well as a leave in mixed with a little gel today and my hair is pretty darn great.</li>
            <li>Basically, she raves about this CurlJunkie to everyone, I love the way her hair smells and feels, and we both agree it was money well spent.</li>
            <li>This product is okay but not very moisturizing for my corkscrew curls, and I used it to do my weekly hair steams.</li>
            <li>I used it as a deep conditioner mixed with a little grape seed oil then steamed my hair fit 20 mins - my hair was AMAZING!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay but not worth the price</li>
            <li>It made my hair so pretty and soft.</li>
            <li>I use it mainly as a leave-in.</li>
            <li>I know that&#x27;s most likely my mistake not reading properly.</li>
            <li>Nothing that I have used as made my hair this moisturized and soft!!</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s subtle enough after washed out to be pleasant.</li>
            <li>I actually felt a difference after the first conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been hearing hype about CJ products, old and new.</li>
            <li>After the treatment I low pooed with water mixed with a little shampoo, with a tea tree shampoo all natural and got all the oil out, and rinsed with warm distilled water.</li>
            <li>I have natural 4b and 4a hair, my hair had protein over load, and my niece told me to try the curl Junkie Rehab.</li>
            <li>Next I gently squeezed out all the water.</li>
            <li>and it leaves my hair soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>It also contains a lot of natural ingredients like shea butter and jojoba oil.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it sparingly since it requires more of the product than Aussie Moist to detangle my thick hair.</li>
            <li>I mean, I&#x27;ve tried better.  </li>
            <li>My fiancee has all-natural extra curly hair - Type 3b curls - which is really delicate, so she is obsessed with finding the perfect products that will protect it from damage and give it the life that she wants.</li>
            <li>my hair is somewhat fine and very cottony , the curls can be super tight in some places, both loose and tight spirals and really loose S waves.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes my hair like no other.  </li>
            <li>product is the only one I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve spent hundreds in the past three months searching for good curly hair products) that has given my hair enough moisture to leave it moist the next day.</li>
            <li>(I have hard water, and using distilled water has been making a huge difference.)At</li>
            <li>but it has a little sweet hint to it that actually makes it smell like &amp;#34;Ice</li>
            <li>Living in high desert, my hair gets very dry.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the tightly curled method and this really helps ensure that my hair is extra moisturizer on wash day.</li>

            <li> much less third day when your have a tight and frizz-prone dry hair type, like a 3b).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did provide decent slip for my very thick and curly hair.</li>
            <li> I did not combine any other conditioners or oils with this product.</li>
            <li> I already felt that this was a pretty expensive conditioner but</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way as well!</li>
            <li> Try it!, and I recommend distilled water, definitely, if you have hard water.</li>
            <li> Once it&#x27;s exposed to air, it goes a bit dark, just like bananas do.</li>
            <li> I check out reviews on other sites, and read up on forums, which I recommend, before I purchase products, and this one got glowing reviews!</li>
            <li> I have tried to find a less expensive product of the same quality but always come back to Curl Junkie Moisture Rehab.  </li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t anything wrong with it, but it simply didn&#x27;t give me the added moisture that my VERY dry hair requires.</li>
            <li> The Bad-- I&#x27;ve only been using Curl Junkie for about a month and my major issue is the price and the bottle size.</li>
            <li> I did give it 4 stars only  because of the price, it is a little too expensive.</li>
            <li> (I lose moisture like mad, highly porous</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I will purchase again.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s definitely to small of a jar for the price.</li>
            <li> but I usually use less expensive conditioners for that.  </li>
            <li> I think anyone who gets bad results with this they should try this method, because I don&#x27;t see how this stuff could make anyone&#x27;s hair dry.</li>
            <li> thin textured curly hair, 3b hair, and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not planning on buying this again because it&#x27;s expensive and it broke me out along my hair line and on my head.</li>
            <li> ; I know that seems weird</li>
            <li> Then I rinsed my hair with cold distilled water to seal in all the moisture.</li>
            <li> 27 dollars for 8oz makes it a Very very expensive conditioner!!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> ...but I didn&#x27;t get &amp;#34;strawberry ice cream&amp;#34; from it at all. Rather, mashed bananas and something else sweet. Once it&#x27;s exposed to air, it goes a bit dark, just like bananas do. I had the impression it was spoiling. I&#x27;m not planning on buying this again because it&#x27;s expensive and it broke me out along my hair line and on my head. Ouch. It did provide decent slip for my very thick and curly hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been hearing hype about CJ products, old and new. I decided to try them. Well, today, I have very nice third day hair (and for you air-drying or Pixie-curl-diffusing/scrunching curly-heads, you know how hard it is to have nice second day, much less third day when your have a tight and frizz-prone dry hair type, like a 3b).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is the only one I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve spent hundreds in the past three months searching for good curly hair products) that has given my hair enough moisture to leave it moist the next day. The only one that tamed my straw-like ends into softness for 24 hours. (I lose moisture like mad, highly porous color-treated hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had intended to get this strawberry scent (which I&#x27;ve heard rave reviews about), but by accident I got the gardenia coconut one, which has a fragrance much more pleasant than I expected. So, either one smells good, and you can pick which you prefer, berry or floral-tropical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend the Curls in a Bottle by Curl Junkie to go with this product. CIAB made my clumps and curls stay beautifully formed (even when I finger combed, they REFORMED), and this Curl Rehab kept my uberdry hair moisturized enough not to decurl into a frizz-bomb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A truly wonderful line. If you can afford it, and you want happy curls, get the Daily Fix for washing, the Smoothing Conditioner to rinse out, the Curl Rehab to leave in (and deep treat), and the CIAB to define curls. Wonderful stuff and it all smells GOOD.</li>
            <li> love this to the max!! smells amazing, coats well and hair comes out looking moisturize</li>
            <li> I love this excellent deep conditioner, too pricey but it&#x27;s good stuff</li>
            <li> I have natural 4b and 4a hair, my hair had protein over load, and my niece told me to try the curl Junkie Rehab. I tried this conditioner for a month and it worked, my hair is very soft, not hard any more. I actually felt a difference after the first conditioning treatment. I did not combine any other conditioners or oils with this product. I did give it 4 stars only  because of the price, it is a little too expensive. But it did work for my hair and I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff. I mean, I&#x27;ve tried better.  But Curl Rehab is pretty good at detangling but not the best.  I&#x27;m not sure I will purchase again.  When I have the money, I will buy a hair steamer and try Curl Rehab with that before giving up on it.  I have tons of deep conditioners and I may have to go back to my original love, Biolaging Detangling Conditioner.  I tried Biolage years ago when I first went natural and it is still the best detangling for me.</li>
            <li> My fiancee has all-natural extra curly hair - Type 3b curls - which is really delicate, so she is obsessed with finding the perfect products that will protect it from damage and give it the life that she wants. We bought this product for her 3 weeks ago, and she has never been happier about her hair! I didn&#x27;t know the right hair product could make a girl so excited and overjoyed - of course, I&#x27;ve never spent my whole life looking for a good hair product either, though. Basically, she raves about this CurlJunkie to everyone, I love the way her hair smells and feels, and we both agree it was money well spent.</li>
            <li> This product is okay but not very moisturizing for my corkscrew curls, and I used it to do my weekly hair steams. It&#x27;s okay but not worth the price and it&#x27;s definitely to small of a jar for the price.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a good DC... but it did nothing for my hair when I rinsed it out. But I recently used it as a leave in and I like it! It smells wonderful either way! I&#x27;ll probably use it on my dad since his hair is finer than mine. Anything that is too light for me is perfect for him. ^u^</li>
            <li> Love this product! I used it as a deep conditioner mixed with a little grape seed oil then steamed my hair fit 20 mins - my hair was AMAZING! Great slip, moisture, and suftness! I have very course and thick hair so when I find something it likes, I stick with it. Definitely worth the price tag.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing without being greasy; exactly as designed. The strawberry ice cream scent is exactly as billed so if you don&#x27;t like that, you won&#x27;t like this. But it&#x27;s subtle enough after washed out to be pleasant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m combining it with Repair Me! every week and my hair is getting healthier, more soft and shinning. I recomend!</li>
            <li> Very conditioning! I love this stuff!!! I&#x27;ve been using the tightly curled method and this really helps ensure that my hair is extra moisturizer on wash day.</li>
            <li> Despite all the rave reviews from people who love this product, it doesn&#x27;t work for my hair. There wasn&#x27;t anything wrong with it, but it simply didn&#x27;t give me the added moisture that my VERY dry hair requires.</li>
            <li> I did not experience the amazing results everyone else writes about, but I this it is nice product.</li>
            <li> I have tried to find a less expensive product of the same quality but always come back to Curl Junkie Moisture Rehab.  It moisturizes my hair like no other.  I wear it under a heat cap for about 45-60 min, rinse &amp; style, and I can get 3-day hair (sometimes 4).  Living in high desert, my hair gets very dry.  I use this product once a week.  Choose either fragrance, they&#x27;re both great.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to stop touching my hair. Nothing that I have used as made my hair this moisturized and soft!! :) I have thick(lots of hair) thin textured curly hair, 3b hair, and my curls drank this up beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;First I did an aloe juice treatment on my head and hair with jojobo oil,(if you try this use more jojobo oil because aloe can dry hair out.) I put my shower cap on then a big towel out of the drier. After the treatment I low pooed with water mixed with a little shampoo, with a tea tree shampoo all natural and got all the oil out, and rinsed with warm distilled water. Next I gently squeezed out all the water. I sat in a hot bath while doing all this to get my body temp up, then I put the conditioner on very damp hair (so the conditioner was able to get really soaked up by my hair.) Then I put my cap on again and a hot towel from the drier and sat in the tub for twenty minutes or so.  Bring lots of drinking water, and sit up in the tub.(so you don&#x27;t fall asleep) I got very hot doing this.  Then I rinsed my hair with cold distilled water to seal in all the moisture. (I have hard water, and using distilled water has been making a huge difference.)At the very end I combed through a little bit of jojobo oil with my wide toothed comb.  I think anyone who gets bad results with this they should try this method, because I don&#x27;t see how this stuff could make anyone&#x27;s hair dry. However, everyone does have different hair.  It made my hair so pretty and soft. Try it!, and I recommend distilled water, definitely, if you have hard water. If you have a steamer, use that. I can&#x27;t wait to have one of those eventually. :) The pre-treatment could have helped with the results, but I tend to do oil treatments almost everytime before I wash my hair now, and I never get results like this! I check out reviews on other sites, and read up on forums, which I recommend, before I purchase products, and this one got glowing reviews!</li>
            <li> The Good-- If you dye or use heat on your hair often than this product will be your best friend. I purchased the strawberry ice-cream scented bottle and let me tell you...it&#x27;s smells good enough to eat! It&#x27;s great for detangling your hair and comes in a nice, thick consistency the color of oatmeal. I&#x27;ve even used it as a leave-in conditioner because it smells so great and it leaves my hair soft and moisturized. It also contains a lot of natural ingredients like shea butter and jojoba oil.  I always use this as a deep conditioner after my henna treatments to cope with the dryness of the henna.    The Bad-- I&#x27;ve only been using Curl Junkie for about a month and my major issue is the price and the bottle size. It&#x27;s pretty costly for such a small bottle . I&#x27;ve been using it sparingly since it requires more of the product than Aussie Moist to detangle my thick hair. Also, you can only purchase this product online.

            <li> Arrived quickly.  Great product for deep conditioning!</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd favorite of the CJ conditioners.  I use it mainly as a leave-in. Sometimes, when I&#x27;m in the mood, I will do a deep treatment with heat. It detangles very well and smells awesome if you like light foody scents.  Makes a good rinse-out conditioner to but I usually use less expensive conditioners for that.  I have super curly/kinky hair and this leaves it soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting 16oz and it was actually 8. I know that&#x27;s most likely my mistake not reading properly. I already felt that this was a pretty expensive conditioner but 27 dollars for 8oz makes it a Very very expensive conditioner!!!! Used it for the first time and really think it might be worth the splurge! I used it as a conditioner wash as well as a leave in mixed with a little gel today and my hair is pretty darn great. The curl definition and the softness is amazing. It&#x27;s pretty thick and that&#x27;s perfect cuz I like the consistency it works well for my needs as a rinse out and a leave in. ( weight and thickness helps style the curls better, also great for detangling in the shower!) my hair is somewhat fine and very cottony , the curls can be super tight in some places, both loose and tight spirals and really loose S waves. This really does smell like strawberry ice cream! Not like strawberries but it has a little sweet hint to it that actually makes it smell like &amp;#34;Ice Cream&amp;#34; I know that seems weird but I love it. A little goes a long way as well! I may not purchase on a regular basis because of the price but it&#x27;s great for a splurge to treat yourself and your hair!</li>
