            <li> both my husband and I use this product and love it (and it smells good too).  I noticed an improvement in my face and neck after about 2 months.  The cost for the size of the product was a great value.  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Purchased this one for a vacation home.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this lotion. Much better deal than buying it in retail or smaller bottles.</li>
            <li> You can feel the difference. Skin is hydrated, smooth and nourished.  Definitely a step beyond just sun protection. Nice to have an all in one that also applies vitamins and anti-oxidants.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, it keeps my make up on longer, keeps my face moist, and helps lighten spot! This is my must have</li>
            <li> Wonderful Product.  Makes face feel soft without feeling oily.  Have a hard time finding a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t break my face out but this one works great.  I&#x27;ve noticed that my make up applies much better and looks better on my face.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> great lightweight moisturizer with SPF 30</li>
            <li> Uber happy! I have somewhat pale sensitive skin and this SPF Moisturizer is awesome. Feels light and makes my skin illuminate.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my fifties , glowing and looking great ( I&#x27;m told but I can actually see this myself ). Time will tell if there is any additional benefits but for now I&#x27;m super satisfied.</li>
            <li> I read many of the reviews and decided to try this product. It seemed a bit expensive for the size of the bottle, but believe me when I say a lot little goes a long way. My skin feels softer and looks more refreshed. All that and a sunscreen. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a light moisturizer, with vitamin C benefits that delivers softer more refreshing skin results.</li>
            <li> Like this, doesn&#x27;t aggravate my acne at all</li>
            <li> Ordered the wrong item but really liek the Murad products. Just a bit to pricey for every day lotion.</li>
            <li> I have used this product, for which I paid @ $60 for a 2-oz m/l size.  The product - wonderful scent, easy to use (not runny or thick like some), and insures moisture replenishment as well.  The price was great for such a larger size!</li>
            <li> Excellent transaction. This is the real stuff, its thick, smells like vitamin C, and has the slight orange tint that I&#x27;m familiar with. I know this is real because it takes just a small amount to cover my entire face. Also, 8 oz is a steal at this price! Only issue I have is trying to get the last remnants of lotion out. I used to cut the 1.5 ounce with scissors to get at the last bits, but it being so thick, I&#x27;m concerned I may end up wasting some with this packaging. But the price makes up for it!</li>
            <li> Not greasy and works well</li>
            <li> not greasy at all, very gentle on skin and i&#x27;ve been using it for years.  appreciate the value of this super size</li>
            <li> I have used it for 25 years</li>
            <li> Great value in the 8 oz size.</li>
            <li> Just like I have been purchasing at full price - this one is less expensive, get more product, and the top is a pump.  Yay!!</li>
            <li> Love the product and the salon size.</li>

            <li> This was recommended for people who are worried about skin cancer protection.  It&#x27;s a gift and my friend loves it.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper to buy it in the larger size. I really like using this moisturizer.</li>
