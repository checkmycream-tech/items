            <li>I love this mirror</li>
            <li>but I love the company even more.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with it that I purchased another one to give as a gift.</li>
            <li>Love that I can unplug the adapter so the cord isnt always showing.  </li>
            <li>The dimming feature is very nice and the light is bright enough without being glaring.  </li>
            <li>great mirror, magnification is clear.</li>
            <li>Easy to mount and wife loves it.  </li>
            <li>(that makes it easy to plumb and level).  </li>
            <li>It went in easy and serves me well.  </li>
            <li>I can tweeze my eyebrows very quickly using it.  </li>
            <li>The mirror looks good, and appears to be of decent quality.</li>
            <li>The light is bright enought and so far...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It arrived and after mounting it the light wouldn&#x27;t turn on.</li>
            <li>Upon calling the company they told me to keep the mirror and that they would replace it for free.</li>
            <li>Great Mirror - especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>It was very easy to hang on the wall, luckily we had a stud right where I wanted to hang it.  </li>
            <li>Very nice - especially for the price.</li>
            <li>The magnification is outstanding, and the LED lighting is more than adequate to really see what&#x27;s what.  </li>
            <li>and the brightest level is bright enough.</li>
            <li>In any case, my charge was refunded quickly, and I was not charged for return shipping.  </li>
            <li>Nice solid quality materials.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>The company went out of their way to &#x27;make it right.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just the right size.</li>
            <li>The lighted mirror is exactly what my wife was looking for to support our bathroom remodel.  </li>
            <li>and I think it was a fluke that the first one didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>However, even on the brightest setting, the light is so dim as to be almost unusable.</li>
            <li>Not difficult to mount either.  </li>
            <li>Some people said the light was too dim</li>
            <li>I shopped around a long time, and am glad I found this one.</li>
            <li>Light did not function unless you held the switch all the way in the on position due to the circuit board attached to the switch spinning freely.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a mirror with decent lighting and magnification and that&#x27;s exactly what this item delivers.</li>
            <li>I am extremely nearsighted, and the ambient light in my bathroom isn&#x27;t adequate for putting on makeup, which is why I wanted this mirror.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The 10x mirror takes some getting used to as it&#x27;s a real eye-opener</li>
            <li>Costs twice as much in stores.</li>
            <li>The fourth time I missed catching it, thinking it was finally secured on the wall.</li>
            <li>means that there&#x27;s a sweet spot in the middle that is used while the edges aren&#x27;t!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have had the new one for about 4 months now</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not Ovente&#x27;s fault, I tried to install it about four different times, each time I thought it was secure in their wall mounting device, it would fall off in a second or two.</li>
            <li>My fiancee actually has used it this morning to gently take something out of his eye, that had blown in.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, similar to one other review, the light did not work at all.</li>
            <li>Have sent it back and ordered a new one.</li>
            <li>I had already bought and installed a similar mirror, but the 10x magnified side was concave and the focal area was so small, I was willing to pay twice as much for the Ovente mirror, which was touted as being &amp;#34;distortion free&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Very heavy with wide profile, not the elegant slim style I was looking for, returned to seller.  </li>
            <li>After careful &amp;#34;research&amp;#34;, trying to read between the lines of customer reviews, I selected this mirror because I wanted a decent size frame with 10X mag, LED lighting and wall mount.  </li>
            <li>I am worried about when the light bulb goes out because replacing it will be very hard.</li>

            <li> I had already bought and installed a similar mirror, but the 10x magnified side was concave and the focal area was so small, I was willing to pay twice as much for the Ovente mirror, which was touted as being &amp;#34;distortion free&amp;#34;.  Well, it was no better than the one I had, so I sent it back immediately.  Maybe I don&#x27;t understand what &amp;#34;distortion free&amp;#34; means??  In any case, my charge was refunded quickly, and I was not charged for return shipping.  I truly appreciate the way Amazon does business!</li>
            <li> The mirror has to be plugged into an outlet which means it is not capable of connecting directly to the wall without using outlet .  Now how ugly is that a cable running accross your bathroom vanity.</li>
            <li> Installed this mirror today &amp; love it! Nice solid quality materials. Went up easily &amp; looks great. I was looking for a mirror with decent lighting and magnification and that&#x27;s exactly what this item delivers. It&#x27;s so nice to be able to see well without having to hunch over the tabletop mirror that I was using. I found this item to be well designed and affordable. Profile is 1.25 inch thick, so not as clumsy looking as similar models. I shopped around a long time, and am glad I found this one. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> perfect light; i bought it for my wife for an anniversary present.  I told her it was something she would like but would not buy for herself but she will use it every day.</li>
            <li> The lighted mirror is exactly what my wife was looking for to support our bathroom remodel.  She&#x27;s very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorable opinion, however, is based on the company&#x27;s remarkable customer service.  Our mirror was damaged during transport.  The company went out of their way to &#x27;make it right.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife recommends the mirror.  I recommend the company.  We&#x27;ll gladly buy from Ovente again; we recommend them without reservation.</li>
            <li> Works great and it&#x27;s just the right size.</li>
            <li> Very nice - especially for the price. Magnification is very strong and light is bright. Battery option is a nice feature as well.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s exactly what we wanted, perfect.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror but I love the company even more.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived and after mounting it the light wouldn&#x27;t turn on. Upon calling the company they told me to keep the mirror and that they would replace it for free. I have had the new one for about 4 months now and I love it! It works great and I think it was a fluke that the first one didn&#x27;t work. I am worried about when the light bulb goes out because replacing it will be very hard. But since it&#x27;s LED it will be years before that happens.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely purchase other products from them. They truly want to make the customer happy, and they did!</li>
            <li> Bought 1.5 years ago.  Easy to mount and wife loves it.  Good value.</li>
            <li> Very heavy with wide profile, not the elegant slim style I was looking for, returned to seller.  Good quality materials, but not the size as shown in the photo image.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal--high quality, and heavy.  No flimsy plastic, this is a solid piece that should last forever.  The magnification is outstanding, and the LED lighting is more than adequate to really see what&#x27;s what.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I am extremely nearsighted, and the ambient light in my bathroom isn&#x27;t adequate for putting on makeup, which is why I wanted this mirror. The mirror looks good, and appears to be of decent quality. However, even on the brightest setting, the light is so dim as to be almost unusable. I returned it.</li>
            <li> Great Mirror - especially for the price.  Mounting is very easy - loosen (don&#x27;t remove) the screw holding the mounting plate from the mirror and mount the plate to the wall (that makes it easy to plumb and level).  Then slide the mirror back onto the two prongs (which do all of the vertical holding of the mirror) and tighten the screw (which only acts as a clamp to hold the mirror onto the base).  If you can handle a screwdriver and a drill this is a 5 minute job.  The dimming feature is very nice and the light is bright enough without being glaring.  The 10x mirror takes some getting used to as it&#x27;s a real eye-opener but it works great.  P.S.  Please don&#x27;t confuse magnification with distortion - the concave nature of the magnifying lens means that there&#x27;s a sweet spot in the middle that is used while the edges aren&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> This unit seems well-made. It&#x27;s heavily constructed, and the mounting system is straight forward. Unfortunately, similar to one other review, the light did not work at all. Dead. Have sent it back and ordered a new one. Will update review when that one shows up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word to the wise: check the light before putting holes in you wall.</li>
            <li> It was broken when I received it.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price. great mirror, magnification is clear. nicely made piece. I like the fact that I can plug it in or have it look neat using batteries.</li>
            <li> although the mirror itself is very nice, I have some issues with this mirror.  one thing is that it was very difficult to mount to wall.  I had a heck of a time.  based on that  alone, I would not recommend.  second, the mirror itself is very heavy.  it is too heavy for the mounting base.  i&#x27;m hoping the thing stays on my wall.  third, I put silicone spray on &amp;#34;joints&amp;#34; of arms bc the mirror arms are extremely tight.  that helped.  the light around diameter of mirror is very nice.  it&#x27;s totally dimmable, built into the on/off switch.  and the brightest level is bright enough.</li>
            <li> The mirror appears to be a quality mirror with good optics. I&#x27;m not sure about the lighting. I had a lot of trouble trying to install it on my wall with the mounting device provided by Ovente. It&#x27;s not Ovente&#x27;s fault, I tried to install it about four different times, each time I thought it was secure in their wall mounting device, it would fall off in a second or two. The fourth time I missed catching it, thinking it was finally secured on the wall. The 10x side of the mirror broke, so it is useless to me. As a tidbit of info, over the years I have installed a lot of different things without any problems, so this failure was a surprise to me. What I figured out was my wall had a small swale right where I was trying to install the mounting device, not really visible until I started studying the wall and the mounting plate, trying to figure out why the mount wouldn&#x27;t work. So. . .beware, it is not the best mounting plate I have ever worked with. Just be careful.</li>
            <li> Very happy with it.  It went in easy and serves me well.  I use it every day period period period</li>
            <li> After careful &amp;#34;research&amp;#34;, trying to read between the lines of customer reviews, I selected this mirror because I wanted a decent size frame with 10X mag, LED lighting and wall mount.  This is a beautiful quality mirror that has everything I wanted.  Not difficult to mount either.  Some people said the light was too dim but I suspect they had not figured out that you have to turn the nob to make it brighter as it&#x27;s adjustable.  I am so pleased with it that I purchased another one to give as a gift.</li>
            <li> Light did not function unless you held the switch all the way in the on position due to the circuit board attached to the switch spinning freely. This is a poor design.</li>
            <li> Excellant lighted Wallmount magnifying mirror.  I can tweeze my eyebrows very quickly using it.  My fiancee actually has used it this morning to gently take something out of his eye, that had blown in.  We are both getting plenty of use from it.</li>
            <li> This mirror came so quickly and I was very impressed with the quality.  It was very easy to hang on the wall, luckily we had a stud right where I wanted to hang it.  Love that I can unplug the adapter so the cord isnt always showing.  The light is bright enought and so far...so good!!</li>
            <li> great product. Great price. Costs twice as much in stores. It would have been great if the instructions have the drill bit size to hang the hardware.</li>
