            <li>Its a great product.  </li>

            <li>Very good product and a nice smell</li>
            <li>Feels good after cleaning my face.</li>
            <li>, I find this brand, it clean my  face very good.</li>
            <li>However, keep in mind that you can still use this cleanser if you use a toner (make sure to test the pH of the toner too!)</li>
            <li>It works up to a good lather, and is very smooth / silky on your face.  </li>
            <li>I sometimes use the Pureness toner, since I would breakout if I use any kind of moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>and it smells kind of feminine.  </li>
            <li>Lathers wonderfully, scent is fresh and nice, leaves my face feeling very clean without overdrying.  </li>
            <li>and I break out very easily.</li>
            <li>Plus it rinses off very easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for more than 4 years.  </li>
            <li>and I re-order more.</li>
            <li>None of them worked, in fact, most of them caused more breakouts..</li>
            <li>I love the scent as well.</li>
            <li>Have been using this cleanser for many years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, but I think that the fragrance is too overpowering.</li>
            <li>I love the creaminess of the face wash.</li>
            <li>love the after-cleanse feeling of this foam.</li>
            <li>My favorite part?  </li>
            <li>I love how it leaves my face feeling unvreasy and</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this in the evenings, and then washing with Pro-Activ in the mornings and for the most part my acne has been at bay.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful facial wash.  </li>
            <li>and I all love it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used a lot of cleansers before - mostly drugstore ones  </li>
            <li>Mom :)</li>
            <li>This is the best facial cleanser ever!  </li>
            <li>It also works awesome with a facial brush.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my face hydrated and smooth!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this face cleanser.  </li>
            <li>it is pretty good for oily skin~</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s probably a strong element of brainwashing here, but oh man, I love Shiseido skincare products.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so clean after using this product!</li>
            <li>it is a great product with very rich foam, and i feel clean after using it and i can feel my skin is very soft!</li>
            <li>BUT JUST REALLY MELTS AWAY WHEN A GOOD LATHER IS MADE.</li>
            <li>The smell is very clean and pure and your face feels wonderful and soft.  </li>
            <li>Take it from me who has very oily skin, its great, really removes the oil!</li>
            <li>perfectly balanced (super clean yet not too dry).</li>
            <li>SMELL IS LIGHT AND NOT OVERPOWERING.</li>
            <li>Does this company make money by earning interest from their free lancers&#x27; wage?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>Everything went smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Creamy and smooth on face.</li>
            <li>Amazon offers a good deal.</li>
            <li>It has some grains within the cream that makes my skin feel so clean.</li>
            <li>and it was very refreshingly clean and did not leave any residue.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, lasts forever, leaves face feeling refreshed and super clean.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my face clean and helps with breakouts</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser so much.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>it is great but not for use twice daily unless you really need it.</li>
            <li>Feels great and gentle on the skin and doesnt leave it dry.</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It foams really nicely, and you don&#x27;t need a foaming net.</li>
            <li>However, it is a bit on the price-y side compared to drugstore brands, but it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the other scrub better</li>
            <li>This wash is extremely drying and takes all the oils out of your skin, even the good ones.</li>
            <li>My face feels fresh and clean afterwards, without feeling too dry as many products with salicylic tend to make it feel.  </li>
            <li>I have to say that this foam is really good, my skin feels clean and fresh when I use it, but dont use it on a regular basis, only every 2 or 3 days, or if I have an special ocasion when I want my face to really look matte.</li>
            <li>Mild and very cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>Also a little pricey but its worth the $ because no other cleansers are as good!</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>I am very apprehensive trying new things because my face breaks out so easily</li>
            <li>I most likely won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li>The texture is smooth with little beans so it exfoliates very lightly.</li>
            <li>Skins feels soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice a difference between this product and other cleansing foams, to be honest.</li>
            <li>Unlike most others I&#x27;ve tried, this doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.  </li>
            <li>I tube can last me 6 to 8 months easy.</li>
            <li>(Neutrogena Deep Clean, Pond&#x27;s Luminous Cleanser, Clean &amp; Clear Essentials, Clinique), and nothing compares to this one.</li>
            <li>I really feel like it is cleaning well, and once rinsed off there is no &#x27;residue&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>My face doesn&#x27;t sting or burn after I use it, it just feels really clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would have never paid this much money for a skincare product</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Shiseido products are top shelf without the extreme pricing.</li>
            <li>and they are minor, are that I wish it were more natural</li>
            <li>I feel for a once a week deep clean</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It&#x27;s just a super gentle cleanser that actually works!</li>
            <li>It lathers up really well and goes on pretty smoothly, so you really only need a tiny amount for your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it makes a very rich foam and those tiny blue particles that exfoliates.</li>
            <li>(I use something lighter for the other days) and it keeps my skin free of blemishes.</li>
            <li>The one tube will last almost 1 year if you use it like I do-- a pea sized amount really does froth up and do the trick!</li>
            <li>Must have face wash for sensitive, oily, and acne prone skin!</li>
            <li>Smells beautifully and lathers like crazy.  </li>
            <li>Even when I wasn&#x27;t using a makeup remover prior to washing it seemed to deep clean without drying out my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used my share of facial cleanser such as; St. Ives Apricot Scrub, Clean &amp; Clear, Neutrogena, Aveeno, Olay, ProActiv etc.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It reduces my acne, brightens my face a little, and makes my face feel soft and smooth without tightening and drying it out.  </li>
            <li>Within a couple of days of use the pimple would clear away.</li>
            <li>but it just abrasive enough to clean your skin without being too oily or making your skin dry.  </li>
            <li>Yet it leaves it soft and moist.</li>
            <li>(Thanks, mom, for sharing your crazy-expensive skincare products with your zitty teenage daughter!)</li>
            <li>I know a few free lance make-up artists for Shiseido, who didn&#x27;t get paid for over 3 months.</li>
            <li>Price is also reasonable compared to similar products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered it twice so far and will continue to order.</li>
            <li>It really cleans your face really deep</li>
            <li>My skin really benefits from this terrific product.</li>
            <li>It is a good product but again bought the wrong product.</li>
            <li>I had a problem with Proactive leaving a filmy residue and not really a clean clean feeling.</li>
            <li>This cleanser leaves my face feeling clean and soft, and that tube lasts a long, long time--I&#x27;ve been using mine for, uh, two-plus years now?</li>
            <li>to adjust your skin pH back to normal.</li>
            <li>No other product cleans my face as completly as Shiseido does</li>
            <li>and you might switch this one out with another general cleanser.</li>
            <li>I am in my early thirties and have struggled with acne and combination skin my entire life.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many cleansers, but nothing compares to how well this cream cleans my skin without irritating it.</li>
            <li>I have normal skin, (dry in the winter, oily in the heat/bad hair days), and this is my go-to.  </li>
            <li>It is by far the most expensive thing I buy for myself, per ounce, and I consider it money</li>
            <li>I only use the amount of a dime (even less) and it foams a lot, so it is very economic at the end.</li>
            <li>May be a little overdrying if used too much.</li>
            <li>A little dab lathers up beautifully and is just enough to clean my face without drying it out horribly.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I have normal skin, (dry in the winter, oily in the heat/bad hair days), and this is my go-to.  My face feels fresh and clean afterwards, without feeling too dry as many products with salicylic tend to make it feel.  I&#x27;ve been using it for more than 4 years.  The one tube will last almost 1 year if you use it like I do-- a pea sized amount really does froth up and do the trick!</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and I break out very easily. I started to use the 3 steps of the Shiseido Pureness line (Cleansing Foam, Balancing Softener and Matifying Moisturizer) and my skins appearance improved a lot. The Cleansing Foam is a key step for this \\&quot;matifying treatment\\&quot;. I used it by day and night, but after one month of using it on a regular basis, my skin began to felt sticky and thick, specialy the T zone (forehead, nose and chin), like if my pores were getting clogged. I stopped using the Shiseido Cleasing Foam and I went back using my Clinique Face Wash (my skin doesn&#x27;t feel thick and sticky anymore). I have to say that this foam is really good, my skin feels clean and fresh when I use it, but dont use it on a regular basis, only every 2 or 3 days, or if I have an special ocasion when I want my face to really look matte.</li>
            <li> Agree with everyone who says &amp;#34;a little goes a long way&amp;#34;.  It works up to a good lather, and is very smooth / silky on your face.  I really feel like it is cleaning well, and once rinsed off there is no &#x27;residue&#x27;.  I use it nightly with my Clarisonic facial brush.</li>
            <li> it is a great product with very rich foam, and i feel clean after using it and i can feel my skin is very soft! it is pretty good for oily skin~</li>
            <li> Must have face wash for sensitive, oily, and acne prone skin! I am very apprehensive trying new things because my face breaks out so easily but this definitely did not disappoint me. I have repurchased this product 3 times already.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for a couple of years. Along the way, I&#x27;ve tried others, but this always comes out the winner and I re-order more. It has some grains within the cream that makes my skin feel so clean. Yet it leaves it soft and moist.</li>
            <li> I bought this through Macys based on excellent customer reviews. I had a problem with Proactive leaving a filmy residue and not really a clean clean feeling. I bought this and it was very refreshingly clean and did not leave any residue. Feels great and gentle on the skin and doesnt leave it dry. Well worth it. Im buying a refill as we speak.</li>
            <li> I have an oily skin that is prone to acne. It&#x27;s not as severe but I breakout from time to time. I have used my share of facial cleanser such as; St. Ives Apricot Scrub, Clean &amp; Clear, Neutrogena, Aveeno, Olay, ProActiv etc. None of them worked, in fact, most of them caused more breakouts.. Only Shiseido Pureness works well to me.  I&#x27;m a lazy person so I don&#x27;t wash my face everyday, I will if I feel like it. Whenever I have breakout I would use this product, after washing I would notice that the pimple aren&#x27;t as sore looking. Within a couple of days of use the pimple would clear away. I like that it makes a very rich foam and those tiny blue particles that exfoliates. It leaves my face clean and fresh. It&#x27;s a bit drying though. I sometimes use the Pureness toner, since I would breakout if I use any kind of moisturizer.  Overall Shiseido Pureness is the only facial wash that works for me. It helps prevent breakouts. I love the scent as well. A bit pricey but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I am using this product at night and is working well! Item was as it. Would rebuy again in the futur!</li>
            <li> Mild and very cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;Very recommendable!&lt;br /&gt;Glad to get it in the U.S.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on a friend&#x27;s suggestion.  My only complaints...and they are minor, are that I wish it were more natural and it smells kind of feminine.  That said, it is great.  Unlike most others I&#x27;ve tried, this doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.  Plus it rinses off very easily.</li>
            <li> Caveat: I&#x27;ve used Shiseido ever since I&#x27;ve been a teenager. (Thanks, mom, for sharing your crazy-expensive skincare products with your zitty teenage daughter!) There&#x27;s probably a strong element of brainwashing here, but oh man, I love Shiseido skincare products. This cleanser leaves my face feeling clean and soft, and that tube lasts a long, long time--I&#x27;ve been using mine for, uh, two-plus years now? I can&#x27;t remember when I bought it, but it was definitely before 2012.. A little dab lathers up beautifully and is just enough to clean my face without drying it out horribly. (I moisturize after anyway. Because habit, and because I&#x27;m vain enough to want to stave wrinkles off as long as I can.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion: this stuff is boss. It is by far the most expensive thing I buy for myself, per ounce, and I consider it money well-spent. This is coming from a person who doesn&#x27;t give two flips about make-up, and whose haircare regimen consists of washing, air-drying and then finger-combing. It&#x27;s my one beauty indulgence.</li>
            <li> This brand was supposed to be the glory of face care, but I found otherwise. This wash is extremely drying and takes all the oils out of your skin, even the good ones. I saw no improvement with my acne and skin condition so I discontinued when I moved to the Paula&#x27;s Choice line.</li>
            <li> THIS LINE FROM SHISEDO IS AWESOME I HAVE BEEN USING THESE PRODUCTS FOR OVER 20 YEARS AND EVERYTHING HAS BEEN UP TO OR ABOVE PAR. IT&#x27;S EXPENSIVE BUT THIS CLEANSER REALLY CLEANS YOUR SKIN LEAVING IT WITHOUT RESIDUE (WHICH I HATE) BUT DOES NOT OVER DRY EITHER. SMELL IS LIGHT AND NOT OVERPOWERING. HAS SLIGHT EXFOLIATING BEADS BUT JUST REALLY MELTS AWAY WHEN A GOOD LATHER IS MADE. NOTE: A LITTLE CLEANS A LOT!! *THUMBS UP*</li>
            <li> Have been using this cleanser for many years. Its shiseido&#x27;s pureness line for oily skin.Take it from me who has very oily skin, its great, really removes the oil! May be a little overdrying if used too much. Also a little pricey but its worth the $ because no other cleansers are as good!</li>
            <li> This Product is great. My skin feels so clean after using this product! No other product cleans my face as completly as Shiseido does</li>
            <li> Shiseido USA sucks as a company. I know a few free lance make-up artists for Shiseido, who didn&#x27;t get paid for over 3 months. Does this company make money by earning interest from their free lancers&#x27; wage?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When they contacted the company HR/Payroll, they got retaliated: their account executive cut their hours.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but I think that the fragrance is too overpowering. It foams really nicely, and you don&#x27;t need a foaming net. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the microbeads. I don&#x27;t really notice a difference between this product and other cleansing foams, to be honest.</li>
            <li> This controls my sort of oily skin yet scrubs off dead epithelial cells.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the other scrub better</li>
            <li> I bought the wrong cleanser. I feel for a once a week deep clean it is great but not for use twice daily unless you really need it. It is a good product but again bought the wrong product.</li>
            <li> I used this as a kid and still do and now my kids are using Sheisedo. It is working well on them too!</li>
            <li> the greatest and the price is fanticitic</li>
            <li> I use this on daily basis almost. Feels good after cleaning my face. Not too dry or too oily. Price is also reasonable compared to similar products.</li>
            <li> I have oil skin,before I used other brand, but they changed the formula, so I do some recharged, I find this brand, it clean my  face very good. I like it very much. I would recommend to all my friends.</li>
            <li> Excellent scrub. Skins feels soft and clean.</li>
            <li> Lathers wonderfully, scent is fresh and nice, leaves my face feeling very clean without overdrying.  Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I love the creaminess of the face wash. It lathers extremely well. I haven&#x27;t seen a reduction in my breakouts, but it has helped my skin feel softer. I wouldn&#x27;t discourage this product.</li>
            <li> love the after-cleanse feeling of this foam. definitely recommend this product- everyone should try this! gonna buy this again after I&#x27;m done with my current one</li>
            <li> We always go to this one for the deep cleanse. Just remember that you are removing ALL oils and you might switch this one out with another general cleanser.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, lasts forever, leaves face feeling refreshed and super clean.  My favorite part?  I love how it leaves my face feeling unvreasy and perfectly balanced (super clean yet not too dry).</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser so much. I&#x27;ve ordered it twice so far and will continue to order. It keeps my face clean and helps with breakouts</li>
            <li> This cleanser leaves my skin with a sensation of purity! It cleans pores in depth and you feel like all the dirt has been removed from your skin afterwards. I love this product. Also, I little bit goes a long way in that you truly only need a drop for a lot of lather. I tube can last me 6 to 8 months easy. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Very good product and a nice smell (it is perfumed). I only use the amount of a dime (even less) and it foams a lot, so it is very economic at the end. The texture is smooth with little beans so it exfoliates very lightly. This line of product is made for oily skin which tends to make breakouts. It works. I only have to use it twice a week (I use something lighter for the other days) and it keeps my skin free of blemishes. I like this product a lot and been using it for years. Amazon offers a good deal. I recommend this buy.</li>
            <li> Everything went smoothly.  Its a great product.  It really cleans your face really deep, it gets in there and get the dirt out.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and it cleans deeply without drying out my face.  My face doesn&#x27;t sting or burn after I use it, it just feels really clean.&lt;br /&gt;It takes the make up off well that I use almost daily.  I&#x27;ve tried many cleansers, but nothing compares to how well this cream cleans my skin without irritating it.</li>
            <li> great for oily skin without drying your skin out</li>
            <li> This is my holy grail! I am in my early thirties and have struggled with acne and combination skin my entire life. A few years ago I chanced upon this product in TJ Maxx and figured I may as well try it out...and have been using it faithfully for the past three years! I&#x27;ve been using this in the evenings, and then washing with Pro-Activ in the mornings and for the most part my acne has been at bay. My boyfriend has even started using this b/c he said his face doesn&#x27;t feel as tight as when he uses his acne wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Specifics:&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;ve never had to use such a tiny amount of product for the payoff. Since I only use it once a day a bottle lasts me close to year.&lt;br /&gt;-This never makes my skin feel tight and dry, or conversely, slimy. Even when I wasn&#x27;t using a makeup remover prior to washing it seemed to deep clean without drying out my face.&lt;br /&gt;-It smells, for a lack of a better word, expensive. ^_^&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s just a super gentle cleanser that actually works!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful facial wash.  I has a granular feel but it just abrasive enough to clean your skin without being too oily or making your skin dry.  My three daughters and I all love it.  Shiseido products are top shelf without the extreme pricing.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best cleansers I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It reduces my acne, brightens my face a little, and makes my face feel soft and smooth without tightening and drying it out.  I use this at least once a day (at night); if I&#x27;m not too lazy, I also use it in the morning. It lathers up really well and goes on pretty smoothly, so you really only need a tiny amount for your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a lot of cleansers before - mostly drugstore ones  (Neutrogena Deep Clean, Pond&#x27;s Luminous Cleanser, Clean &amp; Clear Essentials, Clinique), and nothing compares to this one. However, it is a bit on the price-y side compared to drugstore brands, but it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (5/14/15): So, I recently read up on how the pH of your cleanser can adversely affect your skin with both short-term and long-term consequences, which was shown by a number of research studies. Anyway, long story short, I tested the pH of this cleanser using pH strips and the cleanser pH was around 10. First of all, a person&#x27;s skin pH is usually around 4.2-5.6, so you shouldn&#x27;t use any cleanser above that pH or it will disrupt your acid mantle. Now, the pH scale is a logarithmic scale, so a one unit change in pH is actually a tenfold change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I have reduced this from five stars rating to three stars. I most likely won&#x27;t repurchase. However, keep in mind that you can still use this cleanser if you use a toner (make sure to test the pH of the toner too!) to adjust your skin pH back to normal. As for me, my skin tends to be acne-prone so I&#x27;d rather not do anything to disrupt my skin and possibly cause acne.</li>
            <li> I have used this product line to dramatically improve my skin&#x27;s appearance and reduce breakouts. I would have never paid this much money for a skincare product but my mom bought me the sample kit and insisted I try it. Thanks Mom :)</li>
            <li> This is the best facial cleanser ever!  Smells beautifully and lathers like crazy.  A bottle this size will last me 3 months or longer.  It also works awesome with a facial brush.  I have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Well packaged. Creamy and smooth on face. Leaves my face hydrated and smooth! I love Shiseido products!!</li>
            <li> Best face foam ever. My skin really benefits from this terrific product. Shiseido has the best formulas. Faithful use gives me great results.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this face cleanser.  The smell is very clean and pure and your face feels wonderful and soft.  I use this with my Clarisonic and it is great!!</li>
