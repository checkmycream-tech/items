            <li>This product (and I feel like I can validate this 100% after 3 weeks of use) is supposed to help prepare your skin perfectly for overnight treatment products (I started being faithful to Regenerist as well along with their cleanser).  </li>

            <li>My skin has not looked this good in years.  </li>

            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product by Olay!  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>It has a very nice, light scent, great lather, and is easy to rinse.  </li>
            <li>I particularly liked the idea of the foaming, because that helps on not wasting it.</li>

            <li>I look forward to using more Olay products.</li>
            <li>Love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see any magic though.</li>
            <li>Olay has been a top product for many years, and I don&#x27;t think that will ever change.</li>
            <li>Of all these products, this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love the way my skin feels after I wash it.</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Use morning and night, love it.</li>
            <li>I needed something that would remove makeup more thoroughly</li>
            <li>This surely gets an A+.</li>
            <li>I am pleased to have been an Olay user for many years.</li>
            <li>It acts more like lotion than soap, and it makes zero suds when you wash, so you can&#x27;t even tell where it is on your skin.</li>
            <li>Great cleanser left skin feeling smooth and great scent</li>
            <li>Winning combo.</li>
            <li>but there are so many too choose from.</li>
            <li>This works better than most I have found.  </li>
            <li>I use all Olay products for my skin and my skin never looked better.  </li>
            <li>I love all of the Olay Regenerist products.  </li>
            <li>The smell is okay for me.  </li>
            <li>I use it with a sonic cleaner and have been highly satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li>I plan to buy more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an ok product.</li>
            <li>I really love the pump container--</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the way it leaves me feeling refreshed.  </li>
            <li>I used with regenerist micro sculpting cream and was hoping for better results.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in the store, and getting it through Amazon Subscribe &amp; Save</li>
            <li>This foaming cleanser is my favorite face wash.  </li>
            <li>I would list the other products I am using, but instead recommend visiting the olay website and entering your own preferences to get a combination that will work best for you.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s original soap in there, making a nice foam, but this stuff just blurts out, with zero foam.</li>
            <li>Nice clean scent and minimized my pores.  </li>
            <li>The price is getting too high great stuff now what?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good cleanser, but very gentle on my skin as well.</li>
            <li>Great cleanser for normal aging skin and</li>
            <li>Smells pretty good.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to &#x27;lock the top&#x27; and travel.  </li>
            <li>Olay Regenerist Advanced Anti-Aging Micro-Purifying Foam Cleanser is one of the best facial cleansers I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Great cleanser for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My daughters (in their 30s) used it at my home and loved it so much that they are now using it.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping &amp; good prices.  </li>
            <li>Cleans your skin leaving it feeling smooth and very clean.  </li>
            <li>and it lathers up easily and rinses off well.</li>
            <li>It had worked fine with</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant fragrance and leaves my skin feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>It lathers nicely and cleans well, but, don&#x27;t really see any visible changes with use.</li>
            <li>Makes skin smooth and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>Smooth and moist.</li>
            <li>Gentle cleansing, nice foam.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Even if you&#x27;re young, it&#x27;s never to soon to take good care of your skin.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I have used the higher priced items and this is more than sufficient.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get that really clean feeling</li>
            <li>feel great after wards...doesn&#x27;t dry my face</li>
            <li>It does seem to clean my face well, no drying.</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day and it leaves your face feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>The foaming cleanser makes my skin feel clean.  </li>
            <li>The Olay Regenerist probably cleans as well, but it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling as clean.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clean well, the micro cleaning the label refers to seems to be a lie</li>
            <li>Paired with daily moisturizer, makes a good combo and prevents drying out.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li>but I do not believe it works better than gentle soaps or takes the pace of moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>I love Olay products and like to use the whole package of items that go together.</li>
            <li>will leave your face fresh and clean</li>
            <li>It cleaned my face and left it feeling so smooth and nice.</li>
            <li>I keep getting more and more compliments every day on my skin and some recent pics from a party proved it to me beyond a doubt.</li>
            <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent and doesn&#x27;t really give my skin a nice glow.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now and my skin looks clear, smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li>No stinging and no unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li>great product use it everyday.</li>
            <li>This product is closest to my old favorite.</li>
            <li>But this is by far even better.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling smooth and clean, but not tight.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle and non-drying, but also leaves a really clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>This cleanser is easy to use, thanks to the built in pump, and really strips off the make-up without damaging my skin.  </li>
            <li>but if you have sensitive skin the formula may be to strong.</li>
            <li>Frist time I really used any products for this and my wife is loving these products and we are working out how to advance to the next stages</li>
            <li>I use it with two other products that were recommended by Olay and am very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle and never dries out my skin.  </li>
            <li>The first in years.  </li>
            <li>I actually like this combination of products better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty pricey for soap.</li>
            <li>I can even use this this in hot summer months-without any breakouts.  </li>
            <li>I like foaming cleanser and have tried so many different ones and decided to try the Olay Regenerist cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I have many of such cleansers at home, but I find myself going back to this one more often than not.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and this is perfect, cleans very well without stripping the skin or leaving that tight dry feeling.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, especially in hot and humid weather, but this cleanser keeps my face soft and breakout-free in all kinds of weather.  </li>
            <li>Face feels clean, and not tight.</li>
            <li>At first this made my face red and seemed to strong.</li>
            <li>This makes my very oily skin very controlled!</li>
            <li>and I love this and will keep using it as long as the formulation does not change!</li>
            <li>My favorite product used in the past is no longer available.</li>
            <li>Sometimes have a hard time finding this in the stores, so this was a good idea to buy two.</li>
            <li>and I have very oily skin.  </li>
            <li>This was recommended for my skin profile on the Olay site, however despite not being a real foam cleanser,  I am still using it (about 10 days)- and expecting it will do what it is supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I am very picky about what I use.</li>
            <li>so much so that I used Ivory soap, no makeup, no sunscreen into my 40s.</li>
            <li>I use the Olay age defying creams, and really like the way my skin feels, so I figured I&#x27;d try this stuff out, too.</li>
            <li>It is gentle for removing eye make up, but sometimes does not get all foundation off.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>I really prefer Clinique&#x27;s Foaming Face Wash for $19.99.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cleanser!</li>
            <li>After using for a month straight I saw no change in the overal appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is clean but not dry.  </li>
            <li>Nothing noticeably special or different (except the bottle) from most other face wash/cleansers I&#x27;ve bought for much cheaper.</li>
            <li>This cleanser makes my skin feel very smooth and clean not dry and tight.  </li>
            <li>I got this for the \\&quot;micro-purifying\\&quot; bit because I&#x27;m admittedly kind of lazy in the winter at night washing my face before bed</li>
            <li>Now that I am a full grown senior male</li>
            <li>but the cleanser would not come out once I pushed the top down.</li>
            <li>my skin is firmer,spots and wrinkles are less noticeable and have a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>I get the Olay for my older age and let me tell you, for the price</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think a more expensive product could work any better.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The product came in a timely manner, is of high quality, and backed by an accommodating seller.</li>
            <li>Since both bottles had the broken pumpers, I have no idea if it would have been better in the original bottle, but I doubt it.</li>
            <li>does not dry out my skin, my fine lines have  diminished considerably, I am 30 years old, with very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I am very skeptical about beauty products in general and even more when they claimed to help with wrinkles and un_even skin color; but I have to admitt my face returned to the way is used to be before pregnant, better</li>
            <li>I purchased the product with other two regenerist products: microsculpting cream and regenesit serum fragance free day cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always hesitant to try new cleansers, because I have somewhat oily skin that is prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a cleanser that would get my face really clean without making it feel dry and tight, and I wanted it to help with the fine lines.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin squeaky clean, but it is a little pricey for me even though the container is large and lasts longer than the Olay pump bottle.  </li>
            <li>I like it and am willing to pay extra for this step in skin care.</li>
            <li>I do love this product but the price has climbed excessively - even for 2 bottles.  </li>
            <li>This is the only face cleaner I have used that left my face feeling clean and not heavy with soap residue.</li>
            <li>I turned to Oil of Olay because my skin was dry and just not feeling right.  </li>
            <li>I am very prone to acne and after the initial breakout you get whenever you try something new, my face has been clear -I</li>
            <li>I put it in the shower to wash all of me, but it&#x27;s a huge waste since it absorbs into the washcloth, and I can&#x27;t even tell if it&#x27;s getting on me,</li>
            <li>my face feel cleaner, make up clear</li>
            <li>Im 36y old and</li>
            <li>I had to put it in one of my old cleanser dispenser.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin-</li>
            <li>This cleanser has surprised me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 32 years old.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had oily, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Although it made my skin feel smooth after I use it I get the same result with other products.</li>
            <li>It is more like a creamy liquid soap wash very little lather and definitely not foam, a different feel and after effect than a real foaming wash.  </li>
            <li>Usually it works just fine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on my sensitive dry skin</li>
            <li>People actually comment on how young I look.</li>
            <li>I usually buy the original face wash in the blue bottle.  </li>
            <li>Does not dry out my skin in cooler weather, either.</li>
            <li>Does not dry out skin.</li>

            <li> They&#x27;ve been kind to my skin</li>
            <li> I love a clean face and this makes mine feel and look great without any residue, plus it is not overdrying.</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly and in good order.</li>
            <li> I love Olay and I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this face wash.</li>
            <li> This face is ok.</li>
            <li> Plus I love its scent</li>
            <li> When I wake up my skin feels and looks better.  </li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I look forward to using more Olay products.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any magic though.</li>
            <li> Olay has been a top product for many years, and I don&#x27;t think that will ever change.</li>
            <li> Of all these products, this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels after I wash it.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Use morning and night, love it.</li>
            <li> I needed something that would remove makeup more thoroughly</li>
            <li> This surely gets an A+.</li>
            <li> I am pleased to have been an Olay user for many years.</li>
            <li> It acts more like lotion than soap, and it makes zero suds when you wash, so you can&#x27;t even tell where it is on your skin.</li>
            <li> Great cleanser left skin feeling smooth and great scent</li>
            <li> Winning combo.</li>
            <li> but there are so many too choose from.</li>
            <li> This works better than most I have found.  </li>
            <li> I use all Olay products for my skin and my skin never looked better.  </li>
            <li> I love all of the Olay Regenerist products.  </li>
            <li> The smell is okay for me.  </li>
            <li> I use it with a sonic cleaner and have been highly satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li> I plan to buy more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok product.</li>
            <li> I really love the pump container--</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the way it leaves me feeling refreshed.  </li>
            <li> I used with regenerist micro sculpting cream and was hoping for better results.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in the store, and getting it through Amazon Subscribe &amp; Save</li>
            <li> This foaming cleanser is my favorite face wash.  </li>
            <li> I would list the other products I am using, but instead recommend visiting the olay website and entering your own preferences to get a combination that will work best for you.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s original soap in there, making a nice foam, but this stuff just blurts out, with zero foam.</li>
            <li> Nice clean scent and minimized my pores.  </li>
            <li> The price is getting too high great stuff now what?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good cleanser, but very gentle on my skin as well.</li>
            <li> Great cleanser for normal aging skin and</li>
            <li> Smells pretty good.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to &#x27;lock the top&#x27; and travel.  </li>
            <li> Olay Regenerist Advanced Anti-Aging Micro-Purifying Foam Cleanser is one of the best facial cleansers I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Great cleanser for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My daughters (in their 30s) used it at my home and loved it so much that they are now using it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping &amp; good prices.  </li>
            <li> Cleans your skin leaving it feeling smooth and very clean.  </li>
            <li> and it lathers up easily and rinses off well.</li>
            <li> It had worked fine with</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant fragrance and leaves my skin feeling soft.  </li>
            <li> It lathers nicely and cleans well, but, don&#x27;t really see any visible changes with use.</li>
            <li> Makes skin smooth and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> Smooth and moist.</li>
            <li> Gentle cleansing, nice foam.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Even if you&#x27;re young, it&#x27;s never to soon to take good care of your skin.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I have used the higher priced items and this is more than sufficient.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get that really clean feeling</li>
            <li> feel great after wards...doesn&#x27;t dry my face</li>
            <li> It does seem to clean my face well, no drying.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day and it leaves your face feeling clean.  </li>
            <li> The foaming cleanser makes my skin feel clean.  </li>
            <li> The Olay Regenerist probably cleans as well, but it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling as clean.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clean well, the micro cleaning the label refers to seems to be a lie</li>
            <li> Paired with daily moisturizer, makes a good combo and prevents drying out.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li> but I do not believe it works better than gentle soaps or takes the pace of moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> I love Olay products and like to use the whole package of items that go together.</li>
            <li> will leave your face fresh and clean</li>
            <li> It cleaned my face and left it feeling so smooth and nice.</li>
            <li> I keep getting more and more compliments every day on my skin and some recent pics from a party proved it to me beyond a doubt.</li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent and doesn&#x27;t really give my skin a nice glow.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now and my skin looks clear, smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li> No stinging and no unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> great product use it everyday.</li>
            <li> This product is closest to my old favorite.</li>
            <li> But this is by far even better.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling smooth and clean, but not tight.  </li>
            <li> It is gentle and non-drying, but also leaves a really clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> This cleanser is easy to use, thanks to the built in pump, and really strips off the make-up without damaging my skin.  </li>
            <li> but if you have sensitive skin the formula may be to strong.</li>
            <li> Frist time I really used any products for this and my wife is loving these products and we are working out how to advance to the next stages</li>
            <li> I use it with two other products that were recommended by Olay and am very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle and never dries out my skin.  </li>
            <li> The first in years.  </li>
            <li> I actually like this combination of products better.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty pricey for soap.</li>
            <li> I can even use this this in hot summer months-without any breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I like foaming cleanser and have tried so many different ones and decided to try the Olay Regenerist cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I have many of such cleansers at home, but I find myself going back to this one more often than not.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and this is perfect, cleans very well without stripping the skin or leaving that tight dry feeling.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, especially in hot and humid weather, but this cleanser keeps my face soft and breakout-free in all kinds of weather.  </li>
            <li> Face feels clean, and not tight.</li>
            <li> At first this made my face red and seemed to strong.</li>
            <li> This makes my very oily skin very controlled!</li>
            <li> and I love this and will keep using it as long as the formulation does not change!</li>
            <li> My favorite product used in the past is no longer available.</li>
            <li> Sometimes have a hard time finding this in the stores, so this was a good idea to buy two.</li>
            <li> and I have very oily skin.  </li>
            <li> This was recommended for my skin profile on the Olay site, however despite not being a real foam cleanser,  I am still using it (about 10 days)- and expecting it will do what it is supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I am very picky about what I use.</li>
            <li> so much so that I used Ivory soap, no makeup, no sunscreen into my 40s.</li>
            <li> I use the Olay age defying creams, and really like the way my skin feels, so I figured I&#x27;d try this stuff out, too.</li>
            <li> It is gentle for removing eye make up, but sometimes does not get all foundation off.</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> I really prefer Clinique&#x27;s Foaming Face Wash for $19.99.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cleanser!</li>
            <li> After using for a month straight I saw no change in the overal appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is clean but not dry.  </li>
            <li> Nothing noticeably special or different (except the bottle) from most other face wash/cleansers I&#x27;ve bought for much cheaper.</li>
            <li> This cleanser makes my skin feel very smooth and clean not dry and tight.  </li>
            <li> I got this for the \\&quot;micro-purifying\\&quot; bit because I&#x27;m admittedly kind of lazy in the winter at night washing my face before bed</li>
            <li> Now that I am a full grown senior male</li>
            <li> but the cleanser would not come out once I pushed the top down.</li>
            <li> my skin is firmer,spots and wrinkles are less noticeable and have a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> I get the Olay for my older age and let me tell you, for the price</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think a more expensive product could work any better.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The product came in a timely manner, is of high quality, and backed by an accommodating seller.</li>
            <li> Since both bottles had the broken pumpers, I have no idea if it would have been better in the original bottle, but I doubt it.</li>
            <li> does not dry out my skin, my fine lines have  diminished considerably, I am 30 years old, with very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I am very skeptical about beauty products in general and even more when they claimed to help with wrinkles and un_even skin color; but I have to admitt my face returned to the way is used to be before pregnant, better</li>
            <li> I purchased the product with other two regenerist products: microsculpting cream and regenesit serum fragance free day cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always hesitant to try new cleansers, because I have somewhat oily skin that is prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cleanser that would get my face really clean without making it feel dry and tight, and I wanted it to help with the fine lines.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin squeaky clean, but it is a little pricey for me even though the container is large and lasts longer than the Olay pump bottle.  </li>
            <li> I like it and am willing to pay extra for this step in skin care.</li>
            <li> I do love this product but the price has climbed excessively - even for 2 bottles.  </li>
            <li> This is the only face cleaner I have used that left my face feeling clean and not heavy with soap residue.</li>
            <li> I turned to Oil of Olay because my skin was dry and just not feeling right.  </li>
            <li> I am very prone to acne and after the initial breakout you get whenever you try something new, my face has been clear -I</li>
            <li> I put it in the shower to wash all of me, but it&#x27;s a huge waste since it absorbs into the washcloth, and I can&#x27;t even tell if it&#x27;s getting on me,</li>
            <li> my face feel cleaner, make up clear</li>
            <li> Im 36y old and</li>
            <li> I had to put it in one of my old cleanser dispenser.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin-</li>
            <li> This cleanser has surprised me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 32 years old.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had oily, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Although it made my skin feel smooth after I use it I get the same result with other products.</li>
            <li> It is more like a creamy liquid soap wash very little lather and definitely not foam, a different feel and after effect than a real foaming wash.  </li>
            <li> Usually it works just fine.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle on my sensitive dry skin</li>
            <li> People actually comment on how young I look.</li>
            <li> I usually buy the original face wash in the blue bottle.  </li>
            <li> Does not dry out my skin in cooler weather, either.</li>
            <li> Does not dry out skin.</li>
            <li> so easy to just a little when you need it and not have to mess with trying to open a lid and squeeze anything out when your hands are wet.  </li>
            <li> I have mixed skin type, and I don&#x27;t find any over dry or oily spots after using it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am one that had spent the $80 on Lancome and see no reason to go back.  </li>
            <li> Cleans face but doesnt leave it dry.  </li>
            <li> Being over 60 and living in AZ tends to dry my face</li>
            <li> Keeps skin moist without feeling oily.&lt;br /&gt;Never leaves skin feeling dry &amp; itchy.</li>
            <li> I got this when I was tired of spending so much money for facial cleansers.  </li>
            <li> I ordered two, to save on S&amp;H.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got them fast enough, but they were packed loose, and both bottles pumps were broken, so I couldn&#x27;t use them, other than just dumping it out onto a washcloth, and that&#x27;s a waste, so I emptied a different foaming pump bottle, and poured it in that.</li>
            <li> , i did sense a little residue left.</li>
            <li> The foaming cleanser is a thick liquid, cleans well but rinses completely.  </li>
            <li> This product does not leave my skin dry and tight.  </li>
            <li> and I only have to use a small amount each time I wash my face.</li>
            <li> As Amazon could no longer find the other face wash I used, they recommended Olay Regenerist  </li>
            <li> /&gt;the other product I was using.  </li>
            <li> No funny smell</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t anything that makes this stand out from the other drug store cleansers I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li> I have used other olay products, but this hands down one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> You do not need to buy those expensive products this really works.</li>
            <li> much less doing anything.&lt;br</li>
            <li> with a few other Olay products, I do not need to get fillers......yet!</li>
            <li> My face was dull, dry and flaky, it has never been like that.</li>
            <li> I am almost 40 and wanted something a little gentler than the stuff I have been using.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> /&gt;4 stars only, due to the disappointment in expectations.  </li>
            <li> and I have no more dryness,dullness, flaky skin..</li>
            <li> I am not sure I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> i had to rate it a one because it made my face red and burn sorry it was not for me</li>
            <li> I like it as well if not better than</li>
            <li> I do like it but not necessarily more than some others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Still not sure, just started using this product a month ago.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty disappointed, and hardly ever use it.</li>
            <li> It is not very good at removing makeup on your face.</li>
            <li> I have always fought acne even into my 50&#x27;s, and had dull skin.  </li>
            <li> I had been using and much less expensive.  </li>
            <li> I am somewhat disappointed with this wash since I expected a foaming wash as it is labelled.  </li>
            <li> I was desperate to find a solution so started to try baby lotion, vaseline, aquaphor, etc to mosturize my face since my face moisturizer wasnt working at all.</li>
            <li> Perhaps this was just a bad batch of foaming cleanser?</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s cold!)</li>
            <li> very disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find it in stores anywhere????  The price is getting too high great stuff now what?</li>
            <li> I used this product one time and felt the difference in my skin.  It cleaned my face and left it feeling so smooth and nice.</li>
            <li> I love Olay and I love this product.  I think it is a great cleanser.  I will buy it again and again</li>
            <li> I am using the regnerist lines and getting great results.  I am somewhat disappointed with this wash since I expected a foaming wash as it is labelled.  It is more like a creamy liquid soap wash very little lather and definitely not foam, a different feel and after effect than a real foaming wash.  I don&#x27;t get that really clean feeling and I have very oily skin.  This was recommended for my skin profile on the Olay site, however despite not being a real foam cleanser,  I am still using it (about 10 days)- and expecting it will do what it is supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars only, due to the disappointment in expectations.  Will update review when this bottle is done.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash. feel great after wards...doesn&#x27;t dry my face</li>
            <li> This face is ok. It does seem to clean my face well, no drying. I have oily skin so I am very picky about what I use.</li>
            <li> I got this for the \\&quot;micro-purifying\\&quot; bit because I&#x27;m admittedly kind of lazy in the winter at night washing my face before bed (it&#x27;s cold!) and the lack of a good cleansing at night wreaks havoc for me. This product (and I feel like I can validate this 100% after 3 weeks of use) is supposed to help prepare your skin perfectly for overnight treatment products (I started being faithful to Regenerist as well along with their cleanser).  I keep getting more and more compliments every day on my skin and some recent pics from a party proved it to me beyond a doubt.</li>
            <li> I purchased the product with other two regenerist products: microsculpting cream and regenesit serum fragance free day cream. After 3 months of giving birth my face started to change I think because the water and weather here in  tx and cause of the hormonal change as well. My face was dull, dry and flaky, it has never been like that. I was desperate to find a solution so started to try baby lotion, vaseline, aquaphor, etc to mosturize my face since my face moisturizer wasnt working at all. My sister sent me an amazon gift card for mothers day so I decided to buy the 3 products since they say it helps to regenerate the skin cells and the microsculpting helps with firmness, elasticity, wrinkles and even your skin tone I said to myself i will give it a try. I started only a month ago and I have no more dryness,dullness, flaky skin..my skin is firmer,spots and wrinkles are less noticeable and have a healthy glow. I am very skeptical about beauty products in general and even more when they claimed to help with wrinkles and un_even skin color; but I have to admitt my face returned to the way is used to be before pregnant, better yet my skin glows, and I look younger than before. Im 36y old and people always think Im 25y so I always take care of my face so they keep on thinking that...these products have helped me a lot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always hesitant to try new cleansers, because I have somewhat oily skin that is prone to breakouts. You&#x27;d think by the age of 41 that wouldn&#x27;t be a problem anymore. I was looking for a cleanser that would get my face really clean without making it feel dry and tight, and I wanted it to help with the fine lines. This cleanser does it all. Plus I love its scent and I only have to use a small amount each time I wash my face.</li>
            <li> I loved this product.  I turned to Oil of Olay because my skin was dry and just not feeling right.  This product does not leave my skin dry and tight.  My complexion is fresher looking and I can see a difference in the problem areas.  I use this at night only with the regenerist serum.  When I wake up my skin feels and looks better.  You do not need to buy those expensive products this really works.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.  It is gentle and non-drying, but also leaves a really clean feeling.  I use it with my Clarisonic.  My daughters (in their 30s) used it at my home and loved it so much that they are now using it.</li>
            <li> This face cleanser removes all of my makeup.  I do not wear eye makeup however, so I can&#x27;t vouch for that.  It&#x27;s gentle on my sensitive dry skin and I&#x27;ve been using it for several years now.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this cleanser.  However, it doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent and doesn&#x27;t really give my skin a nice glow.  It lathers nicely and cleans well, but, don&#x27;t really see any visible changes with use.</li>
            <li> I bought this after going through the Olay website and having it recommended.  It has a very nice, light scent, great lather, and is easy to rinse.  It leaves my face feeling smooth and clean, but not tight.  I am almost 40 and wanted something a little gentler than the stuff I have been using.  I am very prone to acne and after the initial breakout you get whenever you try something new, my face has been clear -I even got a complement.  The first in years.  I use it with two other products that were recommended by Olay and am very satisfied.  I am one that had spent the $80 on Lancome and see no reason to go back.  I actually like this combination of products better.  I would list the other products I am using, but instead recommend visiting the olay website and entering your own preferences to get a combination that will work best for you.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is easy to use, thanks to the built in pump, and really strips off the make-up without damaging my skin.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now and my skin looks clear, smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this cleanser but the cleanser would not come out once I pushed the top down. I had to put it in one of my old cleanser dispenser. I am not sure I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> i had to rate it a one because it made my face red and burn sorry it was not for me</li>
            <li> This is the best cleanser for my face i have ever used and i have tried a lot! I have combination skin and this is perfect, cleans very well without stripping the skin or leaving that tight dry feeling. It takes off every bit of make-up, including eye make-up and doesn&#x27;t leave those mascara rings under my eyes. No stinging and no unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Nice clean scent and minimized my pores.  Makes skin smooth and refreshed.  I look forward to using more Olay products. Paired with daily moisturizer, makes a good combo and prevents drying out.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser.  I use it twice a day and it leaves your face feeling clean.  Great product to try..</li>
            <li> I have an anti-aging skin regiment and Olay&#x27;s Regenerist-Advanced Foaming Cleanser is a good start for cleansing the skin.  I find it is just as good as the Perricone MD I had been using and much less expensive.  Great cleanser for normal aging skin and with a few other Olay products, I do not need to get fillers......yet!</li>
            <li> I use this twice a day and follow it with Oil of Olay. My skin feels good. I don&#x27;t see any magic though. My wrinkles are still there !</li>
            <li> What can I say? Olay has been a top product for many years, and I don&#x27;t think that will ever change. It&#x27;s #1 for me!</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin- so much so that I used Ivory soap, no makeup, no sunscreen into my 40s. I recently decided to upgrade that skincare routine, and chose the Olay regenerist products: this cleanser, the exfoliating cleanser, the eye cream, the serum, and the micro sculpting cream. I also bought the two stage peel kit for use once a week. So far so good. Of all these products, this one is my favorite. I love the way my skin feels after I wash it.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.  It has a pleasant fragrance and leaves my skin feeling soft.  It&#x27;s very gentle and never dries out my skin.  This is a great deal on a two pack and have purchased it many times.</li>
            <li> As Amazon could no longer find the other face wash I used, they recommended Olay Regenerist  I like it as well if not better than&lt;br /&gt;the other product I was using.  Cleans face but doesnt leave it dry.  Use morning and night, love it.</li>
            <li> I love a clean face and this makes mine feel and look great without any residue, plus it is not overdrying.</li>
            <li> I am sold on this cleanser.  I have sensitive skin, especially in hot and humid weather, but this cleanser keeps my face soft and breakout-free in all kinds of weather.  Does not dry out my skin in cooler weather, either.</li>
            <li> Was not as deep cleansing as I had hoped it would be.  I needed something that would remove makeup more thoroughly</li>
            <li> Cleans your skin leaving it feeling smooth and very clean.  Olay in my opinion has the best products available to take care of your skin. This surely gets an A+.</li>
            <li> This cleanser has surprised me.  I&#x27;ve never been inclined to rate one before, because they all seemed to do the job, so what.  This one however is noticeably different in how my skin feels afterward, even the following morning.  There also seems to be a cumulative effect as I continue to use it, with my skin feeling softer.</li>
            <li> For some reason, the cleanser gave me a rash.  Usually it works just fine.  Perhaps this was just a bad batch of foaming cleanser?</li>
            <li> It does just what it claims. I am pleased to have been an Olay user for many years. This products not only cleans, but makes skin look younger</li>
            <li> I havent use it, so i cant say if its good or not. But i will update it as soon as i started using it</li>
            <li> Olay Regenerist Advanced Anti-Aging Micro-Purifying Foam Cleanser is one of the best facial cleansers I&#x27;ve ever used.  Being over 60 and living in AZ tends to dry my face but I do not like cream cleansers as I tend to feel greasy afterwards.  The foaming cleanser is a thick liquid, cleans well but rinses completely.  I will continue to purchase it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> i wouldn&#x27;t say it was the BEST. but i will say that its good. my face felt cleaner, i did sense a little residue left. i pushed it off as just an  something relating to the anti ageing properties.</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly and in good order. This face wash works well with 40+ skin - that is still oily  - but also helps prevent wrinkles...</li>
            <li> Very nice.  Leaves your skin feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I always use the regenerist line.  This is a good product at a good price.</li>
            <li> I use the Olay age defying creams, and really like the way my skin feels, so I figured I&#x27;d try this stuff out, too. I particularly liked the idea of the foaming, because that helps on not wasting it. It&#x27;s pretty pricey for soap. I ordered two, to save on S&amp;H.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got them fast enough, but they were packed loose, and both bottles pumps were broken, so I couldn&#x27;t use them, other than just dumping it out onto a washcloth, and that&#x27;s a waste, so I emptied a different foaming pump bottle, and poured it in that. It had worked fine with it&#x27;s original soap in there, making a nice foam, but this stuff just blurts out, with zero foam. It acts more like lotion than soap, and it makes zero suds when you wash, so you can&#x27;t even tell where it is on your skin. I put it in the shower to wash all of me, but it&#x27;s a huge waste since it absorbs into the washcloth, and I can&#x27;t even tell if it&#x27;s getting on me, much less doing anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty disappointed, and hardly ever use it. Since both bottles had the broken pumpers, I have no idea if it would have been better in the original bottle, but I doubt it. It won&#x27;t even suds at all, no matter what I do, so I can&#x27;t see how it was ever going to foam up, regardless of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be buying this again, and if you like the foaming part, skip this one. No foam.</li>
            <li> This cleanser makes my skin feel very smooth and clean not dry and tight.  I can even use this this in hot summer months-without any breakouts.  I love this stuff!  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping &amp; good prices.  thank you!</li>
            <li> I have always been proactive health, my mom was, so I grew up this way.Now that I am a full grown senior male I feel  I need some assistant around the eyes and  under the chin. Something that truly works, so HELP ME OUT! Any product.</li>
            <li> This is the only face cleaner I have used that left my face feeling clean and not heavy with soap residue. Love it!!</li>
            <li> foam is the best for your face i heard so i bought these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;these work just as described and will leave your face fresh and clean</li>
            <li> This is a really good product and I cannot always find it in the stores. It&#x27;s a good cleanser, but very gentle on my skin as well. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> my face feel cleaner, make up clear and I don&#x27;t have to use astringent</li>
            <li> great product use it everyday. Does not dry out skin.</li>
            <li> Great cleanser left skin feeling smooth and great scent</li>
            <li> I like it , good smell</li>
            <li> This cleanser is the best. Leaves my skin smooth and fresh. I combine it with their micro sculpting cream. Winning combo.</li>
            <li> I would never buy this again.  It is not very good at removing makeup on your face. It is inexpensive, but I am going&lt;br /&gt;back to my Estee Lauder.</li>
            <li> Smells good great cleanser for my face.. great value for price.  No complaints!</li>
            <li> Kind to my face while cleansing it sufficiently. Dermatologist recommended the &amp;#34;brand&amp;#34;...but there are so many too choose from. My favorite product used in the past is no longer available. And, having been to the dermatologist because of allergies to some products since tried, Regenerist has been the answer. This product is closest to my old favorite.</li>
            <li> This works better than most I have found.  It is gentle for removing eye make up, but sometimes does not get all foundation off.</li>
            <li> I have used other olay products, but this hands down one of my favorites. does not dry out my skin, my fine lines have  diminished considerably, I am 30 years old, with very sensitive skin and I love this and will keep using it as long as the formulation does not change!</li>
            <li> Bought two. I really liked it.</li>
            <li> At first this made my face red and seemed to strong. I only use it a couple times a week now but notice a difference the days I use it. My face is cleaner and actually feels tighter. I really like this product but if you have sensitive skin the formula may be to strong.</li>
            <li> I use all Olay products for my skin and my skin never looked better.  I get the Olay for my older age and let me tell you, for the price it&#x27;s a steal.  I don&#x27;t think a more expensive product could work any better.  The foaming cleanser makes my skin feel clean.  After that I use the serum and then the eye and face moisturizer.  Together they work great.  Even if you&#x27;re young, it&#x27;s never to soon to take good care of your skin.  Olay makes that an affordable option.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST cleanser I have ever used! This makes my very oily skin very controlled! I just use it morning and night and it keeps my face from shining. I love it! I will not keep searching for the best cleanser for my face any longer...I have found it!</li>
            <li> It does the job of cleaning my skin but I think I like the one with the exfoliate in it.  I got another tube of the cleanser with exfoliation and now use it once or twice a week alternating with the foaming cleanser.  I love all of the Olay Regenerist products.  They&#x27;ve been kind to my skin and I think using the products have given my skin a healthier look.</li>
            <li> I like foaming cleanser and have tried so many different ones and decided to try the Olay Regenerist cleanser.  I do like it but not necessarily more than some others I&#x27;ve tried.  I really prefer Clinique&#x27;s Foaming Face Wash for $19.99.  It leaves my skin squeaky clean, but it is a little pricey for me even though the container is large and lasts longer than the Olay pump bottle.  The Olay Regenerist probably cleans as well, but it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling as clean.  The smell is okay for me.  Some cleansers don&#x27;t have a good smell.  It is quicker to use a pump than a tube if that makes any difference to you.</li>
            <li> Great product and it&#x27;s easy to &#x27;lock the top&#x27; and travel.  I am 59 and my skin looks like 30!</li>
            <li> I use it and find it convenient and the texture an fragrance are pleasant.  I consider it a luxury but I do not believe it works better than gentle soaps or takes the pace of moisturizers.  I do get lots of complements on my skin (for my age) and perhaps this sort of indulgence on the skin does pay off over time.  I like it and am willing to pay extra for this step in skin care.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT, GOOD CARE OF SELLER. I RECOMMEND 100%</li>
            <li> I have used the higher priced items and this is more than sufficient.  I use it with a sonic cleaner and have been highly satisfied with the results.  I plan to buy more.</li>
            <li> Sometimes have a hard time finding this in the stores, so this was a good idea to buy two. I love Olay products and like to use the whole package of items that go together. Makes my skin feel and look great.</li>
            <li> Still not sure, just started using this product a month ago. So far so good. I will continue to use it for a time &amp; see how it goes.</li>
            <li> Great cleanser for sensitive skin. Keeps skin moist without feeling oily.&lt;br /&gt;Never leaves skin feeling dry &amp; itchy.I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Frist time I really used any products for this and my wife is loving these products and we are working out how to advance to the next stages</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok product. Nothing noticeably special or different (except the bottle) from most other face wash/cleansers I&#x27;ve bought for much cheaper. Never saw any results or improvements with my skin after use.</li>
            <li> Just a good night and day cleanser for your face.  I really love the pump container--so easy to just a little when you need it and not have to mess with trying to open a lid and squeeze anything out when your hands are wet.  No funny smell and it lathers up easily and rinses off well.</li>
            <li> I love this product by Olay!  It smells SO good!  I usually buy the original face wash in the blue bottle.  But this is by far even better.  I love the smell and the way it leaves me feeling refreshed.  It also does a great job cleaning.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Cleans well without drying my skin - even removes mascara!!! I use it everyday. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I do love this product but the price has climbed excessively - even for 2 bottles.  At this price I can move to Lancome and Pevonia - what gives I wonder?</li>
            <li> I bought this cleanser seeing all the reviews here on amazon, but did not like it at all. It doesn&#x27;t clean well, the micro cleaning the label refers to seems to be a lie, the cleanser didn&#x27;t even take off a basic tinted moisturizer. very disappointed.</li>
            <li> My skin has not looked this good in years.  I have always fought acne even into my 50&#x27;s, and had dull skin.  I highly recommend this cleanser!</li>
            <li> Although it made my skin feel smooth after I use it I get the same result with other products. After using for a month straight I saw no change in the overal appearance of my skin. I used with regenerist micro sculpting cream and was hoping for better results.  I&#x27;m 32 years old.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  My skin is clean but not dry.  The product is lasts and lasts.  It is part of my regular skin care routine now!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to combat signs of aging, and to care for my skin. The product came in a timely manner, is of high quality, and backed by an accommodating seller.</li>
            <li> Yup, it foams.  No big deal.  Smells pretty good.  Takes off my makeup, but not my waterproof mascara.  There isn&#x27;t anything that makes this stand out from the other drug store cleansers I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li> I got this when I was tired of spending so much money for facial cleansers.  I am going to stick with this product for a while.</li>
            <li> I do notice my skin is clearer and tighter after washing it with this product. I have many of such cleansers at home, but I find myself going back to this one more often than not. I have mixed skin type, and I don&#x27;t find any over dry or oily spots after using it.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Use it every evening before bed. Keeps my skin from drying out. Smooth and moist. Would not be without it.</li>
            <li> I use one of those face buffers with this and my skin has never looked so good. People actually comment on how young I look. I&#x27;ve always had oily, sensitive skin. If this gets discontinued I&#x27;m going to cry. I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in the store, and getting it through Amazon Subscribe &amp; Save means I don&#x27;t even have to think about it.</li>
            <li> Gentle cleansing, nice foam. Face feels clean, and not tight.</li>
            <li> This foaming cleanser is my favorite face wash.  I have been using Olay for years and years and have used the regenerest since it came out.  I am 62 and  have almost no wrinkles.  I attribute it to Oil of Olay.</li>
