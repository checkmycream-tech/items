    <ol>
            <li>They are great!  </li>
            <li>Better pricing too!!!</li>
            <li>Very good</li>
            <li>They are a great size to take when traveling for laptops, iPads, iPhones, etc.</li>
            <li>They work great on my glasses and on my computer screens.</li>
            <li>These work great.</li>
            <li>They are also good for your smartphone screens, laptops, monitors.  </li>
            <li>They do a good job of cleaning my lenses, notice I said good.  </li>
            <li>Totally love these wipes!</li>
            <li>My Mom gets moisturizer on her lenses and this method cleans her glasses nicely</li>
            <li>We use these wipes to clean our monitor and video screens, which they are great for.  </li>
            <li>I then found that using a regular lens cleaning cloth (made from cloth) just after I use the Flents wipe on my glasses cleans my lenses perfectly.</li>
            <li>We have been looking all over for this product glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The one that bothers me the most is my glasses since the streaks are</li>
            <li>more prominent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but these are moderately okay.</li>
            <li>I could not be more dissatisfied.  </li>
            <li>I started with the originals which worked much better, but my store stopped selling them.</li>
            <li>I purchased thee because they claim to be biodegradable and better for the environment.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product, this is the first time I have used them and they work great and are very cost effective compared to others.</li>
            <li>They have more of a cloth feel then paper.</li>
            <li>The regular wipes are GREAT!  </li>
            <li>Have purchased this item in store; ordering is more convenient.</li>
            <li>I LOVE about these wipes</li>
            <li>They do work ok at cleaning, they just have to be followed up with some drying with another cloth to get a perfectly clean lense.</li>
            <li>We  love how they clean our glasses and iPads.</li>
            <li>Nice, soft cloths; odor not too strong; do a nice job.</li>
            <li>and really liked them with the exception that they seemed to run out of moisture pretty quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a nice idea, and I really hope Flents can improve upon it.  </li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t find anything better at a reasonable price, I&#x27;ll buy more.</li>
            <li>The fact that they are environmentally friendly was a selling point for me</li>
            <li>I clean my glasses, phones, and tablets with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They also seemed to stay clean longer.  </li>
            <li>I am a SUPER treehugger and when I found these I was ecstatic.</li>
            <li>Its nice that the actual wipes and the cleaning formula are environmentally friendly.  </li>
            <li>EVERY optometrist I have ever talked with about cleaning my glasses has suggested running them under tap water to get off the large deposits of skin oil, dust and dirt, THEN polishing them with a fine cloth and cleaning solution designed for eyewear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These \\&quot;biodegradable\\&quot; wipes are packaged in NON-biodegradable individual packages (kind of defeats the purpose, doesn&#x27;t it?)</li>
            <li>The texture is like a very soft cloth and my glasses are always clean and smudge free.  </li>
            <li>The regular (non-Biodegradable) Flents are unfortunately much better.</li>
            <li>Overall they are okay</li>
            <li>I am glad that they&#x27;re biodegradable so they&#x27;ll go away faster when I throw the entire box of 200 into a landfill at some point.</li>
            <li>This is certainly better than regular plastic packs</li>
            <li>and the other one is a &#x27;tissue&#x27; (a far superior product).</li>
            <li>and on top of it, you have to clean your glasses AGAIN after using these wipes because they don&#x27;t dry fast enough or something</li>
            <li>Although, the packaging is about the same size these wipes are more \\&quot;wet\\&quot; than I expected and therefore do NOT leave a streak free</li>
            <li>As most of the other reviews say, these lense cleaning cloths leave spots and streaks on my glasses when I use them.</li>
            <li>The wipe itself is stronger than the other brands I have tried and allowed me to get much more of the build-up off my lenses.</li>
            <li>often skip the tap and simply use one wipe to gently remove large debris, then a second to do the fine polish.  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>That is great, but unfortunately they don&#x27;t work as well as the originals.  </li>
            <li>I may give them another try if they come out with a \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; version.</li>
            <li>I am not certain exactly what the cleaning cloth is made of, but it feels MUCH softer and gentler than either the Bosch &amp; Lomb or Zeiss ones</li>
            <li>Only product that I know of that is large &amp; soft fabric like.  </li>
            <li>Wipe &#x27;N Clear Pre-moistened Lens Wipes 100 ea]]</li>
            <li>They claim to be \\&quot;anti-streak for crystal clear</li>
            <li>I can see clearly again.  </li>
            <li>Unless I have a separate soft lens to buff them immediately after wetting with the Flents cloth, vision is spotted and anything but \\&quot;crystal clear.\\&quot;    </li>
            <li>If they are almost completely rubbing alcohol based, they evaporate in a matter of seconds.  </li>
            <li>They are in fact, and, more importantly, the cleaning agent is MUCH less caustic than most of the cleaners I have seen in the past.  </li>
            <li>so you have to waste a tissue or something else to get them clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These wipes leave the surface wet and although they are good for a laptop screen because of the larger surface area they are too moist and NOT GOOD for glasses, a camera screen, iPod screen, cell phone screen or CD&#x27;s  (as pictured on the box).</li>
            <li>, I think I would use the regular Wipe N Clear instead of these</li>
            <li>/&gt;These, by contrast, are flexible, soft and relatively long lived.  </li>

            <li> Now you are left with a dry piece of tissue paper!  </li>
            <li> I hate having anything on my glasses and use these wipes first thing every morning to clean my lenses.</li>
            <li> While they don&#x27;t \\&quot;streak\\&quot; per se, they do dry rapidly and leave \\&quot;water\\&quot; spots all over the lenses.</li>
            <li> It is true that, particularly when the lenses are VERY dirty, they can scratch and leave streaks.  </li>
            <li> Work&#x27;s better than the thin hard ones!</li>
            <li> So these wipes aren&#x27;t a total waste.</li>
            <li> As others have stated, these wipes are too wet, and don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Zeiss feel like wet tissue paper to me.  </li>
            <li> arrived when expected.  </li>
            <li> Did what expected.  </li>
            <li> Not much else to add to a product that states what it will do and does it and arrives when you announced it will and does</li>
            <li> I would have to agree with other reviews about the performance of these wipes.  </li>
            <li> I refuse to use any other eye glass cleaners.</li>
            <li> They cleaned my progressive lenses on my glasses extremely well.  </li>
            <li> They are also cheaper than the other brands.</li>
            <li> Yes, they come in a paper covered foil pack, because they are WET!  </li>
            <li> This is unfortunate because I really wanted to use this product and bought 2 boxes (then returned the unopened box).</li>
            <li> You WILL have to wipe down your items with another cloth afterward if you use these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cleaning solution does not evaporate so quickly as to make it impossible to use them as well.  </li>
            <li> but they are no good for daily use on the items I want it for.</li>
            <li> Also, the green box containing these wipes looks like it was shipped through a war zone -- it is falling apart.  </li>
            <li> I was very unhappy with this at first.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, like other reviewers have stated, they seem to be almost too wet and often leave streaks behind.</li>
            <li> I started with 400 of these suckers and will continue to use them until their gone.</li>
            <li> Paper product &amp;#34;They Say&amp;#34; are not good on lenses, but I like the way they work.</li>
            <li> I hate to say DUH, but doesn&#x27;t that sort of defeat the entire purpose?</li>
            <li> Not ideal.  </li>
            <li> &quot; but unfortunately that has just not been my experience.  </li>
            <li> These are not that expensive.  </li>
            <li> The seller will send you \\&quot;biodegradable\\&quot; wipes in a green box, and the \\&quot;biodegradable\\&quot; wipes are absolutely HORRIBLE.  </li>
            <li> However, the biodegradable ones are terrible, I hate them.  </li>
            <li> These &#x27;biodegradable&#x27; wipes are AWFUL, as everyone says!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Tends to leave streaks on my coated eyeglasses.  The regular (non-Biodegradable) Flents are unfortunately much better.</li>
            <li> As most of the other reviews say, these lense cleaning cloths leave spots and streaks on my glasses when I use them. I was very unhappy with this at first. I then found that using a regular lens cleaning cloth (made from cloth) just after I use the Flents wipe on my glasses cleans my lenses perfectly. My Mom gets moisturizer on her lenses and this method cleans her glasses nicely (the Flents wipe picks up the crud and the wiping cloth just removes the clean fluid left behind). So these wipes aren&#x27;t a total waste. They do work ok at cleaning, they just have to be followed up with some drying with another cloth to get a perfectly clean lense. I hate having anything on my glasses and use these wipes first thing every morning to clean my lenses. I started with 400 of these suckers and will continue to use them until their gone. If I don&#x27;t find anything better at a reasonable price, I&#x27;ll buy more.</li>
            <li> We have been looking all over for this product glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I used to use the regular [[ASIN:B0019D8MMA Flents Wipe &#x27;N Clear Pre-moistened Lens Wipes 100 ea]] and really liked them with the exception that they seemed to run out of moisture pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked these up because I thought they were the same product, just biodegradable. Unfortunately, like other reviewers have stated, they seem to be almost too wet and often leave streaks behind. Overall they are okay and I use them on TV screen, computer screens, camera lenses, Nintendo DS screens and cell phone screens. The one that bothers me the most is my glasses since the streaks are more prominent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given a choice, I think I would use the regular Wipe N Clear instead of these but these are moderately okay.</li>
            <li> The preivous reviewer is correct -- this product is misadvertised.  The seller will send you \\&quot;biodegradable\\&quot; wipes in a green box, and the \\&quot;biodegradable\\&quot; wipes are absolutely HORRIBLE.  They will make your glasses dirtier than they were before.  Also, the green box containing these wipes looks like it was shipped through a war zone -- it is falling apart.  I could not be more dissatisfied.  Beware of this seller!!</li>
            <li> These &#x27;biodegradable&#x27; wipes are AWFUL, as everyone says! I started with the originals which worked much better, but my store stopped selling them. Part of the difference is that one is a &#x27;wipe&#x27; (biodegradable - the wipe only, packaging is NOT biodegradable - go figure!) and the other one is a &#x27;tissue&#x27; (a far superior product). I finally found them at [...] (the manufacturer of both of these products). Better pricing too!!!</li>
            <li> use these every day for work and office...</li>
            <li> As others have stated, these wipes are too wet, and don&#x27;t work. You&#x27;re left with a glass surface swimming in fluid. It will evaporate quickly, but leaves behind residue when it does. I hate to say DUH, but doesn&#x27;t that sort of defeat the entire purpose? I am glad that they&#x27;re biodegradable so they&#x27;ll go away faster when I throw the entire box of 200 into a landfill at some point. And come to think of it: What&#x27;s the point of making a biodegradable wipe when the packet it comes in is not? I guess I will use these for phones, electronics, etc. But not my glasses.</li>
            <li> I am a SUPER treehugger and when I found these I was ecstatic. Then I got the box and opened it. These \\&quot;biodegradable\\&quot; wipes are packaged in NON-biodegradable individual packages (kind of defeats the purpose, doesn&#x27;t it?) and on top of it, you have to clean your glasses AGAIN after using these wipes because they don&#x27;t dry fast enough or something and they leave streaks, smudges and spots so you have to waste a tissue or something else to get them clean. So, don&#x27;t bother wasting your time or money looking at these because they SUCK!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now purchase four boxes of these lens cleaners.  They are great!  The texture is like a very soft cloth and my glasses are always clean and smudge free.  They are also good for your smartphone screens, laptops, monitors.  I use them for all my electronic screens.</li>
            <li> Paper product &amp;#34;They Say&amp;#34; are not good on lenses, but I like the way they work.</li>
            <li> Only product that I know of that is large &amp; soft fabric like.  Work&#x27;s better than the thin hard ones!</li>
            <li> I would have to agree with other reviews about the performance of these wipes.  I purchased thee because they claim to be biodegradable and better for the environment. That is great, but unfortunately they don&#x27;t work as well as the originals.  They claim to be \\&quot;anti-streak for crystal clear vision,\\&quot; but unfortunately that has just not been my experience.  While they don&#x27;t \\&quot;streak\\&quot; per se, they do dry rapidly and leave \\&quot;water\\&quot; spots all over the lenses. Unless I have a separate soft lens to buff them immediately after wetting with the Flents cloth, vision is spotted and anything but \\&quot;crystal clear.\\&quot;    It is a nice idea, and I really hope Flents can improve upon it.  I may give them another try if they come out with a \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; version. Until then I will have to use a different brand such as the Ziess.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product, this is the first time I have used them and they work great and are very cost effective compared to others.</li>
            <li> We use these wipes to clean our monitor and video screens, which they are great for.  They are a great size to take when traveling for laptops, iPads, iPhones, etc.</li>
            <li> Totally love these wipes! We  love how they clean our glasses and iPads. They have more of a cloth feel then paper. I refuse to use any other eye glass cleaners.</li>
            <li> The regular wipes are GREAT!  However, the biodegradable ones are terrible, I hate them.  They leave streaks on your glasses!</li>
            <li> Have purchased this item in store; ordering is more convenient. Nice, soft cloths; odor not too strong; do a nice job.</li>
            <li> I have been using these Wipes for several months. They work great on my glasses and on my computer screens. They are the only wipes I have found that do not smear or leave streaks on my flatscreen monitors. I would recommend these any day.</li>
            <li> These work great. I clean my glasses, phones, and tablets with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only problem is that this is about a 100 year supply!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I have been sharing them!</li>
            <li> Its nice that the actual wipes and the cleaning formula are environmentally friendly.  They cleaned my progressive lenses on my glasses extremely well.  The wipe itself is stronger than the other brands I have tried and allowed me to get much more of the build-up off my lenses. They also seemed to stay clean longer.  They are also cheaper than the other brands.</li>
            <li> I do not understand these people who are concerned about the wipes being biodegradable.  They are in fact, and, more importantly, the cleaning agent is MUCH less caustic than most of the cleaners I have seen in the past.  Yes, they come in a paper covered foil pack, because they are WET!  This is certainly better than regular plastic packs though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, these are a convenience.  I do not always have access to my cleaning chamois and purified water, so I keep these in my gun case, in my car, in my office desk, in my coat pockets, etc.  When I need one on the go, it is always there.  They do a good job of cleaning my lenses, notice I said good.  It is true that, particularly when the lenses are VERY dirty, they can scratch and leave streaks.  That is because there was DIRT on the lens when you started.  EVERY optometrist I have ever talked with about cleaning my glasses has suggested running them under tap water to get off the large deposits of skin oil, dust and dirt, THEN polishing them with a fine cloth and cleaning solution designed for eyewear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I often skip the tap and simply use one wipe to gently remove large debris, then a second to do the fine polish.  These are not that expensive.  Using two or four a week they will still last you an entire year on one box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I LOVE about these wipes is they actually feel like cloth, not paper.  I am not certain exactly what the cleaning cloth is made of, but it feels MUCH softer and gentler than either the Bosch &amp; Lomb or Zeiss ones I have tried.  Zeiss feel like wet tissue paper to me.  It literally crinkles when I fold it.  Not what I am looking for in a cleaning cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These, by contrast, are flexible, soft and relatively long lived.  The cleaning solution does not evaporate so quickly as to make it impossible to use them as well.  That is another problem with some of the alternative brands.  If they are almost completely rubbing alcohol based, they evaporate in a matter of seconds.  Now you are left with a dry piece of tissue paper!  Not ideal.  These Flents stay moist for a bit longer and allow time to get to the crevices and corners of the lenses and frame.  Very good and I highly recommend.  I have been a photographer for over 23 years and these are the only wipes I keep on me anymore.</li>
            <li> arrived when expected.  Did what expected.  I can see clearly again.  Not much else to add to a product that states what it will do and does it and arrives when you announced it will and does</li>
            <li> I bought mine at Costco and thought they would be similar to the wipes that my ophthalmologist gave me for my glasses. Although, the packaging is about the same size these wipes are more \\&quot;wet\\&quot; than I expected and therefore do NOT leave a streak free shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These wipes leave the surface wet and although they are good for a laptop screen because of the larger surface area they are too moist and NOT GOOD for glasses, a camera screen, iPod screen, cell phone screen or CD&#x27;s  (as pictured on the box). You WILL have to wipe down your items with another cloth afterward if you use these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other wipes, like those from my ophthalmologist are not as wet, smaller and the same wipe dries out the surface that it cleans. This is unfortunate because I really wanted to use this product and bought 2 boxes (then returned the unopened box). The fact that they are environmentally friendly was a selling point for me but they are no good for daily use on the items I want it for. Unless they change this I won&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
