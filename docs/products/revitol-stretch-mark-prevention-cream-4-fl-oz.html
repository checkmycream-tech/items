            <li>how they track you lol)</li>
            <li>My results have been remarkable.</li>
            <li>How good is that?</li>
            <li>I am petite with fair skin and EVERYONE in my family gets stretch marks.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>If anything this is just a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I read some good reviews on this product</li>
            <li>This cream is so good.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this item because Revitol is ranked as the number one stretch mark cream on the market and others have given excellent reviews on it.  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased this item because Revitol is ranked as the number one stretch mark cream on the market and others have given excellent reviews on it.</li>
            <li>I know a lot of women use this for much more severe stretch marks after pregnancy, but it worked great for my situation.</li>
            <li>I am a huge believer in this product!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna by more!</li>
            <li>It may not work for everyone, but I am so glad I took the risk!</li>
            <li>But Amazon is amazing and allowed me to purchase 1 tube to test the product.</li>
            <li>so this was an amazing product for me.  </li>
            <li>saw amazing result in  3 weeks.</li>
            <li>It really works great and  i would recommend it to any one who has had a baby or needs to get rid of stretch marks!</li>
            <li>but after 2 weeks of putting it on almost every moment that I can, I&lt;br /&gt;was able to see some good improvement.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice cream.</li>
            <li>Amazon offers the best price for this product!</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Also it is a very good investment to get 2-4 bottles, 2 for newer stretch marks, 4 for older ones.</li>
            <li>My skin is still beautiful and bikini ready.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it worked for some many people, hopefully I&#x27;m one of them.  </li>
            <li>Or when to use for it to be affective the most?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if you would buy lots of it you would see a result.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m better off using Bio oil along with vitamin E oil.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item as many others, based on the reviews.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I am even more motivated to Apply as and when i can...</li>
            <li>But this has lessened the appearance more in two weeks than I thought the 6 weeks</li>
            <li>There are better creams out there.</li>
            <li>I would love to wear a bikini someday.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using another product that works much better.</li>
            <li>I hope ppl have better luck</li>
            <li>I used it every day for more than one month</li>
            <li>and I really love this product.</li>
            <li>a bit to milky and for that price should have been a lot better quality than what it was.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already bought 2 more tubes</li>
            <li>I rub it into my skin and allow it to set in for about 5 minutes (or more if I have time)</li>
            <li>Regardless, I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend a lot of money on this cream.</li>
            <li>I will be spending more and getting a better brand.</li>
            <li>I think this product is ok, I have not been using it the way I should, I will try to be more routine about it.  </li>
            <li>Hope this helps somebody out there :)</li>
            <li>And it take more then one tube to see a difference.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and I have been SO pleased with my results.</li>
            <li>Ok, I saw an Advertisement while I was on FB.</li>
            <li>If you have to, call the company and INQUIRE ABOUT A FREE SAMPLE JAR!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s marketed for cooking, but it kept me stretch mark free until I quit using it!</li>
            <li>I think this product is VERY effective in fading new stretch marks.</li>
            <li>Made them narrower, smoother to the touch and kept them from becoming hyper-pigmented (if that&#x27;s a word).</li>
            <li>My doctor and the nurses said my belly looked really good the whole way through.  </li>
            <li>It also a really good moisturizer my skin feels really some after putting it on.</li>
            <li>the smell isn&#x27;t strong</li>
            <li>Also of note: I have a fair complexion and a normal skin type.</li>
            <li>I believe its also important to follow the directions etc, but this product gets my full five stars!</li>
            <li>If I ever get pregnant again, I&#x27;m using it again!</li>
            <li>Needles to say, when i got pregnant i was more than convinced that my belly would be a battle zone.</li>
            <li>because it got good reviews it will be a good product, not true.</li>
            <li>I think this product was a huge help.  </li>
            <li>Huge change in skin and tightness, plus,  fades them away within 4 weeks.</li>
            <li>the more generously and more frequently you apply the cream the better and faster the results.</li>
            <li>but so far, so good.</li>
            <li>Feels good, I have stretch marks over 19 years old</li>
            <li>So far so good</li>
            <li>I did not have many stretch marks during my first pregnancy</li>
            <li>This product may have contributed but the impact does not seem to be significant.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get this product but after checking the ingredient list I realized this product was a knock off</li>
            <li>It certainly didn&#x27;t make them magically disappear, but I plan to continue to use it</li>
            <li>Feels like nothing special.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do anything special.  </li>
            <li>(Yes thats right!</li>
            <li>The size is great for the price and the ingredients seem 99% natural which is mainly what I like to stick with.</li>
            <li>I have my fair share of doubt initially, but when the item is here...</li>
            <li>I did apply this cream 6 to 7 times a day in combination with sweet almond oil and Reviva.</li>
            <li>I am sure its not for all unless you are on a diet and loosing the weight and/or pregnant but not gaining it too fast.</li>
            <li>Hope this helped someone a little and good luck to all!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the kind of Ad you see pop up on the right and have to fill out some your email, name and number in order to see the special offers...</li>
            <li>My mom also got a lot of stretchmarks while pregnant with me.</li>
            <li>I will use it again if i get pregnant.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my pregnant wife to help prevent stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I used this product every day - morning and night - from the time I was 10 weeks pregnant with Twins.  </li>
            <li>Did not work to prevent stretch marks while pregnant or make the ones I got go away.  </li>
            <li>I gave three stars because I received quickly.</li>
            <li>I am seven months pregnant</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pregnant with twins</li>
            <li>I would definately recommend this to any pregnant moms out there.</li>
            <li>Got it quick.</li>
            <li>I am now 7.5 months pregnant and my belly is covered in stretch marks.</li>
            <li>However, I wish I would have used it on my boobs and butt, because I did get stretch marks there when I was pregnant.  </li>
            <li>Also, I have tried MANY other creams that you can buy at the store and NONE of them worked liked this cream.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be most effective before or very soon after stretch marks appear when they are still red in appearance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recommended to many new mommies.</li>
            <li>I am definitely buying more and continuing using it!</li>
            <li>Use after derma roller to really see results!!</li>
            <li>Perhaps Revitol will be more effective for prevention purposes or newly formed stretch marks as I&#x27;ve had mine for several years.</li>
            <li>Perhaps Revitol will be more effective for prevention purposes or newly formed stretch marks as I&#x27;ve had mine for several years.</li>
            <li>but so worth it.</li>
            <li>After trying many different products I finally decided to give Revitol a try after reading good reviews.</li>
            <li>My belly is ok no stretch marks so far.</li>
            <li>Recently tried Strydexin and so far works great.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money now</li>
            <li>I used this product when I was pregnant with my first child.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I&#x27;d like to mention that I am not now, nor have I ever been pregnant.</li>
            <li>but if it works, the odor doesn&#x27;t matter right?</li>
            <li>but if it works, the odor doesn&#x27;t matter right?</li>
            <li>In about my 5th month, I ran out of revitol, and didn&#x27;t order it right away, and within a week, there were stretch marks forming all over my stomach.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use it until right after I noticed the stretch marks appearing.</li>
            <li>I would use it right after a shower twice a day</li>
            <li>but I really think it&#x27;s a true product that stands by it&#x27;s name.</li>
            <li>and the lady said they were sending me a FREE JAR! :O  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m going to say thank you very much and anything changes</li>
            <li>It does exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I found this product on line after doing some research and started to use it in my first trimester about twice a day</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect miracles, and I am willing to accept the fact that my abdominal skin is permanently scarred.</li>
            <li>I was willing to give it would have.</li>
            <li>and I definitely saw some improvement on my stretch marks and also didn&#x27;t seem to be getting any more.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re willing to stand around waiting for it to set it, then go for it I did think it worked somewhat.</li>
            <li>I started using this product on 6/25/2010, at first I thought this was going to be another cream that was claiming to erase your stretch marks.</li>
            <li>Third kid on the way and just ordered 3 more tubes for the wife.  </li>
            <li>i was hesitant at first because i&#x27;ve purchased SOooo many different types of stretch mark creams that never seemed to work.</li>
            <li>ive been using it for about 2 months and have seen so much improvement!</li>
            <li>which is a plus because I first started using strivectin and the smell</li>
            <li>If you have lost the weight and applying it morning and night or using during pregnancy every morning and night , this really works!</li>
            <li>Although it doesn&#x27;t say on the tube how often to put it on, I put it on every couple of days and it has been working pretty well.</li>
            <li>Of course there are a few that showed up which is inevitable, but for the most part the cream does really good.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product at the end of my first pregnancy.</li>
            <li>Its okay, I will admit I don&#x27;t use it religiously</li>
            <li>but I would love to see the next stage of transformation. ..</li>
            <li>very day, I received an email for 10% off!</li>
            <li>At first I used both the prevention cream and the coconut oil together.</li>
            <li>I ordered more right away, and by the time I had my daughter, there wasn&#x27;t a single stretch mark on my body.</li>
            <li>My stretch marks went from a bright red to white.</li>
            <li>And with my second one, I expected to get bigger than with my first, so I&#x27;ve made sure to keep it stocked up, and so far, so good!</li>
            <li>I use it 2 times a day with a micro derma roller and so far it has shown be the best results being that I&#x27;ve only used for a little over 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>and I feel positive about my purchase.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t want to take the chance to infect the wound, however I have seen the some of the streach marks become smaller; I only gave the cream 4 stars because I&#x27;m not compleatly sure I got the bottle full and because the cream has a funny odor like paste</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t want to take the chance to infect the wound, however I have seen the some of the streach marks become smaller; I only gave the cream 4 stars because I&#x27;m not compleatly sure I got the bottle full and because the cream has a funny odor like paste</li>
            <li>I gave it away to someone because it was such a strong chemical-like smell in my opinion and</li>
            <li>Almost a month later, my stretch marks have lightened tremendously!</li>
            <li>I have been using this cream for two weeks, applying it twice daily, and there is already a huge difference in the appearance and feel of my stretch marks.</li>
            <li>For me though, I have huge a deep stretch marks and it helped fade there appearance!</li>
            <li>This cream really does work.</li>
            <li>I craved fruit the whole way through so antioxidants were definately on board as well.  </li>
            <li>The product got here fast and it works somewhat for the wife.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t been really using it</li>
            <li>Will continue use till I see some real change.</li>
            <li>Got here fast</li>
            <li>Thanks this product worked really well.</li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>I never knew my stretch marks can fade, but this in combination with the skin brush I bought is fading my marks really fast.</li>
            <li>hope it&#x27;s really working and doing it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li>I have used almost the whole tube</li>
            <li>I really have tried everything out there, Coco butter, StriVectin, ect.</li>
            <li>Bought too much of it</li>
            <li>I have not seen much results.</li>
            <li>You really need to have patience with this product.</li>
            <li>Haha  </li>
            <li>it is really greasy and takes forever to soak in/dry.  </li>
            <li>so I cant tell if its really working</li>
            <li>Fast drying and doesn&#x27;t feel very hydrating on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>but I will continue to use and hopefully see better results in the near future.</li>
            <li>At that time I only used sweet almond oil.</li>
            <li>Not one new stretch mark!</li>
            <li>Live and learn!</li>
            <li>I started this product at 4-5 months using it 2-3 times daily (on my belly, thighs, and breasts) and putting a body butter over top as well for extra moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pregnant and I started used Revitol religiously on my breast &amp; on my belly</li>
            <li>am now pregnant with our second child</li>
            <li>My marks are older</li>
            <li>I have no idea if it was because of this cream, but I did use this daily from 3 months pregnant until the end.</li>
            <li>I am pregnant again and decided to apply this product BEFORE my skin stretched too much to see if they would PREVENT them.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this highly.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECCOMMEND</li>
            <li>Also I&#x27;m an African-American with sensitive skin and it works for me!!</li>
            <li>It cost a little more than some stuff out there</li>
            <li>To be honest,this lotion is far away to be a real stretch mark cream,so far,I don&#x27;t see any changes on my skin,like I said,not even hydrated my skin.</li>
            <li>It does feel really moisturizing and makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>My only recommendation would be to contact Revitol direct as you can get a better price if you buy several bottles from them at a time.</li>
            <li>It will sting after you derma roll and then apply Revitol but dont worry thats normal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using,its a smooth spread on cream, light smell, they said a little goes a long way, we will see.</li>
            <li>I had a new stretch mark the color was</li>
            <li>old, I never had any marks!</li>
            <li>Used it with the first kid, now using again with the second</li>
            <li>I used revitol my entire first pregnancy, and didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks.</li>
            <li>And offered me a $100 gift cared to their Natural Well-Being site! :</li>
            <li>Baby is measuring same size as my first and my weight gain is actaully less, so maybe I should have just stuck to the cheap lotion from the grocery instead of trying to use something</li>
            <li>After tons of searching for the best product, I ordered this cream because of its high rank among the others.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fade the old stretch marks nor improve on the new ones.it</li>
            <li>I looked at the prices and offers, but didn&#x27;t want to pay $35-140 for ANY of the offers!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently 8 months pregnant with my second child..</li>
            <li>One more thing the bottle hardly makes it for a month even using it just on my breast.</li>
            <li>I tried it immediately starting with once a day straight after shower...</li>
            <li>I ordered this product directly from Revitol</li>
            <li>using it every morning, so far there is no stretch marks show up.</li>
            <li>it did not prevent them completely.  </li>
            <li>so far no stretch marks... but maybe too early to show.</li>
            <li>So far, I have none.</li>
            <li>I am a 34 year old Mommy who had a stomach a thighs to show for that.</li>
            <li>They have spread above my belly button and I really wanted to do something about them while they were still \\&quot;fresh.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>My stretch mark scars are almost completely gone after using one tube.  </li>
            <li>I have not seen any changes so far.</li>
            <li>It does make your skin soft where you apply it, but did not get rid of my stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I tried a derma roller alone and that didn&#x27;t help, I tried a derma roller and lotion and it helped but didn&#x27;t do too much, so finally after much researching I decided to try this product out</li>
            <li>The stretch marks that used to be over my belly button have faded so much that I can finally being to wear crop tops again.</li>
            <li>I used this cream twice a day for several months straight</li>
            <li>make my skin soft, in which case I could have saved a ton of money just buying body lotion.</li>
            <li>Within 3-4 days I developed stretch marks.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t helped what so ever with my stretch marks on my breast , keep in mind they are very new stretch marks and are not big at all .</li>
            <li>As one does not generally expect to gain this much weight stretch mark prevention was never considered.</li>
            <li>just got the second bottle  for the first time after using 3 different products</li>
            <li>My eyes were droopy and now they look so much better as long as I use it everyday</li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying this &amp; im definitely buying again!!</li>
            <li>I first used it AFTER my first pregnancy, since I was left with deep and dark stretch marks around my belly button.  </li>
            <li>So it definitely does NOT prevent new marks as advertised.</li>
            <li>but I do think being such a thin  Athletic woman before I got pregnant and going to this person with such a huge belly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite far enough along in my pregnancy to tell if it has worked completely -</li>
            <li>I can barely even find them now!</li>
            <li>, they&#x27;re invisible unless you&#x27;re so close that you&#x27;d either be me or a medical professional, so we&#x27;re staying with what seems to work and using this again.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is the type of product that makes your skin worse before it gets better</li>
            <li>Any more than that is unnecessary.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind stretch marks were new not old so it should have worked.</li>
            <li>dark purple and relatively large.  </li>
            <li>Then finally read about Revital stretch mark prevention and OMG, major difference</li>
            <li>although they dont get rid of strech marks, it reduces how much you can see them i was just disapointed at the price as there is other creams which can do a simillar job, the tube is no bigger than a tube of mans hair gel, delivery was on time.</li>
            <li>I used revitol during my first pregnancy and only had a few tiny stretch marks on my breasts afterwards.</li>
            <li>No new ones AND the old ones are hardly even noticeable, my husband was shocked!I recommend this product to everyone for every stretch mark new or old!</li>

            <li> Awesome she really liked it</li>
            <li> I read great reviews on product and thought I would give it a try.  </li>
            <li> This stuff works great for me.</li>
            <li> how they track you lol)</li>
            <li> My results have been remarkable.</li>
            <li> How good is that?</li>
            <li> I am petite with fair skin and EVERYONE in my family gets stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> If anything this is just a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I read some good reviews on this product</li>
            <li> This cream is so good.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this item because Revitol is ranked as the number one stretch mark cream on the market and others have given excellent reviews on it.  </li>
            <li> I originally purchased this item because Revitol is ranked as the number one stretch mark cream on the market and others have given excellent reviews on it.</li>
            <li> I know a lot of women use this for much more severe stretch marks after pregnancy, but it worked great for my situation.</li>
            <li> I am a huge believer in this product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna by more!</li>
            <li> It may not work for everyone, but I am so glad I took the risk!</li>
            <li> But Amazon is amazing and allowed me to purchase 1 tube to test the product.</li>
            <li> so this was an amazing product for me.  </li>
            <li> saw amazing result in  3 weeks.</li>
            <li> It really works great and  i would recommend it to any one who has had a baby or needs to get rid of stretch marks!</li>
            <li> but after 2 weeks of putting it on almost every moment that I can, I&lt;br /&gt;was able to see some good improvement.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice cream.</li>
            <li> Amazon offers the best price for this product!</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Also it is a very good investment to get 2-4 bottles, 2 for newer stretch marks, 4 for older ones.</li>
            <li> My skin is still beautiful and bikini ready.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it worked for some many people, hopefully I&#x27;m one of them.  </li>
            <li> Or when to use for it to be affective the most?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure if you would buy lots of it you would see a result.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m better off using Bio oil along with vitamin E oil.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item as many others, based on the reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I am even more motivated to Apply as and when i can...</li>
            <li> But this has lessened the appearance more in two weeks than I thought the 6 weeks</li>
            <li> There are better creams out there.</li>
            <li> I would love to wear a bikini someday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using another product that works much better.</li>
            <li> I hope ppl have better luck</li>
            <li> I used it every day for more than one month</li>
            <li> and I really love this product.</li>
            <li> a bit to milky and for that price should have been a lot better quality than what it was.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already bought 2 more tubes</li>
            <li> I rub it into my skin and allow it to set in for about 5 minutes (or more if I have time)</li>
            <li> Regardless, I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend a lot of money on this cream.</li>
            <li> I will be spending more and getting a better brand.</li>
            <li> I think this product is ok, I have not been using it the way I should, I will try to be more routine about it.  </li>
            <li> Hope this helps somebody out there :)</li>
            <li> And it take more then one tube to see a difference.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> and I have been SO pleased with my results.</li>
            <li> Ok, I saw an Advertisement while I was on FB.</li>
            <li> If you have to, call the company and INQUIRE ABOUT A FREE SAMPLE JAR!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s marketed for cooking, but it kept me stretch mark free until I quit using it!</li>
            <li> I think this product is VERY effective in fading new stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Made them narrower, smoother to the touch and kept them from becoming hyper-pigmented (if that&#x27;s a word).</li>
            <li> My doctor and the nurses said my belly looked really good the whole way through.  </li>
            <li> It also a really good moisturizer my skin feels really some after putting it on.</li>
            <li> the smell isn&#x27;t strong</li>
            <li> Also of note: I have a fair complexion and a normal skin type.</li>
            <li> I believe its also important to follow the directions etc, but this product gets my full five stars!</li>
            <li> If I ever get pregnant again, I&#x27;m using it again!</li>
            <li> Needles to say, when i got pregnant i was more than convinced that my belly would be a battle zone.</li>
            <li> because it got good reviews it will be a good product, not true.</li>
            <li> I think this product was a huge help.  </li>
            <li> Huge change in skin and tightness, plus,  fades them away within 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> the more generously and more frequently you apply the cream the better and faster the results.</li>
            <li> but so far, so good.</li>
            <li> Feels good, I have stretch marks over 19 years old</li>
            <li> So far so good</li>
            <li> I did not have many stretch marks during my first pregnancy</li>
            <li> This product may have contributed but the impact does not seem to be significant.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this product but after checking the ingredient list I realized this product was a knock off</li>
            <li> It certainly didn&#x27;t make them magically disappear, but I plan to continue to use it</li>
            <li> Feels like nothing special.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything special.  </li>
            <li> (Yes thats right!</li>
            <li> The size is great for the price and the ingredients seem 99% natural which is mainly what I like to stick with.</li>
            <li> I have my fair share of doubt initially, but when the item is here...</li>
            <li> I did apply this cream 6 to 7 times a day in combination with sweet almond oil and Reviva.</li>
            <li> I am sure its not for all unless you are on a diet and loosing the weight and/or pregnant but not gaining it too fast.</li>
            <li> Hope this helped someone a little and good luck to all!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the kind of Ad you see pop up on the right and have to fill out some your email, name and number in order to see the special offers...</li>
            <li> My mom also got a lot of stretchmarks while pregnant with me.</li>
            <li> I will use it again if i get pregnant.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my pregnant wife to help prevent stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I used this product every day - morning and night - from the time I was 10 weeks pregnant with Twins.  </li>
            <li> Did not work to prevent stretch marks while pregnant or make the ones I got go away.  </li>
            <li> I gave three stars because I received quickly.</li>
            <li> I am seven months pregnant</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pregnant with twins</li>
            <li> I would definately recommend this to any pregnant moms out there.</li>
            <li> Got it quick.</li>
            <li> I am now 7.5 months pregnant and my belly is covered in stretch marks.</li>
            <li> However, I wish I would have used it on my boobs and butt, because I did get stretch marks there when I was pregnant.  </li>
            <li> Also, I have tried MANY other creams that you can buy at the store and NONE of them worked liked this cream.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be most effective before or very soon after stretch marks appear when they are still red in appearance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recommended to many new mommies.</li>
            <li> I am definitely buying more and continuing using it!</li>
            <li> Use after derma roller to really see results!!</li>
            <li> Perhaps Revitol will be more effective for prevention purposes or newly formed stretch marks as I&#x27;ve had mine for several years.</li>
            <li> Perhaps Revitol will be more effective for prevention purposes or newly formed stretch marks as I&#x27;ve had mine for several years.</li>
            <li> but so worth it.</li>
            <li> After trying many different products I finally decided to give Revitol a try after reading good reviews.</li>
            <li> My belly is ok no stretch marks so far.</li>
            <li> Recently tried Strydexin and so far works great.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money now</li>
            <li> I used this product when I was pregnant with my first child.  </li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;d like to mention that I am not now, nor have I ever been pregnant.</li>
            <li> but if it works, the odor doesn&#x27;t matter right?</li>
            <li> but if it works, the odor doesn&#x27;t matter right?</li>
            <li> In about my 5th month, I ran out of revitol, and didn&#x27;t order it right away, and within a week, there were stretch marks forming all over my stomach.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it until right after I noticed the stretch marks appearing.</li>
            <li> I would use it right after a shower twice a day</li>
            <li> but I really think it&#x27;s a true product that stands by it&#x27;s name.</li>
            <li> and the lady said they were sending me a FREE JAR! :O  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m going to say thank you very much and anything changes</li>
            <li> It does exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I found this product on line after doing some research and started to use it in my first trimester about twice a day</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect miracles, and I am willing to accept the fact that my abdominal skin is permanently scarred.</li>
            <li> I was willing to give it would have.</li>
            <li> and I definitely saw some improvement on my stretch marks and also didn&#x27;t seem to be getting any more.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re willing to stand around waiting for it to set it, then go for it I did think it worked somewhat.</li>
            <li> I started using this product on 6/25/2010, at first I thought this was going to be another cream that was claiming to erase your stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Third kid on the way and just ordered 3 more tubes for the wife.  </li>
            <li> i was hesitant at first because i&#x27;ve purchased SOooo many different types of stretch mark creams that never seemed to work.</li>
            <li> ive been using it for about 2 months and have seen so much improvement!</li>
            <li> which is a plus because I first started using strivectin and the smell</li>
            <li> If you have lost the weight and applying it morning and night or using during pregnancy every morning and night , this really works!</li>
            <li> Although it doesn&#x27;t say on the tube how often to put it on, I put it on every couple of days and it has been working pretty well.</li>
            <li> Of course there are a few that showed up which is inevitable, but for the most part the cream does really good.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at the end of my first pregnancy.</li>
            <li> Its okay, I will admit I don&#x27;t use it religiously</li>
            <li> but I would love to see the next stage of transformation. ..</li>
            <li> very day, I received an email for 10% off!</li>
            <li> At first I used both the prevention cream and the coconut oil together.</li>
            <li> I ordered more right away, and by the time I had my daughter, there wasn&#x27;t a single stretch mark on my body.</li>
            <li> My stretch marks went from a bright red to white.</li>
            <li> And with my second one, I expected to get bigger than with my first, so I&#x27;ve made sure to keep it stocked up, and so far, so good!</li>
            <li> I use it 2 times a day with a micro derma roller and so far it has shown be the best results being that I&#x27;ve only used for a little over 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> and I feel positive about my purchase.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want to take the chance to infect the wound, however I have seen the some of the streach marks become smaller; I only gave the cream 4 stars because I&#x27;m not compleatly sure I got the bottle full and because the cream has a funny odor like paste</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want to take the chance to infect the wound, however I have seen the some of the streach marks become smaller; I only gave the cream 4 stars because I&#x27;m not compleatly sure I got the bottle full and because the cream has a funny odor like paste</li>
            <li> I gave it away to someone because it was such a strong chemical-like smell in my opinion and</li>
            <li> Almost a month later, my stretch marks have lightened tremendously!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for two weeks, applying it twice daily, and there is already a huge difference in the appearance and feel of my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> For me though, I have huge a deep stretch marks and it helped fade there appearance!</li>
            <li> This cream really does work.</li>
            <li> I craved fruit the whole way through so antioxidants were definately on board as well.  </li>
            <li> The product got here fast and it works somewhat for the wife.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t been really using it</li>
            <li> Will continue use till I see some real change.</li>
            <li> Got here fast</li>
            <li> Thanks this product worked really well.</li>
            <li> Thanks again.</li>
            <li> I never knew my stretch marks can fade, but this in combination with the skin brush I bought is fading my marks really fast.</li>
            <li> hope it&#x27;s really working and doing it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> I have used almost the whole tube</li>
            <li> I really have tried everything out there, Coco butter, StriVectin, ect.</li>
            <li> Bought too much of it</li>
            <li> I have not seen much results.</li>
            <li> You really need to have patience with this product.</li>
            <li> Haha  </li>
            <li> it is really greasy and takes forever to soak in/dry.  </li>
            <li> so I cant tell if its really working</li>
            <li> Fast drying and doesn&#x27;t feel very hydrating on the skin.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> but I will continue to use and hopefully see better results in the near future.</li>
            <li> At that time I only used sweet almond oil.</li>
            <li> Not one new stretch mark!</li>
            <li> Live and learn!</li>
            <li> I started this product at 4-5 months using it 2-3 times daily (on my belly, thighs, and breasts) and putting a body butter over top as well for extra moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pregnant and I started used Revitol religiously on my breast &amp; on my belly</li>
            <li> am now pregnant with our second child</li>
            <li> My marks are older</li>
            <li> I have no idea if it was because of this cream, but I did use this daily from 3 months pregnant until the end.</li>
            <li> I am pregnant again and decided to apply this product BEFORE my skin stretched too much to see if they would PREVENT them.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this highly.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECCOMMEND</li>
            <li> Also I&#x27;m an African-American with sensitive skin and it works for me!!</li>
            <li> It cost a little more than some stuff out there</li>
            <li> To be honest,this lotion is far away to be a real stretch mark cream,so far,I don&#x27;t see any changes on my skin,like I said,not even hydrated my skin.</li>
            <li> It does feel really moisturizing and makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> My only recommendation would be to contact Revitol direct as you can get a better price if you buy several bottles from them at a time.</li>
            <li> It will sting after you derma roll and then apply Revitol but dont worry thats normal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using,its a smooth spread on cream, light smell, they said a little goes a long way, we will see.</li>
            <li> I had a new stretch mark the color was</li>
            <li> old, I never had any marks!</li>
            <li> Used it with the first kid, now using again with the second</li>
            <li> I used revitol my entire first pregnancy, and didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks.</li>
            <li> And offered me a $100 gift cared to their Natural Well-Being site! :</li>
            <li> Baby is measuring same size as my first and my weight gain is actaully less, so maybe I should have just stuck to the cheap lotion from the grocery instead of trying to use something</li>
            <li> After tons of searching for the best product, I ordered this cream because of its high rank among the others.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fade the old stretch marks nor improve on the new ones.it</li>
            <li> I looked at the prices and offers, but didn&#x27;t want to pay $35-140 for ANY of the offers!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently 8 months pregnant with my second child..</li>
            <li> One more thing the bottle hardly makes it for a month even using it just on my breast.</li>
            <li> I tried it immediately starting with once a day straight after shower...</li>
            <li> I ordered this product directly from Revitol</li>
            <li> using it every morning, so far there is no stretch marks show up.</li>
            <li> it did not prevent them completely.  </li>
            <li> so far no stretch marks... but maybe too early to show.</li>
            <li> So far, I have none.</li>
            <li> I am a 34 year old Mommy who had a stomach a thighs to show for that.</li>
            <li> They have spread above my belly button and I really wanted to do something about them while they were still \\&quot;fresh.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> My stretch mark scars are almost completely gone after using one tube.  </li>
            <li> I have not seen any changes so far.</li>
            <li> It does make your skin soft where you apply it, but did not get rid of my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I tried a derma roller alone and that didn&#x27;t help, I tried a derma roller and lotion and it helped but didn&#x27;t do too much, so finally after much researching I decided to try this product out</li>
            <li> The stretch marks that used to be over my belly button have faded so much that I can finally being to wear crop tops again.</li>
            <li> I used this cream twice a day for several months straight</li>
            <li> make my skin soft, in which case I could have saved a ton of money just buying body lotion.</li>
            <li> Within 3-4 days I developed stretch marks.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t helped what so ever with my stretch marks on my breast , keep in mind they are very new stretch marks and are not big at all .</li>
            <li> As one does not generally expect to gain this much weight stretch mark prevention was never considered.</li>
            <li> just got the second bottle  for the first time after using 3 different products</li>
            <li> My eyes were droopy and now they look so much better as long as I use it everyday</li>
            <li> I highly recommend buying this &amp; im definitely buying again!!</li>
            <li> I first used it AFTER my first pregnancy, since I was left with deep and dark stretch marks around my belly button.  </li>
            <li> So it definitely does NOT prevent new marks as advertised.</li>
            <li> but I do think being such a thin  Athletic woman before I got pregnant and going to this person with such a huge belly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite far enough along in my pregnancy to tell if it has worked completely -</li>
            <li> I can barely even find them now!</li>
            <li> , they&#x27;re invisible unless you&#x27;re so close that you&#x27;d either be me or a medical professional, so we&#x27;re staying with what seems to work and using this again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is the type of product that makes your skin worse before it gets better</li>
            <li> Any more than that is unnecessary.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind stretch marks were new not old so it should have worked.</li>
            <li> dark purple and relatively large.  </li>
            <li> Then finally read about Revital stretch mark prevention and OMG, major difference</li>
            <li> although they dont get rid of strech marks, it reduces how much you can see them i was just disapointed at the price as there is other creams which can do a simillar job, the tube is no bigger than a tube of mans hair gel, delivery was on time.</li>
            <li> I used revitol during my first pregnancy and only had a few tiny stretch marks on my breasts afterwards.</li>
            <li> No new ones AND the old ones are hardly even noticeable, my husband was shocked!I recommend this product to everyone for every stretch mark new or old!</li>
            <li> I tried it for 1 month and NO JOKE, that scar on my stomach is no more than a tiny, light line down my middle!</li>
            <li> The packaging I received was open so not sure if this is the real deal</li>
            <li> First pregnancy, used cocoa butter, hardly any results.</li>
            <li> I thought this would work faster than other creams because of the reviews, but it takes a long time before you see a difference on old stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Im usually the person who buys products, and they don&#x27;t work for me, but for some reason, this Revitol cream has really worked with my skin.</li>
            <li> (which for me was mainly my sides and small of my back) then you have to wait for it set it before getting dressed.</li>
            <li> I got stretch marks while pregnant, and being young and very thin</li>
            <li> I got severely bad stretch marks after being pregnant for the first time.</li>
            <li> So far, I notice a little difference</li>
            <li> I have tried other scar creams, but you need one that is meant for stretch marks because they are below the surface and other scar creams do not penetrate that far.  </li>
            <li> So far I have not seen any difference or improvement, It is waste of money.</li>
            <li> I checked all over the net and spent some time in&lt;br /&gt;forums and came up with product recommendations and one of them is Revitol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I came to discover that this item was a complete waste.  </li>
            <li> one was born recently and the other six years ago.</li>
            <li> I gave it two stars for the simple fact that it was not oily, other than that, nothing.</li>
            <li> &quot;  long!</li>
            <li> Im combining this product with dry brushing and dermarolling.</li>
            <li> I had a spot on my back that i had never used lotion on and noticed a few marks starting there that seemed to go away (used this product during pregnancy).</li>
            <li> I would put this on in the morning and at night and there isn&#x27;t a single trace of any stretch marks on me</li>
            <li> My stretch marks were dark and deep and severely noticeable.</li>
            <li> While I only developed a few, those few were quite visible...</li>
            <li> Not bad, not great, but still a discount!</li>
            <li> I had a double transplant July 2010 and now sport a scar down my stomach</li>
            <li> with my first pregnancy I got a lot of stretch marks so needless to say I was worried about the next time around</li>
            <li> and I still have half the bottle left.</li>
            <li> The stretch marks are lighter &amp; less deep in my skin.</li>
            <li> My purple and red stretch marks faded to a peachy skin color and became significantly less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I have continued my use on a less than regular basis but haven&#x27;t noticed a decrease in the product effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> The stretch marks are over half way gone, I am on my second tube.</li>
            <li> Some scars are fading out and no new ones are forming!&lt;br /&gt;Yeeehaw!</li>
            <li> and I could see a small change nothing major</li>
            <li> I used it day and night everyday for my entire pregnancy.</li>
            <li> My calves and thighs stretchmarks is still there but not very visible now..</li>
            <li> Scar is in pink...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not work I expected.</li>
            <li> Even if you only have a few SM</li>
            <li> So I closed the site.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then ran out of the oil and used only this cream twice a day everyday.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m a little larger than average</li>
            <li> The only thing is that is was pretty inconvenient.</li>
            <li> first I was skeptical about it</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research online and Revitol received rave reviews not only from past users, but researchers, as well.</li>
            <li> Can this cream be used for stretch marks on other parts of the body besides stomach</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have an order like some other creams.</li>
            <li> I am a male, not sure if that matters, but I could see results within a couple weeks.  </li>
            <li> After reading many reviews of this product, I was slightly disappointed that it does not work as well for me as it appears to have for others.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it was this product or just how my skin is, but I used this through my entire pregnancy on my stomach and did not get one stretch mark there.  </li>
            <li> I derma roll my legs once a week due to stretch marks .</li>
            <li> She got very minimal stretch marks from baby #2</li>
            <li> I always waited a few minutes before dressing so it would dry into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A little fading but not what I expected from all the other reviews.</li>
            <li> I did get a few small stretch marks on my hips that this cream completely faded within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> but I find the product to be a little on the liquid side, not very creamy.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for over six months and have noticed a pretty dramatic difference!</li>
            <li> The bottle is a little small though I wish they would make them bigger  </li>
            <li> They still showed up, just not as dark as before.  </li>
            <li> but this product is not worth it.</li>
            <li> I was left with ugly stretch marks after first pregnancy.</li>
            <li> It was obviously too late for me to prevent mine, but I had read that it aided in fading existing marks as well.</li>
            <li> I applied it on my chest down to my hips.</li>
            <li> ,it&#x27;s too watery to stay caps down.</li>
            <li> They are now less visible.</li>
            <li> and already I have noticed a slight difference.</li>
            <li> My skin is also less wrinkly.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for about a month and a half now.</li>
            <li> Maybe I did see slight results from it, but no significant change.  </li>
            <li> I found that the stretch marks did fade over time though not significantly.  </li>
            <li> After using it 2-3 times a day for 2-3 months, the dark stretch marks were GONE!  </li>
            <li> I purchashed this product and noticed my strecthmarks lightened some but no significant change.</li>
            <li> While my tummy those not so dark serious stretchmarks has already fade to whitish pink...</li>
            <li> I am not going to buy this again, I wasted my $32.</li>
            <li> People buy something else, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I applied this everyday.  </li>
            <li> , i got a few while i was a teenager from just growing and my body changing.</li>
            <li> Dont waste anymore of your money.</li>
            <li> the item is as said, i have used a few times,</li>
            <li> So basically I had to just stand in my house for 5 or 10 minutes everyday (depending on</li>
            <li> Was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money any way.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything on gods green earth</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> dont even waste your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this 2x&#x27;s a day for a few months now on my belly and have no signs of any stretch marks</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money I have been using the cream for a month with no difference.</li>
            <li> It made my current stretch marks worse and made them appear on places I was preventing them on (and no, I wasn&#x27;t gaining weight at the time</li>
            <li> I have been using for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> , enough unnecessary blabber...</li>
            <li> After I bought it though i realized i wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Also there apears to be less stretch marks!</li>
            <li> I was previously ordering it from revitol.com for $60 a bottle!</li>
            <li> This cream will never remove stretch marks but it will make them less noticeable!</li>
            <li> Kinda hard to rate when your not aware what it would of looked like if you had not used the product.</li>
            <li> All i can say is she has very little showing at this point in her pregnancy (6 months).</li>
            <li> Not sure why</li>
            <li> love the cream, but hate how the price keeps increasing every time i check!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure wether unwound have had stretch marks pop up or not without this cream</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the creme came with no instructions for daily use, so I googled recomendations on how to use it when my package came in.</li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t work for you, you are using it wrong or not enough.</li>
            <li> Not sure how it works.</li>
            <li> To anyone who says that creams don&#x27;t work, well i think they do, at least this one did.</li>
            <li> At least once twice a day.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for at least a month</li>
            <li> I ve serious stretchmarks from tummy to thigh...</li>
            <li> I realize that sounds like a moronic statement, but that&#x27;s seriously what it seemed like.  </li>
            <li> They were bad and I have formerly had a C-section.</li>
            <li> it doesnt smell bad, but the smell is very minor in comparison to its effectiveness on my skin.</li>
            <li> and I was so annoyed.</li>
            <li> This product is too thin and doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> and it made them worse.</li>
            <li> My stretch marks were beyond ugly and dark.</li>
            <li> Wasted money. :-(</li>
            <li> 1 tube is not enuff tho and at $30 per tube it can get expensive.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say</li>
            <li> I had my son a year ago &amp; my pregnancy left horrible stretch marks on my hips that I was so embarrassed of.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this and says it works as well as expensive brands without the cost.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product!!!!!</li>
            <li> The smell was bad the cream was liquidity  and saw no results.</li>
            <li> made me sick.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to keep using it since I was already disappointed.</li>
            <li> ..totally disappointed.</li>
            <li> doesnt do anything :(</li>
            <li> and I have seen no difference at all. :(</li>
            <li> So I clicked on it because I have been desperately looking for a scar removal or fading cream for months and months!</li>
            <li> This crap did not work for me at all</li>
            <li> I HATED seeing it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed that I got stretch marks in my breast during the time I was using Revitol.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed .</li>
            <li> They say you can&#x27;t prevent stretch marks and terrible stretch marks run in my family.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of stretch mark creams and Revitol was one of the worst.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product !! I actually saw a difference in my stretch marks . They are now less visible.</li>
            <li> This cream really does work. I noticed a difference almost immediately. I would definitely recommend this cream to anyone wishing to lighten their stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I have two kids. one was born recently and the other six years ago. with my first pregnancy I got a lot of stretch marks so needless to say I was worried about the next time around so I purchased revitol. I used it day and night everyday for my entire pregnancy. Not one new stretch mark! No new ones AND the old ones are hardly even noticeable, my husband was shocked!I recommend this product to everyone for every stretch mark new or old!</li>
            <li> I just received this cream in the mail today. I used it as soon as I got it.   I planon using it twice daily and hope it works so I can write a great review.   I&#x27;m glad it worked for some many people, hopefully I&#x27;m one of them.  What are some things people did while using this cream daily? Or when to use for it to be affective the most?  Please let me know.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream since June. So far I have not seen any difference or improvement, It is waste of money. I am not going to buy this again, I wasted my $32. The only thing I like is that it moisturize the skin, Who want to spend over $30 for a moisturizer. It smells like almond oil, Not Recommended.</li>
            <li> I loved everything about this product! It does exactly as described. It really works great and  i would recommend it to any one who has had a baby or needs to get rid of stretch marks!</li>
            <li> I did not have many stretch marks during my first pregnancy but I did when I had my second baby. It&lt;br /&gt;started during my 2nd trimester and I was so annoyed. I checked all over the net and spent some time in&lt;br /&gt;forums and came up with product recommendations and one of them is Revitol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was skeptical about it but after 2 weeks of putting it on almost every moment that I can, I&lt;br /&gt;was able to see some good improvement. Some scars are fading out and no new ones are forming!&lt;br /&gt;Yeeehaw! Definitely good result! I continued using it even after I gave birth and till now that my son is 3&lt;br /&gt;yrs old, I never had any marks! How good is that? Revitol is my angel in disguise.[[ASIN:B002UKJN0G Revitol Stretch Mark Prevention Cream]]</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the chance to use the cream daily as directed because I had a C-section and I don&#x27;t want to take the chance to infect the wound, however I have seen the some of the streach marks become smaller; I only gave the cream 4 stars because I&#x27;m not compleatly sure I got the bottle full and because the cream has a funny odor like paste I think but if it works, the odor doesn&#x27;t matter right?</li>

            <li> I bought this product to help with my stretch marks...not impressed.I&#x27;m sure if you would buy lots of it you would see a result.I&#x27;m better off using Bio oil along with vitamin E oil.Still looking for something better😔</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a month to two weeks and already I have noticed a slight difference.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item as many others, based on the reviews. I read that it faded out stretch marks, and that it was one of the best products out there. Well let me say that this cream doesn&#x27;t do what it claims. People buy something else, don&#x27;t waste your money. I have not seen any difference in my stretch marks at all. I have been following the directions as is and nothing different has happened. I will never purchase this product again!!</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product to anyone.  I originally purchased this item because Revitol is ranked as the number one stretch mark cream on the market and others have given excellent reviews on it.  I came to discover that this item was a complete waste.  I applied it 1-3 times daily for a month and noticed no change in the appearance of my stretch marks.  The only change I noticed was that the area to which it was applied was noticeably firmer hence the 2 stars given.  Perhaps Revitol will be more effective for prevention purposes or newly formed stretch marks as I&#x27;ve had mine for several years.</li>
            <li> I used this product when I was pregnant with my first child.  I am petite with fair skin and EVERYONE in my family gets stretch marks.  They say it&#x27;s hereditary so I just wanted a product that would help minimize the marks.  I ended up gaining 70 pounds!  I started this product at 4-5 months using it 2-3 times daily (on my belly, thighs, and breasts) and putting a body butter over top as well for extra moisturizer.  I also took extra zinc and vita C (Garden of Life Living vita C) and omega oils along with my prenatal vitamins.  I craved fruit the whole way through so antioxidants were definately on board as well.  Well, I didn&#x27;t get ANY stretch marks at all!  My doctor and the nurses said my belly looked really good the whole way through.  I think this product was a huge help.  If I ever get pregnant again, I&#x27;m using it again!</li>
            <li> My stretch marks didn&#x27;t fade.  I applied this everyday.  Maybe I did see slight results from it, but no significant change.  It&#x27;s a really good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I had breast implants done in June 2011. I went from an A-cup to a D-cup and I didn&#x27;t even think about how my body would, of course, develop stretch marks. Once they had come in, still having that reddish color, I decided to buy this cream over Mederma&#x27;s stretch mark solution. I&#x27;m glad I did. I would put this on in the morning and at night and there isn&#x27;t a single trace of any stretch marks on me and I still have half the bottle left. Cleared up in about a month or two, give or take. I know a lot of women use this for much more severe stretch marks after pregnancy, but it worked great for my situation. Also I had some chafing from the size up and it also took care of that, works great as a moisturizer. I recommend this highly.</li>
            <li> I have my fair share of doubt initially, but when the item is here... In fact it was shipped promptly.. I tried it immediately starting with once a day straight after shower... After about a week, the scar is definitely lighter. I ve serious stretchmarks from tummy to thigh... And on my calves and my arms... Not sure why but it happens during my pregnancy... Nothing seems to stop them from growing... As i can see results... I am even more motivated to Apply as and when i can... My calves and thighs stretchmarks is still there but not very visible now.. Scar is in pink... While my tummy those not so dark serious stretchmarks has already fade to whitish pink...</li>
            <li> I wanted a product that wouldn&#x27;t necessarily TREAT stretch marks, I wanted something to help PREVENT them all together! I&#x27;m not quite far enough along in my pregnancy to tell if it has worked completely - but so far, so good. I did a lot of research online and Revitol received rave reviews not only from past users, but researchers, as well.</li>
            <li> Can this cream be used for stretch marks on other parts of the body besides stomach</li>
            <li> This product truly works!!! I have a tendency to get stretchmarks, i got a few while i was a teenager from just growing and my body changing. My mom also got a lot of stretchmarks while pregnant with me. Needles to say, when i got pregnant i was more than convinced that my belly would be a battle zone. I found this product on line after doing some research and started to use it in my first trimester about twice a day, i was deligent with it. I also used cocoa butter once daily in the afternoon. This cream in my opinion saved my skin, i got no stretchmarks whatsoever and i gained 50 pounds. To anyone who says that creams don&#x27;t work, well i think they do, at least this one did. I strongly recommend it! I will use it again if i get pregnant. It&#x27;s a bit pricey but so worth it. It saved me literally, i was so happy with it!!!</li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;d like to mention that I am not now, nor have I ever been pregnant. My stretch marks were caused by 80+ lbs of weight gain over 4 to 5 years. As one does not generally expect to gain this much weight stretch mark prevention was never considered. My stretch marks were dark and deep and severely noticeable. Now that I am making progress towards loosing the weight I wanted to lessen the appearance of my stretch marks too. I have been using this cream for two weeks, applying it twice daily, and there is already a huge difference in the appearance and feel of my stretch marks. I didn&#x27;t expect miracles, and I am willing to accept the fact that my abdominal skin is permanently scarred. But this has lessened the appearance more in two weeks than I thought the 6 weeks I was willing to give it would have. I&#x27;m amazed. I would recommend this product to anyone with stretch marks. Also of note: I have a fair complexion and a normal skin type.</li>
            <li> I cannot comment on the effectiveness of this cream for its intended purpose of stretch mark prevention. However, I had read some reviews online that indicated that this product has helped others in reducing the appearance of stretch marks.  I used this product following the appearance of some stretch marks during pregnancy shortly following delivery.  I found that the stretch marks did fade over time though not significantly.  This product may have contributed but the impact does not seem to be significant.</li>
            <li> This product does not work....well not for me....I have tried everything from shea butter, bio oil, to revitol....I hear trilastin SR is the best but I refuse to buy it. Dont waste anymore of your money.</li>
            <li> the item is as said, i have used a few times, although they dont get rid of strech marks, it reduces how much you can see them i was just disapointed at the price as there is other creams which can do a simillar job, the tube is no bigger than a tube of mans hair gel, delivery was on time.</li>
            <li> No visible change on strech marks but on skin texture.  There are better creams out there. Im not buying this one again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice cream. That&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> This product is a legit lifesaver! After I began college I rapidly gained 50 pounds. Of course with this weight gain came stretch marks. My stretch marks were beyond ugly and dark. I became embarrassed to wear shorts and dresses. After trying many different products I finally decided to give Revitol a try after reading good reviews. Almost a month later, my stretch marks have lightened tremendously! I recommend this product for anyone with embarrassing stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I thought this would work faster than other creams because of the reviews, but it takes a long time before you see a difference on old stretch marks.</li>
            <li> The product got here fast and it works somewhat for the wife. They say on the product website that it works for some and not for all. On my wife it worked so so. 1 tube is not enuff tho and at $30 per tube it can get expensive. But Amazon is amazing and allowed me to purchase 1 tube to test the product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product directly from Revitol and I&#x27;m hopeless at this point. This crap did not work for me at all and I&#x27;ve been using it daily for months!</li>
            <li> After using the entire tube, there was no change in the appearance of stretch marks.  They had not improved in size or color.</li>
            <li> I used this cream for quite a while and I definitely saw some improvement on my stretch marks and also didn&#x27;t seem to be getting any more. The only thing is that is was pretty inconvenient. So you have to put it on (which for me was mainly my sides and small of my back) then you have to wait for it set it before getting dressed. This takes about five minutes. So basically I had to just stand in my house for 5 or 10 minutes everyday (depending on if I applied it once or twice). If you&#x27;re willing to stand around waiting for it to set it, then go for it I did think it worked somewhat.</li>
            <li> I have use this along with the derma roller and didn&#x27;t see any difference to my stretch marks. Was hoping to see some progress but it&#x27;s been a month and didn&#x27;t see any progress. Was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I started using this product on 6/25/2010, at first I thought this was going to be another cream that was claiming to erase your stretch marks. To my surprise I started seeing results within a week; Revitol has reduced my stretch marks by 65%. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my pregnant wife to help prevent stretch marks. Kinda hard to rate when your not aware what it would of looked like if you had not used the product. All i can say is she has very little showing at this point in her pregnancy (6 months).</li>
            <li> I had my 1st son in 2008 and did not get any stretch marks. At that time I only used sweet almond oil. When I found out that i was having twins I wanted to take every precaution not to get them. I just has twins in August and did not get ANY stretch marks on my belly. I did apply this cream 6 to 7 times a day in combination with sweet almond oil and Reviva. I don&#x27;t know if was genetics but I believe that it did help.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pregnant and I started used Revitol religiously on my breast &amp; on my belly I try Cocoa butter. I&#x27;m very disappointed that I got stretch marks in my breast during the time I was using Revitol. My belly is ok no stretch marks so far. I though that because it got good reviews it will be a good product, not true. Oh and by the way when I bought Revitol was $35.00 + shipping now it cost $19.99 +shipping. What a waste of money any way. They claim that it can disappear the stretch marks once you get them. I didn&#x27;t want to keep using it since I was already disappointed. One more thing the bottle hardly makes it for a month even using it just on my breast.</li>
            <li> I used this product every day - morning and night - from the time I was 10 weeks pregnant with Twins.  It helped to keep my skin moisturized and I did not end up with ANY stretch marks!</li>
            <li> Revitol stretch mark cream works! I notices results within 3 weeks I would recommend  buying this product. It also a really good moisturizer my skin feels really some after putting it on. Also I&#x27;m an African-American with sensitive skin and it works for me!! The bottle is a little small though I wish they would make them bigger  but with the results I got I&#x27;m gonna by more!</li>
            <li> I have only two stretchmarks because of this cream.  I gained plenty of weight and I&#x27;m prone to stretchmarks so this was an amazing product for me.  I used it religiously every morning and every night.</li>
            <li> it is to prevent the stretch mark, i&#x27;m only 17 weeks now. using it every morning, so far there is no stretch marks show up.</li>
            <li> Seems to work on scars</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to use on my pregnancy stretch marks.  While I only developed a few, those few were quite visible...dark purple and relatively large.  I have been applying this product 2-3 times daily for about 3 weeks.  And...it actually seems to be reducing their appearance.  Even my husband commented to me that he saw improvement and thought this product was helping.  It certainly didn&#x27;t make them magically disappear, but I plan to continue to use it and I feel positive about my purchase.</li>
            <li> Did not work to prevent stretch marks while pregnant or make the ones I got go away.  If anything this is just a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t make a difference what so ever.  A little fading but not what I expected from all the other reviews.</li>
            <li> Overall I like this product.  I first used it AFTER my first pregnancy, since I was left with deep and dark stretch marks around my belly button.  After using it 2-3 times a day for 2-3 months, the dark stretch marks were GONE!  Of course the lines were still there but they were flesh colored instead of purple.  I am pregnant again and decided to apply this product BEFORE my skin stretched too much to see if they would PREVENT them.  WELL......it did not prevent them completely.  They still showed up, just not as dark as before.  Also, I have tried MANY other creams that you can buy at the store and NONE of them worked liked this cream.  So I will continue to buy this product, though it is pricey, until my stretch marks are gone again.</li>
            <li> I read some good reviews on this product so I purchased it, used it for almost 4 weeks and no change at all! Sorry to say but this product is not worth it. Keep in mind stretch marks were new not old so it should have worked.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get the results some websites show, but does help relieve itchiness.</li>
            <li> I like the cream, I&#x27;m in my 5th months.. so far no stretch marks... but maybe too early to show.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t see any big results in this product but I haven&#x27;t been really using it so I&#x27;m going to say thank you very much and anything changes I will let you know and I will purchase another tube</li>
            <li> Still using hope to see some improvement soon. I understand this will take time. Will continue use till I see some real change. I&#x27;ve have these stretch marks for years so to get rid of them will be great. I would love to wear a bikini someday.</li>
            <li> Got here fast the smell isn&#x27;t strong I have alot of stretch marks for giving birth I have tried everything on gods green earth I&#x27;m using this cream with a 1.5mm derma roller daily hope it works</li>
            <li> I had my son a year ago &amp; my pregnancy left horrible stretch marks on my hips that I was so embarrassed of. They were the deep purple ones that looked like a tiger just clawed at my side. I regret not getting this sooner. I have been using revitol for only a week &amp; I see a difference already. The stretch marks are lighter &amp; less deep in my skin. Also there apears to be less stretch marks! This stuff is a life saver. Using it with a derma roller helped boost the affect. I highly recommend buying this &amp; im definitely buying again!! 👍👍</li>
            <li> Used it with the first kid, now using again with the second and my wife still doesn&#x27;t have stretch marks. I&#x27;ve read recently that there may be a genetic component to getting stretch marks but I don&#x27;t know.  I do know she used it and didn&#x27;t get any so we&#x27;re using it again.  [Update Aug 2015] Third kid on the way and just ordered 3 more tubes for the wife.  She got very minimal stretch marks from baby #2, they&#x27;re invisible unless you&#x27;re so close that you&#x27;d either be me or a medical professional, so we&#x27;re staying with what seems to work and using this again.</li>
            <li> Revitol Stretch Mark Prevention Cream does not work with me. I had a new stretch mark the color was red Revitol did not help. It just turn to white color now. You should try others brand.</li>
            <li> This product is too thin and doesn&#x27;t work. The packaging I received was open so not sure if this is the real deal</li>
            <li> saw amazing result in  3 weeks. just got the second bottle  for the first time after using 3 different products</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this product but after checking the ingredient list I realized this product was a knock off so I returned it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any results as of yet and I&#x27;ve been using for about 2 months. At least once twice a day. I gave three stars because I received quickly.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fade the old stretch marks nor improve on the new ones.it didnt just work..totally disappointed. Do not purchase.</li>
            <li> Does not work. Waste of money. I used product twice a day for a month. I&#x27;m using another product that works much better.</li>
            <li> Thanks this product worked really well. Gotta save up to buy another one. Thanks again. Awesome she really liked it</li>
            <li> I have stretch marks around my naval and instead of getting rid of my stretch marks it darken my skin around my naval. i wasn&#x27;t expecting that at all. I hope ppl have better luck then i did.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not work I expected.</li>
            <li> doesnt do anything :( I am very disappointed. dont even waste your money. i want a refund for this product.</li>
            <li> I used revitol during my first pregnancy and only had a few tiny stretch marks on my breasts afterwards. I starting using the cream at 10 weeks along and continued using it several weeks afterwards. I applied it on my chest down to my hips. It doesn&#x27;t have an order like some other creams. I always waited a few minutes before dressing so it would dry into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I am now pregnant with our second child I didn&#x27;t hesitate to order revitol cream again. Amazon offers the best price for this product!</li>
            <li> Cream or watery lotion?I have to put the tube bottom up,it&#x27;s too watery to stay caps down.I never see a stretch mark that  don&#x27;t even hydrated the skin.To be honest,this lotion is far away to be a real stretch mark cream,so far,I don&#x27;t see any changes on my skin,like I said,not even hydrated my skin.Definelly  I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am seven months pregnant and I have been using this product for almost 5 months now to hopefully avoid stretch marks. So far, I have none. I don&#x27;t know whether it is from the product or not, but I&#x27;m continuing to buy it because I don&#x27;t have any stretch marks. I studied up on this product and it is supposedly the only product out there that actually has some scientific backing to it&#x27;s effectiveness. I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> No change after two tubes.</li>
            <li> This cream is so good. I never knew my stretch marks can fade, but this in combination with the skin brush I bought is fading my marks really fast. Even my mom and sister notice it.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a faster results as the product advice. I&#x27;ve been using the product for about a month and I haven&#x27;t seen the results I wanted. The product is working though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper than korea. And Quality is the best.&lt;br /&gt;My wife satisfies with this cream.&lt;br /&gt;I sugguest this product to pregnants.</li>
            <li> Did not work so great!</li>
            <li> I used it every day for more than one month and I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement on my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t helped what so ever with my stretch marks on my breast , keep in mind they are very new stretch marks and are not big at all . Very disappointed .</li>
            <li> i was hesitant at first because i&#x27;ve purchased SOooo many different types of stretch mark creams that never seemed to work. THIS ONE WORKS!! ive been using it for about 2 months and have seen so much improvement! love the cream, but hate how the price keeps increasing every time i check!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this 2x&#x27;s a day for a few months now on my belly and have no signs of any stretch marks what-so-ever yet. I&#x27;m pregnant with twins so I&#x27;m a little larger than average and I really love this product. The size is great for the price and the ingredients seem 99% natural which is mainly what I like to stick with. I&#x27;m not sure wether unwound have had stretch marks pop up or not without this cream but I do think being such a thin  Athletic woman before I got pregnant and going to this person with such a huge belly I should&#x27;ve had something show up but not one stretch mark. I&#x27;ll continue use after the twins are born in the next month or so and hope it&#x27;s really working and doing it&#x27;s job. I would definately recommend this to any pregnant moms out there. It cost a little more than some stuff out there but I really think it&#x27;s a true product that stands by it&#x27;s name. The smell isnt and either which is a plus because I first started using strivectin and the smell made me sick. I gave it away to someone because it was such a strong chemical-like smell in my opinion and a bit to milky and for that price should have been a lot better quality than what it was. Hope this helped someone a little and good luck to all!</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money I have been using the cream for a month with no difference. I have been using cocoa butter on my stretch marks for a couple of weeks and see a difference!! Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product!!!!!</li>
            <li> I received this product promptly and began use immediately.  I noticed results within 24 hours of use and was amazed.  My purple and red stretch marks faded to a peachy skin color and became significantly less noticeable.  I have continued my use on a less than regular basis but haven&#x27;t noticed a decrease in the product effectiveness.  I know that all skin types are different; therefore, everyone&#x27;s results will be different.  My results have been remarkable.</li>
            <li> This has helped me a lot. My eyes were droopy and now they look so much better as long as I use it everyday</li>
            <li> Got it quick. Been using it for about 2 weeks, haven&#x27;t seen results yet.</li>
            <li> I have used almost the whole tube and I see no difference in my stretch marks. Also the product smells. I hope after using the second tube I will see a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently 8 months pregnant with my second child.. I used revitol my entire first pregnancy, and didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks. In about my 5th month, I ran out of revitol, and didn&#x27;t order it right away, and within a week, there were stretch marks forming all over my stomach. I ordered more right away, and by the time I had my daughter, there wasn&#x27;t a single stretch mark on my body. And with my second one, I expected to get bigger than with my first, so I&#x27;ve made sure to keep it stocked up, and so far, so good! :) AND this is a steal.. I just realized recently that amazon sold revitol. I was previously ordering it from revitol.com for $60 a bottle!</li>
            <li> I am a 34 year old Mommy who had a stomach a thighs to show for that. They were bad and I have formerly had a C-section. Two words, What stretch marks? I really have tried everything out there, Coco butter, StriVectin, ect. This actually works. The stretch marks are over half way gone, I am on my second tube.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for about a month and my stretch marks are starting to fade. My skin is also less wrinkly. Im combining this product with dry brushing and dermarolling. I&#x27;ve already bought 2 more tubes</li>
            <li> Only thing I&#x27;ve tried that has made a difference on my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I was left with ugly stretch marks after first pregnancy. First pregnancy, used cocoa butter, hardly any results. Second pregnancy, was conned by using Striae that I saw on a tv commercial.  Bought too much of it and it made them worse. Then finally read about Revital stretch mark prevention and OMG, major difference and they stayed off after my second pregnancy and diet program. My third and final pregnancy, I was in heaven with the results. I am sure its not for all unless you are on a diet and loosing the weight and/or pregnant but not gaining it too fast. If you have lost the weight and applying it morning and night or using during pregnancy every morning and night , this really works! Huge change in skin and tightness, plus,  fades them away within 4 weeks. Continues fading them as I use it.</li>
            <li> I got severely bad stretch marks after being pregnant for the first time. They have spread above my belly button and I really wanted to do something about them while they were still \\&quot;fresh.\\&quot; I considered Bio Oil, and Mama Mio (as sworn by celebrities) but after reading reviews on different websites I bought Revitol Stretch Mark prevention. It was obviously too late for me to prevent mine, but I had read that it aided in fading existing marks as well. Unfortunately the creme came with no instructions for daily use, so I googled recomendations on how to use it when my package came in. I have been putting it on 2 times a day -once in the morning and once at night. I rub it into my skin and allow it to set in for about 5 minutes (or more if I have time) before I put my clothes on. Within 2 days I have noticeably seen such an improvement in the color of them! Im usually the person who buys products, and they don&#x27;t work for me, but for some reason, this Revitol cream has really worked with my skin. It doesnt smell very good....it doesnt smell bad, but the smell is very minor in comparison to its effectiveness on my skin. It may not work for everyone, but I am so glad I took the risk! I believe its also important to follow the directions etc, but this product gets my full five stars!</li>
            <li> I swear, it seemed like it was GIVING me stretch marks.  I realize that sounds like a moronic statement, but that&#x27;s seriously what it seemed like.  It made my current stretch marks worse and made them appear on places I was preventing them on (and no, I wasn&#x27;t gaining weight at the time, I just figured I had a big tube of it...might as well use it).  I don&#x27;t know if this is the type of product that makes your skin worse before it gets better but I stopped using it because I didn&#x27;t want to risk it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything on my stretchmarks. Yes, it moisturizes and hydrates skin, but doesn&#x27;t erase stretchmarks, maybe it prevents it, but doesn&#x27;t get rid of em&#x27;</li>
            <li> I tend to have stretch marks as I am currently bulking and the dreaded marks have started to appear. I tried this product for at least a month and I have to say that it did not work at all. I gave it two stars for the simple fact that it was not oily, other than that, nothing.</li>
            <li> Although it doesn&#x27;t say on the tube how often to put it on, I put it on every couple of days and it has been working pretty well. Of course there are a few that showed up which is inevitable, but for the most part the cream does really good.</li>
            <li> I applied this cream twice a day to my stretch marks on my stomach, chest, and legs from my recent pregnancy two months and didn&#x27;t see a difference at all.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at the end of my first pregnancy. I have been using it for over six months and have noticed a pretty dramatic difference! My stretch marks went from a bright red to white. They have changed in size (or thickness)too.</li>
            <li> I am a male, not sure if that matters, but I could see results within a couple weeks.  My stretch mark scars are almost completely gone after using one tube.  I just ordered my second.  I have tried other scar creams, but you need one that is meant for stretch marks because they are below the surface and other scar creams do not penetrate that far.  Wish it was cheaper, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for about a month and a half now. I have not seen any changes so far. It does make your skin soft where you apply it, but did not get rid of my stretch marks. My marks are older so maybe that is why, it is called prevention cream. Regardless, I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend a lot of money on this cream. I will be spending more and getting a better brand. Live and learn!</li>
            <li> I think this product is ok, I have not been using it the way I should, I will try to be more routine about it.  I have not seen much results.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for about three months now. I didn&#x27;t have any stretch marks whatsoever before using this cream (even though I did have a baby two years and only used cheapy stretch mark lotion I bought at my local grocery store and didn&#x27;t get one stretch mark). I am now 7.5 months pregnant and my belly is covered in stretch marks. Baby is measuring same size as my first and my weight gain is actaully less, so maybe I should have just stuck to the cheap lotion from the grocery instead of trying to use something \\&quot;better\\&quot; this time around. Wasted money. :-(</li>
            <li> Great Product! Started seeing results within one week of application!</li>
            <li> You really need to have patience with this product. I am African Amerian with a deep-caramel complexion, having one of the hardest categories of skin complexions to treat I have tried a million skin products and this is the only stretch mark product I have used that made a NOTICEABLE difference. It seems to be most effective before or very soon after stretch marks appear when they are still red in appearance. I didn&#x27;t use it until right after I noticed the stretch marks appearing. Made them narrower, smoother to the touch and kept them from becoming hyper-pigmented (if that&#x27;s a word). So they&#x27;re almost invisible after 2.5 months. Keep in mind the longer you have had the SM the longer it takes to \\&quot;get rid\\&quot; of them. Also it is a very good investment to get 2-4 bottles, 2 for newer stretch marks, 4 for older ones. Any more than that is unnecessary. Even if you only have a few SM the more generously and more frequently you apply the cream the better and faster the results. ( i did two quarter sized amounts, twice a day). To further improve the texture/appearance of sunken/crater stretch marks use cellulite cream (I recommend dermology or revitol) and sunless-tanning lotion (Yes thats right! For all complexions) I recommend idol tan. The combination of the stretch mark cream, cellulite cream and the sun-less tan, makes your tummy look as smoothe as a baby&#x27;s butt! Haha  Hope this helps somebody out there :)</li>
            <li> This product works amazingly!!!! If it doesn&#x27;t work for you, you are using it wrong or not enough. You wont notice a difference over night. And it needs to be used with the derma roller and after a bath sonit soaks in properly. And it take more then one tube to see a difference. For me though, I have huge a deep stretch marks and it helped fade there appearance! I am definitely buying more and continuing using it! I love this product. It has every ingredient in it that is said to reduce appearance of stretch marks. If your going to spend your money on a stretch mark cream, this would be it! But use it properly!</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews of this product, I was slightly disappointed that it does not work as well for me as it appears to have for others.</li>
            <li> I noticed no changes.</li>
            <li> I purchashed this product and noticed my strecthmarks lightened some but no significant change. It does feel really moisturizing and makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> Feels good, I have stretch marks over 19 years old so I need to continue trying to reduce the look.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this product is over rated for the directions and claims they make. I even gave it to youong girl who used it just as she was showing and it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> i feel like this might have actually worked1 i also used cocoa butter, alternating days. I had a spot on my back that i had never used lotion on and noticed a few marks starting there that seemed to go away (used this product during pregnancy). i have no stretch marks. i should add, i didn&#x27;t gain a lot of weight anyway...like 25lbs.</li>
            <li> it is really greasy and takes forever to soak in/dry.  I have been using for a few weeks now and I have seen no difference at all. :(</li>
            <li> Its okay, I will admit I don&#x27;t use it religiously so I cant tell if its really working but I find the product to be a little on the liquid side, not very creamy.</li>
            <li> I got stretch marks while pregnant, and being young and very thin I felt embarrassed to use a bikini in public, no one in my family have gotten stretch marks during pregnancy I was the only one. So from the moment my son was born I went in search of every cream that would help. I tried a derma roller alone and that didn&#x27;t help, I tried a derma roller and lotion and it helped but didn&#x27;t do too much, so finally after much researching I decided to try this product out I use it 2 times a day with a micro derma roller and so far it has shown be the best results being that I&#x27;ve only used for a little over 2 weeks. The stretch marks that used to be over my belly button have faded so much that I can finally being to wear crop tops again. NOW REMEMBER STRETCH MARKS CAN NOT BE REMOVED!!! This cream will never remove stretch marks but it will make them less noticeable! So far so good I&#x27;ll let you know what results are like once I finish the entire bottle!</li>
            <li> So far, I notice a little difference but I will continue to use and hopefully see better results in the near future.</li>
            <li> I took before and after pictures of my stretch marks from baby and they faded almost 100% &amp; I only used it for 5 weeks 2 times a day. I&#x27;ve recommended to many new mommies.</li>
            <li> No stretch marks after a twin pregnancy!!  I have no idea if it was because of this cream, but I did use this daily from 3 months pregnant until the end.</li>
            <li> I am a huge believer in this product!! They say you can&#x27;t prevent stretch marks and terrible stretch marks run in my family. But I wanted to do everything I could to prevent them. So I invested in this product and used it religiously during both my pregnancies. My skin is still beautiful and bikini ready. I would use it right after a shower twice a day and I have been SO pleased with my results. I did get a few small stretch marks on my hips that this cream completely faded within a few weeks. I can barely even find them now! I think this product is VERY effective in fading new stretch marks. My only recommendation would be to contact Revitol direct as you can get a better price if you buy several bottles from them at a time.</li>
            <li> I used this cream twice a day for several months straight and it did nothing except make my skin soft, in which case I could have saved a ton of money just buying body lotion.</li>
            <li> It did not prevent my stretch marks and I used it daily.</li>
            <li> Feels like nothing special.  Doesn&#x27;t do anything special.  Fast drying and doesn&#x27;t feel very hydrating on the skin.  Not sure how it works.</li>
            <li> I read great reviews on product and thought I would give it a try.  It was a bit pricey, and it did not show any improvement for me.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of stretch mark creams and Revitol was one of the worst. The smell was bad the cream was liquidity  and saw no results. Maybe it moisturized my skin but thats not what I needed. Recently tried Strydexin and so far works great. Very impressed. [[ASIN:B00B5Y2MME Strydexin (4 oz.) Concentrated Stretch Mark &amp; Skin Repair Formula]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used my 1st tube of revitol and I could see a small change nothing major but my marks has gotten lighter but I would love to see the next stage of transformation. ..</li>
            <li> After the 1st use, I noticed improvements.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it was this product or just how my skin is, but I used this through my entire pregnancy on my stomach and did not get one stretch mark there.  However, I wish I would have used it on my boobs and butt, because I did get stretch marks there when I was pregnant.  I am going to buy this again when I have another child.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using,its a smooth spread on cream, light smell, they said a little goes a long way, we will see. Thanks</li>
            <li> Use after derma roller to really see results!! This stuff works great for me. I&#x27;m on my second tube. I derma roll my legs once a week due to stretch marks . Then I apply Revitol twice a day on the area&#x27;s I derma rolled. My stretch marks and blemishes have lightened a lot! Again use a derma roller with this and you should definitely see results! It will sting after you derma roll and then apply Revitol but dont worry thats normal.</li>
            <li> Ok, I saw an Advertisement while I was on FB. It&#x27;s the kind of Ad you see pop up on the right and have to fill out some your email, name and number in order to see the special offers... So I clicked on it because I have been desperately looking for a scar removal or fading cream for months and months! I had a double transplant July 2010 and now sport a scar down my stomach that is 12\\&quot;  long! I HATED seeing it so I was trying to find something to minimize it.  (I&#x27;m 27 now). This is the truth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I checked out the Ad and it directed me to the actual site. I looked at the prices and offers, but didn&#x27;t want to pay $35-140 for ANY of the offers! So I closed the site.&lt;br /&gt;That very day, I received an email for 10% off! Not bad, not great, but still a discount! A day later, a Revitol Representative called me and said she noticed I had checked out their site (I have no idea how they track you lol).. . and the lady said they were sending me a FREE JAR! :O  I was like WOOHOO! I had to pay $9 for the shipping, THAT&#x27;S IT! And offered me a $100 gift cared to their Natural Well-Being site! :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, enough unnecessary blabber... I tried it for 1 month and NO JOKE, that scar on my stomach is no more than a tiny, light line down my middle! ALSO got rid of some deep pitted scars in my face and legs from Shingles. IT IS A GREAT PRODUCT to me! The moment you put it on, it tingles a bit, so you know there&#x27;s something in there that&#x27;s WORKING! HIGHLY RECCOMMEND THIS PRODUCT! If you have to, call the company and INQUIRE ABOUT A FREE SAMPLE JAR! It&#x27;s a BIG JAR too! Well worth the money now that I&#x27;ve used it. If you&#x27;re still in doubts, email me at crys1218@gmail.com... I&#x27;ll show anyone what it&#x27;s done for me!</li>
            <li> I was terrified of getting stretch marks and had used extra virgin coconut oil until 32 weeks. After tons of searching for the best product, I ordered this cream because of its high rank among the others. At first I used both the prevention cream and the coconut oil together. Then ran out of the oil and used only this cream twice a day everyday. Within 3-4 days I developed stretch marks. So it definitely does NOT prevent new marks as advertised. I may have got them anyway even if I had continued using the coconut oil..but my guess is that there is a correlation. My suggestion is extra virgin coconut oil! It&#x27;s marketed for cooking, but it kept me stretch mark free until I quit using it!</li>
            <li> My wife uses this and says it works as well as expensive brands without the cost.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product to anyone. I originally purchased this item because Revitol is ranked as the number one stretch mark cream on the market and others have given excellent reviews on it. After I bought it though i realized i wasted my money. I applied it 1-3 sometimes 4 times daily and noticed no change in the appearance of my stretch marks. Perhaps Revitol will be more effective for prevention purposes or newly formed stretch marks as I&#x27;ve had mine for several years.</li>
            <li> This product did not help my stretch marks at all. Would not recomend this product. I will not purchase again.</li>
