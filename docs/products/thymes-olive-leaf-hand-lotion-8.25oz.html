            <li>If you are looking for fragrance, it&#x27;s really nice - not at all like olives</li>
            <li>It smells so good, and goes on lightly without being sticky.</li>
            <li>Lovely product would make a nice birthday or hostess gift.</li>
            <li>This fast absorbing, non-greasy, pleasant smelling, perfect lotion is in a class by itself.</li>
            <li>Smells great, but very, very drying to skin....</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know what I was going to do because I enjoyed this lotion</li>
            <li>I love this hand cream and its scent</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>The scent is delicious and the fragrance lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I love this product and will enjoy giving it as Christmas presents.</li>
            <li>This lotion is light and moisturizing without being oily.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>This is just right and the scent is light and refreshing.</li>
            <li>love the clean, fresh smell of Thymes Olive Leaf.</li>
            <li>love the clean fresh smell and the lotion is not greasy and&lt;br</li>
            <li>and the lotions is a nice high quality i would buy again.</li>
            <li>I discovered this beautiful, clean, fresh hand lotion at a local gift store.</li>
            <li>It leaves a clean aroma and is not greasy to the touch.  </li>
            <li>is so clean.....</li>
            <li>It has a nice daytime scent, not a heavy perfume.</li>
            <li>My husband also will use this as it&#x27;s a fresh clean scent, not floral.</li>
            <li>I think most people would find this soft natural smelling sent appealing.</li>
            <li>This is a great smell, very natural and not real &#x27;perfumey&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>These cream makes my hands soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>For some reason it is hard to find in my area so was pleased to be able to purchase it on line</li>
            <li>really a skin saver in winter and a good overall moisture lotion even for facial use.</li>
            <li>Olive Leaf takes me back in time to the &#x27;50&#x27;s for some reason--a great, slow, easy time to be alive!</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and gets into the cuticles to keep your hands feeling soft and smooth without having rough areas around your fingertips.</li>
            <li>too much alcohol.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very moisturizing and can be used on the body, not just hands.</li>
            <li>We know that there are hundreds of lotions on the market that all do the same thing - they soften, smooth, protect, etc.  </li>
            <li>so I have went on Amazon for so many other things and decided to give it a try,thanks Amazon without you</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The minute I started using this lotion I fell in Love with it,the smell the way it felt but little to my surprise the store I purchased it from went out of business.</li>
            <li>I love the scent and it last a long time.</li>
            <li>I purchased this in a little boutique shop and now see it&#x27;s cheaper here on Amazon, should have known to look here first.</li>
            <li>would like to see another top since the pump wastes a lot of the lotion and requires maneuvering to get the last few dabs.</li>
            <li>I am new to the Thymes brand, but I am eager to try their other products.  </li>

            <li> the scent does last a long time......</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t smell good, leaves a weird lingering oder for a long time that is hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> There are many less expensive hand and body lotions out there, but everyone deserves to treat themselves once in a while.  </li>
            <li> My next purchase will be the cologne,and then the other Olive Leaf products.</li>
            <li> It is expensive but worth it.  </li>
            <li> and actually dries out skin because of the harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> It is priced $2.00 less here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> it makes my hands feel so soft especially in this cold weather we&#x27;ve been having.</li>
            <li> However,  within those hundreds are tucked little gems that are standouts.</li>
            <li> I have thrown away a lot of hand lotion because it was too watery or too heavy.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance draws lots of compliments and is subtle and lingering.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and it was brutal.  </li>

            <li> The thymes olive leaf fragrance I have been using for years and it can&#x27;t be beat!  It leaves a clean aroma and is not greasy to the touch.  All of their products are wonderful.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and it last a long time.</li>
            <li> Smells great, but very, very drying to skin....too much alcohol.  I have eczema and it was brutal.  I returned to store.</li>
            <li> I love this hand cream and its scent is so clean..... it makes my hands feel so soft especially in this cold weather we&#x27;ve been having.</li>
            <li> Used for years, Thymes never disappoints.</li>

            <li> this lotion was introduced to me by a friend..... love the clean fresh smell and the lotion is not greasy and&lt;br /&gt;absorbs good.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It has a nice daytime scent, not a heavy perfume. It&#x27;s also very moisturizing and can be used on the body, not just hands.</li>
            <li> I have always liked the Thymes brand. The candles they have are really great. This is lotion as it says. Smells good.</li>
            <li> it works great as a lotion too, but the smell is awesome - nice and clean.  Moisturizes and soaks into the skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion is a different flavor, same maker as some I got daughter for Christmas last year.  I think she&#x27;s happy with it.</li>
            <li> This lotion is light and moisturizing without being oily.  It is expensive but worth it.  I have thrown away a lot of hand lotion because it was too watery or too heavy.  This is just right and the scent is light and refreshing.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for fragrance, it&#x27;s really nice - not at all like olives though and actually dries out skin because of the harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic.  I think it is a bit pricey but after trying some out at a friends house, I had to buy it.  the scent does last a long time......</li>
            <li> These cream makes my hands soft and smooth. Like the smell and the convenient bottle. I recommend this cream. great product</li>
            <li> We know that there are hundreds of lotions on the market that all do the same thing - they soften, smooth, protect, etc.  However,  within those hundreds are tucked little gems that are standouts. Such is the case with Thymes Olive Leaf lotion.  This fast absorbing, non-greasy, pleasant smelling, perfect lotion is in a class by itself.
