            <li>Great polish!</li>
            <li>Sometimes you will see this type of product that does offer a color shift, but not always a pleasant one!</li>
            <li>Works wonderful and looks great.</li>
            <li>but they are all beautiful when you finish.</li>
            <li>With a name like 3D duochrome, you&#x27;d think you&#x27;d see some beautiful, eye popping color kaleidoscope</li>
            <li>lol)</li>

            <li>Kleancolor 3D Duochrome Nail Polish is amazing!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got good coverage, great colors.</li>
            <li>Nice polish, she loves them!</li>
            <li>Great quality nail polish, beyond pleased!</li>
            <li>good polish.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased Kleancolor polishes before, and loved them.</li>
            <li>Simply very beautiful, shiny, smooth eggplant, purple polish.</li>
            <li>Has good coverage.</li>
            <li>These nail polishes came quickly and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>Great, bring out more 3D colors.</li>
            <li>The polish does stay on good though, which is nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall: If you have a nail dryer (or lots of time), then you&#x27;ll love them!</li>
            <li>The are amazing quality for the price.  </li>
            <li>Also do not forget that duochromes can look amazing when you paint them as a rainbow patterned gradient.</li>
            <li>I liked these polishes.</li>
            <li>packaged nicely.</li>
            <li>Good deal for 6 bottles of nail polish, the colors are lovely.</li>
            <li>With The Chromies&amp;#34; is the one that has impressed me the most, even indoors, major color shift AND the colors are attractive themselves.  </li>
            <li>Since I change my nail polish alot, my polish lasting a good week is perfect for me!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another problem is that the colors aren&#x27;t very strong in the duochrome department.</li>
            <li>beautiful colors, fast sipping!</li>
            <li>Very light coating  </li>
            <li>I love wicked/angelic.  </li>
            <li>And the rhinestone chandelier earrings are seriously cute.  </li>
            <li>These are quite lovely.</li>
            <li>These were just okay for me.</li>
            <li>The colors are okay.</li>
            <li>Yes, you are getting 6 bottles for basically the price of one, but in my opinion, you would be better off with one quality polish.</li>
            <li>Wicked/Angelic is the lightest of them all, and the most transparent.</li>
            <li>It needs a minimum of three coats, but more like five to be opaque.</li>
            <li>Dollar store polish works better.</li>
            <li>but I saw a video of these and am so glad I got them</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>I love all these colors.  </li>
            <li>lovely colors.</li>
            <li>Love the colors, goes on evenly.</li>
            <li>I love the colors.</li>
            <li>The colors are good but you need 3 coats to be worth while.</li>
            <li>better than described.</li>
            <li>So worth the money really good quality.</li>
            <li>Maybe they show better outdoors but it didn&#x27;t give any color changing effects.  </li>
            <li>I love these colors.</li>
            <li>love the colors.</li>
            <li>does stay on better than most polishes.</li>
            <li>I love the polish.</li>
            <li>Very nice colors for the price and came fast in the mail.</li>
            <li>(People I gave them to were very excited to get them)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I got my polish today, and was very excited.  </li>
            <li>Also, thanks for the gift, nice earrings!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest #309 Bold</li>
            <li>For best results, let dry fully between each coat because it will smudge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried it right away, however, and I love it!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe you will need 2 or 3 coat for a better color, but at the final will be beautiful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to get these colors, they are beautiful and I intend to order the metallic and the holographic polish in the very near future!  </li>
            <li>They do take multiple coats and need a good though top coat!</li>
            <li>this polish will chip incredibly easily.  </li>
            <li>It does have a strong odor, but cheap nail polish always does.  </li>
            <li>when I did put on way too much I was able to peel it off easily!</li>
            <li>I think they&#x27;re wonderful, as long as the light hits them just right.</li>
            <li>Like the way the go on so smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I also did not receive the free earring that they say you also get</li>
            <li>but I did not receive my free earings with this order.</li>
            <li>goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>I only need two coats for the look I want,  then apply a really good top coat.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the key to this polish,  finding a really good top coat.  </li>
            <li>Vampy/Girly is best layered over red, dark or bright is fine.</li>
            <li>I will buy other colors very good polish .</li>
            <li>I love the one&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried, For me the smell is strong but doesn&#x27;t bother me to much.</li>
            <li>Experimenting with them is fun!</li>
            <li>top coat sealer and my nails stay pretty for 5-7 days without chipping or peeling.  </li>
            <li>The package arrived safely with no broken bottles, and it did come with a free earring (which I will never wear, but on of my students will probably appreciate).</li>
            <li>These didn&#x27;t turn out to be as good as I expected them to be because you have to have so many layers of polish before it becomes opague</li>
            <li>The matte finish polish colors are nice and vibrant and apply with ease, but once applied the paint chips off right away.</li>
            <li>Not so with these: the first coat is really, really light with each color, so light</li>
            <li>Very, VERY sheer, colors aren&#x27;t terribly bright.</li>
            <li>U have to apply 3 coats to see the true color.</li>
            <li>You will need 3-4 coats to get full opacity.</li>
            <li>My co-workers love the color selection so much they want to order them too.</li>
            <li>Not a bad polish for the price.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick and the items were packaged as one would expect of bottled polish.</li>
            <li>Wet n Wild&#x27;s Grays Anatomy is another underrated duochrome best layer, which is 3 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;Happy nailpolishing everyone.</li>
            <li>these are inexpensive and very pretty</li>
            <li>these are inexpensive and very pretty</li>
            <li>This polish is very pretty and sturdy.</li>
            <li>The colors are very pretty.</li>
            <li>For $8.50 just the five cool duochromes are worth the price.</li>
            <li>These are very pretty, but all kind of look the same.</li>
            <li>I gave a few away and my friends who aren&#x27;t nail addicts like me were happy with them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the colors of this whole brand are fantastic.</li>
            <li>This is a nice pack to split up and share, since some end up looking very similar to others.</li>
            <li>company kept it&#x27;s promise.. worth the price.</li>
            <li>Two of the colors are very very similar but it&#x27;s a nice variety pack otherwise.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty, but if you&#x27;re into bold colors, this is a bit of a yawner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Not like some polishes that start flaking off right away.</li>
            <li>The colors stay true and even after working with paper and file folders for two weeks really wouldn&#x27;t need to go to the manicurist except for the growth.</li>
            <li>, I get huge nicks and chips even after using a layer of clear coat over the polish and a layer of top coat over the clear coat.</li>
            <li>, they have a subtle shift that is really more gentle and has more depth than most</li>
            <li>I love to mix them, I have 4 different types of polish on my nails right now.</li>
            <li>The only way I could used them is to paint them over an opaque black color and then paint a good top coat over it.  </li>
            <li>They also look different depending on how many coats you use.</li>
            <li>Out of all the colors I really only like one, the one that is more purple.</li>
            <li>Scarabée just came out with three shades which I imagine are stunning...if you are ready to spend $50!</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty, and though they&#x27;re really not as duochrome as I hoped, they still have some nice depth and effect.</li>
            <li>Product goes on smooth and gives complete coverage in two coats.</li>
            <li>They are pretty</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>First time using this brand.  </li>
            <li>The colors are really pretty</li>
            <li>Rose with pink shift?</li>
            <li>Because the other five duochromes are spectacular.</li>
            <li>To get a more blue effect Layer it over a strong blue like</li>
            <li>The consistency of this and most KC polish is on the thick side, but most are opaque in one or two coats.</li>
            <li>These are pretty but not too much 3d.</li>
            <li>It is fun to have such rich looking polish.  </li>
            <li>Wet n Wild&#x27;s Grays Anatomy is another underrated duochrome best layer, which is 3 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;Happy nailpolishing everyone.is really dark but flashes some wicked purple-red</li>
            <li>Low shipping (or free shipping?)</li>
            <li>I like that this brand is cruelty-free and they are reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>KB Shimmer and Color Club have offerings in this line that really put these to shame.  </li>
            <li>very mucht</li>
            <li>Bold/Classic isn&#x27;t really a duochrome at all - it&#x27;s sort of a frosty taupe.</li>
            <li>so I really do like them.</li>
            <li>so I really do like them.</li>
            <li>I love the colors and the arrival was sooner than I expected</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Niece, age 13, really likes the colors.</li>
            <li>The colors are very cool.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A real value for the money.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I was expecting too much when I bought these, but there isn&#x27;t much of a &amp;#34;3D&amp;#34; effect</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really see much difference in the colors on my nails</li>
            <li>And while others are saying they aren&#x27;t very duochrome</li>
            <li>dries fast even when I accidentally put way too much on.</li>
            <li>Very unattractive  polish</li>
            <li>Cons: It does take at least two-three good coats,</li>
            <li>#314 is to the far right FYI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>#314 is to the far right FYI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was really excited to see they put out a new line of shades, but really disappointed that it isn&#x27;t among their best work.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to see they put out a new line of shades, but really disappointed that it isn&#x27;t among their best work.</li>
            <li>Other than that I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>Use a good base and top coat and let everything dry properly, and these are pretty good polishes.</li>
            <li>Not super fast but ok.</li>
            <li>fast drying clear coat on top, no mess , no smudge ,solid application.  </li>
            <li>moody looks good on top of dark (or Barney) purple , navy blue, or black.</li>
            <li>I have bought a quite a few nail polish of this brand and was very surprised at how much I liked them</li>
            <li>Like others of this brand, the polishes smell a little funny and dry a little funny, but they work perfectly well.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t as solid as I&#x27;d wished, but if put over another color, they look really cool.</li>
            <li>I also highly recommend them for Halloween as most of them look like dark spooky colors.</li>
            <li>and they aren&#x27;t particularly smelly -</li>
            <li>Needed a little more depth to be 3d.</li>
            <li>This polish has a fast dry time making multiple coats easy and fast to apply.</li>
            <li>Then again they are all pretty much the same color .</li>
            <li>In the pic Amazon has up this looks far more blue than it actually is.</li>
            <li>After a week of wear I did have a few chips and cracks, but I did not have a top coat on.</li>
            <li>pretty much all the same color...</li>
            <li>I am shopping early for Christmas, so I can not tell how it looks on the nails, but it looks as pictured, the colors are vibrant</li>
            <li>Flirty/Innocent is much more of a rose-colored frost and more opaque than any of the other shades, but again, not really much of a duochrome, other than a hint of gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love how these look, they are very stylish but grown up enough that I wear them to work, mainly because the colors go well with my business and business casual clothes like navy, grey, and khaki etcetera.</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty, totally different from anything I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick, rich, &amp; colorful.</li>
            <li>#310 -diva/tomboy also looks good on top of grey, dark pink, or dark (or Barney) purple.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found the a colored base coat works good for this polish but that certain colors work better with the different polishes in this set .</li>
            <li>While they don&#x27;t cover well by themselves I use a plain color as a base and just add 2 layers of this on top and it looks perfect.</li>
            <li>/Angelic is best layered over deep green since it is Green with a red duel.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wet n Wild Wild Shine Nail Color, Blue Moon or if you like a more purple tone</li>
            <li># 312 flirty/innocent looks good on top of dark orange , emerald green , and dark red.</li>
            <li>/angelic also looks good on top of emerald green, dark orange, and dark red.</li>
            <li>Well, they are cheap, they do have a hint of Duochrome (even in direct sunlight, where other brands generally explode, these have only a hint!), but compared to a bit higher end products (and I am talking mid-range, say $10 a bottle,</li>
            <li>I couldn´t really see a big difference between some of them</li>
            <li>would really like a refund and somewhere to send this stuff back to.</li>
            <li>Okay, I&#x27;ve  been a nail polish fanatic for a while now</li>
            <li>The only thing that really sucked was I ordered six colors</li>
            <li>I have had no trouble with chipping or with the application of the product.</li>
            <li>Although they look the same when looking at the bottle, when they&#x27;re applied they look very</li>
            <li>Probably my least favorite of the Kleancolor collections I bought.  </li>
            <li>So far I have tried the wicked/angelic.</li>
            <li>Feel free to try other combinations to see how different colored base costs affect the colors and see which combinations you like the best .  </li>
            <li># 311-vampy/girly looks good on top of dark (or Barney) purple , dark pink, or dark red .</li>
            <li>Very shimmery, and a little color changing (not as much as the pics show).</li>
            <li>The color variety is what attracted me to this product, but many seemed like slight variations on each other when I got the polish in person.</li>
            <li>Wet n Wild Wild Shine Nail Color, Eggplant Frost (I&#x27;m suggesting lower end product because on the nails a good base and top coat are going to determine how long your polish lasts no matter what you use, so save your money for those two items.)&lt;br /&gt;311</li>
            <li>last two, 311 Vampy/Girly and 312 Flirty/Innocent look pretty similar in the bottles but go on very differently.</li>
            <li>/Moody: Dark blue with light blue shift.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok but not great.</li>
            <li>We all know you need to make a duochrome come to life by layering it (not to full opacity obviously) over another slightly similar color or over black.</li>
            <li>The only reason I&#x27;m giving them 4 stars instead of 5 is that the nail polishes are quite dull in color and are very sheer and take a few coats to get a good color from them.</li>
            <li>Some of the colors do look a lot alike and the color switch is not as intense as some other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li>The smell isnt any different from any other polish I have used and the consistency is perfect, not too thick and not too thin.</li>
            <li>Vampy/Girly is a pretty, frosty deep mauve color, without any obvious duochrome look, other than a darker similar color at some angles, but any frost is like that.</li>
            <li>Be sure to give yourself a lot of time between coats, and layering over other polish, even polish dried for over a day, can create nails that won&#x27;t dry and get dented with flaws or could be scraped off, even after several hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>problem KC has had with some shades in the past is drying time: the polishes aren&#x27;t like many other formulas and can stay tacky for a long time.</li>
            <li>hate to say it, but these polishes, while pretty, exemplify some of the complaints I&#x27;ve read about KleanColor polishes over the years, even though a lot of their hundreds of polishes are really fabulous and unusual.</li>

            <li>Diva/Tomboy is a little blue and a little purple/pink, but try not to streak any of the coats, or you&#x27;ll end up with a light spot, even after three coats.</li>

            <li> This is a great polish for the price.</li>
            <li> These polish are great.</li>
            <li> They are are great price though so it all works out in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The colors are great.  </li>
            <li> Love all the colors I recieved!!</li>
            <li> Very nice item&lt;br /&gt;thank</li>
            <li> Very nice colors,</li>
            <li> Very nice colors.</li>
            <li> Kleancolor 3D Duochrome Nail Polish is amazing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got good coverage, great colors.</li>
            <li> Nice polish, she loves them!</li>
            <li> Great quality nail polish, beyond pleased!</li>
            <li> good polish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased Kleancolor polishes before, and loved them.</li>
            <li> Simply very beautiful, shiny, smooth eggplant, purple polish.</li>
            <li> Has good coverage.</li>
            <li> These nail polishes came quickly and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Great, bring out more 3D colors.</li>
            <li> The polish does stay on good though, which is nice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall: If you have a nail dryer (or lots of time), then you&#x27;ll love them!</li>
            <li> The are amazing quality for the price.  </li>
            <li> Also do not forget that duochromes can look amazing when you paint them as a rainbow patterned gradient.</li>
            <li> I liked these polishes.</li>
            <li> packaged nicely.</li>
            <li> Good deal for 6 bottles of nail polish, the colors are lovely.</li>
            <li> With The Chromies&amp;#34; is the one that has impressed me the most, even indoors, major color shift AND the colors are attractive themselves.  </li>
            <li> Since I change my nail polish alot, my polish lasting a good week is perfect for me!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another problem is that the colors aren&#x27;t very strong in the duochrome department.</li>
            <li> beautiful colors, fast sipping!</li>
            <li> Very light coating  </li>
            <li> I love wicked/angelic.  </li>
            <li> And the rhinestone chandelier earrings are seriously cute.  </li>
            <li> These are quite lovely.</li>
            <li> These were just okay for me.</li>
            <li> The colors are okay.</li>
            <li> Yes, you are getting 6 bottles for basically the price of one, but in my opinion, you would be better off with one quality polish.</li>
            <li> Wicked/Angelic is the lightest of them all, and the most transparent.</li>
            <li> It needs a minimum of three coats, but more like five to be opaque.</li>
            <li> Dollar store polish works better.</li>
            <li> but I saw a video of these and am so glad I got them</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> I love all these colors.  </li>
            <li> lovely colors.</li>
            <li> Love the colors, goes on evenly.</li>
            <li> I love the colors.</li>
            <li> The colors are good but you need 3 coats to be worth while.</li>
            <li> better than described.</li>
            <li> So worth the money really good quality.</li>
            <li> Maybe they show better outdoors but it didn&#x27;t give any color changing effects.  </li>
            <li> I love these colors.</li>
            <li> love the colors.</li>
            <li> does stay on better than most polishes.</li>
            <li> I love the polish.</li>
            <li> Very nice colors for the price and came fast in the mail.</li>
            <li> (People I gave them to were very excited to get them)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I got my polish today, and was very excited.  </li>
            <li> Also, thanks for the gift, nice earrings!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest #309 Bold</li>
            <li> For best results, let dry fully between each coat because it will smudge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried it right away, however, and I love it!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe you will need 2 or 3 coat for a better color, but at the final will be beautiful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to get these colors, they are beautiful and I intend to order the metallic and the holographic polish in the very near future!  </li>
            <li> They do take multiple coats and need a good though top coat!</li>
            <li> this polish will chip incredibly easily.  </li>
            <li> It does have a strong odor, but cheap nail polish always does.  </li>
            <li> when I did put on way too much I was able to peel it off easily!</li>
            <li> I think they&#x27;re wonderful, as long as the light hits them just right.</li>
            <li> Like the way the go on so smoothly.  </li>
            <li> I also did not receive the free earring that they say you also get</li>
            <li> but I did not receive my free earings with this order.</li>
            <li> goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> I only need two coats for the look I want,  then apply a really good top coat.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the key to this polish,  finding a really good top coat.  </li>
            <li> Vampy/Girly is best layered over red, dark or bright is fine.</li>
            <li> I will buy other colors very good polish .</li>
            <li> I love the one&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried, For me the smell is strong but doesn&#x27;t bother me to much.</li>
            <li> Experimenting with them is fun!</li>
            <li> top coat sealer and my nails stay pretty for 5-7 days without chipping or peeling.  </li>
            <li> The package arrived safely with no broken bottles, and it did come with a free earring (which I will never wear, but on of my students will probably appreciate).</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t turn out to be as good as I expected them to be because you have to have so many layers of polish before it becomes opague</li>
            <li> The matte finish polish colors are nice and vibrant and apply with ease, but once applied the paint chips off right away.</li>
            <li> Not so with these: the first coat is really, really light with each color, so light</li>
            <li> Very, VERY sheer, colors aren&#x27;t terribly bright.</li>
            <li> U have to apply 3 coats to see the true color.</li>
            <li> You will need 3-4 coats to get full opacity.</li>
            <li> My co-workers love the color selection so much they want to order them too.</li>
            <li> Not a bad polish for the price.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick and the items were packaged as one would expect of bottled polish.</li>
            <li> Wet n Wild&#x27;s Grays Anatomy is another underrated duochrome best layer, which is 3 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;Happy nailpolishing everyone.</li>
            <li> these are inexpensive and very pretty</li>
            <li> these are inexpensive and very pretty</li>
            <li> This polish is very pretty and sturdy.</li>
            <li> The colors are very pretty.</li>
            <li> For $8.50 just the five cool duochromes are worth the price.</li>
            <li> These are very pretty, but all kind of look the same.</li>
            <li> I gave a few away and my friends who aren&#x27;t nail addicts like me were happy with them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the colors of this whole brand are fantastic.</li>
            <li> This is a nice pack to split up and share, since some end up looking very similar to others.</li>
            <li> company kept it&#x27;s promise.. worth the price.</li>
            <li> Two of the colors are very very similar but it&#x27;s a nice variety pack otherwise.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty, but if you&#x27;re into bold colors, this is a bit of a yawner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Not like some polishes that start flaking off right away.</li>
            <li> The colors stay true and even after working with paper and file folders for two weeks really wouldn&#x27;t need to go to the manicurist except for the growth.</li>
            <li> , I get huge nicks and chips even after using a layer of clear coat over the polish and a layer of top coat over the clear coat.</li>
            <li> , they have a subtle shift that is really more gentle and has more depth than most</li>
            <li> I love to mix them, I have 4 different types of polish on my nails right now.</li>
            <li> The only way I could used them is to paint them over an opaque black color and then paint a good top coat over it.  </li>
            <li> They also look different depending on how many coats you use.</li>
            <li> Out of all the colors I really only like one, the one that is more purple.</li>
            <li> Scarabée just came out with three shades which I imagine are stunning...if you are ready to spend $50!</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty, and though they&#x27;re really not as duochrome as I hoped, they still have some nice depth and effect.</li>
            <li> Product goes on smooth and gives complete coverage in two coats.</li>
            <li> They are pretty</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> First time using this brand.  </li>
            <li> The colors are really pretty</li>
            <li> Rose with pink shift?</li>
            <li> Because the other five duochromes are spectacular.</li>
            <li> To get a more blue effect Layer it over a strong blue like</li>
            <li> The consistency of this and most KC polish is on the thick side, but most are opaque in one or two coats.</li>
            <li> These are pretty but not too much 3d.</li>
            <li> It is fun to have such rich looking polish.  </li>
            <li> Wet n Wild&#x27;s Grays Anatomy is another underrated duochrome best layer, which is 3 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;Happy nailpolishing everyone.is really dark but flashes some wicked purple-red</li>
            <li> Low shipping (or free shipping?)</li>
            <li> I like that this brand is cruelty-free and they are reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> KB Shimmer and Color Club have offerings in this line that really put these to shame.  </li>
            <li> very mucht</li>
            <li> Bold/Classic isn&#x27;t really a duochrome at all - it&#x27;s sort of a frosty taupe.</li>
            <li> so I really do like them.</li>
            <li> so I really do like them.</li>
            <li> I love the colors and the arrival was sooner than I expected</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Niece, age 13, really likes the colors.</li>
            <li> The colors are very cool.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A real value for the money.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I was expecting too much when I bought these, but there isn&#x27;t much of a &amp;#34;3D&amp;#34; effect</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really see much difference in the colors on my nails</li>
            <li> And while others are saying they aren&#x27;t very duochrome</li>
            <li> dries fast even when I accidentally put way too much on.</li>
            <li> Very unattractive  polish</li>
            <li> Cons: It does take at least two-three good coats,</li>
            <li> #314 is to the far right FYI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> #314 is to the far right FYI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was really excited to see they put out a new line of shades, but really disappointed that it isn&#x27;t among their best work.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to see they put out a new line of shades, but really disappointed that it isn&#x27;t among their best work.</li>
            <li> Other than that I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> Use a good base and top coat and let everything dry properly, and these are pretty good polishes.</li>
            <li> Not super fast but ok.</li>
            <li> fast drying clear coat on top, no mess , no smudge ,solid application.  </li>
            <li> moody looks good on top of dark (or Barney) purple , navy blue, or black.</li>
            <li> I have bought a quite a few nail polish of this brand and was very surprised at how much I liked them</li>
            <li> Like others of this brand, the polishes smell a little funny and dry a little funny, but they work perfectly well.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t as solid as I&#x27;d wished, but if put over another color, they look really cool.</li>
            <li> I also highly recommend them for Halloween as most of them look like dark spooky colors.</li>
            <li> and they aren&#x27;t particularly smelly -</li>
            <li> Needed a little more depth to be 3d.</li>
            <li> This polish has a fast dry time making multiple coats easy and fast to apply.</li>
            <li> Then again they are all pretty much the same color .</li>
            <li> In the pic Amazon has up this looks far more blue than it actually is.</li>
            <li> After a week of wear I did have a few chips and cracks, but I did not have a top coat on.</li>
            <li> pretty much all the same color...</li>
            <li> I am shopping early for Christmas, so I can not tell how it looks on the nails, but it looks as pictured, the colors are vibrant</li>
            <li> Flirty/Innocent is much more of a rose-colored frost and more opaque than any of the other shades, but again, not really much of a duochrome, other than a hint of gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love how these look, they are very stylish but grown up enough that I wear them to work, mainly because the colors go well with my business and business casual clothes like navy, grey, and khaki etcetera.</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty, totally different from anything I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, rich, &amp; colorful.</li>
            <li> #310 -diva/tomboy also looks good on top of grey, dark pink, or dark (or Barney) purple.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found the a colored base coat works good for this polish but that certain colors work better with the different polishes in this set .</li>
            <li> While they don&#x27;t cover well by themselves I use a plain color as a base and just add 2 layers of this on top and it looks perfect.</li>
            <li> /Angelic is best layered over deep green since it is Green with a red duel.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wet n Wild Wild Shine Nail Color, Blue Moon or if you like a more purple tone</li>
            <li> # 312 flirty/innocent looks good on top of dark orange , emerald green , and dark red.</li>
            <li> /angelic also looks good on top of emerald green, dark orange, and dark red.</li>
            <li> Well, they are cheap, they do have a hint of Duochrome (even in direct sunlight, where other brands generally explode, these have only a hint!), but compared to a bit higher end products (and I am talking mid-range, say $10 a bottle,</li>
            <li> I couldn´t really see a big difference between some of them</li>
            <li> would really like a refund and somewhere to send this stuff back to.</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;ve  been a nail polish fanatic for a while now</li>
            <li> The only thing that really sucked was I ordered six colors</li>
            <li> I have had no trouble with chipping or with the application of the product.</li>
            <li> Although they look the same when looking at the bottle, when they&#x27;re applied they look very</li>
            <li> Probably my least favorite of the Kleancolor collections I bought.  </li>
            <li> So far I have tried the wicked/angelic.</li>
            <li> Feel free to try other combinations to see how different colored base costs affect the colors and see which combinations you like the best .  </li>
            <li> # 311-vampy/girly looks good on top of dark (or Barney) purple , dark pink, or dark red .</li>
            <li> Very shimmery, and a little color changing (not as much as the pics show).</li>
            <li> The color variety is what attracted me to this product, but many seemed like slight variations on each other when I got the polish in person.</li>
            <li> Wet n Wild Wild Shine Nail Color, Eggplant Frost (I&#x27;m suggesting lower end product because on the nails a good base and top coat are going to determine how long your polish lasts no matter what you use, so save your money for those two items.)&lt;br /&gt;311</li>
            <li> last two, 311 Vampy/Girly and 312 Flirty/Innocent look pretty similar in the bottles but go on very differently.</li>
            <li> /Moody: Dark blue with light blue shift.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but not great.</li>
            <li> We all know you need to make a duochrome come to life by layering it (not to full opacity obviously) over another slightly similar color or over black.</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving them 4 stars instead of 5 is that the nail polishes are quite dull in color and are very sheer and take a few coats to get a good color from them.</li>
            <li> Some of the colors do look a lot alike and the color switch is not as intense as some other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> The smell isnt any different from any other polish I have used and the consistency is perfect, not too thick and not too thin.</li>
            <li> Vampy/Girly is a pretty, frosty deep mauve color, without any obvious duochrome look, other than a darker similar color at some angles, but any frost is like that.</li>
            <li> Be sure to give yourself a lot of time between coats, and layering over other polish, even polish dried for over a day, can create nails that won&#x27;t dry and get dented with flaws or could be scraped off, even after several hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> problem KC has had with some shades in the past is drying time: the polishes aren&#x27;t like many other formulas and can stay tacky for a long time.</li>
            <li> hate to say it, but these polishes, while pretty, exemplify some of the complaints I&#x27;ve read about KleanColor polishes over the years, even though a lot of their hundreds of polishes are really fabulous and unusual.</li>
            <li> hate to say it, but these polishes, while pretty, exemplify some of the complaints I&#x27;ve read about KleanColor polishes over the years, even though a lot of their hundreds of polishes are really fabulous and unusual.</li>
            <li> Diva/Tomboy is a little blue and a little purple/pink, but try not to streak any of the coats, or you&#x27;ll end up with a light spot, even after three coats.</li>
            <li> All I can say is granted these are cheap but none the less, I do feel that I wasted my money on them!</li>
            <li> # 309 -bold/classic looks good on top of a base coat of grey , dark pink, or dark( or Barney ) purple.</li>
            <li> Smell of the polish is not as bad as others have stated and dry time is appropriate for standard non fast drying polish.</li>
            <li> Moody Was an unexpectedly goth polish in that it is really dark but flashes some wicked purple-red</li>
            <li> /&gt;The colors did last a long time without chipping, so that was a plus for me</li>
            <li> She also said the nail polish seems to last a long time .</li>
            <li> Also disappointed at the lack of greens or green highlights.much more of a rose-colored frost and more opaque than any of the other shades, but again, not really much of a duochrome, other than a hint of gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /Classic looks like the just poured pink shimmer into what ever polish they had left which turned out as gray brown muck and not muck else.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Layer it over whatever you think might work, red blue purple, black, IDK?</li>
            <li> Layer it over whatever you think might work, red blue purple, black, IDK?</li>
            <li> These were priced so low though that I don&#x27;t consider it a total waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Bright/Moody is really just a dark blue-purple with only a subtle dark blue frost highlight.</li>
            <li> I painted two colors, the purplish and dark blueish, together side by side on my nail, and they look ALMOST the same.</li>
            <li> (Example: Green with pink undertones next blue with purple and there you go.)</li>
            <li> Only about 2 of the colors really seem to be actual duochromes which is rather disappointing.</li>
            <li> Not really what I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sort of a champagne beige tinged with pink at an angle.</li>
            <li> Not really a chrome color.</li>
            <li> Orangey pink with pinkish purple shift...</li>
            <li> /Classic: Gunmetal with pink shift.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to use 3 - 4 coats just to get decent coverage as it&#x27;s rather thin polish.</li>
            <li> Some are definitely nicer than others - even with a dark or corresponding base several of these look exactly the same.</li>
            <li> have to say these are average quality nail polishes, they chip within 3-5</li>
            <li> If you want to get the colors dark you have to put a dark color underneath or put lots of coats of the polish on your nails.</li>
            <li> not a smooth look ,rough look when it drys.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably use these as a base and then put the holos on top.  </li>
            <li> Also these have a consistency that takes them a little longer to dry, and you need about two to three coat depending on your tastes of coverage, however I&#x27;ve found they don&#x27;t take nearly as long to dry if I do three thin coats waiting about 5 min between each, and then applying seche vit</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll break it down for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Layer it over a deep purple or black and see what I mean.</li>
            <li> In my case, it lasted for less than 6 hours.</li>
            <li> However, this package of 6 &amp;#34;Duochrome&amp;#34; colors are so similar, and non-3D that I am pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> The colors require several coats or a dark base like black to really pop.</li>
            <li> Even using a dark (or white) base coat, the amount of color shift and the visual appeal is extremely low.  </li>
            <li> in all these are really cool duochromes Aside for 309 which I just use as a base to other colors or</li>

            <li> got 6 very similar nail polishes for the same price I would have payed for one at Sally Beauty Supply, I read that each color was meant to have a specific base color polish  </li>
            <li> I recived the nail polish, but no free pair of earrings as promised</li>
            <li> Green with purple shift.</li>
            <li> I wonder why some polish smells worse than others but that would be my only complaint about the polish.</li>
            <li> The polish is too thin and takes forever to dry.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to even know what the color will look like after a few</li>
            <li> I can only say that I find these to be pretty pathetic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad to give a not-so-great review on these since I am a regular user of KleanColor nail polish, and I was hoping they would have worked out some of the longer known issues with their formula by now, but these disappoint.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure I needed six bottles.  </li>
            <li> Hard to call it a duochrome.</li>
            <li> but I was disappointed at how similar the colors are to each other.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I would buy them again, because I really like the chrome-effect they give to the base layer nail polish, though I wish Kleancolor would sell each one of these paired up with the correct shade of base-layer nail polish.</li>
            <li> I only used one coat as I applied a black polish as a base coat.</li>
            <li> which you get sometimes with less expensive polish.</li>
            <li> Disappointed that out of six polishes I got 2 that were the same.</li>
            <li> product was horable very thick</li>
            <li> Remember to use a base color, otherwise they may seem too sheer.  </li>

            <li> Coverage is a bit thin.  </li>
            <li> , the colors are so similar what is the point?&amp;#34; Those people are idiots.</li>
            <li> Also disappointed at the lack of greens or green highlights.</li>
            <li> With a base (I used matte black)</li>
            <li> I did put it over a black base coat.</li>
            <li> so I ordered this set, was disappointed the colors don&#x27;t look like what&#x27;s shown in the picture..</li>
            <li> but if you put a silver base it will help to enhance the color</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> All the colors look the same.</li>
            <li> Only about 2 of the colors really seem to be actual duochromes which is rather disappointing. I&#x27;ve had to use 3 - 4 coats just to get decent coverage as it&#x27;s rather thin polish.</li>
            <li> U have to apply 3 coats to see the true color.</li>
            <li> I love the one&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried, For me the smell is strong but doesn&#x27;t bother me to much.</li>
            <li> So impressed.  The are amazing quality for the price.  Remember to use a base color, otherwise they may seem too sheer.  I love wicked/angelic.  To me they are bronze in one angle and purple in another angle.  Like the way the go on so smoothly.  With a base (I used matte black) it only takes one or two coats.  Can&#x27;t wait to try the rest!  And the rhinestone chandelier earrings are seriously cute.  Will probably wear to work Christmas party.  What a deal for just over $7.  Low shipping (or free shipping?)</li>
            <li> These are quite lovely. They aren&#x27;t as solid as I&#x27;d wished, but if put over another color, they look really cool. Very shimmery, and a little color changing (not as much as the pics show). This is a nice pack to split up and share, since some end up looking very similar to others. It takes about 2-3 layers by themselves to be solid.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but not great. You will need 3-4 coats to get full opacity. The colors look very similar in the bottle, but on look different. They also look different depending on how many coats you use.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try the chrome effect for my nails, so I bought these, I was not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I got 6 very similar nail polishes for the same price I would have payed for one at Sally Beauty Supply, I read that each color was meant to have a specific base color polish  and that is how they were different, but I couldn´t really see a big difference between some of them so I ended up giving  3 of them away. (People I gave them to were very excited to get them)&lt;br /&gt;I have to say these are average quality nail polishes, they chip within 3-5 days.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would buy them again, because I really like the chrome-effect they give to the base layer nail polish, though I wish Kleancolor would sell each one of these paired up with the correct shade of base-layer nail polish.</li>
            <li> The color variety is what attracted me to this product, but many seemed like slight variations on each other when I got the polish in person. The polish needs multiple layers (5-6) in order to achieve the desired effect, so the amount of work to paint is already a deal breaker for me.  If you have thin or brittle nails (I do) this polish will chip incredibly easily.  In my case, it lasted for less than 6 hours. I won&#x27;t bother using it again.  I would suggest this purchase if you are looking for a duochrome for art projects.  It just isn&#x27;t practical for actual wear.</li>
            <li> The matte finish polish colors are nice and vibrant and apply with ease, but once applied the paint chips off right away.</li>
            <li> Appreciate the product, looking forward to using in jewelry making.  Thank you.  Also, thanks for the gift, nice earrings!</li>
            <li> These were just okay for me. The package arrived safely with no broken bottles, and it did come with a free earring (which I will never wear, but on of my students will probably appreciate). The colors are okay. Some are definitely nicer than others - even with a dark or corresponding base several of these look exactly the same. I gave a few away and my friends who aren&#x27;t nail addicts like me were happy with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors did last a long time without chipping, so that was a plus for me and they aren&#x27;t particularly smelly - which you get sometimes with less expensive polish. I like that this brand is cruelty-free and they are reasonably priced. I will probably order from this company again, but I would not repurchase any of these colors.</li>
            <li> Not really what I expected. I thought that the colors would be like in the pic. If you want to get the colors dark you have to put a dark color underneath or put lots of coats of the polish on your nails. One coat just doesn&#x27;t do it.  Out of all the colors I really only like one, the one that is more purple. Then again they are all pretty much the same color . The polish does stay on good though, which is nice. Not like some polishes that start flaking off right away. This nail color sticks to your nails. I painted my toe nails over a week ago and they still look just like they did when I painted them. I also did not receive the free earring that they say you also get but oh well</li>
            <li> I have bought a quite a few nail polish of this brand and was very surprised at how much I liked them so I ordered this set, was disappointed the colors don&#x27;t look like what&#x27;s shown in the picture.. will still buy this brand again just not this set</li>
            <li> Well, they are cheap, they do have a hint of Duochrome (even in direct sunlight, where other brands generally explode, these have only a hint!), but compared to a bit higher end products (and I am talking mid-range, say $10 a bottle,Christian Louboutin Nail Colour- Scarabée just came out with three shades which I imagine are stunning...if you are ready to spend $50! lol) I can only say that I find these to be pretty pathetic. Even using a dark (or white) base coat, the amount of color shift and the visual appeal is extremely low.  Yes, you are getting 6 bottles for basically the price of one, but in my opinion, you would be better off with one quality polish. KB Shimmer and Color Club have offerings in this line that really put these to shame.  KB Shimmer&#x27;s &amp;#34;Rollin&#x27; With The Chromies&amp;#34; is the one that has impressed me the most, even indoors, major color shift AND the colors are attractive themselves.  Sometimes you will see this type of product that does offer a color shift, but not always a pleasant one! All I can say is granted these are cheap but none the less, I do feel that I wasted my money on them!</li>
            <li> Very nice item&lt;br /&gt;thank u very mucht</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick and the items were packaged as one would expect of bottled polish. The colors require several coats or a dark base like black to really pop.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad to give a not-so-great review on these since I am a regular user of KleanColor nail polish, and I was hoping they would have worked out some of the longer known issues with their formula by now, but these disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have mentioned, the polish requires a minimum of three coats for each color. The consistency of this and most KC polish is on the thick side, but most are opaque in one or two coats. Not so with these: the first coat is really, really light with each color, so light it&#x27;s hard to even know what the color will look like after a few coats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A problem KC has had with some shades in the past is drying time: the polishes aren&#x27;t like many other formulas and can stay tacky for a long time. Be sure to give yourself a lot of time between coats, and layering over other polish, even polish dried for over a day, can create nails that won&#x27;t dry and get dented with flaws or could be scraped off, even after several hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another problem is that the colors aren&#x27;t very strong in the duochrome department. Bold/Classic isn&#x27;t really a duochrome at all - it&#x27;s sort of a frosty taupe. Diva/Tomboy is a little blue and a little purple/pink, but try not to streak any of the coats, or you&#x27;ll end up with a light spot, even after three coats. Bright/Moody is really just a dark blue-purple with only a subtle dark blue frost highlight. Hard to call it a duochrome. Wicked/Angelic is the lightest of them all, and the most transparent. It&#x27;s sort of a champagne beige tinged with pink at an angle. It needs a minimum of three coats, but more like five to be opaque. It&#x27;s pretty, but if you&#x27;re into bold colors, this is a bit of a yawner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last two, 311 Vampy/Girly and 312 Flirty/Innocent look pretty similar in the bottles but go on very differently. Vampy/Girly is a pretty, frosty deep mauve color, without any obvious duochrome look, other than a darker similar color at some angles, but any frost is like that. Flirty/Innocent is much more of a rose-colored frost and more opaque than any of the other shades, but again, not really much of a duochrome, other than a hint of gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate to say it, but these polishes, while pretty, exemplify some of the complaints I&#x27;ve read about KleanColor polishes over the years, even though a lot of their hundreds of polishes are really fabulous and unusual. I was really excited to see they put out a new line of shades, but really disappointed that it isn&#x27;t among their best work. Also disappointed at the lack of greens or green highlights.much more of a rose-colored frost and more opaque than any of the other shades, but again, not really much of a duochrome, other than a hint of gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate to say it, but these polishes, while pretty, exemplify some of the complaints I&#x27;ve read about KleanColor polishes over the years, even though a lot of their hundreds of polishes are really fabulous and unusual.

            <li> Have used OPI for years but this polish stays on like nothing I have ever used.  The colors stay true and even after working with paper and file folders for two weeks really wouldn&#x27;t need to go to the manicurist except for the growth.</li>
            <li> I recived the nail polish, but no free pair of earrings as promised</li>
            <li> not a smooth look ,rough look when it drys. looks and feels like it has particles in it. would really like a refund and somewhere to send this stuff back to.</li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t any 3 D effects . The polish is too thin and takes forever to dry. Dollar store polish works better.</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t turn out to be as good as I expected them to be because you have to have so many layers of polish before it becomes opague but they are all beautiful when you finish.</li>
            <li> I liked these polishes. The colors are pretty, and though they&#x27;re really not as duochrome as I hoped, they still have some nice depth and effect. Like others of this brand, the polishes smell a little funny and dry a little funny, but they work perfectly well. Use a good base and top coat and let everything dry properly, and these are pretty good polishes.</li>
            <li> I have not been a duochrome fan but I saw a video of these and am so glad I got them, they have a subtle shift that is really more gentle and has more depth than most</li>
            <li> Yay, they are here! My co-workers love the color selection so much they want to order them too.</li>
            <li> Item was received 9 days after ordered. Not super fast but ok. Disappointed that out of six polishes I got 2 that were the same. Smell of the polish is not as bad as others have stated and dry time is appropriate for standard non fast drying polish. Coverage is a bit thin.  Not a bad polish for the price.</li>
            <li> This is a great polish for the price. It&#x27;s got good coverage, great colors. I wonder why some polish smells worse than others but that would be my only complaint about the polish.</li>
            <li> product was horable very thick</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty, totally different from anything I have ever used. The smell isnt any different from any other polish I have used and the consistency is perfect, not too thick and not too thin. I only have one problem with it, and that is after 24 hours of it drying on my nails, I get huge nicks and chips even after using a layer of clear coat over the polish and a layer of top coat over the clear coat. Other than that I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> These are pretty but not too much 3d. I don&#x27;t see it. But they are beautiful! Needed a little more depth to be 3d.</li>
            <li> Not really a chrome color. Very light coating  but if you put a silver base it will help to enhance the color</li>
            <li> Product goes on smooth and gives complete coverage in two coats.</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;ve  been a nail polish fanatic for a while now and I&#x27;m darn picky about nail polish as I use it in my art work on glass resin and wood. I&#x27;ll be honest #309 Bold/Classic looks like the just poured pink shimmer into what ever polish they had left which turned out as gray brown muck and not muck else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why Five stars and not four? Because the other five duochromes are spectacular. Some people complain, &amp;#34;Oh, the colors are so similar what is the point?&amp;#34; Those people are idiots. We all know you need to make a duochrome come to life by layering it (not to full opacity obviously) over another slightly similar color or over black. Also do not forget that duochromes can look amazing when you paint them as a rainbow patterned gradient. (Example: Green with pink undertones next blue with purple and there you go.) For $8.50 just the five cool duochromes are worth the price. Why? I&#x27;ll break it down for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;310 Diva/Tomboy: In the pic Amazon has up this looks far more blue than it actually is. To get a more blue effect Layer it over a strong blue like Wet n Wild Wild Shine Nail Color, Blue Moon or if you like a more purple tone try Wet n Wild Wild Shine Nail Color, Eggplant Frost (I&#x27;m suggesting lower end product because on the nails a good base and top coat are going to determine how long your polish lasts no matter what you use, so save your money for those two items.)&lt;br /&gt;311 Vampy/Girly is best layered over red, dark or bright is fine. It depends on what effect you want.&lt;br /&gt;312 Flirty/innocent This one reminds me of the color shift we all went nuts over with: Clarin 230, Nuf-Oh 51, Max Factor Fantasy Fire, Color Club The Uptown, ect. Layer it over a deep purple or black and see what I mean. The Holo&#x27;s my color club could be used with this color, like Kleancolor chunky holo bluebell.&lt;br /&gt;313 Wicked/Angelic is best layered over deep green since it is Green with a red duel.&lt;br /&gt;314Bright/Moody Was an unexpectedly goth polish in that it is really dark but flashes some wicked purple-red and I think the name Wicked/Angelic should have gone to this one. Layer it over whatever you think might work, red blue purple, black, IDK? In the pick they have up this polish is mislabeled as being #309 Bold/Classic. #314 is to the far right FYI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all these are really cool duochromes Aside for 309 which I just use as a base to other colors or over black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, That&#x27;s it. these are inexpensive and very pretty so I really do like them. Wet n Wild&#x27;s Grays Anatomy is another underrated duochrome best layer, which is 3 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;Happy nailpolishing everyone.is really dark but flashes some wicked purple-red and I think the name Wicked/Angelic should have gone to this one.

            <li> These polish are great. I love them. I love to mix them, I have 4 different types of polish on my nails right now. Experimenting with them is fun!</li>
            <li> Like the colors but polish doesn&#x27;t last</li>
            <li> Very nice colors, but I did not receive my free earings with this order.</li>
            <li> I love all these colors.  I only need two coats for the look I want,  then apply a really good top coat.  That&#x27;s the key to this polish,  finding a really good top coat.  I use Probelle top coat sealer and my nails stay pretty for 5-7 days without chipping or peeling.  Since I change my nail polish alot, my polish lasting a good week is perfect for me!</li>
            <li> They are pretty but I was disappointed at how similar the colors are to each other.</li>
            <li> lovely colors. company kept it&#x27;s promise.. worth the price. good polish. packaged nicely. wish all companies were as dependable as this one</li>
            <li> i cant wait to use all of these colors</li>
            <li> Works wonderful and looks great.</li>
            <li> I love the colors and the arrival was sooner than I expected</li>
            <li> Kleancolor 3D Duochrome Nail Polish is amazing! It&#x27;s thick, rich, &amp; colorful.</li>
            <li> Nice polish, she loves them!</li>
            <li> These nail polishes came quickly and in perfect condition. The only reason I&#x27;m giving them 4 stars instead of 5 is that the nail polishes are quite dull in color and are very sheer and take a few coats to get a good color from them. They are are great price though so it all works out in my opinion. I also highly recommend them for Halloween as most of them look like dark spooky colors.</li>
            <li> I am shopping early for Christmas, so I can not tell how it looks on the nails, but it looks as pictured, the colors are vibrant</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased Kleancolor polishes before, and loved them. However, this package of 6 &amp;#34;Duochrome&amp;#34; colors are so similar, and non-3D that I am pretty disappointed. I painted two colors, the purplish and dark blueish, together side by side on my nail, and they look ALMOST the same. There is no color deviation. Simply very beautiful, shiny, smooth eggplant, purple polish. I like the quality, just NOT anything &amp;#34;Duochrome&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Love the colors, goes on evenly.</li>
            <li> Great, bring out more 3D colors. I can&#x27;t wait. I love the colors.</li>
            <li> The colors are good but you need 3 coats to be worth while.</li>
            <li> better than described. beautiful colors, fast sipping! thanks</li>
            <li> Very nice colors. Thanks! I will buy other colors very good polish .</li>
            <li> Niece, age 13, really likes the colors. She also said the nail polish seems to last a long time .</li>
            <li> I love how these look, they are very stylish but grown up enough that I wear them to work, mainly because the colors go well with my business and business casual clothes like navy, grey, and khaki etcetera. I&#x27;ve found the a colored base coat works good for this polish but that certain colors work better with the different polishes in this set . # 309 -bold/classic looks good on top of a base coat of grey , dark pink, or dark( or Barney ) purple. #310 -diva/tomboy also looks good on top of grey, dark pink, or dark (or Barney) purple. #314 -bright/moody looks good on top of dark (or Barney) purple , navy blue, or black. # 311-vampy/girly looks good on top of dark (or Barney) purple , dark pink, or dark red .# 312 flirty/innocent looks good on top of dark orange , emerald green , and dark red. # 313 wicked/angelic also looks good on top of emerald green, dark orange, and dark red. Feel free to try other combinations to see how different colored base costs affect the colors and see which combinations you like the best .  Also these have a consistency that takes them a little longer to dry, and you need about two to three coat depending on your tastes of coverage, however I&#x27;ve found they don&#x27;t take nearly as long to dry if I do three thin coats waiting about 5 min between each, and then applying seche vit fast drying clear coat on top, no mess , no smudge ,solid application.  I hope my findings help you !</li>
            <li> Good deal for 6 bottles of nail polish, the colors are lovely. Two of the colors are very very similar but it&#x27;s a nice variety pack otherwise.</li>
            <li> Beautiful!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> So worth the money really good quality.</li>
            <li> I got my polish today, and was very excited.  The only thing that really sucked was I ordered six colors and I only got five, one of the colors (312 Flirty/Innocent) was a duplicate so I have two of these.  I tried it right away, however, and I love it!  It does have a strong odor, but cheap nail polish always does.  I&#x27;m happy to get these colors, they are beautiful and I intend to order the metallic and the holographic polish in the very near future!  Happy to have this polish in my collection!</li>
            <li> This polish is very pretty and sturdy. I have had no trouble with chipping or with the application of the product.</li>
            <li> With a name like 3D duochrome, you&#x27;d think you&#x27;d see some beautiful, eye popping color kaleidoscope but nope.  I didn&#x27;t see jack.  Maybe they show better outdoors but it didn&#x27;t give any color changing effects.  They are still wearable but not as 3D duochrome; not the ones I received but give a try because you may get a different experience.</li>
            <li> I love these colors. They do take multiple coats and need a good though top coat!</li>
            <li> The Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s inexpensive. It doesn&#x27;t smell up the room when painting your nails. The colors are very pretty. Although they look the same when looking at the bottle, when they&#x27;re applied they look very different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cons: It does take at least two-three good coats, three-four is best for the color to show. For best results, let dry fully between each coat because it will smudge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: If you have a nail dryer (or lots of time), then you&#x27;ll love them!</li>
            <li> The colors are very cool.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe you will need 2 or 3 coat for a better color, but at the final will be beautiful.</li>
            <li> love the colors. goes on smooth. Has good coverage.</li>
            <li> It is fun to have such rich looking polish.  The colors are great.  I only used one coat as I applied a black polish as a base coat. A real value for the money.  Would buy them again.</li>
            <li> Maybe I was expecting too much when I bought these, but there isn&#x27;t much of a &amp;#34;3D&amp;#34; effect and I don&#x27;t really see much difference in the colors on my nails so I&#x27;m not sure I needed six bottles.  I&#x27;ll probably use these as a base and then put the holos on top.  Probably my least favorite of the Kleancolor collections I bought.  And as seems the norm with Kleancolor they seem to chip overnight.</li>
            <li> Very nice colors for the price and came fast in the mail. While they don&#x27;t cover well by themselves I use a plain color as a base and just add 2 layers of this on top and it looks perfect. And while others are saying they aren&#x27;t very duochrome I think they&#x27;re wonderful, as long as the light hits them just right.</li>
            <li> First time using this brand.  The only way I could used them is to paint them over an opaque black color and then paint a good top coat over it.  The colors are really pretty but they don&#x27;t have the 3d effect I was hoping for.  These were priced so low though that I don&#x27;t consider it a total waste of money.  I can still use them albeit not the way I was hoping.</li>
            <li> dries fast even when I accidentally put way too much on. does stay on better than most polishes. the colors of this whole brand are fantastic. when I did put on way too much I was able to peel it off easily!</li>
            <li> So far I have tried the wicked/angelic. The color goes from a bronze to garnet I did put it over a black base coat. The colors take a few coats to really pop. This polish has a fast dry time making multiple coats easy and fast to apply. After a week of wear I did have a few chips and cracks, but I did not have a top coat on. Some of the colors do look a lot alike and the color switch is not as intense as some other brands I have tried. Over all I do like this polish and would order it again</li>
            <li> These are very pretty, but all kind of look the same.</li>
            <li> Love all the colors I recieved!! Great polish!</li>
            <li> Great quality nail polish, beyond pleased!</li>
            <li> Very unattractive  polish</li>
            <li> pretty much all the same color...</li>
            <li> Very, VERY sheer, colors aren&#x27;t terribly bright. Takes several coats for opacity. Does not watermarble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diva/Tomboy: Bluejeans-type blue with purple shift. Needs 3-4 coats.&lt;br /&gt;Flirty/Innocent: Orangey pink with pinkish purple shift... Needs 4-5 coats.&lt;br /&gt;Bold/Classic: Gunmetal with pink shift. Needs 3-4 coats&lt;br /&gt;Bright/Moody: Dark blue with light blue shift. Needs 2-3 coats.&lt;br /&gt;Wicked/Angelic: Green with purple shift. Needs 4-5 coats.&lt;br /&gt;Vampy/Girly: Rose with pink shift? I think? Needs 2-3 coats.</li>
            <li> I love the polish. I have over 200 colors now. However I ordered these specific labeled colors and got 3 of the same and 2 of the same. So all in all I got 3 diff colors instead of 6.</li>
