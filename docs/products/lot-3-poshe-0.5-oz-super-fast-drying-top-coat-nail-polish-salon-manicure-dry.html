            <li>A great product, highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I really love it.  </li>
            <li>This top coat dries my polish incredibly quickly, and I always use three coats of color.  </li>
            <li>My favorite fast drying top coat.</li>
            <li>I have tried many, many different top coats.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many top coats in my lifetime and this is the only one I have purchased more than once.</li>
            <li>The pros, very quick drying and does last longer than most quick drying top coats.</li>
            <li>Wow, this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>I plan on buying these as gifts and cannot say enough good things about them.</li>
            <li>A top coat that is free of the major chemicals that cause drying and just as good as the more expensive top coats that are also free of the drying chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Super fast drying time!</li>
            <li>The cons because it is quick drying my nails do chip sooner than if I use a regular formula top coat</li>
            <li>Super shiny and evens out streaky polish and smudges very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Dries super fast and shiny.</li>
            <li>It is very shiny and super fast drying!</li>
            <li>This dries so fast, and leaves your nails looking like glass!</li>
            <li>Shine is awesome and lasts at least a week to ten days.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so effective at drying all the polish layers down to the nail that it forms a bond</li>
            <li>My nail polish started peeling (like the whole nail) after two days.</li>
            <li>It gets goopy, towards the very end, but it doesn&#x27;t change how it works.</li>
            <li>It takes about a minute to dry (great for busy people on the run) and come to completely dry after 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>The only top coats that last really long are the gel top coats.  </li>
            <li>The coats dry so fast!</li>
            <li>My nails are pretty much dry after a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>It last about the same as the more expensive top coats and the shiny finish is the same.  </li>
            <li>It dry so fast, while leaving my nails looking glossy.  </li>
            <li>my manicurist want to know where I got this, it dries very hard, quick... and very shiny...</li>
            <li>and I can be active much sooner without having to worry about destroying 2 hours worth of work.</li>

            <li> Dries several layers of polish to the touch in about a minute, and depending on the type and number of layers it&#x27;s completely dry in about 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> For a long time I&#x27;ve been doing nail art, and a Reddit community introduced me to Poshe.</li>
            <li> This takes maybe a minute longer to dry than Seche, but it doesn&#x27;t shrink the polish.</li>
            <li> It creates a layer appearing to be a thick gel that makes any at home manicure look professional.</li>
            <li> Also, the formula is a little thick and goopy after you open it and use it for awhile.</li>
            <li> Everything else is just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It has been a life saver because, like Seche Vite, it dries within a few minutes</li>
            <li> but because sitting still is a problem for me I used to always mess up my manicure anyways!</li>
            <li> word of caution, don&#x27;t use this with peel-off base coat (like you&#x27;d use under glitter)  </li>

            <li> My nail polish started peeling (like the whole nail) after two days. If you want something that last two days, this is for you!</li>
            <li> My all time fav. Never found a better top coat!!!! Shine is awesome and lasts at least a week to ten days.</li>
            <li> Wow, this product is amazing. It dry so fast, while leaving my nails looking glossy.  I will definitely buy this polish again.</li>
            <li> This dries so fast, and leaves your nails looking like glass!</li>
            <li> Poshe is my go to. I have tried many, many different top coats. Including the big names and indies.. This takes maybe a minute longer to dry than Seche, but it doesn&#x27;t shrink the polish. It gets goopy, towards the very end, but it doesn&#x27;t change how it works. It still looks just as good. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever switch top coats again. Everything else is just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> favorite top coat in the salon</li>
            <li> My favorite fast drying top coat. I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time. It drys polish very quickly with a nice shine.</li>
            <li> This top coat dries my polish incredibly quickly, and I always use three coats of color.  Everyone always asks if I have a Shellac manicure, but it&#x27;s just Poshe!</li>
            <li> This nail polish is very good im very happy  this is the best and very good  i like very much</li>
            <li> My favorite top coat!  Dries several layers of polish to the touch in about a minute, and depending on the type and number of layers it&#x27;s completely dry in about 30 minutes.  Super shiny and evens out streaky polish and smudges very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word of caution, don&#x27;t use this with peel-off base coat (like you&#x27;d use under glitter)  It&#x27;s so effective at drying all the polish layers down to the nail that it forms a bond and when you go to peel it off it takes your nail with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let that stop you from buying, though.  It works great!</li>
            <li> My favorite top coat! I used to use seche vite until I tried this. Absolutely amazing you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>

            <li> For a long time I&#x27;ve been doing nail art, and a Reddit community introduced me to Poshe. Unlike Seche Vite, which I used to use, Poshe doesn&#x27;t shrink my manicure or turn the white of my polish yellow. It has been a life saver because, like Seche Vite, it dries within a few minutes and I can be active much sooner without having to worry about destroying 2 hours worth of work.</li>
            <li> Great product- great price- fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Super fast drying time! My nails are pretty much dry after a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> Love this top coat...  It is very shiny and super fast drying!</li>

It last about the same as the more expensive top coats and the shiny finish is the same.  I really love it.  The only top coats that last really long are the gel top coats.  Otherwise this one is very good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best polish I have found for real nails.</li>
