            <li>feels great, works with and without a cleanser (i use just water in the morning and different kinds of cleansers in the evenings).&lt;br /&gt;dries</li>
            <li>Dries out nicely so doesn&#x27;t hold bacteria as much as a washcloth, etc.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your face smooth and oil free</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple but a great product.</li>
            <li>Only been using it for a week, but it seems to be working great.</li>
            <li>and I really enjoy using the product.</li>
            <li>and I love it so much!  </li>
            <li>This sponge is very soft and gentle but somehow it is also very effective at cleansing and exfoliating.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only just started using it, but it is gentle on my skin which is feeling very good.</li>
            <li>I love this sponge, it is incredibly soft and leaves my skin feeling very clean and supple.</li>
            <li>If I have some flaking on my face the sponge removes the loose skin very effectively.</li>
            <li>If I have some flaking on my face the sponge removes the loose skin very effectively.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true life span is a week.</li>
            <li>More reasonable though.</li>
            <li>Has been clearing my breakouts and giving my skin a nice soft feel for two weeks now.</li>
            <li>and I love this product so much</li>
            <li>but they tear quickly.</li>
            <li>Its great for gentle physical exfoliation.</li>
            <li>I received it quickly</li>
            <li>It gives a really smooth and soft feeling so that I can be sure my moisturizer and primer stay on all day.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought it was fantastic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled most of my adult life with acne, so I&#x27;m also always so pleasantly surprised when something is effective for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it, It leaves my face feeling clean and soft</li>
            <li>It is the best face sponge I have ever used for sensitive skin: it is so soft  and gentle to the skin and really cleans.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite new beauty products to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and leaves my face very smooth and fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>This little sponge is great.</li>
            <li>It has a nice texture and feels good on the face, especially if you use cold water -- very refreshing!</li>
            <li>Makes my skin soft, clear, and bright.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel lovely and soft.</li>
            <li>Have been using this for a few weeks and so far it&#x27;s doing the job perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I do love the texture and how soft it makes my face feel</li>
            <li>But if you have sensitive skin, then it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Its fun.</li>
            <li>Love this sponge so far...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a fun squishy wash cloth.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to everyone all you need to do is chose the right one for you</li>
            <li>At first it was working great, but after a few weeks it started to irritate her skin.</li>
            <li>Really leaves my skin feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good facial sponge just make sure and squeeze it dry</li>
            <li>A great exfoliater without being too rough on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Very soft on the face, but strong enough to wash my face clean and smooth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty awesome, and I will be ordering a few for back up one of these days.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I use it every day, and my skin feels soft and smooth after every application.</li>
            <li>Also getting another one ;)</li>
            <li>;-))</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my mom, who has pretty oily skin.</li>
            <li>My face is like buttah, so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Item exactly as described.</li>
            <li>By comparison to a cellulose sponge my Konjac sponge has smaller holes and feels softer and more resilient.</li>
            <li>â™¦ Original Pure Konjac Sponge works on all skin types including very sensitive.</li>
            <li>They are soft and gentle once filled with water.  </li>
            <li>My face is a clean slate to apply makeup on and feels so soft.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s exfoliating, but gentle enough to use on your face more than once a week.</li>
            <li>Wonderful for home and travel, especially when you can only take a limited amount of liquids on an airplane.  </li>
            <li>but now I have nicer skin and don&#x27;t feel the need to wear anything on my skin other than moisturizer, such a great feeling.</li>
            <li>but really makes my skin feel clean and soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve kept it hanging off the faucet to let it dry between uses (without wringing it), so I&#x27;m not quite sure why the mold formed.</li>
            <li>It squeezes out nicely as well, and I use a lot less cleanser with it than without.</li>
            <li>My skin is super sensitive .</li>
            <li>I love the feature of the string to hang the sponge up to dry when not in use.</li>
            <li>I wish I had an easier way to dry it out more often, maybe a hairdryer would work?</li>
            <li>I have combination skin, more on the dry side</li>
            <li>I liked it for the first week or so, but when it dried out it was nothing but a sponge.</li>
            <li>this is a very good product the two main ingredients that i  like are its natural and simple i just wet it and wipe my face.  </li>
            <li>My new konjac go to!!</li>
            <li>It is good for late nights when I&#x27;m too tired to wash my face because it is easy to use, quick, removes makeup better than makeup wipes.</li>
            <li>The green clay is great for getting rid of these blackheads and red spots.</li>
            <li>It softens up very well</li>
            <li>and since I&#x27;m not big on physical exfoliating too much this is a nice gentle way to do that.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>and really doesn&#x27;t do what it says.</li>
            <li>fast delivery-excellent company-will buy again.</li>
            <li>This does not scratch or irritate but gently exfoliates and cleanses.  </li>
            <li>Really didn&#x27;t do much for me;  </li>
            <li>When you take it out of the packaging, it is moist and ready to use.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I use this at night to get my face really cleaned &amp; have already noticed a difference in my pores.  </li>
            <li>From what I read about the product in Sephora related articles and the description, I thought I would feel a fantastic &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;, but in fact, I have no idea if it&#x27;s even cleaning my face????  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>We may try another kind in a few months.</li>
            <li>â™¦ French Pink Clay Konjac sponge is good for dehydrated skin.</li>
            <li>Since adding this sponge to my beauty routine, I have far fewer breakouts, my pores seem almost invisible, and the skin tone is much more even especially around my nose and chin.</li>
            <li>any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponges are very soft, so they do very gentle exfoliation.</li>
            <li>any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponges are very soft, so they do very gentle exfoliation.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve seen actual results pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product, I will continue to purchase it, my skin has been so soft and less oily and the color of my skin looks less blotchy.  </li>
            <li>I am older and I needed something that was gentle.</li>
            <li>I feel nothing, it doesn&#x27;t feel like anything, I don&#x27;t notice anything different, but my face does not feel clean after I use the sponge.  </li>
            <li>It is very gentle and soft.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle and soft.</li>
            <li>I am able to use less product as this sponge gets it really foamy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s surprisingly gentle, so it&#x27;s kind of hard to believe that it does anything, let alone so much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I do use the sponge with a very mild cleanser (cetaphil) having tried it with and without cleanser , I personally found it less drying when used with that very mild cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using for a week with my normal gentle cleanser</li>
            <li>Easy instructions.&lt;br /&gt;You basically get it wet</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this but ever since I started using it a few weeks ago I&#x27;ve been having break outs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft but still exfoliates without being too harsh, and it feels really nice on my face.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes that this sponge would provide an exfoliating effect.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t wait to receive my shipment since a friend had recommended the sponge so highly.</li>
            <li>I love this little guy.</li>
            <li>Soft and gentle.</li>
            <li>I have only used this a few times, but so far so good</li>
            <li>This is pretty much the only thing I use to wash my face.</li>
            <li>It also rinses quickly and completely, no residue.  </li>
            <li>I read an article on Refinery29.com about this &amp;#34;amazing new product&amp;#34; and so I wanted to try it.</li>
            <li>Soft, gentle and leaves your face so soft.</li>
            <li>I love this little thing!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the sonic brush for years and so far this sponge is doing fine as an every other day tool.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other konjac sponges previously, and I loved them but the pear shape of this one is far superior to the round shape of the other brands.</li>
            <li>not sure why the magic rubbed off.</li>
            <li>Turns out I really like using it before it is totally soaked and soft, it gives me just a little more abrasiveness and becomes softer as I use</li>
            <li>Turns out I really like using it before it is totally soaked and soft, it gives me just a little more abrasiveness and becomes softer as I use it.</li>
            <li>I do have acne prone skin and have found that this product is a little drying if used every day, so I switched to using the green clay sponge every other than and that worked perfectly for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this sponge for a month now and was really happy with the results until I found a gash down the middle littered with black mold.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive combination skin with adult acne.</li>
            <li>I hang it in my shower and use it every time I shower with a little cleanser, my skin feels fantastic.</li>
            <li>If I workout in the early morning I use it with a bit of my cleanser, but if I dont workout till later in the day I just use water and gently scrub away.</li>
            <li>The water runs clear as you can see in my video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It dries overnight and is ready for the next day.  </li>
            <li>I have a somewhat sensitive combination skin, break-up prone.</li>
            <li>well without dripping, if water is squeezed out completely.</li>
            <li>These sponges are natural, affordable, time-saving and give you results.</li>
            <li>Skin is so soft too.</li>
            <li>sensitive face</li>
            <li>&gt;â™¦ Volcanic Scoria Kojac sponge is recommended for mature skin as volcanic scoria</li>
            <li>If you do not have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Young Skin, Old Skin - there is a My Konjac Sponge for everyone.  </li>
            <li>(thought this would take longer to absorb and I would be irritated, and I am pleasantly surprised_</li>
            <li>This sponge feels so soft and smooth on my skin, it exfoliates without being too harsh, and it helps my oily skin without drying it out too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I  love this green clay Konjac facial sponge.</li>
            <li>I had rather prominent melasma spots on my cheeks from pregnancy that lingered for a few years, and using this almost daily has reduced (but not eliminated) them.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical (how does a sponge change your skin), but heard good things about konjac and gave it a whirl.</li>
            <li>so I can allow the first one to completely dry between uses and alternating to avoid mold and bacteria building up in the sponge.</li>
            <li>The texture of the sponge is slimy and it breaks down quickly.</li>
            <li>Makes your face feel clean and tight!</li>
            <li>I immediately noticed that my skin wasn&#x27;t as dry and was much smoother.</li>
            <li>My pores are clear after using twice daily for a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also almost impossible to overuse it - even though it is that gentle it really is effective.</li>
            <li>When used every other day, I&#x27;ve found it to really be helpful for my skin.  </li>
            <li>When I decided to purchase this sponge, I was not sure what I was getting, only that it appeared to be something special.  </li>
            <li>this is a huge plus for me because my nose is prone to blackheads and my chin always seems to have at least 1 or 2 acne or red spots popping up.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend letting it dry between uses by hanging it outside the shower.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying this product and have been using it for the past two and a half weeks.  </li>
            <li>After a review of these sponges in general - but a different one, I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;Came</li>
            <li>Minor breakouts go away far quicker using this</li>
            <li>Because the sponge is soft it has a fairly limited life span.</li>
            <li>This is my second Konjac sponge and my first French Green Clay</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed how much water this little sponge can hold.</li>

            <li> It leaves your face smooth and oil free</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple but a great product.</li>
            <li> Only been using it for a week, but it seems to be working great.</li>
            <li> and I really enjoy using the product.</li>
            <li> and I love it so much!  </li>

            <li> I love this sponge, it is incredibly soft and leaves my skin feeling very clean and supple.</li>

            <li> If I have some flaking on my face the sponge removes the loose skin very effectively.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true life span is a week.</li>
            <li> More reasonable though.</li>
            <li> Has been clearing my breakouts and giving my skin a nice soft feel for two weeks now.</li>
            <li> and I love this product so much</li>
            <li> but they tear quickly.</li>
            <li> Its great for gentle physical exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I received it quickly</li>
            <li> It gives a really smooth and soft feeling so that I can be sure my moisturizer and primer stay on all day.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought it was fantastic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled most of my adult life with acne, so I&#x27;m also always so pleasantly surprised when something is effective for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it, It leaves my face feeling clean and soft</li>
            <li> It is the best face sponge I have ever used for sensitive skin: it is so soft  and gentle to the skin and really cleans.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite new beauty products to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and leaves my face very smooth and fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> This little sponge is great.</li>
            <li> It has a nice texture and feels good on the face, especially if you use cold water -- very refreshing!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin soft, clear, and bright.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel lovely and soft.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for a few weeks and so far it&#x27;s doing the job perfectly.  </li>
            <li> I do love the texture and how soft it makes my face feel</li>
            <li> But if you have sensitive skin, then it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Its fun.</li>
            <li> Love this sponge so far...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a fun squishy wash cloth.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to everyone all you need to do is chose the right one for you</li>
            <li> At first it was working great, but after a few weeks it started to irritate her skin.</li>
            <li> Really leaves my skin feeling clean.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good facial sponge just make sure and squeeze it dry</li>
            <li> A great exfoliater without being too rough on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Very soft on the face, but strong enough to wash my face clean and smooth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty awesome, and I will be ordering a few for back up one of these days.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I use it every day, and my skin feels soft and smooth after every application.</li>
            <li> Also getting another one ;)</li>
            <li> ;-))</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my mom, who has pretty oily skin.</li>
            <li> My face is like buttah, so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Item exactly as described.</li>
            <li> By comparison to a cellulose sponge my Konjac sponge has smaller holes and feels softer and more resilient.</li>
            <li> â™¦ Original Pure Konjac Sponge works on all skin types including very sensitive.</li>
            <li> They are soft and gentle once filled with water.  </li>
            <li> My face is a clean slate to apply makeup on and feels so soft.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s exfoliating, but gentle enough to use on your face more than once a week.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for home and travel, especially when you can only take a limited amount of liquids on an airplane.  </li>
            <li> but now I have nicer skin and don&#x27;t feel the need to wear anything on my skin other than moisturizer, such a great feeling.</li>
            <li> but really makes my skin feel clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve kept it hanging off the faucet to let it dry between uses (without wringing it), so I&#x27;m not quite sure why the mold formed.</li>
            <li> It squeezes out nicely as well, and I use a lot less cleanser with it than without.</li>
            <li> My skin is super sensitive .</li>
            <li> I love the feature of the string to hang the sponge up to dry when not in use.</li>
            <li> I wish I had an easier way to dry it out more often, maybe a hairdryer would work?</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, more on the dry side</li>
            <li> I liked it for the first week or so, but when it dried out it was nothing but a sponge.</li>
            <li> this is a very good product the two main ingredients that i  like are its natural and simple i just wet it and wipe my face.  </li>
            <li> My new konjac go to!!</li>
            <li> It is good for late nights when I&#x27;m too tired to wash my face because it is easy to use, quick, removes makeup better than makeup wipes.</li>
            <li> The green clay is great for getting rid of these blackheads and red spots.</li>
            <li> It softens up very well</li>
            <li> and since I&#x27;m not big on physical exfoliating too much this is a nice gentle way to do that.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> and really doesn&#x27;t do what it says.</li>
            <li> fast delivery-excellent company-will buy again.</li>
            <li> This does not scratch or irritate but gently exfoliates and cleanses.  </li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t do much for me;  </li>
            <li> When you take it out of the packaging, it is moist and ready to use.  </li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I use this at night to get my face really cleaned &amp; have already noticed a difference in my pores.  </li>
            <li> From what I read about the product in Sephora related articles and the description, I thought I would feel a fantastic &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;, but in fact, I have no idea if it&#x27;s even cleaning my face????  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> We may try another kind in a few months.</li>
            <li> â™¦ French Pink Clay Konjac sponge is good for dehydrated skin.</li>
            <li> Since adding this sponge to my beauty routine, I have far fewer breakouts, my pores seem almost invisible, and the skin tone is much more even especially around my nose and chin.</li>
            <li> any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponges are very soft, so they do very gentle exfoliation.</li>
            <li> any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponges are very soft, so they do very gentle exfoliation.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve seen actual results pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, I will continue to purchase it, my skin has been so soft and less oily and the color of my skin looks less blotchy.  </li>
            <li> I am older and I needed something that was gentle.</li>
            <li> I feel nothing, it doesn&#x27;t feel like anything, I don&#x27;t notice anything different, but my face does not feel clean after I use the sponge.  </li>
            <li> It is very gentle and soft.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle and soft.</li>
            <li> I am able to use less product as this sponge gets it really foamy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s surprisingly gentle, so it&#x27;s kind of hard to believe that it does anything, let alone so much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I do use the sponge with a very mild cleanser (cetaphil) having tried it with and without cleanser , I personally found it less drying when used with that very mild cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a week with my normal gentle cleanser</li>
            <li> Easy instructions.&lt;br /&gt;You basically get it wet</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this but ever since I started using it a few weeks ago I&#x27;ve been having break outs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft but still exfoliates without being too harsh, and it feels really nice on my face.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes that this sponge would provide an exfoliating effect.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to receive my shipment since a friend had recommended the sponge so highly.</li>
            <li> I love this little guy.</li>
            <li> Soft and gentle.</li>
            <li> I have only used this a few times, but so far so good</li>
            <li> This is pretty much the only thing I use to wash my face.</li>
            <li> It also rinses quickly and completely, no residue.  </li>
            <li> I read an article on Refinery29.com about this &amp;#34;amazing new product&amp;#34; and so I wanted to try it.</li>
            <li> Soft, gentle and leaves your face so soft.</li>
            <li> I love this little thing!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the sonic brush for years and so far this sponge is doing fine as an every other day tool.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other konjac sponges previously, and I loved them but the pear shape of this one is far superior to the round shape of the other brands.</li>
            <li> not sure why the magic rubbed off.</li>
            <li> Turns out I really like using it before it is totally soaked and soft, it gives me just a little more abrasiveness and becomes softer as I use</li>
            <li> Turns out I really like using it before it is totally soaked and soft, it gives me just a little more abrasiveness and becomes softer as I use it.</li>
            <li> I do have acne prone skin and have found that this product is a little drying if used every day, so I switched to using the green clay sponge every other than and that worked perfectly for my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this sponge for a month now and was really happy with the results until I found a gash down the middle littered with black mold.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive combination skin with adult acne.</li>
            <li> I hang it in my shower and use it every time I shower with a little cleanser, my skin feels fantastic.</li>
            <li> If I workout in the early morning I use it with a bit of my cleanser, but if I dont workout till later in the day I just use water and gently scrub away.</li>
            <li> The water runs clear as you can see in my video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It dries overnight and is ready for the next day.  </li>
            <li> I have a somewhat sensitive combination skin, break-up prone.</li>
            <li> well without dripping, if water is squeezed out completely.</li>
            <li> These sponges are natural, affordable, time-saving and give you results.</li>
            <li> Skin is so soft too.</li>
            <li> sensitive face</li>
            <li> &gt;â™¦ Volcanic Scoria Kojac sponge is recommended for mature skin as volcanic scoria</li>
            <li> If you do not have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Young Skin, Old Skin - there is a My Konjac Sponge for everyone.  </li>
            <li> (thought this would take longer to absorb and I would be irritated, and I am pleasantly surprised_</li>
            <li> This sponge feels so soft and smooth on my skin, it exfoliates without being too harsh, and it helps my oily skin without drying it out too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I  love this green clay Konjac facial sponge.</li>
            <li> I had rather prominent melasma spots on my cheeks from pregnancy that lingered for a few years, and using this almost daily has reduced (but not eliminated) them.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical (how does a sponge change your skin), but heard good things about konjac and gave it a whirl.</li>
            <li> so I can allow the first one to completely dry between uses and alternating to avoid mold and bacteria building up in the sponge.</li>
            <li> The texture of the sponge is slimy and it breaks down quickly.</li>
            <li> Makes your face feel clean and tight!</li>
            <li> I immediately noticed that my skin wasn&#x27;t as dry and was much smoother.</li>
            <li> My pores are clear after using twice daily for a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also almost impossible to overuse it - even though it is that gentle it really is effective.</li>
            <li> When used every other day, I&#x27;ve found it to really be helpful for my skin.  </li>
            <li> When I decided to purchase this sponge, I was not sure what I was getting, only that it appeared to be something special.  </li>
            <li> this is a huge plus for me because my nose is prone to blackheads and my chin always seems to have at least 1 or 2 acne or red spots popping up.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend letting it dry between uses by hanging it outside the shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying this product and have been using it for the past two and a half weeks.  </li>
            <li> After a review of these sponges in general - but a different one, I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;Came</li>
            <li> Minor breakouts go away far quicker using this</li>
            <li> Because the sponge is soft it has a fairly limited life span.</li>
            <li> This is my second Konjac sponge and my first French Green Clay</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed how much water this little sponge can hold.</li>
            <li> I use the turmeric version in the morning with just a scooch of cleanser &amp; this at night with about half the cleanser I normally used before this product.  </li>
            <li> Alternate since they take a couple of days to dry.</li>
            <li> I was going to buy this at Sephora, but saw it on Amazon for far less.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mildly exfoliating without being being irritating.  </li>
            <li> It does leave my skin soft and not feeling too tight but it does not exfoliate as well as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> Out of curious I left one sponge to dry without using it for several days and it took 3 days to totally dry.</li>
            <li> I like that it is a natural fiber sponge, as opposed to the cellulose round dish sponge-like thing I had been using.</li>
            <li> It takes quite a long time to dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got 6 different sponges to compare them to each other as it was not clear if they would feel significantly different from each other.</li>
            <li> I have used several other kinds of sponges before.</li>
            <li> I they feel quite similar to each other in terms of softness and resilience.</li>
            <li> The charcoal is fleeting and is not in contact with the skin very long at all.</li>
            <li> Rinse after using and hang to dry.  </li>
            <li> I wanted something that would take away the oil but not leave my skin dry and would exfoliate to get rid of the dry flakiness.</li>
            <li> Some take forever to soften up, others take forever to dry.</li>
            <li> I wash with this sponge morning and again at night and just hang it to dry.  </li>
            <li> Each sponge has a string loop that allows you to hang it to dry, which helps to dry it on all sides.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> The green clay seemed to last only two or three uses, however, so in the future I may just purchase the plain white sponge.</li>
            <li> This did nothing to help my skin, in fact, I broke out every single day I used it.</li>
            <li> I also ordered a black charcoal one and a white Boscia one</li>
            <li> I think next time I will buy the black one.</li>
            <li> I use it every night with the and andalou naturals citrus kombucha cleansing gel and no more major breakouts!</li>
            <li> I use a little bit of liquid facial soap with Tea Tree Oil with this sponge.</li>
            <li> Other exfoliating cleansing solutions would irritate and dry my skin</li>
            <li> I have used it only for 2 days ( i will update this after a few weeks if problems develop)  and my face already feels softer and my acne is clearing up.  </li>
            <li> Men - be careful, will not work with a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
            <li> &gt;â™¦ French Green Clay Konjac sponge is recommended for Oily skin because it absorbs dirt and oil.</li>
            <li> If you like the feeling of something rough on your skin this sponge is not going to give you that feeling.</li>
            <li> If you like the feeling of something rough on your skin this sponge is not going to give you that feeling.</li>
            <li> it take only a few seconds)&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> Konjac sponge feels very soft when wet and very hard when totally dry.</li>
            <li> I use less cleanser - so will save money in the long run.  </li>
            <li> my face doesn&#x27;t feel too dry or tight after using it w/o cleanser.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I had to toss it and am pretty bummed about that.</li>
            <li> I cannot wait to try the other type of Konjac Sponges.  </li>
            <li> I will have to try the other sponges by Konjac.  </li>
            <li> I plan on buying it again, but I think for the winter , I may switch to one of the other colors.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it too abrasive as other reviewers have mentioned.</li>
            <li> Not worth it all at</li>
            <li> I mentioned in my review that the sponge becomes stiff when it tries.</li>

            <li> The dry areas of skin on my forehead and cheeks have disappeared and the oil beside my nose seems less after just a few days of using the green clay sponge.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this along with the black one</li>
            <li> now have been using this sponge for slightly over a month.  </li>

            <li> At the beginning it seemed that i started to have little bumps, but I think it was the exfoliation bringing out all the hidden toxins and residues under my skin.</li>
            <li> Using the green one now , also bought the black one which i will use after i toss this away .</li>
            <li> Much less harsh as an exfoliator than loofah pads.  </li>
            <li> I like this little sponge.  </li>
            <li> Yesterday I used a little bit of cleanser just to see how it feels.  </li>
            <li> This little sponge is a miracle.</li>
            <li> I have to say that other than color I am not able to tell the difference between the sponges by either how they feel or by the effects on my skin.&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used this every morning for about 2 weeks now. If I workout in the early morning I use it with a bit of my cleanser, but if I dont workout till later in the day I just use water and gently scrub away. Though it&#x27;s really hard to scrub rough at all with this sponge. It softens up very well and since I&#x27;m not big on physical exfoliating too much this is a nice gentle way to do that. I&#x27;m not sure if I notice anything with the green clay in the sponge doing anything but just incase, it&#x27;s in there! My skin does look and feel smoother after using this and that&#x27;s what I wanted out of this sponge so I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this little thing!  I have used it only for 2 days ( i will update this after a few weeks if problems develop)  and my face already feels softer and my acne is clearing up.  I have combo skin and this was a perfect pick for me.  my face doesn&#x27;t feel too dry or tight after using it w/o cleanser.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I use this by itself in the mornings and it works wonders. My face is a clean slate to apply makeup on and feels so soft. Great working and looking sponge.</li>
            <li> I like this little sponge.  I have rosacea and oily, breakout prone skin and this seems to work nicely.  I&#x27;ve been using the sonic brush for years and so far this sponge is doing fine as an every other day tool.  Just a drop of cleanser is all you need, no scratching or grittiness.  Does not leave my face any redder than it already is.  It also rinses quickly and completely, no residue.  It dries overnight and is ready for the next day.  I like it.</li>
            <li> I love this thing. I use it every night with the and andalou naturals citrus kombucha cleansing gel and no more major breakouts! It&#x27;s soft and leaves my face very smooth and fresh feeling. BUY IT</li>
            <li> The dry areas of skin on my forehead and cheeks have disappeared and the oil beside my nose seems less after just a few days of using the green clay sponge.  I&#x27;ve already told friends and will be ordering again. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I like my sponge! Thanks.</li>
            <li> Love it! It feels great my skin!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brand of konjac sponge! I have tried three different colors of My Konjac Sponge, and have been very pleased with all of them!</li>
            <li> Like them but they tear quickly.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel lovely and soft. A great exfoliater without being too rough on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Interesting product, liked it a lot!</li>
            <li> This facial sponge solved my skin problems. I have a somewhat sensitive combination skin, break-up prone. Other exfoliating cleansing solutions would irritate and dry my skin and my skin would break up after exfoliating. This sponge is very soft and gentle but somehow it is also very effective at cleansing and exfoliating. I use it every day, and my skin feels soft and smooth after every application. I use a little bit of liquid facial soap with Tea Tree Oil with this sponge. I buy it all the time, since I discovered this sponge. It is my routine now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this sponge for a month now and was really happy with the results until I found a gash down the middle littered with black mold. I&#x27;ve kept it hanging off the faucet to let it dry between uses (without wringing it), so I&#x27;m not quite sure why the mold formed. Needless to say I had to toss it and am pretty bummed about that.</li>
            <li> I have two of these and like them. Alternate since they take a couple of days to dry.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought it was fantastic. It&#x27;s true life span is a week. Not worth it all at and really doesn&#x27;t do what it says. Got suckered because I saw it advertised on AOL with rave reviews. Rave reviews..I do not give it. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> Service was exceptional. I love the sponge. I&#x27;ve only just started using it, but it is gentle on my skin which is feeling very good.</li>
            <li> exactly as described!!!</li>
            <li> fast delivery-excellent company-will buy again.</li>
            <li> feels great, works with and without a cleanser (i use just water in the morning and different kinds of cleansers in the evenings).&lt;br /&gt;dries well without dripping, if water is squeezed out completely. i hope to have it in use for many months!</li>
            <li> This feels great on your face. It is especially good to use in the morning to wake up, or before shaving to make your razor glide over your face.</li>
            <li> Good product and price. Makes your face feel clean and tight!</li>
            <li> My new konjac go to!! Nice and gentle, but very effective.</li>
            <li> At the beginning it seemed that i started to have little bumps, but I think it was the exfoliation bringing out all the hidden toxins and residues under my skin. Also getting another one ;)</li>
            <li> I threw out my &#x27;baby washcloths&#x27; to use this facial sponge.  This does not scratch or irritate but gently exfoliates and cleanses.  I use less cleanser - so will save money in the long run.  Rinse after using and hang to dry.  It is that wonderfully simple.  I cannot wait to try the other type of Konjac Sponges.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t do much for me;  Used for several weeks and didn&#x27;t seem to make a different.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that no products have worked for (Clarisonic, expensive washes and creams, etc.)  Have been using this for a few weeks and so far it&#x27;s doing the job perfectly.  My face is mostly blemish-free and it takes 30 seconds in the shower each morning.  Dries out nicely so doesn&#x27;t hold bacteria as much as a washcloth, etc.  Great product.  I don&#x27;t use any face wash with it.</li>
            <li> When I decided to purchase this sponge, I was not sure what I was getting, only that it appeared to be something special.  I received the product and used it immediately.  I loved it...When you take it out of the packaging, it is moist and ready to use.  I didn&#x27;t use cleanser the first time, and it felt great.  Yesterday I used a little bit of cleanser just to see how it feels.  The texture of the sponge feels great on the skin.  I will have to try the other sponges by Konjac.  I recommend this product!!! ;-))</li>
            <li> My face looks best with the charcoal Konjac, so just find the konjac that works best for you. The exfoliating properties are uncomparable!</li>
            <li> Good sponge, gets face very clean.</li>
            <li> Love washing my face!</li>
            <li> I use this between Clarisonic uses... I have combination acne-prone skin. I wanted something that would take away the oil but not leave my skin dry and would exfoliate to get rid of the dry flakiness. It does leave my skin soft and not feeling too tight but it does not exfoliate as well as I thought it would. It is good for late nights when I&#x27;m too tired to wash my face because it is easy to use, quick, removes makeup better than makeup wipes. However it is not a replacement for an exfoliator. I would recommend though.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this but ever since I started using it a few weeks ago I&#x27;ve been having break outs. I&#x27;m still using it because I don&#x27;t want to believe the break outs are from the sponge but nothing else had changed. It&#x27;s cruelty free and vegan which is most important to me. I do love the texture and how soft it makes my face feel but I&#x27;m 34 and do not want acne.</li>
            <li> I got this for my roommate who has combination skin.  Her skin&#x27;s clearing up and she says it just FEELS healthier and more clean.</li>
            <li> This little sponge is great. I hang it in my shower and use it every time I shower with a little cleanser, my skin feels fantastic. I have used several other kinds of sponges before. Some take forever to soften up, others take forever to dry. This is the happy medium. I was going to buy this at Sephora, but saw it on Amazon for far less.</li>
            <li> This sponge is very gentle, but does a good job of exfoliating.  My pores are clear after using twice daily for a couple of weeks.  The green clay seemed to last only two or three uses, however, so in the future I may just purchase the plain white sponge.</li>
            <li> I bought the My Konjac Sponge for the second time recently. I like that it is a natural fiber sponge, as opposed to the cellulose round dish sponge-like thing I had been using. Gentle to use and does a good job cleansing my skin. Hangs easily in the shower for convenience. I also appreciate the personal communications from the company&#x27;s owner and their commitment to their product.</li>
            <li> Better than my clarisonic mia. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and I&#x27;ve seen actual results pretty quickly. I also ordered a black charcoal one and a white Boscia one and this seems to be the second best after Boscia. More reasonable though. Makes my skin soft, clear, and bright. Love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as exfoliating as I was hoping for. But if you have sensitive skin, then it&#x27;s ok. It is very nice to have something that I can scrub my face with and rinse out without having to wash it like a rag.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, I will continue to purchase it, my skin has been so soft and less oily and the color of my skin looks less blotchy.  GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I purchased this along with the black one and I regret it.This did nothing to help my skin, in fact, I broke out every single day I used it. I was so frustrated I didn&#x27;t understand what was going on and realized using this product was the only thing I did differently. Once I stopped using it, I stopped breaking out. This thing is awful.</li>
            <li> This sponge feels so soft and smooth on my skin, it exfoliates without being too harsh, and it helps my oily skin without drying it out too.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy this again. Great Product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed how much water this little sponge can hold. My face has been cleaner with almost no breakouts since I started using it. It squeezes out nicely as well, and I use a lot less cleanser with it than without. It&#x27;s pretty awesome, and I will be ordering a few for back up one of these days.</li>
            <li> My wife just loves it thank you</li>
            <li> Did not like it, I was allergic to whatever was in it</li>
            <li> Will never use anything else!&lt;br /&gt;It is slowly clearing my skin. I have clear skin except for by my temples (where my phone sits), and this is working awesome to clear it.&lt;br /&gt;Buy! You will not regret it!</li>
            <li> My skin is super sensitive . I always get zits no matter what skincare or makeup i used (except a selected few) .My skin has never felt so good before. No more breakouts no more dead skin and no more dull skin. This will be my holy grail face cleansing product! Thank you guys for inventing this stuff ^_^ i will buy it again and again. Using the green one now , also bought the black one which i will use after i toss this away .</li>
            <li> Soft and gentle. Men - be careful, will not work with a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
            <li> I like this sponge.  It&#x27;s soft but still exfoliates without being too harsh, and it feels really nice on my face.  I can&#x27;t tell if the green clay is doing anything, but I like this sponge and I will buy another one when this one is done.  Great price, fast shipping.  Happy with this seller.</li>
            <li> Very soft on the face, but strong enough to wash my face clean and smooth</li>
            <li> Excellent gentle exfoliation!  I plan on purchasing two of the black acne sponges for my teens!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes that this sponge would provide an exfoliating effect. It didn&#x27;t seem to exfoliate at all. The texture of the sponge is slimy and it breaks down quickly. I wanted to like it, but ended up tossing it in the trash.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong but it does nothing</li>
            <li> Lasted forever. Works like a dream.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical (how does a sponge change your skin), but heard good things about konjac and gave it a whirl. I&#x27;ve been using for a week with my normal gentle cleanser and I AM CONVINCED. My skin is softer and brighter and I&#x27;m planning to buy these for every lady I know for Christmas.</li>
            <li> This is my second Konjac sponge and my first French Green Clay and I really like it.  It has cleared up my face just using it once per day with only water.  I immediately noticed that my skin wasn&#x27;t as dry and was much smoother.</li>
            <li> Using for problem acne skin. Skin feels good. Pimples may have decreased in frequency.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Really leaves my skin feeling clean.  Goes great with my cleansers. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good facial sponge just make sure and squeeze it dry or else it will get mold in a month time.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;. Its fun.</li>
            <li> Feels wonderful on the skin, good price and love it to wash face with.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot! Its great for gentle physical exfoliation. I&#x27;ve only been using it about a week or so but I think it&#x27;s helping my skin.</li>
            <li> I read an article on Refinery29.com about this &amp;#34;amazing new product&amp;#34; and so I wanted to try it. I liked it for the first week or so, but when it dried out it was nothing but a sponge. If you like the product, I would recommend buying it every 2 weeks.  Its cheaper then a Clarisonic, but over time it will cost more. Try it for yourself.</li>
            <li> These sponges are natural, affordable, time-saving and give you results. I used them as a youth in Japan and suffered no teenage acne.</li>
            <li> this is a very good product the two main ingredients that i  like are its natural and simple i just wet it and wipe my face.  It leaves your face smooth and oil free</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my mom, who has pretty oily skin. At first it was working great, but after a few weeks it started to irritate her skin. She was squeezing, not wringing as suggested and we have a water filter on our shower, so not sure why the magic rubbed off. We may try another kind in a few months.</li>
            <li> I love this little guy. Has been clearing my breakouts and giving my skin a nice soft feel for two weeks now. Skin is so soft too.</li>
            <li> Nice product. My son uses it every day.</li>
            <li> I use this sponge and love it.  I am older and I needed something that was gentle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying this product and have been using it for the past two and a half weeks.  I do have acne prone skin and have found that this product is a little drying if used every day, so I switched to using the green clay sponge every other than and that worked perfectly for my skin.  It&#x27;s mildly exfoliating without being being irritating.  When used every other day, I&#x27;ve found it to really be helpful for my skin.  I&#x27;ve struggled most of my adult life with acne, so I&#x27;m also always so pleasantly surprised when something is effective for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do use the sponge with a very mild cleanser (cetaphil) having tried it with and without cleanser , I personally found it less drying when used with that very mild cleanser.  It&#x27;s a good product.  I plan on buying it again, but I think for the winter , I may switch to one of the other colors.</li>
            <li> Works well in the shower in the mornings for washing my face. Nice exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I had been using another face sponge that was perfect for my combination sensitive face but I lost it and couldn&#x27;t remember the company so I bought this. It is the best face sponge I have ever used for sensitive skin: it is so soft  and gentle to the skin and really cleans. My only dislike is that it has reduced my pimples but I still get some (with the past one I hardly got one). I think next time I will buy the black one.</li>
            <li> Love this sponge so far...it&#x27;s exfoliating, but gentle enough to use on your face more than once a week. The clay also leaves my skin feeling moisturized.</li>
            <li> Very effective cleansing tool - thorough but not harsh &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling stripped.  I use this at night to get my face really cleaned &amp; have already noticed a difference in my pores.  I use the turmeric version in the morning with just a scooch of cleanser &amp; this at night with about half the cleanser I normally used before this product.  Is definitely a keeper &amp; pays for itself.  It&#x27;s also almost impossible to overuse it - even though it is that gentle it really is effective.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to receive my shipment since a friend had recommended the sponge so highly. I received it quickly and I love it. Very interesting texture but really makes my skin feel clean and soft. Much less harsh as an exfoliator than loofah pads.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> This little sponge is a miracle. My face is like buttah, so soft and smooth. I prefer to use it without cleanser, just water and sponge. Then again, I don&#x27;t wear makeup, so that works. If you wear makeup, using it with cleanser would be just as awesome.</li>
            <li> I love this sponge, it is incredibly soft and leaves my skin feeling very clean and supple. I&#x27;ve convinced several people I know to buy one, seriously great purchase!</li>
            <li> I have been using my Konjac Facial Sponge for only 2 weeks and I love it so much!  I usually use it without any cleanser in the morning. It gives a really smooth and soft feeling so that I can be sure my moisturizer and primer stay on all day. Good product and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Great product, great price. Item exactly as described. I have only used this a few times, but so far so good</li>
            <li> This is a great product!!  Wonderful for home and travel, especially when you can only take a limited amount of liquids on an airplane.  We can leave the cleansers at home.  I wash with this sponge morning and again at night and just hang it to dry.  Every one or two weeks I sterilize it as the package information recommends.  They last for several months, depending on individual use.  You can use with or without cleanser and get great results.  They are soft and gentle once filled with water.  My daughter and I both use these.  I have purchased them for our family and as gifts for people travelling or going into the hospital.  Delivery was on time and packaging is good.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:moBPOX1GHFICJ3]]I like using sponges to wash my face as well as my body. The sponges I use on regular basis are made from cellulose (i.e. wood pulp). Konjac sponge is made from the root of the Konjac plant (which is a potato-like plant). By comparison to a cellulose sponge my Konjac sponge has smaller holes and feels softer and more resilient. I included a photo of the Konjac sponge next to the cellulose sponge in my video, you can see the difference just by looking at them side by side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Konjac sponge feels very soft when wet and very hard when totally dry. It absorbs quite a lot of water. It suds up fairly well. It takes quite a long time to dry. Out of curious I left one sponge to dry without using it for several days and it took 3 days to totally dry. Each sponge has a string loop that allows you to hang it to dry, which helps to dry it on all sides. Because the sponge is soft it has a fairly limited life span. Based on what I read I expect to get 3 months out it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got 6 different sponges to compare them to each other as it was not clear if they would feel significantly different from each other. I they feel quite similar to each other in terms of softness and resilience. I was happy to see that none of them had a scent. The difference in color comes from what the sponges were injected with, but none of them bleed any colors. The water runs clear as you can see in my video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;â™¦ French Green Clay Konjac sponge is recommended for Oily skin because it absorbs dirt and oil. Size: 4\\&quot; x 3\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;â™¦ Original Pure Konjac Sponge works on all skin types including very sensitive. Size: 4\\&quot; x 3\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;â™¦ Volcanic Scoria Kojac sponge is recommended for mature skin as volcanic scoria supposedly is good for purifying skin. Size: 4\\&quot; x 3\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;â™¦ Red Clay Sponge improves elasticity and texture of the skin. Size: 4.5\\&quot; x 2.5\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;â™¦ French Pink Clay Konjac sponge is good for dehydrated skin. Size: 4\\&quot; x 3\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;â™¦ Bamboo Charcoal Konjac Sponge is good at gentle exfoliation. Size: 4\\&quot; x 3\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using two sponges on regular basis for about 2 weeks now. I have to say that other than color I am not able to tell the difference between the sponges by either how they feel or by the effects on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponges feel pleasant and soft. I like how my face feels after using them. If I have some flaking on my face the sponge removes the loose skin very effectively. Does it reduce the appearance of the pores? I can&#x27;t say I notice any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponges are very soft, so they do very gentle exfoliation. If you like the feeling of something rough on your skin this sponge is not going to give you that feeling. It is very gentle and soft. I think some of the marketing is just marketing (i.e. is a bit exaggerated). Don&#x27;t expect miracles this is just a nice sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These sponges are provided by Konjac.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/1/14 Update:&lt;br /&gt;I now have been using this sponge for slightly over a month.

            <li> I love this sponge. I&#x27;ve been using the product for months. My skin has been cleaner and clearer because of it and the use of washcloths is history for me! I love the feature of the string to hang the sponge up to dry when not in use. It&#x27;s simple but a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other konjac sponges previously, and I loved them but the pear shape of this one is far superior to the round shape of the other brands. It allows you to scrub your nose, sides of nose and chin better - this is a huge plus for me because my nose is prone to blackheads and my chin always seems to have at least 1 or 2 acne or red spots popping up. The green clay is great for getting rid of these blackheads and red spots. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks now and it has seriously reduced the stubborn red spots on my face. I have nice skin but now I have nicer skin and don&#x27;t feel the need to wear anything on my skin other than moisturizer, such a great feeling. Very happy with this buy and will be continuing to buy this face sponge!</li>
            <li> I read this is great for all skin types and I was extremely excited to use it!  However, within 3 days my peri-oral dermatitis (a form of Rosacea) started acting up again.  I have had my skin under control for about 2 years, but no longer...a month after using this sponge for just one week and I&#x27;m still fighting to get back to where I was before.  If you do not have sensitive skin I&#x27;m sure this product will work for you, but if you have any form of Rosacea, beware.</li>
            <li> Caused breakouts after a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> I  love this green clay Konjac facial sponge. Soft, gentle and leaves your face so soft. I even ordered one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> From what I read about the product in Sephora related articles and the description, I thought I would feel a fantastic &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;, but in fact, I have no idea if it&#x27;s even cleaning my face????  I feel nothing, it doesn&#x27;t feel like anything, I don&#x27;t notice anything different, but my face does not feel clean after I use the sponge.  Not sure what all the hype is..........</li>
            <li> This feels awesome, super easy and convenient to use at night and in the morning. Not quite as good to remove makeup as I thought it would be but still great. I wish I had an easier way to dry it out more often, maybe a hairdryer would work? Anyways great product highly recommend :)</li>
            <li> Sponger broken down quicker than expected. Perhaps it was a poor batch or I was too tough on it.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite new beauty products to use. Before I bought this I was breaking out from stress and the weather. It definitely cleared up my skin. I went a week without it since I was traveling and I broke out again after I stopped using it. I have combination skin, more on the dry side and I occasionally breakout. I decided to go with the green sponge since it was recommended for acne but it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I don&#x27;t like to use cleanser in the morning so I will use this alone. When using this at night I usually wash my make up off first to avoid getting residue on the sponge and then I&#x27;ll use it again with some cleanser (cetaphil). After washing I squeeze out all the excess water with my palms. This is pretty much the only thing I use to wash my face. To disinfect I just put it in a bowl and microwave for about a minute. Thinking about buying a second one so I can allow the first one to completely dry between uses and alternating to avoid mold and bacteria building up in the sponge.</li>
            <li> Waste of money. Doesn&#x27;t really work. You can get the same results with a wash cloth. The charcoal is fleeting and is not in contact with the skin very long at all. Ripoff for $10. Save your money</li>
            <li> I like this sponge, I use it in conjunction with a foaming cleanser. I am able to use less product as this sponge gets it really foamy. It has a nice texture and feels good on the face, especially if you use cold water -- very refreshing!</li>
            <li> Young Skin, Old Skin - there is a My Konjac Sponge for everyone.  My teenage daughter and I love this product so much, we have started buying them as gifts.</li>
            <li> Love it, It leaves my face feeling clean and soft I would recommend this to everyone all you need to do is chose the right one for you there is a description chart that helps with that.</li>
            <li> After a review of these sponges in general - but a different one, I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;Came very quickly. Nicely packaged. Easy instructions.&lt;br /&gt;You basically get it wet (thought this would take longer to absorb and I would be irritated, and I am pleasantly surprised_ it take only a few seconds)&lt;br /&gt;Then you scrub and rinse, and hang to dry.&lt;br /&gt;Leave my face feeling matte - which I have OILY skin so this is a huge plus. Minor breakouts go away far quicker using this and my skin looks a lot clearer and tighter already.</li>
            <li> the sponge does exfoliate but i think the charcoal one is better. not a terrible product just not the best for my skin- it has lasted me two months  and is still in perfect shape</li>
            <li> Love this sponge! Only been using it for a week, but it seems to be working great. I highly recommend letting it dry between uses by hanging it outside the shower.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive combination skin with adult acne. Since adding this sponge to my beauty routine, I have far fewer breakouts, my pores seem almost invisible, and the skin tone is much more even especially around my nose and chin. I had rather prominent melasma spots on my cheeks from pregnancy that lingered for a few years, and using this almost daily has reduced (but not eliminated) them. It&#x27;s surprisingly gentle, so it&#x27;s kind of hard to believe that it does anything, let alone so much. One sponge usually lasts 2 months for me before losing effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and I really enjoy using the product. I don&#x27;t find it too abrasive as other reviewers have mentioned. It&#x27;s like a fun squishy wash cloth.</li>
