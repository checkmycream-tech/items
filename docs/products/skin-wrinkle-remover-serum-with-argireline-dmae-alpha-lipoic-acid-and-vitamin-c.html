            <li>Great customer service and expedient delivery.</li>
            <li>its okay!</li>
            <li>Buy this, I was paying 5 times more and they didn&#x27;t work as well!</li>
            <li>Continue to love the product!</li>
            <li>Has kind of a funky smell though.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I haven&#x27;t noticed an odor.</li>
            <li>and I have to say I&#x27;m impressed so far.  </li>
            <li>Also I have very sensitive and very fair skin which tends to break out.</li>
            <li>The price was great and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product...</li>
            <li>and i may even try more in the line.</li>
            <li>its noticably more even tone and</li>
            <li>It is a nice serum: easily absorbed, doesn&#x27;t have an odor and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And honestly, if I could afford it, I&#x27;d be doing it right now.</li>
            <li>Noticeable laugh &amp; frown lines seem more relaxed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This works great on sagging skin on my neck and my deep furrow line on forehead.i like</li>
            <li>But as far as a topical goes... I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
            <li>I had some pretty powerful frown/worry muscles, so I&#x27;m pleased with the improvement.</li>
            <li>i like that it goes on (water like texture) and it absorbs quick.</li>
            <li>I like this serum as it penetrates quickly and is very concentrated so easy</li>
            <li>On my first full day of use I immediately felt my skin tightening.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I felt good about the other ingredients, so I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>But the price was right</li>
            <li>I have some pretty developed forehead muscles and lines, so I&#x27;m going to give it more time.</li>
            <li>and p.m. along with my many gizmos: a Nuface, derma roller, FacialFlex and lastly the LightStim and those are just the gadgets !</li>
            <li>It does very well!</li>
            <li>This means your getting the real stuff not the fluffy diluted stuff in most products that cost 10 times more.</li>
            <li>what&#x27;s listed first has the highest consideration .</li>
            <li>I  will definitely be ordering more when I run out..</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t a total freeze, but I&#x27;m definitely noticing more limited movement, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>Thanks VRLT.</li>
            <li>I really think it has help my wrinkles diminish a bit.  </li>
            <li>Alpha lipoic acid is much like vitamin c.</li>
            <li>i really like this serum</li>
            <li>Did absolutely nothing for me.  </li>
            <li>my fine lines are much more subtle ....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to smell, I promise it disappears!</li>
            <li>A very clear non sticky smooth&lt;br /&gt;substance.</li>
            <li>It does only \\&quot;reduce\\&quot; movement to a certain extent.</li>
            <li>, it makes my skin so soft, i think it is beginning to work on my wrinkles</li>
            <li>old spa owner.</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s natural with no parabens.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m nearly 3 weeks in</li>
            <li>far as the rest, it is a light-weight serum.</li>
            <li>I shopped for prices on different products with the same ingredients, and this was much much cheaper than anything out there.  </li>
            <li>I saw the other customer who complained about a very strong odor.</li>
            <li>Bought the samples to see about the product, didnt notice results, believe the price is too high, its just any other skin care product you have to take a chance</li>
            <li>I would give it at least a 4 rating or higher if it didn&#x27;t smell like I&#x27;d rolled my face in fish guts!</li>

            <li> but boy does it smell bad.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is supposed to smell so bad or not</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> On my first full day of use I immediately felt my skin tightening.&lt;br /&gt;No smell what so ever at all. A very clear non sticky smooth&lt;br /&gt;substance. Noticeable laugh &amp; frown lines seem more relaxed.&lt;br /&gt;I think with continued use this product may be the answer for&lt;br /&gt;my skin issues. Shipping was within 3 days, priced very&lt;br /&gt;affordable. Yes I will definitely order again. Thanks VRLT.</li>
            <li> It is a nice serum: easily absorbed, doesn&#x27;t have an odor and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;ve been using the serum every morning and every night and I haven&#x27;t seen any results at all. I&#x27;m going to continue using the entire bottle and see if I see any difference with my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I like this serum as it penetrates quickly and is very concentrated so easy does it and the bottle seems to last forever I use it a.m. and p.m. along with my many gizmos: a Nuface, derma roller, FacialFlex and lastly the LightStim and those are just the gadgets ! But seriously I would definitely buy this over ridiculous over hyperbolized Perricone</li>
            <li> My skin seems smoother.  I really think it has help my wrinkles diminish a bit.  Has kind of a funky smell though.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for the DMAE to help tighten my face. It does very well! It also has alpha lipoic acid and argireline which also tightens the face and the alpha lipoic acid helps to regenerate collagen in the skin. Alpha lipoic acid is much like vitamin c. This also contains vitamin c called MAP. This is the best type of vitamin c to use for the face. It penetrates deeper than other c serums. The price was great and the shipping was fast. I am pleased with this product...</li>
            <li> i really like this serum, it makes my skin so soft, i think it is beginning to work on my wrinkles</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing for me.  Will not buy again.  And it does have somewhat of a fishy smell to it.</li>
            <li> I want to purchase this, however, after reading the reviews on the odor it produces, I am not sure.  Some say it smells, others say it does not.  Does it smell bad or not?  Dr. J.  California</li>
            <li> its okay! ia m not sure as i have not used it enough to say whether or not it works. i like that it goes on (water like texture) and it absorbs quick. i will continue to use this product for another month and i may even try more in the line. i like the ingredient list</li>
            <li> Bought the samples to see about the product, didnt notice results, believe the price is too high, its just any other skin care product you have to take a chance</li>
            <li> I continue to use this serum as I may be crazy but I like the way it makes my skin feel and it has the ingredients that are recommended to help prevent wrinkles but boy does it smell bad. Like rotten fish! I don&#x27;t know if it is supposed to smell so bad or not so I am trying to do some research on that. I would give it at least a 4 rating or higher if it didn&#x27;t smell like I&#x27;d rolled my face in fish guts! I put it on with tissue up my nose! No joke!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 44 yr. old spa owner. Im a liscenced esthetician and I&#x27;ve used all of the best products on the market. This works great on sagging skin on my neck and my deep furrow line on forehead.i like that it&#x27;s natural with no parabens. It has a slight smell that disappears after 30 sec. I&#x27;m very sensitive to smell, I promise it disappears! This means your getting the real stuff not the fluffy diluted stuff in most products that cost 10 times more. I know my ingredients, what&#x27;s listed first has the highest consideration . This is the best serum I&#x27;ve found ! it&#x27;s best to use it under another dmae cream. I would reccomend derma e dmae cream if your problem is sagging. If wrinkles are your problem  derma e wrinkle cream. Buy this, I was paying 5 times more and they didn&#x27;t work as well!</li>
            <li> This serum is great! I can see and feel an improvement in my skin.. its noticably more even tone and my fine lines are much more subtle .... I  will definitely be ordering more when I run out..</li>
            <li> I used it under my eyes and it burns and left my face looking cracked and dry.  I wouldn&#x27;t chance trying it.  You only get one set of eyes and to take a chance is not worth  risk of injury.</li>
            <li> I shopped for prices on different products with the same ingredients, and this was much much cheaper than anything out there.  I am waiting for the results, as I have only used it for a while.  Great customer service and expedient delivery.</li>
            <li> My skin immediately had a brighter, fresher look to it.</li>
            <li> OK, I was totally skeptical about argireline. I didn&#x27;t expect results. But the price was right and I felt good about the other ingredients, so I decided to give it a try. First off let me say that I have tried Botox in the past. And honestly, if I could afford it, I&#x27;d be doing it right now. But this is an affordable, needle-free alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m nearly 3 weeks in and I have to say I&#x27;m impressed so far.  Like I said, I didn&#x27;t actually expect muscle-freezing results. But after 2 to 2-1/2 weeks I started to notice that feeling in my forehead that I&#x27;d gotten when the Botox started to kick in. There isn&#x27;t a total freeze, but I&#x27;m definitely noticing more limited movement, which is a good thing. I have some pretty developed forehead muscles and lines, so I&#x27;m going to give it more time. But I am definitely noticing a difference and wanted to report in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the rest, it is a light-weight serum. I saw the other customer who complained about a very strong odor. Honestly, I haven&#x27;t noticed an odor. Also I have very sensitive and very fair skin which tends to break out. I haven&#x27;t noticed any irritation or breakouts with use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6/16/13 update. Continue to love the product! No cons to its use at all. No breakouts or irritation. It does only \\&quot;reduce\\&quot; movement to a certain extent. But I like that. I don&#x27;t have a frozen, expressionless look, but my frowning movement is reduced. I had some pretty powerful frown/worry muscles, so I&#x27;m pleased with the improvement. I plan to reorder, which is the greatest testament.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/13/13 update. Continuing to reorder this product. One bottle lasts about 2 months. I can definitely tell a difference between when I use it and go without. Again, it&#x27;s topical versus injections, so you can&#x27;t compare to injections. But as far as a topical goes... I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
            <li> I only use it where I tend to have expression lines. I don&#x27;t use it all over; I thought it made my face look droopy when I did.</li>
    </ol>
