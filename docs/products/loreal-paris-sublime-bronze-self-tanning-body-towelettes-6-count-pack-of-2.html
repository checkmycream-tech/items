            <li>Color looks very natural.  </li>
            <li>Vastly better than L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s spray-on self tanner, which just doesn&#x27;t go on evenly, no matter how hard you try.</li>
            <li>Takes the white glow off legs with a realistic tan color, takes up no room in the suitcase, and doesn&#x27;t leak, run or stain.</li>
            <li>Be careful around knees, ankles, and feet too - as the skin in those areas tends to color darker and more rapidly than other parts of the body!  </li>

            <li> My wife has tried countless &amp;#34;tanning&amp;#34; creams - and none work as good as the L&#x27;Oreal tanning towels - and these are a lot less expensive too!</li>
            <li> There is a slight &#x27;self tanner&#x27; smell, but it&#x27;s definitely tolerable.</li>
            <li> like to look  a little tan instead of white  being from Texas  </li>
            <li> 1 box will get you from that pale winter white skin to a luxurious tan - i usually use 1 towel a day for several days before the start of the summer season to give me a jump start on the summer tan.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE USED OTHER BRANDS  AND L&#x27;OREAL PARIS</li>
            <li> I use this to add a little color to my face an neck.  </li>
            <li> i have been using for 10 yrs  and does not smell but a little bit  </li>
            <li> These are ez to use but the application is a little streaky.</li>
            <li> stills take a few time to get med tan</li>
            <li> I think the shelf life for this item is a few weeks, max.</li>
            <li> Uneven and orange.</li>
            <li> every one is so pale  </li>
            <li> I wore rubber gloves to apply and only streaked in one small spot behind my knee.</li>
            <li> and i can order small amt  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the towelettes as well as the Sublime Bronze self-tanning Lotion for past 3 years and apply it while wearing disposable latex gloves.  </li>
            <li> and no more tanning beds !</li>

            <li> easy and a fabulous tan</li>
            <li> love this product - no orange glow !  and no more tanning beds !</li>
            <li> A very good product that lives up to its claims and represents the&lt;br /&gt;brand name with integrity.</li>
            <li> Great product - no orange colors!</li>
            <li> These work so well! I am very fair-skinned, and these made me noticeably tanner. This was my first time using tanning towelettes, so I&#x27;m not sure what the norm is, but the towelettes were much larger than I was expecting; about the size of a piece of paper. I wore rubber gloves to apply and only streaked in one small spot behind my knee. I did not use this product on my face (I use a gradual tanning face moisturizer daily). There is a slight &#x27;self tanner&#x27; smell, but it&#x27;s definitely tolerable. Will definitely be reusing/repurchasing.</li>
            <li> I use this to add a little color to my face an neck.  Lotion goes on easily and provides complete coverage.  I have never had any problem with streaking.  Color looks very natural.  Vastly better than L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s spray-on self tanner, which just doesn&#x27;t go on evenly, no matter how hard you try.</li>
            <li> I used to lay in the sun and in the tanning beds.  I am beginning to see the effects.  I have tried many sunless lotion and towelettes. These by are one of my favorite alternatives.  No smell and so easy to use, to get a more even tan.</li>
            <li> it works better than Tan Towel i have been using for 10 yrs  and does not smell but a little bit  after you have had on a while  It is a great price  and i can order small amt  i try to keep it all the time  .UI am older and  like to look  a little tan instead of white  being from Texas  we like to have tans  ,when i lived in PA and NY  every one is so pale  .It stills take a few time to get med tan but it shows some color  even after 1st time in about 3 hrs  love it</li>
            <li> The best self - tanning product out there. No streaks.  I&#x27;m fair complexion , and the color is perfect. Awesome for travel.</li>
            <li> These are ez to use but the application is a little streaky. The color is nice a golden tan, not orange.</li>
            <li> Product worked great.  Can go light or darker - your choice.  Love the product.</li>
            <li> Great for light skinned northerns traveling to summer climes during the winter!  Takes the white glow off legs with a realistic tan color, takes up no room in the suitcase, and doesn&#x27;t leak, run or stain.</li>
            <li> Great fake tanning product.  1 box will get you from that pale winter white skin to a luxurious tan - i usually use 1 towel a day for several days before the start of the summer season to give me a jump start on the summer tan.  Especially when living in cloudy NW Ohio - and heading for a Southern spring vacation - you don&#x27;t want to be caught looking like a beached whale - or white enough that people need sunglasses to look at your legs when wearing shorts!  The wipes/towels are large enough to cover most bodies.  They solution on the wipes/towels does not stink and is pleasant - and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky (maybe just a touch).  Just be sure to wash your hands off so your palms aren&#x27;t stained from using these.  No streaking is evident from using them.  Be careful around knees, ankles, and feet too - as the skin in those areas tends to color darker and more rapidly than other parts of the body!

            <li> I REALLY LIKE THESE TAN TOWELS . I&#x27;VE USED OTHER BRANDS  AND L&#x27;OREAL PARIS SUBLIME BRONZE TAN TOWELS IS THE BEST.</li>
            <li> This is the third tan towel I have tried. Unfortunately, this brand didn&#x27;t achieve any better results.  I think the shelf life for this item is a few weeks, max. They really had no effect.</li>
            <li> I use this regularly with great results.  Never leaves streaks and never rubs off on clothes.  Looks more natural than anything I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t a fan. Uneven and orange.</li>
