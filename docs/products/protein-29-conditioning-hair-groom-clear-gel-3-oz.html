            <li> This is completely water soluble so no &amp;#34;greasy kid stuff.&amp;#34; It has a pleasant odor and is easy to apply in small amounts. It doesn&#x27;t leave hair with a shiny finish. I have been usiing this for years and am sorry it no longer appears in drug store counters.</li>

            <li> Shipping came pretty fast. My only complaint is I&#x27;ve been using this product for 30+ years. I&#x27;m guessing the ingredients have changed from what i used. It&#x27;s not a firm clear green gel. More like oozing lime green semi-gel.</li>
