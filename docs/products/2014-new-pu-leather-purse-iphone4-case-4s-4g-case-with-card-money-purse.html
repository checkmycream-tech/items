            <li> Excellent product. My little girl loves it. If you are willing to wait for it this purchase cannot be beat. Great price/value ratio. It&#x27;s coming directly from China so unless you pay a higher shipping fee it will take several weeks to arrive. But again, couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. My little girl own words: &amp;#34;It&#x27;s super cute and it won&#x27;t crack if it falls&#x27;.</li>
            <li> everyone admires my phone case, it&#x27;s just as it&#x27;s pictured.</li>
