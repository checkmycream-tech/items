            <li>It arrived with no harm in very good packaging.  </li>

            <li>Great seller.  </li>
            <li>My order arrived very quickly,  and the product is wonderful at a very good price.</li>
            <li>got a great price and mother loved it</li>
            <li>One of my favorite perfumes at the best price</li>
            <li>She loved it and wears it all the time.</li>
            <li>but I think the Flowerbomb scent smells good.</li>
            <li>While on vacation in April a waitress at one of the restaurants inside the hotel I stayed at just loved the fragrance, so I gave it to her.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite fragrance!</li>
            <li>Try the website for an amusing experience.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so beautiful and feminine and sexy and elegant and soooooo much more.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>MY FAVORITE PERFUME.</li>
            <li>Arrives in cutely packaged box and bottle.</li>
            <li>my favorite fragrance...</li>
            <li>After having some issues getting it around my location I was able to find it even cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have read many reviews describing what folks call \\&quot;knock-off\\&quot; versions of Flowerbomb.  </li>
            <li>I think this is the most deceptive title for a perfume period.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t even mind it any more.</li>
            <li>I love, love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>I am so in love with this fragrance</li>
            <li>Even one of my male friends recommended Flowerbomb to me, not realizing I was already up on it though, lol!</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance on my wife, she love the smell also</li>
            <li>It has a light but intriguing scent that is so nice!  </li>
            <li>and she loved it very much.</li>
            <li>Arrived super early, very happy with the service.</li>
            <li>Parfume and eau de toilette, both very good but slightly different.</li>
            <li>I think it smells good too haha.</li>
            <li>Great scent, fresh and unusual.  </li>
            <li>She liked it very much.</li>
            <li>A bomb of a beautiful fragrance has been dropped on me and I look forward to the next attack!</li>
            <li>My first fragrance love is CHANEL as most women know.</li>
            <li>it smells amazing, isn&#x27;t overpowering, and really lasts.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very sweet, warm floral, with a bit of a sharp osmanthus (sort of citrus, plummy) top note and a musky sweetness on drydown.</li>
            <li>I have requested a full refund and will buy at an authorized reseller with authenticity code in tact.</li>
            <li>It was 100% worthy the price</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not even funny!</li>
            <li>My husband seems to think that it&#x27;s the real perfume, but it was repackaged since someone already used the code to get the free gifts.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The price was right on this.</li>
            <li>my favorite, long lasting, unique.</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>My wife loves this fragrance and I really like it on her.</li>
            <li>It really smells like baby powder.</li>
            <li>Thank you and much luck to you.</li>
            <li>It is very suspicious and Amazon should correct this problem with their supplier.</li>
            <li>The fragrance smells the same, but doesn&#x27;t last as long, which I&#x27;m pretty sure is the point of having the \\&quot;watered-down\\&quot; version, so that you don&#x27;t melt people&#x27;s faces off with the original.  </li>
            <li>It was a bit pricey, so I only wear it on special occasions.</li>
            <li>That is exactly what my 15 year old grand-daughetr said wen</li>
            <li>Clever.</li>
            <li>My second bottle and not last, for sure.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I just feel that it was priced a bit too high.</li>
            <li>My box was also butchered by little gnomes, but was intact, and I believe the product to be authentic.  </li>
            <li>Like many other reviews, the authenticity code that is normally on the inside of box&#x27;s top when you open it has been removed with some precision using an Exacto knife or other such tool.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want the gift set I had first bought and wanted a larger bottle instead.</li>
            <li>This scent is a mature version of sweetness.</li>
            <li>The box arrived early.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sent directly from Aphrodite, if you know the Greek myths.</li>
            <li>That at least explains why the bottle is different from my previous two: much more faceted.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Wonderful perfume, one of my favorite, long lasting, unique. Arrived super early, very happy with the service.</li>
            <li> my favorite fragrance... every comments in it.</li>
            <li> I have bought this for my girlfriend twice now and she absolutely loves it. I think it smells good too haha.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas present for my girlfriend. She had been wanting Flowerbomb for a while. After having some issues getting it around my location I was able to find it even cheaper on Amazon. I didn&#x27;t want the gift set I had first bought and wanted a larger bottle instead. The price was right on this. She loved it and wears it all the time. I actually don&#x27;t care for some fragrances but I think the Flowerbomb scent smells good.</li>
            <li> That is exactly what my 15 year old grand-daughetr said wen she oppened her Cristmas present I saw the bottle of Flowebomb perfum.  It was 100% worthy the price</li>
            <li> it smells amazing, isn&#x27;t overpowering, and really lasts.</li>
            <li> My first fragrance love is CHANEL as most women know. This scent is a mature version of sweetness. Cotton candy deliciousness is just one of the scents. They call it FlowerBOMB for a reason. A bomb of a beautiful fragrance has been dropped on me and I look forward to the next attack!</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t be fooled, this perfume is totally a fake and I will never be buying it through amazon AGAIN! BIG waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> Our local stores stopped selling Flowerbomb. My wife loves this fragrance and I really like it on her. Simple solution. The box arrived early. Very satisfied with Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have read many reviews describing what folks call \\&quot;knock-off\\&quot; versions of Flowerbomb.  Initially, I was also skeptical about the bottle I bought.  It was advertised as the eau de parfum, but my invoice from seller informed me I had purchased the eau de toilette.  That at least explains why the bottle is different from my previous two: much more faceted.  The fragrance smells the same, but doesn&#x27;t last as long, which I&#x27;m pretty sure is the point of having the \\&quot;watered-down\\&quot; version, so that you don&#x27;t melt people&#x27;s faces off with the original.  My box was also butchered by little gnomes, but was intact, and I believe the product to be authentic.  Just wouldv&#x27;e been good to know what I was buying!  Tisk tisk Beauty Encounter!</li>
            <li> This is like sexiness in a bottle. You will definitely smell like a flowery Bombshell. And the bottle itself looks like a &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; grenade. Clever. It was a bit pricey, so I only wear it on special occasions. I always get &amp;#34;Oh, you smell so good&amp;#34; compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Delightful scent in a beautiful bottle.  It arrived with no harm in very good packaging.  Once again, Amazon comes through for me.</li>
            <li> I think this is the most deceptive title for a perfume period. It really smells like baby powder. I got this from the perfumania sale after having it on my amazon wish list for ages. just to realize this thing really is no better smelling than baby powder. Fell for the hype. I paid a lot of money to discover this. My kids play with this and I don&#x27;t even mind it any more.</li>
            <li> I just received my 1.7 oz bottle, and I&#x27;m a little confused. The bottle looks exactly like my old bottle, and the perfume is the same heavenly scent, BUT the batch number on the bottle and box don&#x27;t match, and the Secret Service code was cut out. My husband seems to think that it&#x27;s the real perfume, but it was repackaged since someone already used the code to get the free gifts. I don&#x27;t really care much about the code since I&#x27;m too poor to regularly buy V&amp;R in order to get the perks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just don&#x27;t like the idea of someone meddling with my products. It seems dirty.</li>
            <li> I get asked quite often about the fragrance I&#x27;m wearing. A little goes a long way. It&#x27;s my favorite fragrance!</li>
            <li> I received this parfumerie as a gift forChristmas from my daughter. While on vacation in April a waitress at one of the restaurants inside the hotel I stayed at just loved the fragrance, so I gave it to her. I brought this one as a replacement. I love, love this fragrance.</li>
            <li> Great seller.  My order arrived very quickly,  and the product is wonderful at a very good price. Thank you and much luck to you.</li>
            <li> got a great price and mother loved it</li>
            <li> Is not the same product I bought from Saphara ,</li>
            <li> Fragrance reviews are hard to write since they&#x27;re so personalised, but the least I can say is that Flowerbomb is a relatively strong fragrance (moderate sillage), and quite longlasting (over 6 hours on me). It&#x27;s a very sweet, warm floral, with a bit of a sharp osmanthus (sort of citrus, plummy) top note and a musky sweetness on drydown. I quite like it, though it might not suit all tastes.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this fragrance it&#x27;s not even funny! It&#x27;s to the point where I can pick it up when I&#x27;m in a crowd of people. I walked up to this woman and asked her was she wearing Flowerbomb and she said yes and I was the second person to approach her. It&#x27;s so beautiful and feminine and sexy and elegant and soooooo much more. You will definitely stand out in a crowd. Almost every woman I know owns a bottle of flowerbomb. Even one of my male friends recommended Flowerbomb to me, not realizing I was already up on it though, lol! It&#x27;s simply lovely!!!</li>
            <li> I suspect that Amazon is using a supplier that is bootlegging suspect FlowerBomb product through a channel that is not authorized to sell. Like many other reviews, the authenticity code that is normally on the inside of box&#x27;s top when you open it has been removed with some precision using an Exacto knife or other such tool. It is very suspicious and Amazon should correct this problem with their supplier. I have requested a full refund and will buy at an authorized reseller with authenticity code in tact.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my GF and she loved it very much. I like the smell of it when she is wearing. she gets lots of compliments about her perfume wherever we go.</li>
            <li> My second bottle and not last, for sure. Parfume and eau de toilette, both very good but slightly different. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Gift to my daughter and she was very happy.</li>
            <li> I chose this item because my wife suggested it. Purchased it for her. She liked it very much. I just feel that it was priced a bit too high.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite perfumes at the best price</li>
            <li> Dreamy!  Seductive!  A great treat from me to me!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife&#x27;s birthday.  She loves it</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance on my wife, she love the smell also</li>
