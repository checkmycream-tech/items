            <li>Good machine to play with if you are wondering about using a rotary.</li>
            <li>But all in all good buy</li>
            <li>Just as good as the name brands 90% price.</li>

            <li>Seems to be a nice machine,strong.</li>
            <li>simply and completely impressed and happy with this buy....</li>
            <li>Perfect foruse as a  liner, light shader &amp; light color packer.</li>
            <li>, I bought a nice placstic one and</li>
            <li>it s nice</li>
            <li>If you like this model then scrap it and buy a nice Swiss Rotory for quality and features along with 5 star performance..</li>
            <li>but I ordered a stainless steel replacement and now its perfect.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping, great product!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Get the nice 10 wrap coil machines.</li>
            <li>this machine works very good doesnt get hot.</li>
            <li>I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting more than a cobbled together piece of garbage for $10.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it will work good as a liner but hits smooth for the price</li>
            <li>it came from china, it ran so smooth &amp; good</li>
            <li>and honestly I liked the swashdrive whip better</li>
            <li>this machine came and i was impressed with it as far as looks good, sound good, and runs right out of the box.</li>
            <li>I did two of my first tattoos on myself with this machine and for the most part worked great...</li>
            <li>Nice strong motor makes quik work of both lining and shading.</li>
            <li>cant be better love weight of it to sounds very smooth quite ...</li>
            <li>i will be buying more if this goes as planned.</li>
            <li>Runs nice and smooth now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a $10 machine, and I already feel like I got more than I paid for</li>
            <li>Wonderful, incredibly quiet, doesn&#x27;t stutter at all .</li>
            <li>I will be ordering atleast 3 to 4 more.</li>
            <li>I love it while using it..</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m more of a rotary type.  </li>
            <li>There are better ones out there.</li>
            <li>Kearney. :-)</li>
            <li>no what you are getting,they are all mostly put together over</li>
            <li>It is ok as a liner, but there is no give, so as a shader - i don&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li>For sure buy one.</li>
            <li>I love it and will buy another one</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for any beginner for sure.</li>
            <li>i love this gun</li>
            <li>im buying 2 more as backups</li>
            <li>HOW MUCH BETTER</li>
            <li>i just began tattooing, I have used many art medium before.</li>
            <li>i might get one more</li>
            <li>Never before I had such a perfect amount of ink my skin.</li>
            <li>The machine vibrates was to much cant get a good line if there is a way to tune it please email me at CSeymour89@email.com</li>
            <li>I tried it on my self and it was the most pleasant tattooing experience I had as far as pain is concerned.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Additionally more consistent hits means better line work better color</li>
            <li>Very very satisfied with this machine came fast works</li>
            <li>This machine is perfect very lightweight and quiet have run it for hours with no problems love it.</li>
            <li>Any problems I have run into are a result of me not being used to how smooth &amp; easy it runs in comparison to a coil.</li>
            <li>Regarding pain, unless you are really a &amp;#34;p##sy&amp;#34;... lol but really, I almost did not feel a thing!</li>
            <li>within my first year as a tattoo artist and I&#x27;ve tried multiple machines to find what fit me best</li>
            <li>This Rotary tattoo machine works fine, looks,and feels well made,and performs smoothly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is light weight great for longer larger tattoo secession, since it will not fatigue you like heavier coil machines</li>
            <li>Runs smooth, but will it stand the test of time??</li>
            <li>I should have known because it was so cheap.</li>
            <li>By light I reference needle grouping size.</li>
            <li>This machine packs alot of power, plus it is superr silent,it is also light weight..</li>
            <li>Its a bit heavier of a rotary machine ,but feels very sturdy and nicely build for the price that is.</li>
            <li>I like the fact it is quite and light.</li>
            <li>guess I have to get use to how light this thing is.</li>
            <li>you can feel the motor coast when you let up of it,its smooth as homemade wine, but my opinion,if you got nice coil machines stick to them,because these 2 and 3 hundred dollar rotary machines are to much for me to invest in something</li>
            <li>Super quite and strong motor.</li>
            <li>Its a REALLY simple and effective machine!</li>
            <li>First rotary I have ever used and really satisfied with the quality of materials.</li>
            <li>I originally ordered 1</li>
            <li>Super smooth to shade with.</li>
            <li>SUPER LIGHT</li>
            <li>Your skill will improve right away!</li>
            <li>so I may amend this review later, but having just got it in the mail, I had to remark on how surprisingly well made it was for the miniscule price.</li>
            <li>I had it for almost 2 full years</li>
            <li>this latest 1 i dont like as much as the 1st.</li>
            <li>Good basic rotary until you could afford the name brands, like Stigma hyper v3</li>
            <li>it is cheaply made but for $10 its worth it  </li>
            <li>I though, inner bicep would be good to test out the pain level too.</li>
            <li>I would by extra rings for the needles very comfortable and light a little shakey but works great!</li>
            <li>As other reviews stated, the machine needed a bit of tweaking, but it runs great.</li>
            <li>this item quickly broke...</li>
            <li>I pack each review with tons of educational information, links to free videos &amp; PDF&#x27;S on tattooing...</li>
            <li>and I along with my mentors simply fell in LOVE with this machine!</li>
            <li>I will definitely order couple more!</li>
            <li>this is a great little rotary ..</li>
            <li>Great little machine.</li>
            <li>Great little machine</li>
            <li>the cams &amp; noticed the 1st is 3mm which is good for all purpose, the latest is @ 2mm good for a liner, as far as knowing what cams do what go to worldwide tattoo supply check out the parts for stealth rotary machine, this 2nd one has a diffrent motor a little louder buzz still quieter than coil machine.</li>
            <li>Runs low power &amp; is just amazing.</li>
            <li>its quiet and nicely put together ..</li>
            <li>CHINA Controls Rare Earth Magnets.</li>
            <li>motor is powerful for it&#x27;s size.</li>
            <li>Great machine, I&#x27;m am an apprentice currently and didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money on a machine, a fellow artist friend suggested this machine, great for lining and really can pack in some heavy color as a shader as well, I will be buying several more.</li>
            <li>and it seems like a nice rotary especially for the price.</li>
            <li>This machine is worth the money.</li>
            <li>but for me it was better then most my other rotary guns.  </li>
            <li>and they work fantastic.. light wieght and quiet my favorite new gun...</li>
            <li>I guess you get what you pay for, right.</li>
            <li>Feels good good weight to it bar is a little loose tho</li>
            <li>once I use it I will update the review as of right now I am very satisfied with this perches not much to say until I see how it will run a line.</li>
            <li>we were kinda amazed but overall super satisfied.</li>
            <li>Not only was the package on time, but their customer service was very prompt and courteous.</li>
            <li>overall for the money is ok.</li>
            <li>I am very please with my purchase!</li>
            <li>Broke the first time used.</li>
            <li>I believe this to be one of the best Rotary&#x27;s Chinese, European, American!</li>
            <li>for educational information on tattooing see YouTube Channel SINCITYTATTOOZ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I understand its tempting and scary to buy a machine for this price, but I promise I used this a lot and its excellent liner..</li>
            <li>can&#x27;nt try first and the are like surfboards if you buy it and you</li>
            <li>Gets too hot and runs inconsistently halfway through the tattoo</li>
            <li>It runs quiet like most rotary&#x27;s do.</li>
            <li>ink in like a charm will buy another one.. more buying in the future.....</li>
            <li>My first thoughts on opening the package was the quality of this machine.</li>
            <li>It is very well put together!</li>
            <li>Anyway I did my first tattoo with it yesterday.</li>
            <li>Did not last more than 10 tattoos max.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t running properly at first.  </li>
            <li>No tuning, no nothing, straight out the box!</li>
            <li>i got this gun last week and its work perfect not heavy when you tattoo the vibrations dont mess up your lines since theres like no vibrations at all</li>
            <li>I enjoy it, smooth action and quiet!</li>
            <li>In the end you get more than you pay for, but if your serious about tatting you need a better machine</li>
            <li>Enough power for lining or shading and so easy to switch from the two.</li>
            <li>Got this for my boyfriend as a gift, and he&#x27;s been doing more tattoos lately, this is quickly becoming his favourite gun.</li>
            <li>Besides, I definitely would have had to touch up or even add some more layers on top, because you can&#x27;t really stretch your skin there yourself without somebody&#x27;s help and thats why its really hard to get the right amount of ink!</li>
            <li>i can go as low as 4v and it works fine</li>
            <li>If you are a decent artist, get it also!</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Not what u would expect for such a cheap price.  </li>
            <li>Straight from China.</li>
            <li>Cheap for Chinese Companies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks...</li>
            <li>Rotary machines are so much smoother than the coil machines.</li>
            <li>Rotory Motor W1  has absolutely ZERO give BUT stays consistant at ALL speeds.</li>
            <li>, This machine packs in ink really well, although I did have to remove the two silver bars</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would recommend this for anyone who wants to try out a cheaper version of rotary&lt;</li>
            <li>Lines went in solid and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sastified.</li>
            <li>But this, really deserves the review!&lt;br</li>
            <li>But if u want a good gun I went back to coil machines and spent the money.  </li>
            <li>With 4,5 voltage, 9RL needle I went ahead to work on my inner bicep piece that was kind of faded out from my last session.</li>
            <li>Mine broke in original machine on second tattoo</li>
            <li>He said he wanted to go back to rotary machines, so I bought this one because of the price: if it works awesome, if it dont i wont be sad.</li>
            <li>the selling price its decent to buy just to use an example of how a Rotory works and feels like.</li>
            <li>This was cheap enough to take a chance on, and has proven to be a reliable device so far.</li>
            <li>Decent machine for the price.</li>
            <li>so my rubber bands could hold the needle steady.</li>
            <li>now that&#x27;s something that decent artists might flame me for...</li>
            <li>highly recommend this rotary tattoo machine...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Fits the normal grips and needles and runs like a dream.</li>
            <li>so it was worth the ten bucks.</li>
            <li>Had to make some cheapo adjustments to it, the metal bars come right out, so that wasn&#x27;t a big problem.</li>
            <li>First since the hit is consistent even though a rotary hits harder</li>
            <li>cheap quiet and low vibration</li>
            <li>Was very surprised at its power considering the price.</li>
            <li>Those annoyingly loud coil machines got to go!</li>
            <li>Ok, so, usually, I don&#x27;t review stuff...</li>
            <li>The price is right, my shipping was free &amp; even if its not a good product it will allow me to test a rotary on a budget &amp; decide if I like them.</li>
            <li>Only used a few times so far, works great down to 3v with liners and shaders.</li>
            <li>Well, with a lot of rotaries you can adjust the &amp;#34;t-bar&amp;#34; to give a little more slack when the needle penetrates the skin, this one does not have that option, so when the needle hits the skin, it will penetrate the same every time</li>
            <li>the toreture racks alright, and mine lasted me around 6 months,and the motor was in there crooked and the cam was out of whack,and it would toreture your ass if you want careful, because the type of machines ,don&#x27;nt pull the ink up that good and feed it bck out,it just one little stroke</li>
            <li>, I fixed it and</li>
            <li>Do NOT Waste Ur Money</li>
            <li>Go in any Tattoo Studio Rotary&#x27;s are in just about every professional tattooartist arsenal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>young tattoo artist in tattoo studios use Rotary&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>The machine actually didn&#x27;t work when I got it, I took it apart (be careful not to lose those tiny pieces or break anything) and cut about 1/8 -1/4 inch off of the spring holding up the top bar.</li>
            <li>sometimes when I just try it out to see if it maybe fixed its self</li>
            <li>The seller shipped it out and it arrived early</li>
            <li>Runs for long periods without heating up &amp; is very consistent &amp; quiet.</li>
            <li>This gun runs SOOo much quieter and smoother than my other gun.</li>
            <li>I love this little machine!!!!</li>
            <li>So They Set the price high for other countries.</li>
            <li>Now the piece is a solid black tribal, no shades, straight black.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bad in the fact that if it is not used correctly, can hamburger the skin, good in the fact that if you know what your doing, the lines will be very consistent and thick.</li>
            <li>For the price you really can&#x27;t beat this little rotary.</li>
            <li>The pieces all seem to fit together well, even though I am a little leery about a few of the plastic</li>
            <li>, this can be good and bad.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> it came from china, it ran so smooth &amp; good</li>

            <li> this machine came and i was impressed with it as far as looks good, sound good, and runs right out of the box.</li>
            <li> I did two of my first tattoos on myself with this machine and for the most part worked great...</li>

            <li> There are better ones out there.</li>
            <li> Kearney. :-)</li>
            <li> no what you are getting,they are all mostly put together over</li>
            <li> It is ok as a liner, but there is no give, so as a shader - i don&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> For sure buy one.</li>
            <li> I love it and will buy another one</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for any beginner for sure.</li>
            <li> i love this gun</li>
            <li> im buying 2 more as backups</li>
            <li> HOW MUCH BETTER</li>
            <li> i just began tattooing, I have used many art medium before.</li>
            <li> i might get one more</li>
            <li> Never before I had such a perfect amount of ink my skin.</li>
            <li> The machine vibrates was to much cant get a good line if there is a way to tune it please email me at CSeymour89@email.com</li>
            <li> I tried it on my self and it was the most pleasant tattooing experience I had as far as pain is concerned.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally more consistent hits means better line work better color</li>
            <li> Very very satisfied with this machine came fast works</li>
            <li> This machine is perfect very lightweight and quiet have run it for hours with no problems love it.</li>
            <li> Any problems I have run into are a result of me not being used to how smooth &amp; easy it runs in comparison to a coil.</li>
            <li> Regarding pain, unless you are really a &amp;#34;p##sy&amp;#34;... lol but really, I almost did not feel a thing!</li>
            <li> within my first year as a tattoo artist and I&#x27;ve tried multiple machines to find what fit me best</li>
            <li> This Rotary tattoo machine works fine, looks,and feels well made,and performs smoothly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is light weight great for longer larger tattoo secession, since it will not fatigue you like heavier coil machines</li>
            <li> Runs smooth, but will it stand the test of time??</li>
            <li> I should have known because it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> By light I reference needle grouping size.</li>
            <li> This machine packs alot of power, plus it is superr silent,it is also light weight..</li>
            <li> Its a bit heavier of a rotary machine ,but feels very sturdy and nicely build for the price that is.</li>
            <li> I like the fact it is quite and light.</li>
            <li> guess I have to get use to how light this thing is.</li>
            <li> you can feel the motor coast when you let up of it,its smooth as homemade wine, but my opinion,if you got nice coil machines stick to them,because these 2 and 3 hundred dollar rotary machines are to much for me to invest in something</li>
            <li> Super quite and strong motor.</li>
            <li> Its a REALLY simple and effective machine!</li>
            <li> First rotary I have ever used and really satisfied with the quality of materials.</li>
            <li> I originally ordered 1</li>
            <li> Super smooth to shade with.</li>
            <li> SUPER LIGHT</li>
            <li> Your skill will improve right away!</li>
            <li> so I may amend this review later, but having just got it in the mail, I had to remark on how surprisingly well made it was for the miniscule price.</li>
            <li> I had it for almost 2 full years</li>
            <li> this latest 1 i dont like as much as the 1st.</li>
            <li> Good basic rotary until you could afford the name brands, like Stigma hyper v3</li>
            <li> it is cheaply made but for $10 its worth it  </li>
            <li> I though, inner bicep would be good to test out the pain level too.</li>
            <li> I would by extra rings for the needles very comfortable and light a little shakey but works great!</li>
            <li> As other reviews stated, the machine needed a bit of tweaking, but it runs great.</li>
            <li> this item quickly broke...</li>
            <li> I pack each review with tons of educational information, links to free videos &amp; PDF&#x27;S on tattooing...</li>
            <li> and I along with my mentors simply fell in LOVE with this machine!</li>
            <li> I will definitely order couple more!</li>
            <li> this is a great little rotary ..</li>
            <li> Great little machine.</li>
            <li> Great little machine</li>
            <li> the cams &amp; noticed the 1st is 3mm which is good for all purpose, the latest is @ 2mm good for a liner, as far as knowing what cams do what go to worldwide tattoo supply check out the parts for stealth rotary machine, this 2nd one has a diffrent motor a little louder buzz still quieter than coil machine.</li>
            <li> Runs low power &amp; is just amazing.</li>
            <li> its quiet and nicely put together ..</li>
            <li> CHINA Controls Rare Earth Magnets.</li>
            <li> motor is powerful for it&#x27;s size.</li>
            <li> Great machine, I&#x27;m am an apprentice currently and didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money on a machine, a fellow artist friend suggested this machine, great for lining and really can pack in some heavy color as a shader as well, I will be buying several more.</li>
            <li> and it seems like a nice rotary especially for the price.</li>
            <li> This machine is worth the money.</li>
            <li> but for me it was better then most my other rotary guns.  </li>
            <li> and they work fantastic.. light wieght and quiet my favorite new gun...</li>
            <li> I guess you get what you pay for, right.</li>
            <li> Feels good good weight to it bar is a little loose tho</li>
            <li> once I use it I will update the review as of right now I am very satisfied with this perches not much to say until I see how it will run a line.</li>
            <li> we were kinda amazed but overall super satisfied.</li>
            <li> Not only was the package on time, but their customer service was very prompt and courteous.</li>
            <li> overall for the money is ok.</li>
            <li> I am very please with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Broke the first time used.</li>
            <li> I believe this to be one of the best Rotary&#x27;s Chinese, European, American!</li>
            <li> for educational information on tattooing see YouTube Channel SINCITYTATTOOZ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I understand its tempting and scary to buy a machine for this price, but I promise I used this a lot and its excellent liner..</li>
            <li> can&#x27;nt try first and the are like surfboards if you buy it and you</li>
            <li> Gets too hot and runs inconsistently halfway through the tattoo</li>
            <li> It runs quiet like most rotary&#x27;s do.</li>
            <li> ink in like a charm will buy another one.. more buying in the future.....</li>
            <li> My first thoughts on opening the package was the quality of this machine.</li>
            <li> It is very well put together!</li>
            <li> Anyway I did my first tattoo with it yesterday.</li>
            <li> Did not last more than 10 tattoos max.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t running properly at first.  </li>
            <li> No tuning, no nothing, straight out the box!</li>
            <li> i got this gun last week and its work perfect not heavy when you tattoo the vibrations dont mess up your lines since theres like no vibrations at all</li>
            <li> I enjoy it, smooth action and quiet!</li>
            <li> In the end you get more than you pay for, but if your serious about tatting you need a better machine</li>
            <li> Enough power for lining or shading and so easy to switch from the two.</li>
            <li> Got this for my boyfriend as a gift, and he&#x27;s been doing more tattoos lately, this is quickly becoming his favourite gun.</li>
            <li> Besides, I definitely would have had to touch up or even add some more layers on top, because you can&#x27;t really stretch your skin there yourself without somebody&#x27;s help and thats why its really hard to get the right amount of ink!</li>
            <li> i can go as low as 4v and it works fine</li>
            <li> If you are a decent artist, get it also!</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Not what u would expect for such a cheap price.  </li>
            <li> Straight from China.</li>
            <li> Cheap for Chinese Companies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks...</li>
            <li> Rotary machines are so much smoother than the coil machines.</li>
            <li> Rotory Motor W1  has absolutely ZERO give BUT stays consistant at ALL speeds.</li>
            <li> , This machine packs in ink really well, although I did have to remove the two silver bars</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would recommend this for anyone who wants to try out a cheaper version of rotary&lt;</li>
            <li> Lines went in solid and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sastified.</li>
            <li> But this, really deserves the review!&lt;br</li>
            <li> But if u want a good gun I went back to coil machines and spent the money.  </li>
            <li> With 4,5 voltage, 9RL needle I went ahead to work on my inner bicep piece that was kind of faded out from my last session.</li>
            <li> Mine broke in original machine on second tattoo</li>
            <li> He said he wanted to go back to rotary machines, so I bought this one because of the price: if it works awesome, if it dont i wont be sad.</li>
            <li> the selling price its decent to buy just to use an example of how a Rotory works and feels like.</li>
            <li> This was cheap enough to take a chance on, and has proven to be a reliable device so far.</li>
            <li> Decent machine for the price.</li>
            <li> so my rubber bands could hold the needle steady.</li>
            <li> now that&#x27;s something that decent artists might flame me for...</li>
            <li> highly recommend this rotary tattoo machine...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Fits the normal grips and needles and runs like a dream.</li>
            <li> so it was worth the ten bucks.</li>
            <li> Had to make some cheapo adjustments to it, the metal bars come right out, so that wasn&#x27;t a big problem.</li>
            <li> First since the hit is consistent even though a rotary hits harder</li>
            <li> cheap quiet and low vibration</li>
            <li> Was very surprised at its power considering the price.</li>
            <li> Those annoyingly loud coil machines got to go!</li>
            <li> Ok, so, usually, I don&#x27;t review stuff...</li>
            <li> The price is right, my shipping was free &amp; even if its not a good product it will allow me to test a rotary on a budget &amp; decide if I like them.</li>
            <li> Only used a few times so far, works great down to 3v with liners and shaders.</li>
            <li> Well, with a lot of rotaries you can adjust the &amp;#34;t-bar&amp;#34; to give a little more slack when the needle penetrates the skin, this one does not have that option, so when the needle hits the skin, it will penetrate the same every time</li>
            <li> the toreture racks alright, and mine lasted me around 6 months,and the motor was in there crooked and the cam was out of whack,and it would toreture your ass if you want careful, because the type of machines ,don&#x27;nt pull the ink up that good and feed it bck out,it just one little stroke</li>
            <li> , I fixed it and</li>
            <li> Do NOT Waste Ur Money</li>
            <li> Go in any Tattoo Studio Rotary&#x27;s are in just about every professional tattooartist arsenal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> young tattoo artist in tattoo studios use Rotary&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The machine actually didn&#x27;t work when I got it, I took it apart (be careful not to lose those tiny pieces or break anything) and cut about 1/8 -1/4 inch off of the spring holding up the top bar.</li>
            <li> sometimes when I just try it out to see if it maybe fixed its self</li>
            <li> The seller shipped it out and it arrived early</li>
            <li> Runs for long periods without heating up &amp; is very consistent &amp; quiet.</li>
            <li> This gun runs SOOo much quieter and smoother than my other gun.</li>
            <li> I love this little machine!!!!</li>
            <li> So They Set the price high for other countries.</li>
            <li> Now the piece is a solid black tribal, no shades, straight black.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bad in the fact that if it is not used correctly, can hamburger the skin, good in the fact that if you know what your doing, the lines will be very consistent and thick.</li>
            <li> For the price you really can&#x27;t beat this little rotary.</li>
            <li> The pieces all seem to fit together well, even though I am a little leery about a few of the plastic</li>
            <li> , this can be good and bad.</li>
            <li> I have four of these cheap ones and sick of messing with machine to perform right..</li>
            <li> Wanted to try one out before I spent money on a more expensive one.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how heavy and well put together</li>
            <li> This purchase was a COMPLETE waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> the speed and depth of needle were not what was expected and was only used twice before breaking</li>
            <li> just received shipment, machine is very solid not what I expected haven&#x27;t used it yet</li>
            <li> It is recommended for hatches do not work very long</li>
            <li> so it you plan on useing it your hands will fall asleep and its really loud and annoying if you want a cheap quiet rotary</li>
            <li> They do infact cut the learning curve down immensely...</li>
            <li> its quiet and lightweight with wayyyy less kickback than a coiled machine.</li>
            <li> a few weeks later it broke during a sesh, I had to stop and switch set ups...</li>
            <li> It was chipped in a few places, but no big deal because it gets the job done...</li>
            <li> seas.but if you want a jail house tat machine</li>
            <li> /&gt;See my other reviews of tattooing equipment...</li>
            <li> Kinda skeptical at first...</li>
            <li> I recieved product before estimated delivery date and it runs as well as some of my more expensive machines!!</li>
            <li> my only complaint is I have to turn the power up a lot to make it go ..</li>
            <li> black coating is rough, it has dings and a few fingerprints.</li>
            <li> it never broke down on me</li>
            <li> A little slower than other rotary guns I have used but still gets the job done.</li>
            <li> it was a little off.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll overlook a little cosmetic roughness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> we had it for a few months now</li>
            <li> and hes used it a few time and sometimes for continous hours.</li>
            <li> Its a bit heavy</li>
            <li> When i received the package in the mail (which took a few weeks because it came from China)</li>
            <li> Heavy duty rotatry machine.</li>
            <li> #34;wtf is wrong with this guy&amp;#34;, don&#x27;t be surprised.</li>
            <li> , item arrived almost a week late but due to the fact that it was the holiday season and was coming from china i can understand.</li>
            <li> At first I was disappointed because I received a gold one instead of black.  </li>
            <li> The only thing wrong with this machine was the paint job.</li>
            <li> With this machine and a 3 round liner i did Line work, Shading AND COLOR PACKING!</li>
            <li> Also havn&#x27;t used it yet cause not sure how the needle ame with some instructionsgoes on....</li>
            <li> AT THE BOTTEM IS IN AT A SMALL ANGLE.</li>
            <li> With my previous coil machine it probably would have taken me at least 5 to 6 hours!</li>
            <li> skin is damn hard to master.</li>
            <li> But I figure it wasn&#x27;t manufactured in a sterile environment by delicate, caring fingers.</li>
            <li> Does feel kinda awkward coming from a regular setup,</li>
            <li> It might be inexpensive but this sucker goes!</li>
            <li> ,that&#x27;s tough</li>
            <li> So less painful for client</li>
            <li> I like the design unfortunately for me</li>
            <li> it sort of fail apart after I used it a couple of times</li>
            <li> I sorry</li>
            <li> Ill update when used</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what reviews r saying about it bad as packing color</li>
            <li> Bad buy.</li>
            <li> but the machine vibrates really bad</li>

            <li> I guess I liked it, I have to admit it I like the design unfortunately for me it sort of fail apart after I used it a couple of times, I fixed it and a few weeks later it broke during a sesh, I had to stop and switch set ups...overall for the money is ok.</li>
            <li> Awesome price and very good tattoo machine!! I recieved product before estimated delivery date and it runs as well as some of my more expensive machines!! Thanks</li>
            <li> Great item.good shipping</li>
            <li> The back where the clip connectors are didn&#x27;t have screws so when I pulled with it plugged in it pulled the back off.</li>
            <li> came as described. totally happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> If ur an open minded artist and not a stuck up know it all, give this a try. Its a REALLY simple and effective machine!</li>
            <li> Rotory machine works great. Wanted to try one out before I spent money on a more expensive one. Read all reviews and figured I&#x27;d try this one out. Made a good choice.  Was very surprised at its power considering the price.</li>
            <li> Worked good for about 30min and now doesn&#x27;t keep voltage.</li>
            <li> First rotary I have ever used and really satisfied with the quality of materials. Runs smooth, but will it stand the test of time?? We will see. I will however continue to use this machine until the end. Plus at $5 a piece, I bought three. So if it burns out after a year or two, it will still be a great value. Buy one and give it a try.</li>
            <li> The machine vibrates was to much cant get a good line if there is a way to tune it please email me at CSeymour89@email.com</li>
            <li> This was probably 1 of the greatest buys I&#x27;ve ever run across. Not only was the package on time, but their customer service was very prompt and courteous. Very happy to say that I will be a return customer and look forward to spending a lot of money with this company. If you go to the actual site for this seller, Tmart.com, you don&#x27;t even have a hassle shipping and handling costs to deal with! Tell em Digger T. sent you</li>
            <li> this is a great little rotary .. its solid and works well .. it has tons of stroke and lots of power .. my only complaint is I have to turn the power up a lot to make it go .. its quiet and nicely put together .. I got mine from [...] and that&#x27;s where I go for all my tattoo and piercing supplies</li>
            <li> It looks well assembled but i need help tunning this machine can anybody help?...i will be buying more if this goes as planned.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a nice machine,strong.All I had to do is adjust the cam it was a little off.Runs nice and smooth now.Looks like it is built to last.</li>
            <li> This machine does its job runs very great cant be better love weight of it to sounds very smooth quite ...</li>
            <li> I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting more than a cobbled together piece of garbage for $10. I just wanted to try my hand at a rotary machine without shelling out some big bucks. It ain&#x27;t perfect and it ain&#x27;t pretty, but I was surprised at how heavy and well put together it feels for the price. The pieces all seem to fit together well, even though I am a little leery about a few of the plastic bits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The black coating is rough, it has dings and a few fingerprints. But I figure it wasn&#x27;t manufactured in a sterile environment by delicate, caring fingers. It&#x27;s a $10 machine, and I already feel like I got more than I paid for so I&#x27;ll overlook a little cosmetic roughness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried it yet so I may amend this review later, but having just got it in the mail, I had to remark on how surprisingly well made it was for the miniscule price.</li>
            <li> I bought this machine for my husband. He said he wanted to go back to rotary machines, so I bought this one because of the price: if it works awesome, if it dont i wont be sad. once it came in the mail he used it. we had it for a few months now and hes used it a few time and sometimes for continous hours. its perfect for the price. i am going to buy him a backup. he loves it opposed to his $500 iron horse coil machines. this rotary machine has been producing besutiful lines and shading. we were kinda amazed but overall super satisfied. but i have 1 question: can this machine be autoclaved?</li>
            <li> this machine works very good doesnt get hot. I like rotarys. The only thing wrong with this machine was the paint job. It was chipped in a few places, but no big deal because it gets the job done...</li>
            <li> This Knock Off Machine Is A Piece Of Garbage. I Bought One Of These &amp; It Didn&#x27;t Even Make It Thru One Tattoo B4 Everything Began Falling Apart. Do NOT Waste Ur Money On This Garbage....BUT Hey, It&#x27;s Amazon, Sometimes You May Get A Good Working Machine And Sometimes You Won&#x27;t. I Know I Didn&#x27;t....</li>
            <li> Thing works like a champ! Its a bit heavy but this thing is seriously a great buy! Not what u would expect for such a cheap price.  I would definitely recommend this machine if u are contemplating on buying it. I am very please with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I used this machine twice and it was louder than my coil machine and quit in the running in the middle of the third use</li>
            <li> This purchase was a COMPLETE waste of time and money. I should have known because it was so cheap. I guess you get what you pay for, right. The motor won&#x27;t even turn with the load of a needle. SMH</li>
            <li> I did two of my first tattoos on myself with this machine and for the most part worked great...for the price best deal but....I just paid 350 for a NEOTAT machine....I have four of these cheap ones and sick of messing with machine to perform right..In the end you get more than you pay for, but if your serious about tatting you need a better machine</li>
            <li> Great machine for the price</li>
            <li> Omg I can&#x27;t believe how much I love this rotary!!! Wonderful, incredibly quiet, doesn&#x27;t stutter at all . Super smooth to shade with. I will be ordering atleast 3 to 4 more.</li>
            <li> Very very satisfied with this machine came fast works great I would by extra rings for the needles very comfortable and light a little shakey but works great!</li>
            <li> It is recommended for hatches do not work very long</li>
            <li> Good in a pinch or parts</li>
            <li> I had it for almost 2 full years before it broke.. I love it while using it.. it wont last forever but it will last for a while.  The tattooist that owned the shop I worked at hated hers but she loves her coil machine and i&#x27;m more of a rotary type.  There are better ones out there.</li>
            <li> Broke the first time used. Been tattooing 13 years and know how machines run. I sorry but this was horrible.</li>
            <li> within my first year as a tattoo artist and I&#x27;ve tried multiple machines to find what fit me best and I along with my mentors simply fell in LOVE with this machine! its quiet and lightweight with wayyyy less kickback than a coiled machine. absolutely perfect for lining and even better for shading. I&#x27;ll never use a different type of machine again unless something else comes along. simply and completely impressed and happy with this buy.... #thumbsUP 👍💯</li>
            <li> Aint got it yet but from searching for an affordable rotary I came up with this. The price is right, my shipping was free &amp; even if its not a good product it will allow me to test a rotary on a budget &amp; decide if I like them. Ill update when used</li>
            <li> Feels good good weight to it bar is a little loose tho I don&#x27;t know if it will work good as a liner but hits smooth for the price</li>
            <li> Straight from China. Took about two weeks to arrive. Excellent quality for my style of fine lines.</li>
            <li> The person I bought this for loved it.</li>
            <li> I believe this to be one of the best Rotary&#x27;s Chinese, European, American! This Chinese version of the Stealth is about 1/20th of the price. &amp; works the same.  FACT CHINA Controls Rare Earth Magnets. So They Set the price high for other countries. Cheap for Chinese Companies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The motor is powerful for it&#x27;s size. Perfect foruse as a  liner, light shader &amp; light color packer. By light I reference needle grouping size. So for needle groupings like the 25 mag or larger no but up to that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is light weight great for longer larger tattoo secession, since it will not fatigue you like heavier coil machines can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YouTube Channel Andrew Mckinstrie has a review of this Chinese version versus an Actual Stealth Rotary.. Guess What? THIS BEAT THE STEALTH!&lt;br /&gt;Also for educational information on tattooing see YouTube Channel SINCITYTATTOOZ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rotary&#x27;s are the Future of Tattooing. They do infact cut the learning curve down immensely... Go in any Tattoo Studio Rotary&#x27;s are in just about every professional tattooartist arsenal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most young tattoo artist in tattoo studios use Rotary&#x27;s. First since the hit is consistent even though a rotary hits harder the client doesn&#x27;t feel it. So less painful for client some clients don&#x27;t feel it at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally more consistent hits means better line work better color saturation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See my other reviews of tattooing equipment... I pack each review with tons of educational information, links to free videos &amp; PDF&#x27;S on tattooing...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this review was helpful please check the box  √ Yes this Review Was Helpful!  Thanks...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this rotary tattoo machine...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take Care &amp; Good Luck in your Tattooing Career..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bill Kearney. :-)</li>
            <li> I understand its tempting and scary to buy a machine for this price, but I promise I used this a lot and its excellent liner..I don&#x27;t know what reviews r saying about it bad as packing color but for me it was better then most my other rotary guns.  But if u want a good gun I went back to coil machines and spent the money.  U pay for what u get and this gun helped pave the way for a beginner to learner and not have to drop lots of money</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat it for the money. performs just as good as the ones the cost 10 times the price. Nice strong motor makes quik work of both lining and shading.</li>
            <li> the toreture racks alright, and mine lasted me around 6 months,and the motor was in there crooked and the cam was out of whack,and it would toreture your ass if you want careful, because the type of machines ,don&#x27;nt pull the ink up that good and feed it bck out,it just one little stroke and it crap, I bought a nice placstic one and it s nice you can feel the motor coast when you let up of it,its smooth as homemade wine, but my opinion,if you got nice coil machines stick to them,because these 2 and 3 hundred dollar rotary machines are to much for me to invest in something I can&#x27;nt try first and the are like surfboards if you buy it and you don&#x27;nt like it ,that&#x27;s tough s*** it yours,the same with them thousands of tattoo machine out there ,you don&#x27;nt no what you are getting,they are all mostly put together over seas.but if you want a jail house tat machine the w1 t.r.&#x27;s for you.</li>
            <li> this item quickly broke...the speed and depth of needle were not what was expected and was only used twice before breaking</li>
            <li> Great little machine. Runs for long periods without heating up &amp; is very consistent &amp; quiet. Runs low power &amp; is just amazing. Any problems I have run into are a result of me not being used to how smooth &amp; easy it runs in comparison to a coil. Great buy, great machine!</li>
            <li> As other reviews stated, the machine needed a bit of tweaking, but it runs great. Rotary machines are so much smoother than the coil machines.</li>
            <li> It is ok as a liner, but there is no give, so as a shader - i don&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> Rotory Motor W1  has absolutely ZERO give BUT stays consistant at ALL speeds. If you like this model then scrap it and buy a nice Swiss Rotory for quality and features along with 5 star performance..&lt;br /&gt;For the selling price its decent to buy just to use an example of how a Rotory works and feels like. Thats about it though..</li>
            <li> This thing is a beast. Super quite and strong motor. It might be inexpensive but this sucker goes! The tube clamp did strip out but I ordered a stainless steel replacement and now its perfect. For sure buy one. It&#x27;s a neat machine.</li>
            <li> I originally ordered 1 it came from china, it ran so smooth &amp; good I decided to try another this 1 came from crazycart,&lt;br /&gt;Anyway this latest 1 i dont like as much as the 1st. Got to looking @ the cams &amp; noticed the 1st is 3mm which is good for all purpose, the latest is @ 2mm good for a liner, as far as knowing what cams do what go to worldwide tattoo supply check out the parts for stealth rotary machine, this 2nd one has a diffrent motor a little louder buzz still quieter than coil machine.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to try out a rotary tattoo machine, to compare it to the standard coils.  This was cheap enough to take a chance on, and has proven to be a reliable device so far.</li>
            <li> Gets too hot and runs inconsistently halfway through the tattoo</li>
            <li> I have 2 coil ones and they are trash, I bought this rotary one and it is awesome! I love it and will buy another one</li>
            <li> Good machine to play with if you are wondering about using a rotary.</li>
            <li> Great machine, I&#x27;m am an apprentice currently and didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money on a machine, a fellow artist friend suggested this machine, great for lining and really can pack in some heavy color as a shader as well, I will be buying several more. Great for beginners or advanced artist.</li>
            <li> This machine packs alot of power, plus it is superr silent,it is also light weight..&lt;br /&gt;I jus need to wait to see how the tattoo heals to see the actual results.. But all in all good buy so i wuld recomend</li>
            <li> great machine but you will have to adjust the cam on it but it works great i can go as low as 4v and it works fine</li>
            <li> I have not used this yet but I did set it up and tune it and it seems like a nice rotary especially for the price. Its a bit heavier of a rotary machine ,but feels very sturdy and nicely build for the price that is. It runs quiet like most rotary&#x27;s do. once I use it I will update the review as of right now I am very satisfied with this perches not much to say until I see how it will run a line.</li>
            <li> Best gun I ever bought better than n e gun I have .&lt;br /&gt;Puts ink in like a charm will buy another one.. more buying in the future.....</li>
            <li> Just as good as the name brands 90% price.</li>
            <li> When i received the package in the mail (which took a few weeks because it came from China) I was expecting to get what I paid for. a 10.00 machine.... My first thoughts on opening the package was the quality of this machine. It is very well put together! I hooked it up to the power supply and messed around with it purrs like a cat! Those annoyingly loud coil machines got to go! very quiet machine indeed! Anyway I did my first tattoo with it yesterday. With this machine and a 3 round liner i did Line work, Shading AND COLOR PACKING! I love this little machine!!!! Anyone who is considering picking up a rotary machine and not trying to hurt their wallets, this is for you!!!! may even order another one for backup. These have got to be the best clone machines!!!!!</li>
            <li> A little slower than other rotary guns I have used but still gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping, great product!!!!!!</li>
            <li> this machine came and i was impressed with it as far as looks good, sound good, and runs right out of the box. Then i read some reviews and they mentioned that it took a while 2 tune. I thought TUNE? I CAN DO THAT. so i inspected the unit only to find that there were no adjustment screws or levers or dials. so how do i tune it. Voltage? Also havn&#x27;t used it yet cause not sure how the needle ame with some instructionsgoes on....wish it c</li>
            <li> Bad buy. Did not last more than 10 tattoos max. Get the nice 10 wrap coil machines. They&#x27;re easier to replace parts too.</li>
            <li> Decent machine for the price. Have used it twice and it functions well. I like the fact it is quite and light. Recommend it.</li>
            <li> Had to make some cheapo adjustments to it, the metal bars come right out, so that wasn&#x27;t a big problem. The machine actually didn&#x27;t work when I got it, I took it apart (be careful not to lose those tiny pieces or break anything) and cut about 1/8 -1/4 inch off of the spring holding up the top bar. Also, I noticed that there was some curiosity on the &amp;#34;give&amp;#34; and what that means. Well, with a lot of rotaries you can adjust the &amp;#34;t-bar&amp;#34; to give a little more slack when the needle penetrates the skin, this one does not have that option, so when the needle hits the skin, it will penetrate the same every time, this can be good and bad. Bad in the fact that if it is not used correctly, can hamburger the skin, good in the fact that if you know what your doing, the lines will be very consistent and thick. I would say that if you are going to use it for shading, keep the power well below 8 to start out with. I have been using a rotary for a while now and honestly I liked the swashdrive whip better, I got one on here a year ago for $15, now I think they are up to $30.</li>
            <li> Use it a couple times...guess I have to get use to how light this thing is. Over all it&#x27;s a perfect liner.</li>
            <li> Only used a few times so far, works great down to 3v with liners and shaders.</li>
            <li> This machine is perfect very lightweight and quiet have run it for hours with no problems love it. I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> i have about 10 guns and i bought 2 of these and they work fantastic.. light wieght and quiet my favorite new gun...</li>
            <li> No it stop working after only use for 5 mines</li>
            <li> Worked perfect for about 2 weeks before motor I guess just stopped working. sometimes when I just try it out to see if it maybe fixed its self it didn&#x27;t so yaaaaaaa if you can fix rotarys then no problem if not stick with coils.</li>
            <li> This gun runs SOOo much quieter and smoother than my other gun. Fits the normal grips and needles and runs like a dream. I didn&#x27;t need to do anything to it I just opened it stuck a needle in and startted tattooing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done 5 hour sessions with this machine it never broke down on me, This machine packs in ink really well, although I did have to remove the two silver bars so my rubber bands could hold the needle steady. Good basic rotary until you could afford the name brands, like Stigma hyper v3</li>
            <li> For the price you really can&#x27;t beat this little rotary.Enough power for lining or shading and so easy to switch from the two.Does feel kinda awkward coming from a regular setup,but I guess that its something I could get used to. I would recommend this for any beginner for sure.</li>
            <li> This machine is worth the money. I&#x27;m still using it and have no issues with it.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for anyone who wants to try out a cheaper version of rotary&lt;br /&gt;before investing in a more expensive one.</li>
            <li> just received shipment, machine is very solid not what I expected haven&#x27;t used it yet so we&#x27;ll be coming back to write another review</li>
            <li> ordered item as a christmas gift for my wife, item arrived almost a week late but due to the fact that it was the holiday season and was coming from china i can understand. the item was as described and works well. a great machine for a great price. would buy again.</li>
            <li> Bought this machine because I wanted to try out a rotary machine without paying $$$ for the STEALTH machines.  At first I was disappointed because I received a gold one instead of black.  It wasn&#x27;t running properly at first.  Then I read reviews here about adjusting the cam.  Works like a charm now.  I&#x27;d rather use this machine than my standard coil machines for line work.  I tried it on my self and it was the most pleasant tattooing experience I had as far as pain is concerned.  Lines went in solid and smooth.  Shading was a dream.  Color gets packed in perfectly. I actually purchased a shading bearing that was meant for the STEALTH machine and it fit perfectly.  This machine is the best value for your money.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> i got this gun last week and its work perfect not heavy when you tattoo the vibrations dont mess up your lines since theres like no vibrations at all i love this gun its the best gun i ever used deff going to buy more of these im impressed</li>
            <li> Kinda skeptical at first...works good..I only use it as a shader...its quiet...im buying 2 more as backups</li>
            <li> Just got it yesterday and it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It suck it broke before I used it don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> Great Clone! Perfect! 10/10</li>
            <li> Got this for my boyfriend as a gift, and he&#x27;s been doing more tattoos lately, this is quickly becoming his favourite gun.</li>
            <li> THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST FOR COLORING! I CANT STOP LOOKING AT HOW MUCH BETTER THESE ROSES CAME OUT, THEN THE OTHERS IVE DONE WITH THE REST OF MY MACHINES. SUPER LIGHT AN QUIET. ONLY THING I COULD SAY IS A SCREW AT THE BOTTEM IS IN AT A SMALL ANGLE. BUT DOESNT SEEM TO AFECT THE MACHINE. THX</li>
            <li> i just began tattooing, I have used many art medium before. skin is damn hard to master. But, that said. This Rotary tattoo machine works fine, looks,and feels well made,and performs smoothly.</li>
            <li> it is cheaply made but for $10 its worth it  ive done two tattoos with it and actually like it  i might get one more</li>
            <li> Great little machine but when you order this also order a stealth can bearing replacement. Mine broke in original machine on second tattoo but I went with the 3mm replacement which I found on eBay and now I have done several with 20 overall in the machine I&#x27;m very sastified.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty rotatry machine. I enjoy it, smooth action and quiet!</li>
            <li> Piece of garbage. Fell apart on me. Don&#x27;t buy it. Shreds skin.</li>
            <li> Ok, so, usually, I don&#x27;t review stuff... I just don&#x27;t. But this, really deserves the review!&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I am a beginner. I only tattooed for like a year. Also, I only had just one machine through all this time... So if you read something that makes you go like &amp;#34;wtf is wrong with this guy&amp;#34;, don&#x27;t be surprised. I did not take any apprenticeship or whatever, I learned by myself.&lt;br /&gt;So, as soon as this thing arrived, I took it out of the box and went to try it out! No tuning, no nothing, straight out the box! With 4,5 voltage, 9RL needle I went ahead to work on my inner bicep piece that was kind of faded out from my last session. I though, inner bicep would be good to test out the pain level too. Now the piece is a solid black tribal, no shades, straight black.&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I started, wiped of after couple of lines I was amazed. Never before I had such a perfect amount of ink my skin. It was like drawing with a pen! I just finished working on the piece (almost 3 hours) and I completed it all! With my previous coil machine it probably would have taken me at least 5 to 6 hours! Besides, I definitely would have had to touch up or even add some more layers on top, because you can&#x27;t really stretch your skin there yourself without somebody&#x27;s help and thats why its really hard to get the right amount of ink! But not for this machine! Regarding pain, unless you are really a &amp;#34;p##sy&amp;#34;... lol but really, I almost did not feel a thing! And there was almost no blood!&lt;br /&gt;I forgot to mention, I did both lining and shading at the same speed with the same needle... now that&#x27;s something that decent artists might flame me for... but, whatever! I am happy! lol&lt;br /&gt;With this machine I will definitely get to learn shading... Not the shading shading, but giving the shades, like cloud effect (i don&#x27;t know how its called).&lt;br /&gt;So yea, if you are like me, get this machine!!! Your skill will improve right away! If you are a decent artist, get it also! You probablygonna fall in love with it! I will definitely order couple more!</li>
            <li> The seller shipped it out and it arrived early but the machine vibrates really bad so it you plan on useing it your hands will fall asleep and its really loud and annoying if you want a cheap quiet rotary i would suggest one of the ones that have word tattoo machine on the side and a skull with a hat... cheap quiet and low vibration i have about 80 hours on one so it was worth the ten bucks.</li>
