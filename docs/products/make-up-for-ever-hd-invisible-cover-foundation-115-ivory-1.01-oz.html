            <li>It&#x27;s the best foundation I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>Best makeup I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>It is the best foundation that I have ever used!  </li>
            <li>What was otherwise the perfect formula for me had to be abandoned because of the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Very great product tho</li>
            <li>I have the makeup forever foundation in 115 Ivory, and my hairstylist raved about this product saying how it made her blemishes disappear and that it also covered her freckles and that it was the best foundation she&#x27;d ever use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a dewy finish and your skin does look better in pictures and video!!!</li>
            <li>Made my skin look flawless and beautiful, but after a week every pore was clogged.</li>
            <li>Good luck!</li>
            <li>It makes me feel beautiful</li>
            <li>my skin looks beautiful,</li>
            <li>I can say that it went on beautifully</li>
            <li>you have perfect/normal/dry skin, this will probably be great for you.</li>
            <li>yes, this will even it out and look great.  </li>
            <li>Great coverage foundation.  </li>
            <li>For example, MAC&#x27;s concealer works great with this, but I found Clinique&#x27;s concealer to clump onto any flakiness I have on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Great for me because I have drier skin.</li>
            <li>Great product but</li>
            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>I know it is a very popular foundation, and lots of people rave about it.</li>
            <li>The formulation is very nice.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard nothing but amazing reviews for this product, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a very good foundation for oily/combination skin.</li>
            <li>Great coverage, it lasts for a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>I have considerate acne and always try to find the foundation with the best coverage that won&#x27;t make me break out more.</li>
            <li>:) Lightweight with awesome coverage.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product because it covers perfectly, blends amazingly</li>
            <li>I still use a good concealer where i break out</li>
            <li>price is fair for the quality and quantity of the product.</li>
            <li>I can pat the oil off with a kleenex or add a bit of powder, and it still looks good for the rest of the day.  </li>
            <li>Here are the steps to finding a good foundation that looks like SKIN, not like foundation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have fair, freckled, oily skin.</li>
            <li>but you can combat this with a good primer.</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t getting good results, try a moisturizer that is creamier to see if that helps&lt;br</li>
            <li>This looks the most beautiful when applied with a moist beauty blender.</li>
            <li>Your skin will look amazing if you are fair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing product and</li>
            <li>I get amazing wear out of this product, though.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Having said that about the price from this seller, this makeup is amazing.</li>
            <li>but in a good way :) Your face isn&#x27;t too shiny nor too matte.</li>
            <li>IT DOES LOOK LIKE YOUR OWN</li>
            <li>It does not go on matte and already has a nice glow, but give it an hour or so</li>
            <li>some have rose undertones.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m kind of on the fence with this product...</li>
            <li>I can honestly rave about.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying drugstore foundations in search of my perfect color and formula match since I was in high school in the 90&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I had used every drugstore brand out there and some high end brands, and this is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>This is a great foundation with medium to full coverage.</li>
            <li>as an additional note: This makeup comes off fairly easy with a good cleanser and makeup remover.</li>
            <li>Very recommended!It makes my skin look very good</li>
            <li>I get around 6 hours of flawless coverage before I get a bit of oil breaking through, but I have a fairly oily forehead and nose, so your results may be different if you are drier or more oily than me.  </li>
            <li>This make up line is loved by make up artists because it makes the skin look smooth and poreless.</li>
            <li>I decided to buy this HD foundation after reading such amazing reviews on it and how it looks flawless.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many foundations and this was by far the best for my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the most important pro for me after a good coverage is that it is lightweight...</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t seem to go on very smoothly for me.</li>
            <li>When I use it with Amazing Cosmetics Concealer it seems to do a pretty good job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this makeup.</li>
            <li>Love this foundation.  </li>
            <li>I am sure that I saved almost twenty dollars from buying it from Amazon, too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this product and</li>
            <li>And believe me, I&#x27;ve tried many drugstore foundations but nothing seems to compare.</li>
            <li>and i want to purchase more products from this brand.</li>
            <li>Hope it helped :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are MANY fakes being sold on amazon</li>
            <li>I prefer a more matte finish also, but my skin looked healthy when covered by it and felt healthy under it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind spending a bit of money on makeup, especially on one that promises to make your face look flawless.</li>
            <li>I love this foundation.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.</li>
            <li>and I have to say I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>HD was always on the top 5!!!&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Definitely the best foundation I have used.</li>
            <li>We love it.  </li>
            <li>It does tend to break my skin out from time to time but overall it&#x27;s an EXCELLENT foundation.  </li>
            <li>MUFE&#x27;s HD  Foundation is perfect for covering up not only my scarring, but also my under-eye darkness, and any redness I have in the morning.  </li>
            <li>At $53 a bottle, I expect that it will be a better quality product than what I buy at the drug store, but I&#x27;m better off with Maybelline.</li>
            <li>You need to have many brands at your disposal</li>
            <li>If they act goofy when you ask for a sample, WHO CARES.  </li>
            <li>If they act goofy when you ask for a sample, WHO CARES.  </li>
            <li>It is ok</li>
            <li>I have tried most of the foundations in the market, none of them have been able to match my skin tone.</li>
            <li>A friend of mine recommended this HD foundation to me and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I am really glad I did.</li>
            <li>Make sure you have well hydrated skin to start</li>
            <li>After a time I started to notice it more and more and started to get headaches throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I have had others that have come off better, but I consider this a longer-staying makeup.</li>
            <li>in all, I love this makeup.</li>
            <li>:) Hopefully this information helped those who are considering it.</li>
            <li>I love this foundation.</li>
            <li>I do suggest it, but for me it&#x27;s just a foundation and not my favorite foundation or one</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of my favorite foundations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>am in love with this foundation.</li>
            <li>yup sry need more words</li>
            <li>Any woman knows there&#x27;s no \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; foundation (with flawless coverage, a light feel, and a long stay), but this is the best I&#x27;ve found so far (and I have tried HUNDREDS).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice medium to full coverage foundation, but there are better for the price.  </li>
            <li>This foundation covers my skin flawlessly, meaning no cakey-ness, the kind that I&#x27;ve experienced with Mac Foundations, and an overall coverage of my skins freckles and red spots without making me look too</li>
            <li>I have a lot of old acne marks which it does cover beautifully, but it doesn&#x27;t cover the handful of blemishes I always seem to have.</li>
            <li>This is great and does cover pretty well, but I don&#x27;t feel that it&#x27;s full coverage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really not that impressed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a nice sparkle, shine to this foundation that makes my skin look fresh and</li>
            <li>Very light and full coverage.  </li>
            <li>It lasts me easily through an 8 hour work day, as well as a night out on the town.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply and blend&lt;br</li>
            <li>I strongly suggest powdering/setting if you have oily skin.  </li>
            <li>It is the best I have had so far in regards to my own personal skin type and shades.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to a friend ... if my friends weren&#x27;t beautifully California tanned...</li>
            <li>I have tried fingertips, flat brush, stippling brushes and found I was most happy with the beauty blender for even coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like I said, it looked flawless when first applied on me and the coverage is definitely buildable.</li>
            <li>The only positive is that the color matches my skin perfectly (I use the 127).  </li>
            <li>&quot; is a huge compliment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This foundation is so smooth and complementary to my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Feels so light when applying.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a few excellent matches over the years, but it seems like as soon as I find one</li>
            <li>I apply it with my fingertips, but feel free to use a foundation brush to blend into the skin as well.</li>
            <li>While the foundation does match my skin tone and it is light weight it lacks in coverage and can tend to maximize problem areas ( can be corrected with a primer or pore refiner).  </li>
            <li>It has medium to full coverage, leaning more on the full coverage side.</li>
            <li>This is a really good foundation, make sure you are color matched prior to purchasing it.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>I went to Sephora and color matched my skin so that I was sure that I was getting the right shade.  </li>
            <li>i use Korres vitamin E primer, but there are many other great primers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It blends beautifully onto my skin, although if you have dry patchy skin this formula will cling to imperfections and blemishes.</li>
            <li>It covers dark spots flawlessly and makes skin look fresh, not cakey.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light-diffusing technology makes your skin look overall amazing in pictures!  </li>
            <li>Originally I bought it at Sephora with the help of a salesperson who helped me pick the color.</li>
            <li>This makeup seemed ok at first with sufficient coverage and look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard so many great things about this foundation, but I really didn&#x27;t see what the big deal was.  </li>
            <li>My skin at the end of my work day looks still radiant and that is a lot considering that many times I am running around doing errands in the hot and unpredicatable weather of Florida.</li>
            <li>This product made my skin super oily and made my pores look huge</li>
            <li>I have fair skin; made me look white and pasty.  </li>
            <li>(i use the makeup forever full coverage concealer) and my skin looks amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Make no joke about it, this stuff is seriously full coverage.  </li>
            <li>Last a good 8 hours and atleast for me didn&#x27;t lead to any breakouts.</li>
            <li>I decided not to order from Amazon&#x27;s sellers...too many counterfeits and if I&#x27;m paying this much for something it had better be real.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally pair it with a concealer, and yet I feel confident enough to leave the house and feel good about my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>recently went to Sephora for some help, and after testing many foundations, this is the one I fell in love with.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a new foundation after using mineral make-up for many years.  </li>
            <li>Flawless dewy finish and long lasting.</li>
            <li>This product is not only great in covering up but also light enough to allow you to breathe and not feel like you are piling up the makeup.</li>
            <li>Looks fresh all day.</li>
            <li>well worth the money.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a sheer foundation and stays on even when you work in a humid warm environment as I do.</li>
            <li>GO FIND A NATURAL LIGHT SOURCE!</li>
            <li>I thought this would look more natural but looked cakey to me.</li>
            <li>this is the right foundation for you.</li>
            <li>I find that I do mix it with another foundation of mine just to get the right color for my skin.  </li>
            <li>My issue is that I can never find a light weight make up with decent coverage that will match my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>Silicone and fragrance, however, are two ingredients that can often set off acne prone and sensitive skin, so the only thing one can do is try samples first, as only you know what is best for your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found that this pinky shade was best for my super pale, pink undertone-having skin.  </li>
            <li>This foundations gives exceptional coverages without even slightly looking cakey.</li>
            <li>I have pretty bad-looking skin, so I apply one layer, wait about 20 seconds, then apply another layer.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m willing to bet that you can just toss this on and go without any issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Look at your face in natural light.  </li>
            <li>The finish to this is smooth and natural, and also photo-compatible.  </li>
            <li>I find this makeup is a bit difficult to layer without losing that flawless finish.</li>
            <li>Tired of being let down by beautiful advertisements promising gorgeous skin?</li>
            <li>Due to the headaches I got from this, I had to stop using the product despite the fact that I liked the formula otherwise.hes, sponges, and my fingertips, and all have worked well.    </li>
            <li>It really was so promising!</li>
            <li>Nice finish that isn&#x27;t too shiny but also not dry (as long as you pick the right moisturizer - see below)&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin does not like sillicone in large quantities.  </li>
            <li>My skin does not like sillicone in large quantities.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve fought large pores and acne scars my whole life, and for me to claim I look \\&quot;airbrushed\\</li>
            <li>They all go together very well and are exactly what you want for a cost this high.</li>
            <li>He is a very good liquid foundation, very thin, but there are certain Concealer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light and sheer on your face and doesn&#x27;t create oiliness.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It is very breathable.</li>
            <li>It was really embarrassing as I was still mid-shopping trip...</li>
            <li>very even once I apply this make up.</li>
            <li>They really know hat they are doing</li>
            <li>The coverage is fantastic and it lasts all day (especially if you use the finishing powder from sephora as well).  </li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li>It arrived really fast</li>
            <li>Too much of a difference to pay just for convenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All I can say is I expected better.</li>
            <li>It is not too heavy on silicone, which give that nice velvety feel, but tend to go greasy on me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably much better for people who like a dewy look with normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li>It took my natural color right out of my face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many foundations but after using this, I wouldn&#x27;t buy any other foundation again.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was that it felt much lighter than my old drug store foundation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve heard that they&#x27;re reformulating and the new formula will be out in July 2015 so depending on when you&#x27;re reading this, my review is of the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; formulation available prior to that date.</li>
            <li>I will only save this foundation for special occasions where photos will be taken.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be afraid that you don&#x27;t get the perfect color for your skin tone, because it looks anyway very natural.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin look fabulous and it lasts all day long.</li>
            <li>although I agree that $40 is a lot to pay for foundation, this is the only foundation I&#x27;ve found that gives me that even and full coverage.</li>
            <li>It is very pigmented and long lasting, especially with a good primer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that Revlon Colorstay is a better foundation for a much less price tag.</li>
            <li>I have used so many different foundations for my skin and usually by mid day you have to touch up because of the wearing off.</li>
            <li>I bought this product mainly because Kim Kardashian uses this as one of her to-go products.</li>
            <li>Easy to choose your level of coverage, and still looks natural if you put more in certain areas and less (or none) in other areas</li>
            <li>It cost a little more than others but this is a great product, sorry tried the others and they don&#x27;t even come close.</li>
            <li>(I have combination skin, but not oily on the level this product caused on a normal day).  </li>
            <li>but it does live up to all the hype.</li>
            <li>Goes on even and looks very natural.</li>
            <li>As I am also one with very sensitive and acne-prone skin, I have found that this makeup does not break me out.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;m going to keep using it because it&#x27;s pretty pricey, but I might try their matte liquid foundation next.</li>
            <li>Pair it with concealer (only if necessary) and top with a very sheer dusting of powder for maximum hold-power throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>This foundation is really great for my skin ( oily, pale, and prone to small breakouts).</li>
            <li>It offers coverage that is just short of full coverage, covering what needs to be covered without looking mask-like and flat.  </li>
            <li>Three words: Invisible, natural coverage.  </li>
            <li>This not only arrived 4 days after purchase but is the real deal.</li>
            <li>) Get a sample that you can try it for at least 3-4 days or more.  </li>
            <li>Get a sample that you can try it for at least 3-4 days or more.  </li>
            <li>its not heavy or cakey.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone likes a natural medium coverage look without cakey.</li>
            <li>Guessing the color may not work very well as some of the shades have yellow and</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to fragrance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since started using Laura Mercier Silk Creme, which I personally feel is a very comparable formula with no fragrance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My concern in switching to a more traditional foundation was that it would feel heavy or cause problems with blocked pores, but I don&#x27;t know that I have this on and have had no problems with breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>if it is the wrong color- will look good on you.  </li>
            <li>If only it didn&#x27;t come with the high end price tag!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me, with acne scarring (or even current breakouts), or splotchy/uneven skin, I highly recommend this foundation.</li>
            <li>Be careful not to use too much, and to let your moisturizer/primer set and dry before you put this on or it can make you appear pretty oily.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to fragrance in many products and it&#x27;s worse when it&#x27;s on my face.</li>
            <li>I am also one with very sensitive and acne-prone skin, I have found that this makeup does not break me out, although I do use a primer, so that likely helps to keep the makeup from clogging my pores throughout the day.</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a very long way and the pump-top applicator makes this easy to achieve.  </li>
            <li>One bottle lasts forever - I&#x27;ve barely made a dent in two months!&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I could barely see my freckles</li>
            <li>/&gt;You only need a small amount for full coverage, long-lasting, matte finish foundation.</li>
            <li>Back to Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li>I had tried Bare Minerals a while back, but my skin broke out and did not react well to the mineral make up.  </li>
            <li>it does not look cakey on skin or dries up in patches like other high end foundations I have tried.</li>
            <li>If you have dry, clear skin then</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this is a good foundation, but it is not worth the price.</li>
            <li>Still, I find that even with my rosacea, this makeup does very well to even out my skin tone, and I just apply one coat, sometimes with a little bit of concealer.</li>
            <li>Not that it&#x27;s a bad foundation, it&#x27;s got good coverage and doesn&#x27;t look like you&#x27;re wearing any, but I got the same effect from Revlon Photoready for a quarter of the price.</li>

            <li> MUFE HD in 115 is MY perfect match, but it might not be yours.the transition from face to neck is seamless.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>

            <li> it matches my skin tone perfectly.</li>
            <li> Best foundation I have used to date!  </li>

            <li> and I was very happy with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best foundation I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> Best makeup I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> It is the best foundation that I have ever used!  </li>
            <li> What was otherwise the perfect formula for me had to be abandoned because of the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Very great product tho</li>
            <li> I have the makeup forever foundation in 115 Ivory, and my hairstylist raved about this product saying how it made her blemishes disappear and that it also covered her freckles and that it was the best foundation she&#x27;d ever use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a dewy finish and your skin does look better in pictures and video!!!</li>
            <li> Made my skin look flawless and beautiful, but after a week every pore was clogged.</li>
            <li> Good luck!</li>
            <li> It makes me feel beautiful</li>
            <li> my skin looks beautiful,</li>
            <li> I can say that it went on beautifully</li>
            <li> you have perfect/normal/dry skin, this will probably be great for you.</li>
            <li> yes, this will even it out and look great.  </li>
            <li> Great coverage foundation.  </li>
            <li> For example, MAC&#x27;s concealer works great with this, but I found Clinique&#x27;s concealer to clump onto any flakiness I have on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Great for me because I have drier skin.</li>
            <li> Great product but</li>
            <li> Love it!!</li>
            <li> I know it is a very popular foundation, and lots of people rave about it.</li>
            <li> The formulation is very nice.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard nothing but amazing reviews for this product, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a very good foundation for oily/combination skin.</li>
            <li> Great coverage, it lasts for a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> I have considerate acne and always try to find the foundation with the best coverage that won&#x27;t make me break out more.</li>
            <li> :) Lightweight with awesome coverage.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product because it covers perfectly, blends amazingly</li>
            <li> I still use a good concealer where i break out</li>
            <li> price is fair for the quality and quantity of the product.</li>
            <li> I can pat the oil off with a kleenex or add a bit of powder, and it still looks good for the rest of the day.  </li>
            <li> Here are the steps to finding a good foundation that looks like SKIN, not like foundation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have fair, freckled, oily skin.</li>
            <li> but you can combat this with a good primer.</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t getting good results, try a moisturizer that is creamier to see if that helps&lt;br</li>
            <li> This looks the most beautiful when applied with a moist beauty blender.</li>
            <li> Your skin will look amazing if you are fair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product and</li>
            <li> I get amazing wear out of this product, though.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Having said that about the price from this seller, this makeup is amazing.</li>
            <li> but in a good way :) Your face isn&#x27;t too shiny nor too matte.</li>
            <li> IT DOES LOOK LIKE YOUR OWN</li>
            <li> It does not go on matte and already has a nice glow, but give it an hour or so</li>
            <li> some have rose undertones.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m kind of on the fence with this product...</li>
            <li> I can honestly rave about.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying drugstore foundations in search of my perfect color and formula match since I was in high school in the 90&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I had used every drugstore brand out there and some high end brands, and this is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This is a great foundation with medium to full coverage.</li>
            <li> as an additional note: This makeup comes off fairly easy with a good cleanser and makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Very recommended!It makes my skin look very good</li>
            <li> I get around 6 hours of flawless coverage before I get a bit of oil breaking through, but I have a fairly oily forehead and nose, so your results may be different if you are drier or more oily than me.  </li>
            <li> This make up line is loved by make up artists because it makes the skin look smooth and poreless.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this HD foundation after reading such amazing reviews on it and how it looks flawless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many foundations and this was by far the best for my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the most important pro for me after a good coverage is that it is lightweight...</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to go on very smoothly for me.</li>
            <li> When I use it with Amazing Cosmetics Concealer it seems to do a pretty good job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup.</li>
            <li> Love this foundation.  </li>
            <li> I am sure that I saved almost twenty dollars from buying it from Amazon, too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product and</li>
            <li> And believe me, I&#x27;ve tried many drugstore foundations but nothing seems to compare.</li>
            <li> and i want to purchase more products from this brand.</li>
            <li> Hope it helped :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are MANY fakes being sold on amazon</li>
            <li> I prefer a more matte finish also, but my skin looked healthy when covered by it and felt healthy under it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind spending a bit of money on makeup, especially on one that promises to make your face look flawless.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.</li>
            <li> and I have to say I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> HD was always on the top 5!!!&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Definitely the best foundation I have used.</li>
            <li> We love it.  </li>
            <li> It does tend to break my skin out from time to time but overall it&#x27;s an EXCELLENT foundation.  </li>
            <li> MUFE&#x27;s HD  Foundation is perfect for covering up not only my scarring, but also my under-eye darkness, and any redness I have in the morning.  </li>
            <li> At $53 a bottle, I expect that it will be a better quality product than what I buy at the drug store, but I&#x27;m better off with Maybelline.</li>
            <li> You need to have many brands at your disposal</li>
            <li> If they act goofy when you ask for a sample, WHO CARES.  </li>
            <li> If they act goofy when you ask for a sample, WHO CARES.  </li>
            <li> It is ok</li>
            <li> I have tried most of the foundations in the market, none of them have been able to match my skin tone.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine recommended this HD foundation to me and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I am really glad I did.</li>
            <li> Make sure you have well hydrated skin to start</li>
            <li> After a time I started to notice it more and more and started to get headaches throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I have had others that have come off better, but I consider this a longer-staying makeup.</li>
            <li> in all, I love this makeup.</li>
            <li> :) Hopefully this information helped those who are considering it.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation.</li>
            <li> I do suggest it, but for me it&#x27;s just a foundation and not my favorite foundation or one</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of my favorite foundations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> am in love with this foundation.</li>
            <li> yup sry need more words</li>
            <li> Any woman knows there&#x27;s no \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; foundation (with flawless coverage, a light feel, and a long stay), but this is the best I&#x27;ve found so far (and I have tried HUNDREDS).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice medium to full coverage foundation, but there are better for the price.  </li>
            <li> This foundation covers my skin flawlessly, meaning no cakey-ness, the kind that I&#x27;ve experienced with Mac Foundations, and an overall coverage of my skins freckles and red spots without making me look too</li>
            <li> I have a lot of old acne marks which it does cover beautifully, but it doesn&#x27;t cover the handful of blemishes I always seem to have.</li>
            <li> This is great and does cover pretty well, but I don&#x27;t feel that it&#x27;s full coverage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not that impressed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a nice sparkle, shine to this foundation that makes my skin look fresh and</li>
            <li> Very light and full coverage.  </li>
            <li> It lasts me easily through an 8 hour work day, as well as a night out on the town.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply and blend&lt;br</li>
            <li> I strongly suggest powdering/setting if you have oily skin.  </li>
            <li> It is the best I have had so far in regards to my own personal skin type and shades.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to a friend ... if my friends weren&#x27;t beautifully California tanned...</li>
            <li> I have tried fingertips, flat brush, stippling brushes and found I was most happy with the beauty blender for even coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like I said, it looked flawless when first applied on me and the coverage is definitely buildable.</li>
            <li> The only positive is that the color matches my skin perfectly (I use the 127).  </li>
            <li> &quot; is a huge compliment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This foundation is so smooth and complementary to my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Feels so light when applying.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few excellent matches over the years, but it seems like as soon as I find one</li>
            <li> I apply it with my fingertips, but feel free to use a foundation brush to blend into the skin as well.</li>
            <li> While the foundation does match my skin tone and it is light weight it lacks in coverage and can tend to maximize problem areas ( can be corrected with a primer or pore refiner).  </li>
            <li> It has medium to full coverage, leaning more on the full coverage side.</li>
            <li> This is a really good foundation, make sure you are color matched prior to purchasing it.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I went to Sephora and color matched my skin so that I was sure that I was getting the right shade.  </li>
            <li> i use Korres vitamin E primer, but there are many other great primers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It blends beautifully onto my skin, although if you have dry patchy skin this formula will cling to imperfections and blemishes.</li>
            <li> It covers dark spots flawlessly and makes skin look fresh, not cakey.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light-diffusing technology makes your skin look overall amazing in pictures!  </li>
            <li> Originally I bought it at Sephora with the help of a salesperson who helped me pick the color.</li>
            <li> This makeup seemed ok at first with sufficient coverage and look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard so many great things about this foundation, but I really didn&#x27;t see what the big deal was.  </li>
            <li> My skin at the end of my work day looks still radiant and that is a lot considering that many times I am running around doing errands in the hot and unpredicatable weather of Florida.</li>
            <li> This product made my skin super oily and made my pores look huge</li>
            <li> I have fair skin; made me look white and pasty.  </li>
            <li> (i use the makeup forever full coverage concealer) and my skin looks amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Make no joke about it, this stuff is seriously full coverage.  </li>
            <li> Last a good 8 hours and atleast for me didn&#x27;t lead to any breakouts.</li>
            <li> I decided not to order from Amazon&#x27;s sellers...too many counterfeits and if I&#x27;m paying this much for something it had better be real.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally pair it with a concealer, and yet I feel confident enough to leave the house and feel good about my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> recently went to Sephora for some help, and after testing many foundations, this is the one I fell in love with.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a new foundation after using mineral make-up for many years.  </li>
            <li> Flawless dewy finish and long lasting.</li>
            <li> This product is not only great in covering up but also light enough to allow you to breathe and not feel like you are piling up the makeup.</li>
            <li> Looks fresh all day.</li>
            <li> well worth the money.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a sheer foundation and stays on even when you work in a humid warm environment as I do.</li>
            <li> GO FIND A NATURAL LIGHT SOURCE!</li>
            <li> I thought this would look more natural but looked cakey to me.</li>
            <li> this is the right foundation for you.</li>
            <li> I find that I do mix it with another foundation of mine just to get the right color for my skin.  </li>
            <li> My issue is that I can never find a light weight make up with decent coverage that will match my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> Silicone and fragrance, however, are two ingredients that can often set off acne prone and sensitive skin, so the only thing one can do is try samples first, as only you know what is best for your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found that this pinky shade was best for my super pale, pink undertone-having skin.  </li>
            <li> This foundations gives exceptional coverages without even slightly looking cakey.</li>
            <li> I have pretty bad-looking skin, so I apply one layer, wait about 20 seconds, then apply another layer.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m willing to bet that you can just toss this on and go without any issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Look at your face in natural light.  </li>
            <li> The finish to this is smooth and natural, and also photo-compatible.  </li>
            <li> I find this makeup is a bit difficult to layer without losing that flawless finish.</li>
            <li> Tired of being let down by beautiful advertisements promising gorgeous skin?</li>
            <li> Due to the headaches I got from this, I had to stop using the product despite the fact that I liked the formula otherwise.hes, sponges, and my fingertips, and all have worked well.    </li>
            <li> It really was so promising!</li>
            <li> Nice finish that isn&#x27;t too shiny but also not dry (as long as you pick the right moisturizer - see below)&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin does not like sillicone in large quantities.  </li>
            <li> My skin does not like sillicone in large quantities.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve fought large pores and acne scars my whole life, and for me to claim I look \\&quot;airbrushed\\</li>
            <li> They all go together very well and are exactly what you want for a cost this high.</li>
            <li> He is a very good liquid foundation, very thin, but there are certain Concealer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so light and sheer on your face and doesn&#x27;t create oiliness.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It is very breathable.</li>
            <li> It was really embarrassing as I was still mid-shopping trip...</li>
            <li> very even once I apply this make up.</li>
            <li> They really know hat they are doing</li>
            <li> The coverage is fantastic and it lasts all day (especially if you use the finishing powder from sephora as well).  </li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> It arrived really fast</li>
            <li> Too much of a difference to pay just for convenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All I can say is I expected better.</li>
            <li> It is not too heavy on silicone, which give that nice velvety feel, but tend to go greasy on me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably much better for people who like a dewy look with normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li> It took my natural color right out of my face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many foundations but after using this, I wouldn&#x27;t buy any other foundation again.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was that it felt much lighter than my old drug store foundation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard that they&#x27;re reformulating and the new formula will be out in July 2015 so depending on when you&#x27;re reading this, my review is of the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; formulation available prior to that date.</li>
            <li> I will only save this foundation for special occasions where photos will be taken.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid that you don&#x27;t get the perfect color for your skin tone, because it looks anyway very natural.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin look fabulous and it lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> although I agree that $40 is a lot to pay for foundation, this is the only foundation I&#x27;ve found that gives me that even and full coverage.</li>
            <li> It is very pigmented and long lasting, especially with a good primer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that Revlon Colorstay is a better foundation for a much less price tag.</li>
            <li> I have used so many different foundations for my skin and usually by mid day you have to touch up because of the wearing off.</li>
            <li> I bought this product mainly because Kim Kardashian uses this as one of her to-go products.</li>
            <li> Easy to choose your level of coverage, and still looks natural if you put more in certain areas and less (or none) in other areas</li>
            <li> It cost a little more than others but this is a great product, sorry tried the others and they don&#x27;t even come close.</li>
            <li> (I have combination skin, but not oily on the level this product caused on a normal day).  </li>
            <li> but it does live up to all the hype.</li>
            <li> Goes on even and looks very natural.</li>
            <li> As I am also one with very sensitive and acne-prone skin, I have found that this makeup does not break me out.  </li>
            <li> As I am also one with very sensitive and acne-prone skin, I have found that this makeup does not break me out.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to keep using it because it&#x27;s pretty pricey, but I might try their matte liquid foundation next.</li>
            <li> Pair it with concealer (only if necessary) and top with a very sheer dusting of powder for maximum hold-power throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> This foundation is really great for my skin ( oily, pale, and prone to small breakouts).</li>
            <li> It offers coverage that is just short of full coverage, covering what needs to be covered without looking mask-like and flat.  </li>
            <li> Three words: Invisible, natural coverage.  </li>
            <li> This not only arrived 4 days after purchase but is the real deal.</li>
            <li> ) Get a sample that you can try it for at least 3-4 days or more.  </li>
            <li> Get a sample that you can try it for at least 3-4 days or more.  </li>
            <li> its not heavy or cakey.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone likes a natural medium coverage look without cakey.</li>
            <li> Guessing the color may not work very well as some of the shades have yellow and</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since started using Laura Mercier Silk Creme, which I personally feel is a very comparable formula with no fragrance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My concern in switching to a more traditional foundation was that it would feel heavy or cause problems with blocked pores, but I don&#x27;t know that I have this on and have had no problems with breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> if it is the wrong color- will look good on you.  </li>
            <li> If only it didn&#x27;t come with the high end price tag!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, with acne scarring (or even current breakouts), or splotchy/uneven skin, I highly recommend this foundation.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to use too much, and to let your moisturizer/primer set and dry before you put this on or it can make you appear pretty oily.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to fragrance in many products and it&#x27;s worse when it&#x27;s on my face.</li>
            <li> I am also one with very sensitive and acne-prone skin, I have found that this makeup does not break me out, although I do use a primer, so that likely helps to keep the makeup from clogging my pores throughout the day.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a very long way and the pump-top applicator makes this easy to achieve.  </li>
            <li> One bottle lasts forever - I&#x27;ve barely made a dent in two months!&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I could barely see my freckles</li>
            <li> /&gt;You only need a small amount for full coverage, long-lasting, matte finish foundation.</li>
            <li> Back to Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li> I had tried Bare Minerals a while back, but my skin broke out and did not react well to the mineral make up.  </li>
            <li> it does not look cakey on skin or dries up in patches like other high end foundations I have tried.</li>
            <li> If you have dry, clear skin then</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this is a good foundation, but it is not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Still, I find that even with my rosacea, this makeup does very well to even out my skin tone, and I just apply one coat, sometimes with a little bit of concealer.</li>
            <li> Not that it&#x27;s a bad foundation, it&#x27;s got good coverage and doesn&#x27;t look like you&#x27;re wearing any, but I got the same effect from Revlon Photoready for a quarter of the price.</li>
            <li> You are better off buying in a store if you are not sure what you are buying because the seller does not stand behind their product and is completely non-responsive.  </li>
            <li> Bottle is well designed so you can get small or large amounts out</li>
            <li> Being such a pale lady, I have a really hard time finding a light foundation.</li>
            <li> Overall, it does have medium coverage and stays on for a very long time</li>
            <li> so spending this much money on a foundation was a hard splurge)</li>
            <li> and it stays like that for a long time.</li>
            <li> It is long wearing, but does sink into wrinkles, even after setting it with powder.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, I&#x27;d consider it a medium coverage, not completely &amp;#34;full&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could wear a lighter foundation with less coverage, but I have recent acne scarring that leaves me with dark spots on my cheeks and near my chin.  </li>
            <li> As I have read several reviews for other cosmetic/beauty items here on Amazon</li>
            <li> Hello everyone,    I am using foundation for a very long time</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin or break me out, but I do pair it with a moisturizer that I use about 10 minutes before application.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;  If your skin is dry, it can exacerbate the problem.</li>
            <li> so I went to sephora to check it out after becoming unhappy with my clinique foundation sliding off my face halfway though the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to drop some money on something that I wear every day, which is why I invest some money into my makeup ;however, I was spending unnecessary money.</li>
            <li> And this little bottle does last me like 5 months.</li>
            <li> Now people who have freckles know how much of a bother they can be and how hard it is to actually find a foundation that will cover them suckers up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite expensive, but worth the money.</li>
            <li> I do not wear any other products other than Makeupforever, YSL and Nars.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> Preferably, one foundation on one side of your face,  and another on the other side, so you can compare the colors.  </li>
            <li> The pump bottle is sanitary unlike other foundations where you dip your fingers into a pot of makeup.</li>
            <li> In the winter I have to be very careful</li>
            <li> ; I usually set it with my old MAC Studio Fix pressed powder to absorb some of it, but it seems a little redundant (I wanted to replace it, not use both).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had foundations either be wayyyyy to dark for my skin, or oxidize and turn orange half way through my day.</li>
            <li> Other than that, don&#x27;t waste your $.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have combination skin (I really don&#x27;t think my skin is even THAT oily) and this foundation was running down my face within the hour!</li>
            <li> I have olive undertones, as I am half Italian and a quarter Greek so finding a foundation to match my skin tone is difficult.  </li>
            <li> .. and don&#x27;t use powder after applying this foundation because it can mess up with the invisible hd effect.</li>
            <li> I find it to look cakey, even when I apply just a little.</li>
            <li> I would elope to Vegas with it if I could and have little HD foundation babies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A few friends and a Sephora makeup artist recommended this foundation to me.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been sold a few -</li>
            <li> MUFE HD had these promises based on reviews, but for me, I wasted $45.  </li>
            <li> This is heavy foundation and is not for everyone.  </li>
            <li> I like to try a foundation for a few days</li>
            <li> I like to try a foundation for a few days</li>
            <li> It ranges from a medium to heavy build-able coverage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit expensive for foundation, but as I mentioned above it lasts a while&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I will purchase this again or if I&#x27;ll try Lorac/Chanel.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m usually a drug store beauty buyer</li>
            <li> you do pair this with a concealer, try out several brands, as I think the wrong combination starts to look cakey.  </li>
            <li> Look no more.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed, because I really really wanted it to be all it was cracked up to be, but I&#x27;ll stick with Revlon I guess.</li>
            <li> Arrived about 10 days past the day it was supposed to and was late for Christmas</li>
            <li> I hardly ever have to touch it up</li>
            <li> Biggest complaint for me is the fragrance.</li>
            <li> really, really slow shipping.  </li>
            <li> but after an hour I was shocked to find that the makeup barely lasted an hour.</li>
            <li> and i have tried a bunch of products (from cheep drugstores cosmetics to really expensive ones ).</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to try this foundation</li>
            <li> Maybe the wrong co,or for my skin.</li>
            <li> Sorry for the length!</li>
            <li> Now I wouldn&#x27;t be so mad if it was some foundation I bought at Walgreens, but this was a $56.00 foundation.</li>
            <li> Are you sick of being disappointed by your liquid foundation?</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> Very disappointing for the cost...</li>
            <li> Very unhappy.</li>
            <li> However, the fact that I have to apply and reapply powder throughout the day is incredibly annoying.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t go on evenly, even with a base and primer.</li>
            <li> THis product is garbage and looks horrible.- :</li>
            <li> product is HORRIBLE.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried this brand before, but decided to give it a whirl. I&#x27;m so glad I did. This foundation is so smooth and complementary to my skin tone. Love it.</li>
            <li> Feels so light when applying.  Coverage is excellent.  Looks fresh all day. I love this makeup.</li>
            <li> Love this foundation.  It&#x27;s so light and sheer on your face and doesn&#x27;t create oiliness.  It&#x27;s a must buy!&lt;br /&gt;Visit my video review/swatch at this link! [...]</li>
            <li> This is the best foundation I have ever had. Great coverage, it lasts for a good amount of time. It has medium to full coverage, leaning more on the full coverage side. It is very pigmented and long lasting, especially with a good primer. I hardly ever have to touch it up and I cant beat the price on Amazon either. I was worried about ordering online without knowing my color but it was perfect! I went on the makeup forever website and looked through all of the colors and I chose this one. I am sure that I saved almost twenty dollars from buying it from Amazon, too. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this foundation for years. The first thing I noticed was that it felt much lighter than my old drug store foundation. It is very breathable. Also it blends well. The color works well for me. Originally I bought it at Sephora with the help of a salesperson who helped me pick the color. I recommend others to do the same.</li>
            <li> Three words: Invisible, natural coverage.  This foundations gives exceptional coverages without even slightly looking cakey. It&#x27;s an amazing product and well worth the money. Vast shade selection, too.</li>
            <li> A few friends and a Sephora makeup artist recommended this foundation to me. I know it is a very popular foundation, and lots of people rave about it. It really was so promising! Being such a pale lady, I have a really hard time finding a light foundation. The ivory was a perfect color match for me, and my skin looked flawless after the makeup artist applied this foundation. Unfortunately, I have combination skin (I really don&#x27;t think my skin is even THAT oily) and this foundation was running down my face within the hour! It was really embarrassing as I was still mid-shopping trip...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have perfect/normal/dry skin, this will probably be great for you. Like I said, it looked flawless when first applied on me and the coverage is definitely buildable. If you have oily skin, do yourself a favor and try a different foundation.</li>
            <li> This foundation provides a medium coverage but is definitely not invisible. I decided to buy this HD foundation after reading such amazing reviews on it and how it looks flawless. I find it to look cakey, even when I apply just a little. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this is a good foundation, but it is not worth the price. I&#x27;ve found that Revlon Colorstay is a better foundation for a much less price tag. Don&#x27;t buy this foundation thinking it&#x27;s going to be invisible, because it&#x27;s not!</li>
            <li> I have considerate acne and always try to find the foundation with the best coverage that won&#x27;t make me break out more. I&#x27;ve definitely found it with HD Makeup Forever. I&#x27;m in love with this product and although I agree that $40 is a lot to pay for foundation, this is the only foundation I&#x27;ve found that gives me that even and full coverage. And believe me, I&#x27;ve tried many drugstore foundations but nothing seems to compare. You won&#x27;t regret buying this, it gives you the illusion of flawless skin, which is what I was striving for!</li>
            <li> This makeup seemed ok at first with sufficient coverage and look. However it caused such irritation and itching to my skin that I can no longer use it. Very disappointing for the cost...</li>
            <li> The BEST foundation I have ever used in my 60+ years.  The only one I will ever buy from now on.</li>
            <li> I have red patches on my cheeks and this foundation is a miracle. Skin color is very even once I apply this make up.</li>
            <li> Hello everyone,    I am using foundation for a very long time and i have tried a bunch of products (from cheep drugstores cosmetics to really expensive ones ). I LOVE this product because it covers perfectly, blends amazingly and it stays like that for a long time. I would totally recommend this product for beginners and for professionals too. It makes your skin look fabulous and it lasts all day long. It does not get into your pores or cause breakouts. Don&#x27;t be afraid that you don&#x27;t get the perfect color for your skin tone, because it looks anyway very natural. I am since last year a Make up Forever fan and i want to purchase more products from this brand. (Their products are used even for fashion shows make up!) They really know hat they are doing and they do it well.  Hope it helped :)</li>
            <li> Any woman knows there&#x27;s no \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; foundation (with flawless coverage, a light feel, and a long stay), but this is the best I&#x27;ve found so far (and I have tried HUNDREDS).  I have pretty bad-looking skin, so I apply one layer, wait about 20 seconds, then apply another layer.  The coverage is fantastic and it lasts all day (especially if you use the finishing powder from sephora as well).  GREAT STUFF!!!!</li>
            <li> I do not wear any other products other than Makeupforever, YSL and Nars. They all go together very well and are exactly what you want for a cost this high. I&#x27;m 35 and HD makeup (I use the setting powder, the primer and the elixir with this) makes it look as though I&#x27;m wearing nothing at all - but in a good way :) Your face isn&#x27;t too shiny nor too matte. It holds up if you use all the products that are made for one another (as stated above). But I&#x27;m willing to bet that you can just toss this on and go without any issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are MANY fakes being sold on amazon and I&#x27;ve been sold a few - or they just didn&#x27;t know. This not only arrived 4 days after purchase but is the real deal. Obviously I will buy again. Fingers crossed that they will never discontinue this line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m over 60 and get lot&#x27;s of compliments when I wear this make up but that isn&#x27;t the reason I wear it at all.It makes me feel beautiful it&#x27;s a sheer foundation and stays on even when you work in a humid warm environment as I do.I was skeptical at first and I have tried lot&#x27;s of different types of make up and after all these years this is the one for me.          Bonnie</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice medium to full coverage foundation, but there are better for the price.  I feel selecting a shade on line is risky, and this shade is lighter than I hoped it would be.  It is long wearing, but does sink into wrinkles, even after setting it with powder.  I prefer a more matte finish also, but my skin looked healthy when covered by it and felt healthy under it.</li>
            <li> This is great and does cover pretty well, but I don&#x27;t feel that it&#x27;s full coverage. I have a lot of old acne marks which it does cover beautifully, but it doesn&#x27;t cover the handful of blemishes I always seem to have. When I use it with Amazing Cosmetics Concealer it seems to do a pretty good job. Be careful not to use too much, and to let your moisturizer/primer set and dry before you put this on or it can make you appear pretty oily. I&#x27;m not sure if I will purchase this again or if I&#x27;ll try Lorac/Chanel.</li>
            <li> Did not like it. It took my natural color right out of my face.  I have fair skin; made me look white and pasty.  Try Adrienne Arpel&#x27;s argon oil makeup/primer in a bottle. Your skin will look amazing if you are fair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind spending a bit of money on makeup, especially on one that promises to make your face look flawless. MUFE HD had these promises based on reviews, but for me, I wasted $45.  This product made my skin super oily and made my pores look huge (I have combination skin, but not oily on the level this product caused on a normal day).  It also does not cover red spots or under eye circles at all.  The only positive is that the color matches my skin perfectly (I use the 127).  However, the fact that I have to apply and reapply powder throughout the day is incredibly annoying. I will only save this foundation for special occasions where photos will be taken. I haven&#x27;t taken any photos yet so can&#x27;t attest to its efficacy but that&#x27;s supposedly what it was made for. If you have dry, clear skin then yes, this will even it out and look great.  Other than that, don&#x27;t waste your $.</li>
            <li> Always heard rave reviews on MUFE, so I finally sucked it up and decided to buy a bottle (I&#x27;m usually a drug store beauty buyer so spending this much money on a foundation was a hard splurge)....I&#x27;m really not that impressed. Not that it&#x27;s a bad foundation, it&#x27;s got good coverage and doesn&#x27;t look like you&#x27;re wearing any, but I got the same effect from Revlon Photoready for a quarter of the price. I was disappointed, because I really really wanted it to be all it was cracked up to be, but I&#x27;ll stick with Revlon I guess.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation. If only it didn&#x27;t come with the high end price tag!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You only need a small amount for full coverage, long-lasting, matte finish foundation. Oh my god. It doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to drop some money on something that I wear every day, which is why I invest some money into my makeup ;however, I was spending unnecessary money. This foundation is really great for my skin ( oily, pale, and prone to small breakouts).</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to try this foundation but it does live up to all the hype. This is a great foundation with medium to full coverage. I&#x27;ve tried many foundations and this was by far the best for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;It has a dewy finish and your skin does look better in pictures and video!!! Of course it is not miraculous... I still use a good concealer where i break out (i use the makeup forever full coverage concealer) and my skin looks amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I researched a lot before committing to this foundation and I have to say I&#x27;m glad I did. I watched some youtube videos of makeup artists talking about the best foundations and makeup forever HD was always on the top 5!!!&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you are like me and have troubles matching the foundation with your skin color this is the right foundation for you. There are 26 color options so one will be perfect for your skin tone. I am white but my skin has a yellowish undertone... color 117 was perfect for me (concealer was #4).&lt;br /&gt;Then... the most important pro for me after a good coverage is that it is lightweight... it does not look cakey on skin or dries up in patches like other high end foundations I have tried. IT DOES LOOK LIKE YOUR OWN SKIN!&lt;br /&gt;Oh.. and don&#x27;t use powder after applying this foundation because it can mess up with the invisible hd effect. makeup specialists say that if you want to use a setting powder use a translucent one. After applying this foundation my skin does not stay greasy and I don&#x27;t feel like I would need to apply any powder anyway.&lt;br /&gt;The price is fair for the quality and quantity of the product. Definitely the best foundation I have used. Flawless dewy finish and long lasting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard so many great things about this foundation, but I really didn&#x27;t see what the big deal was.  It really didn&#x27;t do anything for me. It didn&#x27;t seem to go on very smoothly for me. I ended up returning it and getting Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked foundation and it is awesome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard nothing but amazing reviews for this product, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a very good foundation for oily/combination skin. It does not go on matte and already has a nice glow, but give it an hour or so and your forehead goes from &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;did a BP oil rig just crash there?&amp;#34; I usually set it with my old MAC Studio Fix pressed powder to absorb some of it, but it seems a little redundant (I wanted to replace it, not use both). I&#x27;m going to keep using it because it&#x27;s pretty pricey, but I might try their matte liquid foundation next. Overall, it does have medium coverage and stays on for a very long time (however this may be my primer at work). It&#x27;s probably much better for people who like a dewy look with normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li> Great coverage foundation.  I find that I do mix it with another foundation of mine just to get the right color for my skin.  My daughter also uses this product.  We love it.  It does tend to break my skin out from time to time but overall it&#x27;s an EXCELLENT foundation.  Two big thumbs up.</li>
            <li> Make no joke about it, this stuff is seriously full coverage.  I wish I could wear a lighter foundation with less coverage, but I have recent acne scarring that leaves me with dark spots on my cheeks and near my chin.  MUFE&#x27;s HD  Foundation is perfect for covering up not only my scarring, but also my under-eye darkness, and any redness I have in the morning.  I don&#x27;t normally pair it with a concealer, and yet I feel confident enough to leave the house and feel good about my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do pair this with a concealer, try out several brands, as I think the wrong combination starts to look cakey.  For example, MAC&#x27;s concealer works great with this, but I found Clinique&#x27;s concealer to clump onto any flakiness I have on my skin.  And speaking of flakiness, this product is not moisturizing.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin or break me out, but I do pair it with a moisturizer that I use about 10 minutes before application.  I find that this combination gives me a bit of a glow on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I definitely recommend getting a sample.  This is heavy foundation and is not for everyone.  If you&#x27;re like me, with acne scarring (or even current breakouts), or splotchy/uneven skin, I highly recommend this foundation.</li>
            <li> THis product is garbage and looks horrible.- : -This product is HORRIBLE. It doesn&#x27;t go on evenly, even with a base and primer. My Studio Fix won&#x27;t even make it look even. At $53 a bottle, I expect that it will be a better quality product than what I buy at the drug store, but I&#x27;m better off with Maybelline. Further, I DO NOT appreciate that when I contact the seller I get zero response. When I finally filed with Amazon, the claim was denied with no explanation.  You are better off buying in a store if you are not sure what you are buying because the seller does not stand behind their product and is completely non-responsive.  Shameful.  Very unhappy.</li>
            <li> This foundation covers my skin flawlessly, meaning no cakey-ness, the kind that I&#x27;ve experienced with Mac Foundations, and an overall coverage of my skins freckles and red spots without making me look too colorless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a nice sparkle, shine to this foundation that makes my skin look fresh and awake.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a few different brands and this is one that I cannot get away from or would ever want to, I highly recommend MUFE Foundation!</li>
            <li> Perfect, Flawless coverage. Love it!! I&#x27;ve tried many foundations but after using this, I wouldn&#x27;t buy any other foundation again.</li>
            <li> Goes on even and looks very natural. Color match is awesome!  Last all day about 8 hrs wish it was longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying drugstore foundations in search of my perfect color and formula match since I was in high school in the 90&#x27;s.  I&#x27;ve had a few excellent matches over the years, but it seems like as soon as I find one I like, it is discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;I recently went to Sephora for some help, and after testing many foundations, this is the one I fell in love with.  Since I had help finding my shade, this foundation is a dead-accurate color for me.  The formulation is very nice.  It is not too heavy on silicone, which give that nice velvety feel, but tend to go greasy on me.  The formulation is a medium coverage, but you can always add an extra concealer if you need it. The formulation is long-lasting.  I get around 6 hours of flawless coverage before I get a bit of oil breaking through, but I have a fairly oily forehead and nose, so your results may be different if you are drier or more oily than me.  I can pat the oil off with a kleenex or add a bit of powder, and it still looks good for the rest of the day.  It also washes off well at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;However, no foundation on Earth- if it is the wrong color- will look good on you.  What you need to to is go to a makeup counter and let a makeup-artist put some foundation on your face.  Here are the steps to finding a good foundation that looks like SKIN, not like foundation.&lt;br /&gt;1) Go to a makeup counter, like Sephora or Ulta, where they sell multiple brands.  This is key! A MAC counter only believes in MAC, a Clinique counter in Clinique, and etc.  You need to have many brands at your disposal so you can&lt;br /&gt;2) Let the makeup artist match you to several brands and shades.&lt;br /&gt;3) GO FIND A NATURAL LIGHT SOURCE! A WINDOW! A DOOR! WHATEVER!!! Look at your face in natural light.  Preferably, one foundation on one side of your face,  and another on the other side, so you can compare the colors.  See what it looks like your actual skin color, in sunlight.  Try to match it to your neck and upper chest, so that the transition from face to neck is seamless.&lt;br /&gt;4) Get a sample that you can try it for at least 3-4 days or more.  My skin does not like sillicone in large quantities.  I like to try a foundation for a few days so I can see if I become a pimple-monster.  If they act goofy when you ask for a sample, WHO CARES.  It is not like the salesperson is going to be your mother-in-law.  Everyone needs a test run, right?&lt;br /&gt;5) Try out your samples for a couple of days, and look at your face under a couple of different lights, and different conditions. MUFE HD in 115 is MY perfect match, but it might not be yours.the transition from face to neck is seamless.&lt;br /&gt;4) Get a sample that you can try it for at least 3-4 days or more.

            <li> I have fair, freckled, oily skin. I&#x27;ve always had foundations either be wayyyyy to dark for my skin, or oxidize and turn orange half way through my day. this foundation is great! no orange skin at 2:30 in the afternoon! it matches my skin tone perfectly. its not heavy or cakey. and it photographs well! I would definitely recommend this product to a friend ... if my friends weren&#x27;t beautifully California tanned...</li>
            <li> This foundation rocks. I am on my 3rd bottle! :) Lightweight with awesome coverage. Great for me because I have drier skin.</li>
            <li> This is the only makeup I&#x27;ll buy. Doesn&#x27;t clog pores, covers moderately. Goes on heavier if you use a brush. And this little bottle does last me like 5 months.</li>
            <li> I have used so many different foundations for my skin and usually by mid day you have to touch up because of the wearing off. This product is not only great in covering up but also light enough to allow you to breathe and not feel like you are piling up the makeup. My skin at the end of my work day looks still radiant and that is a lot considering that many times I am running around doing errands in the hot and unpredicatable weather of Florida. It cost a little more than others but this is a great product, sorry tried the others and they don&#x27;t even come close.</li>
            <li> Made my skin look flawless and beautiful, but after a week every pore was clogged. Doesn&#x27;t say noncomedogenic for a reason. Had to stop using or become blackhead central. Back to Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li> I thought this would look more natural but looked cakey to me. Maybe the wrong co,or for my skin.It is ok</li>
            <li> I have tried most of the foundations in the market, none of them have been able to match my skin tone. A friend of mine recommended this HD foundation to me and I love it. It&#x27;s quite expensive, but worth the money. I recommend this product to anyone likes a natural medium coverage look without cakey.</li>
            <li> Best foundation I have used to date!  Very light and full coverage.  I believe this is the best foundation for my skin color and skin tone</li>
            <li> This make up line is loved by make up artists because it makes the skin look smooth and poreless. This is a really good foundation, make sure you are color matched prior to purchasing it. Guessing the color may not work very well as some of the shades have yellow and some have rose undertones.It ranges from a medium to heavy build-able coverage. Last a good 8 hours and atleast for me didn&#x27;t lead to any breakouts. It gives a matte finish.</li>
            <li> It arrived really fast and I was very happy with it. It&#x27;s the best foundation I&#x27;ve ever used! Will definitely purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> Best makeup I have ever used.  Love it</li>
            <li> He is a very good liquid foundation, very thin, but there are certain Concealer. Very recommended!It makes my skin look very good</li>
            <li> I kept hearing rave reviews on MUFE HD foundation so I went to sephora to check it out after becoming unhappy with my clinique foundation sliding off my face halfway though the day. I am really glad I did. I do have some tips though to make this foundation look its best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. this will appear flakey on some people. Make sure you have well hydrated skin to start but you can combat this with a good primer. i use Korres vitamin E primer, but there are many other great primers.&lt;br /&gt;2. This looks the most beautiful when applied with a moist beauty blender. I have tried fingertips, flat brush, stippling brushes and found I was most happy with the beauty blender for even coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This makeup will stay on all day, especially if you use a setting powder or spray along with it. I believe that this makeup has also improved my skins texture. It definitely has not caused any breakouts.</li>
            <li> I purchased this foundation in shade 110 for my wedding.  It is the best foundation that I have ever used!  A little bit goes a very long way and the pump-top applicator makes this easy to achieve.  I found that this pinky shade was best for my super pale, pink undertone-having skin.  The finish to this is smooth and natural, and also photo-compatible.  It&#x27;s light-diffusing technology makes your skin look overall amazing in pictures!  Pair it with concealer (only if necessary) and top with a very sheer dusting of powder for maximum hold-power throughout the day.  I get amazing wear out of this product, though.  It lasts me easily through an 8 hour work day, as well as a night out on the town.  I apply it with my fingertips, but feel free to use a foundation brush to blend into the skin as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a new foundation after using mineral make-up for many years.  My skin has changed and it was no longer giving me the coverage or finish that I needed.  I went to Sephora and color matched my skin so that I was sure that I was getting the right shade.  I was going to re-order from Amazon for the faster shipping but the current price is listed as $62.00 when it&#x27;s $43.00 at Sephora.  Too much of a difference to pay just for convenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that about the price from this seller, this makeup is amazing. It offers coverage that is just short of full coverage, covering what needs to be covered without looking mask-like and flat.  I put it on over my skincare and a primer, then set with powder and it lasts all day.  My concern in switching to a more traditional foundation was that it would feel heavy or cause problems with blocked pores, but I don&#x27;t know that I have this on and have had no problems with breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This foundation does not contain sunscreen, so a separate sunscreen is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard that they&#x27;re reformulating and the new formula will be out in July 2015 so depending on when you&#x27;re reading this, my review is of the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; formulation available prior to that date.</li>
            <li> I find this makeup is a bit difficult to layer without losing that flawless finish. Therefore, I&#x27;d consider it a medium coverage, not completely &amp;#34;full&amp;#34;.  Still, I find that even with my rosacea, this makeup does very well to even out my skin tone, and I just apply one coat, sometimes with a little bit of concealer. It blends beautifully onto my skin, although if you have dry patchy skin this formula will cling to imperfections and blemishes. When I had larger acne blemishes, it gathered around them and made them stand out. I have applied using kabuki brushes, sponges, and my fingertips, and all have worked well.  For those worried about oiliness at the end of the day, I do have oily skin and will say that although the makeup does stay on my skin, I do notice some oil start to peek through in the later hours of the work day. I strongly suggest powdering/setting if you have oily skin.  As I am also one with very sensitive and acne-prone skin, I have found that this makeup does not break me out.  Biggest complaint for me is the fragrance. I am sensitive to fragrance in many products and it&#x27;s worse when it&#x27;s on my face. Due to the headaches I got from this, I had to stop using the product despite the fact that I liked the formula otherwise.hes, sponges, and my fingertips, and all have worked well.

After a time I started to notice it more and more and started to get headaches throughout the day. I had to stop use of this product because of it. What was otherwise the perfect formula for me had to be abandoned because of the fragrance. :( I&#x27;ve since started using Laura Mercier Silk Creme, which I personally feel is a very comparable formula with no fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;As I am also one with very sensitive and acne-prone skin, I have found that this makeup does not break me out, although I do use a primer, so that likely helps to keep the makeup from clogging my pores throughout the day. Silicone and fragrance, however, are two ingredients that can often set off acne prone and sensitive skin, so the only thing one can do is try samples first, as only you know what is best for your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as an additional note: This makeup comes off fairly easy with a good cleanser and makeup remover. I have had others that have come off better, but I consider this a longer-staying makeup. Compared to Revlon Colorstay, this formula is a breeze to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I love this makeup. It is the best I have had so far in regards to my own personal skin type and shades. All I can say is that I, personally, find that this is my current go-to makeup, but that like anything else, it depends on the individual. :) Hopefully this information helped those who are considering it. Sorry for the length! I wanted to include anything that could help. Good luck!</li>
            <li> Are you sick of being disappointed by your liquid foundation? Tired of being let down by beautiful advertisements promising gorgeous skin? Look no more. I had used every drugstore brand out there and some high end brands, and this is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. It covers dark spots flawlessly and makes skin look fresh, not cakey. The pump bottle is sanitary unlike other foundations where you dip your fingers into a pot of makeup. I love this foundation. I&#x27;m never buying anything else ever again.</li>
            <li> I saw this makeup featured in the show &amp;#34;Mirror, Mirror&amp;#34; from livewellnetwork.com. So far, so good.</li>
            <li> Great product but really, really slow shipping.  Arrived about 10 days past the day it was supposed to and was late for Christmas</li>
            <li> As I have read several reviews for other cosmetic/beauty items here on Amazon I decided not to order from Amazon&#x27;s sellers...too many counterfeits and if I&#x27;m paying this much for something it had better be real.  I purchased mine at Sephora.  My issue is that I can never find a light weight make up with decent coverage that will match my skin tone.  Up until trying this product I had been purchasing drug store brands (Maybelline, L&#x27;oreal, Physicians Formula...etc.) and they all made me look orange.  I have olive undertones, as I am half Italian and a quarter Greek so finding a foundation to match my skin tone is difficult.  I had tried Bare Minerals a while back, but my skin broke out and did not react well to the mineral make up.  So, I decided to try Make Up Forever.  While the foundation does match my skin tone and it is light weight it lacks in coverage and can tend to maximize problem areas ( can be corrected with a primer or pore refiner).  So, I&#x27;m kind of on the fence with this product...I do suggest it, but for me it&#x27;s just a foundation and not my favorite foundation or one I can honestly rave about.</li>
            <li> I have been using this foundation almost every day for several months. It&#x27;s one of my favorite foundations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;  Easy to apply and blend&lt;br /&gt;  Bottle is well designed so you can get small or large amounts out&lt;br /&gt;  Easy to choose your level of coverage, and still looks natural if you put more in certain areas and less (or none) in other areas&lt;br /&gt;  Nice finish that isn&#x27;t too shiny but also not dry (as long as you pick the right moisturizer - see below)&lt;br /&gt;  One bottle lasts forever - I&#x27;ve barely made a dent in two months!&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;  It&#x27;s a little bit expensive for foundation, but as I mentioned above it lasts a while&lt;br /&gt;  If your skin is dry, it can exacerbate the problem. In the winter I have to be very careful what moisturizer I pair this with. If you aren&#x27;t getting good results, try a moisturizer that is creamier to see if that helps&lt;br /&gt;  No SPF</li>
            <li> I bought this product mainly because Kim Kardashian uses this as one of her to-go products. This tempted me away from both Clinique and Mac.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in love with this foundation. I would elope to Vegas with it if I could and have little HD foundation babies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I apply it with a stippling brush my skin looks beautiful, like I&#x27;ve been airbrushed. I&#x27;ve fought large pores and acne scars my whole life, and for me to claim I look \\&quot;airbrushed\\&quot; is a huge compliment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a hardcore Make Up Forever devotee for life.</li>
            <li> Very great product tho it did take some time to get thru the mail.yup yup yup yup yup sry need more words</li>
            <li> I have the makeup forever foundation in 115 Ivory, and my hairstylist raved about this product saying how it made her blemishes disappear and that it also covered her freckles and that it was the best foundation she&#x27;d ever use. Now people who have freckles know how much of a bother they can be and how hard it is to actually find a foundation that will cover them suckers up. I can say that it went on beautifully and I could barely see my freckles but after an hour I was shocked to find that the makeup barely lasted an hour. Now I wouldn&#x27;t be so mad if it was some foundation I bought at Walgreens, but this was a $56.00 foundation. All I can say is I expected better.</li>
