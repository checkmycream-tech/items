    <ol>
            <li>glaze, Stila is the BEST I have found.  </li>
            <li>The scent is to die for, one of the best I have ever come across.</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t the best lip gloss I ever used.</li>
            <li>beautiful!)</li>
            <li>, this is how to best use the product.</li>
            <li>wait, then you should have the perfect amount of product on the brush.</li>
            <li>Its a beautiful shade of berry, just like its name.</li>
            <li>and i think this color is beautiful on me and almost all of my friends.</li>
            <li>Stila Lip Glaze is great.</li>
            <li>The color is great and gives my lips shine.</li>
            <li>no, stila doesn&#x27;t taste great...</li>
            <li>the built in brush application is great for applying glaze on the go --</li>
            <li>This is a great lip gloss.  </li>
            <li>If and when the gloss does come out, I will admit it is a great lip gloss for shine and staying power.</li>
            <li>i think it&#x27;s a superior product.</li>
            <li>It smells good and looks good - gives my lips shine and shimmer.  </li>
            <li>It feels good on your lips.</li>
            <li>However I find that worth it because it is just the best looking gloss.</li>
            <li>I love Stila!</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d keep trying - maybe it would get better!  </li>
            <li>However, these Lip Glaze&#x27;s feel great, they are comfortable and look amazing.</li>
            <li>- just enjoy this great product.</li>
            <li>It may not come boxed, but who cares if its for your own use?  </li>
            <li>I loved it because you can either wear it by its self, or on top of another gloss.</li>
            <li>, it was nice</li>
            <li>I never thought I would find a lipgloss that I liked as well as Chanel Glossimer (spongetip) or MakeUp</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant too, its not too strong.  </li>
            <li>You can have glossy lips without kind of the, for lack of a better word</li>
            <li>It goes on easy and my lips are nice and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I like it better than Mac lustre glass  </li>
            <li>Stila is one of my favorite makeup distributors in the Sephora store.</li>
            <li>This has to be one of my favorite glosses ever.</li>
            <li>You can also use the pen to apply much more neatly.    </li>
            <li>Many shades to choose from, and</li>
            <li>and I just love it.</li>
            <li>And, it smells lovely.</li>
            <li>You click it some more and still nothing happens.</li>
            <li>to use, but love the color, smell, and non-stickyness.</li>
            <li>I was absolutely in love with the color I brought home, so</li>
            <li>i love this gloss.</li>
            <li>but i love this color.</li>
            <li>and I have gotten many compliments while wearing it.</li>
            <li>Besides the fact that it has a great scent, and it&#x27;s yummy (not yucky, like some upscale brands I&#x27;ve tried), it doesn&#x27;t make me look 13, but it doesn&#x27;t make me look like an old fuddy-duddy either.  </li>
            <li>and it blends marvelously with other colors or with lip liner, should you choose to wear it.</li>
            <li>The applicator is easy to use.</li>
            <li>it is true that the packaging could be better</li>
            <li>If it hadn&#x27;t been for the great color, I would have returned it sooner; fortunately Sephora is kind that way and let me bring it back once I was REALLY sure I could live without it.  </li>
            <li>This is a smooth, not too stickly lip gloss that has a built-in brush.</li>
            <li>(I bought it in Guava, a light pinkie color...</li>
            <li>its great that u can use two different shades at a time!!</li>
            <li>When the gloss is low, twisting the bottom becomes twisting in vain and the remaining gloss (which is still good) gets stuck at the top of the pen</li>
            <li>And there are others I love a whole lot more than this.</li>
            <li>I like the apricot color and smell better, and think it adds just the right amount of color/shine, after 4 clicks.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Unless you&#x27;re already ABSOLUTELY in love with an exact shade, I recommend hunting for a more economical price/design/volume.</li>
            <li>It was hard to pick the one I liked because of so many choices and all of them smelled really good.</li>
            <li>This gloss is incredibly rich, yet not sticky.</li>
            <li>This is nicer for eating, but most importantly, they do look more professional, in both senses of the word.</li>
            <li>a pain trying to remember how many times you&#x27;ve clicked to avoid getting too much!</li>
            <li>At this rate, splurge on the higher price point glosses -- get more pucker for your pout, ladies.</li>
            <li>Maybe next time, they should give you your&#x27;e moneys worth and give more gloss!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a nice, classy look.</li>
            <li>packaging takes some getting used to because if you click it too many times you&#x27;ll end up with way too much gloss in the brush.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say enough good things</li>
            <li>I have it gloss in Sweet</li>
            <li>Even though the color is very pretty on, I won&#x27;t be buying this type of lip gloss ever again.</li>
            <li>I bought the lip glaze in Blackberry and it has great, long-lasting shine and slight color.  </li>
            <li>I am willing to pay $20.00 for lip gloss only if it exceptionally good.</li>
            <li>It is slightly less sticky, has just as great colors, and totally different, more user friendly packaging.</li>
            <li>Applied properly, you can wear this to the office, have great looking lips and not look like a complete tart.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it, though.</li>
            <li>Stila offers such a broad range of hues that anyone could find the perfect pinky or peachy or bronzy gloss.  </li>
            <li>The colors are pretty and look natural on the lips (your lips--but better.)</li>
            <li>Ok, 1st off I know many people gave this product a poor review, mostly because of the high price (which I agree is to high), yes, there are MANY other more important things to spend your money on.  </li>
            <li>If you love Stila products and don&#x27;t mind dropping the extra $$, then it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>The color is great- visible but still sheer; it has a bit of a shimmer to it (but never any obvious glitter-</li>
            <li>Each color is very blendable with other lipcolors, too, so I&#x27;ve experimented with lots of combinations and they always look good.</li>
            <li>I bought the Blackberry shade which gives me the exact hint of color that I want.  </li>
            <li>Once you find your perfect shade you will be hooked because they are not \\&quot;cheesy &amp; unatural\\&quot; colors as you would find in a drug store/Walmart.  </li>
            <li>Finally I chose banana smell which I love.</li>
            <li>This was the first lip gloss I bought at Sephora.</li>
            <li>That makes my lips shiny and red, and I love how it looks.</li>
            <li>unfamilar with these exact lip glazes,i have a question... &lt;</li>
            <li>The people at Stila counter told me to shake the pen after I click it the first time, but that doesn&#x27;t always work.  </li>
            <li>I also have it in Cranberry, which I sometimes wear in the evening, and the color is surprisingly rich but not heavy.  </li>
            <li>find it perfectly reasonable to spend more money on a pair of shoes than my entire month&#x27;s food budget.</li>
            <li>Lucky for me, I received a full size tube of this product in Passion Fruit flavor at a Stila event that was happening at my local Sephora, so I didn&#x27;t have to pay...</li>
            <li>I love this color, it looks great on, and it&#x27;s a color that I never really ever dreamed of picking up and using, and since I received the product, I&#x27;ve bought glosses of similar colors from other brands too.</li>
            <li>However, the case, as cute as it is, proves to be a little tricky.  </li>
            <li>It has good shine, stays on, and does not dry out my lips, like some other glosses.</li>
            <li>The whole point of the applicator design is so you can use it like it is intended- like a glaze.</li>
            <li>Anyway, what I like about these glazes is that they don&#x27;t leave you with too much stuff on your lips.</li>
            <li>Otherwise there are some cheap no name brands of lip gloss that do the same job</li>
            <li>I mean, finding the perfect pink lip gloss will make me act like I absentmindedly split the atom in my den while watching Fear Factor.</li>
            <li>But if you DO want a very natural pretty color of lip gloss/</li>
            <li>For those complaining about the packaging (it is VERY aggravating sometimes, especially when I&#x27;m trying to get out of the house quickly and the gloss just DOES NOT want to come out), I suggest trying Stila&#x27;s It Gloss.</li>
            <li>It wears for a long time and has a fantastic shine.</li>
            <li>although I will probably try the new stuff out there, this one (in the Fruit Punch shade), is going to be one of my all-time favorites!</li>
            <li>The effect is distinct, yet the quality of the gloss somehow makes it look more subtle.</li>
            <li>, ill use a more neutral color!!</li>
            <li>Wildly popular, yet a total waste of money.</li>
            <li>I usually stuck with Carmex and sometimes I used lipsticks because they feel okay on lips, but I had never used a gloss I could like.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s for a 12 year old!)  </li>
            <li>I have a drawer-full of flavored, shiny, pretty glosses, but once I&#x27;m done using some of the older shades, I am sticking to this glaze, precisely because it&#x27;s the least sticky of them all!  </li>
            <li>, trashy look some people get with great big globs of gloss in questionable colors.</li>
            <li>But this has gone too far.</li>
            <li>Maybe that was one piece of technology that should have stayed with the professional makeup artists?</li>
            <li>if you click too much, a glob will come out five minutes later.</li>
            <li>You click it again, then suddenly, you have all this gloss over over the brush, too much to use at once, so you end up wasting all this product.</li>
            <li>It lasts a fairly decent amount of time, and I use mine REGULARLY!</li>
            <li>i bought the pussycat dolls lip glaze,it was pretty good,but didnt last long...</li>
            <li>And the tube is CLEAR, so you get openly MOCKED by the rapidly disappearing bar of color.  </li>
            <li>it makes my lips feel soft at harry potter premieres with shine and such, and if im just goin shoppin in oxfordshire</li>
            <li>However, pricewise, it runs out pretty quickly so is rather expensive.</li>

            <li> Stila Lip Glaze is great. I like it better than Mac lustre glass  which is what I had been using before.  I bought the Blackberry shade which gives me the exact hint of color that I want.  However, the case, as cute as it is, proves to be a little tricky.  You twist the bottom once or twice and then you have to wait 2 min for the lip gloss to come thru the brush.  If you keep twisting  because it seems like nothing is coming out,you will eventually have a big blob of gloss on the brush. When the gloss is low, twisting the bottom becomes twisting in vain and the remaining gloss (which is still good) gets stuck at the top of the pen and then you have to squeeze the casing around the brush to get that last little bit (which is what I do before shelling out another $20).</li>
            <li> I usually hate putting anything on my lips. I usually stuck with Carmex and sometimes I used lipsticks because they feel okay on lips, but I had never used a gloss I could like. They are always sticky, get on everything and are just plain uncomfortable. However, these Lip Glaze&#x27;s feel great, they are comfortable and look amazing. I don&#x27;t leave home without them.</li>
            <li> I love Stila! Stila is one of my favorite makeup distributors in the Sephora store. But this has gone too far. I am willing to pay $20.00 for lip gloss only if it exceptionally good. And this lip gloss qualifies. It has good shine, stays on, and does not dry out my lips, like some other glosses. But the thing is, you get so little for what you are paying for. They don&#x27;t even fill up the skinny little tube, which is small. But they give you about two inches of gloss, at least in the one I bought. Maybe next time, they should give you your&#x27;e moneys worth and give more gloss!!</li>
            <li> at the price-per-performance of this item. Wildly popular, yet a total waste of money. You can find similar products in your drugstore in the teeny section. This is a smooth, not too stickly lip gloss that has a built-in brush. It is dispensed by clicking the end. The colors are pretty and look natural on the lips (your lips--but better.) However, pricewise, it runs out pretty quickly so is rather expensive.</li>
            <li> Ok, 1st off I know many people gave this product a poor review, mostly because of the high price (which I agree is to high), yes, there are MANY other more important things to spend your money on.  But if you DO want a very natural pretty color of lip gloss/glaze, Stila is the BEST I have found.  Once you find your perfect shade you will be hooked because they are not \\&quot;cheesy &amp; unatural\\&quot; colors as you would find in a drug store/Walmart.  I buy off of e-bay &amp; pay half the price!!  It may not come boxed, but who cares if its for your own use?  I have NEVER had a problem with any seller on e-bay &amp; I&#x27;ve been ordering for years.  The only lip gloss of Stila&#x27;s I do not like is their cheapie \\&quot;lip shine\\&quot;..The colors are bad &amp; unatural.</li>
            <li> This has to be one of my favorite glosses ever. I purchased the gloss color Watermelon after trying a sample. This gloss is incredibly rich, yet not sticky. The scent is to die for, one of the best I have ever come across. It wears for a long time and has a fantastic shine.</li>
            <li> Shopping at Sephora one day, I saw Stila Lip Glaze collection and wanted to get one. It was hard to pick the one I liked because of so many choices and all of them smelled really good. Finally I chose banana smell which I love. The color is great and gives my lips shine. The applicator is easy to use. It doesn&#x27;t stay long though, you have to reapply it couple times a day. And the amount is ridiculous, especially for the price you pay. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> stila lip glaze is a quality product. the extremely sticky quality of the glaze ensures the product stays on your lips -- with stila lip glaze, you don&#x27;t need to wear lip liner to keep the color from feathering outside your lips.     no, stila doesn&#x27;t taste great...but it belongs ON your lips, not in your mouth. i appreciate stila lip glaze because it doesn&#x27;t take much of the product to cover my lips -- a little goes a long way to provide a delicate kiss of color. the built in brush application is great for applying glaze on the go -- no worries about holding the gloss bottle in one hand while clumisly dipping the brush with the other...just click the bottom of the tube, wait a few seconds for the glaze to ooze over the brush, then apply!     despite what others say, i&#x27;d suggest stila to any of my gal pals. i think it&#x27;s a superior product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little surprised by some of the reviews here. I think people are buying the lip GLAZE expecting something that is like one of those really thick glosses that you just put tons on. That is not what this product is. It is a lip glaze, and like the name suggests, you only need to apply a thin glaze on your lips to get high color and shine. The whole point of the applicator design is so you can use it like it is intended- like a glaze. Maybe that was one piece of technology that should have stayed with the professional makeup artists? I don&#x27;t know. I notice stila has put out an It gloss probably so people can use the conventional wand they are used to, as well as thicker look.    Anyway, what I like about these glazes is that they don&#x27;t leave you with too much stuff on your lips. This is nicer for eating, but most importantly, they do look more professional, in both senses of the word. Applied properly, you can wear this to the office, have great looking lips and not look like a complete tart. You can also layer it on thicker and use bolder color choices for evening wear. The effect is distinct, yet the quality of the gloss somehow makes it look more subtle. It&#x27;s just a nice, classy look. You can have glossy lips without kind of the, for lack of a better word, trashy look some people get with great big globs of gloss in questionable colors. You can also use the pen to apply much more neatly.    On that note- the one annoying thing everyone mentions is waiting for the gloss to come up. You do have to give it 3-4 twists, and then let it sit. I just twist it, do my eyes, then apply it. I find that since I&#x27;m using it as a glaze- a thin layer, it doesn&#x27;t go too quickly- but then I&#x27;m talking about the .08 oz size which is twice what they used to sell. However I find that worth it because it is just the best looking gloss.</li>
            <li> I got the vanilla glaze.  It smells good and looks good - gives my lips shine and shimmer.  Wish it would stay on a little longer though, but I guess that&#x27;s lip gloss for you!</li>
            <li> I got trial sizes of the apricot and brown sugar. I like the apricot color and smell better, and think it adds just the right amount of color/shine, after 4 clicks. However, it is def. a pain trying to remember how many times you&#x27;ve clicked to avoid getting too much!</li>
            <li> I am a gloss-nut!  I have a drawer-full of flavored, shiny, pretty glosses, but once I&#x27;m done using some of the older shades, I am sticking to this glaze, precisely because it&#x27;s the least sticky of them all!  I love gloss because of its finish and texture, but I hated getting my hair caught in it.  Besides the fact that it has a great scent, and it&#x27;s yummy (not yucky, like some upscale brands I&#x27;ve tried), it doesn&#x27;t make me look 13, but it doesn&#x27;t make me look like an old fuddy-duddy either.  Many shades to choose from, and although I will probably try the new stuff out there, this one (in the Fruit Punch shade), is going to be one of my all-time favorites!</li>
            <li> This is a great lip gloss.  I bought the lip glaze in Blackberry and it has great, long-lasting shine and slight color.  It made my pout look glamorous.  I only wish Stila had darker colors rather than mostly pale pinks.</li>
            <li> I have it in Starfruit and Grapefruit, and I alternate using them everyday.  Stila offers such a broad range of hues that anyone could find the perfect pinky or peachy or bronzy gloss.  I also have it in Cranberry, which I sometimes wear in the evening, and the color is surprisingly rich but not heavy.  Each color is very blendable with other lipcolors, too, so I&#x27;ve experimented with lots of combinations and they always look good. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The packaging takes some getting used to because if you click it too many times you&#x27;ll end up with way too much gloss in the brush.  You have to click it four or five times and then, as another reviewer said, shake it and wait.  It&#x27;s worth it, though.</li>
            <li> This was the first lip gloss I bought at Sephora. I loved it because you can either wear it by its self, or on top of another gloss. I have the red type, and I wear it over Jessica Simpson&#x27;s Dessert lip gloss. That makes my lips shiny and red, and I love how it looks.</li>
            <li> I was always tempted to buy this and I always hesitated but what finally made me cross the line was when Stila increased the tube size.  I bought the raspberry shade and I just love it. Its a beautiful shade of berry, just like its name. It goes on easy and my lips are nice and shiny.  This is not a sticky or tacky gloss either. It feels good on your lips. The smell is pleasant too, its not too strong.  I don&#x27;t know if I would buy this gloss again though, it was nice but it wasn&#x27;t the best lip gloss I ever used. And there are others I love a whole lot more than this.</li>
            <li> I am a lip gloss junkie and decided to give the Stila lip glaze a try. (I bought it in Guava, a light pinkie color...beautiful!) You definitely have to get use to waiting for the the gloss to come out after you click the bottom a few times. It takes forever!! Not a fan and if you click too much, a glob will come out five minutes later. If and when the gloss does come out, I will admit it is a great lip gloss for shine and staying power. It is a little sticky but not as bad as some other brands. Even though the color is very pretty on, I won&#x27;t be buying this type of lip gloss ever again. If you love Stila products and don&#x27;t mind dropping the extra $$, then it&#x27;s worth a try. Otherwise there are some cheap no name brands of lip gloss that do the same job and you don&#x27;t have to wait forever to put it on.</li>
            <li> I mean, finding the perfect pink lip gloss will make me act like I absentmindedly split the atom in my den while watching Fear Factor. The thrill. The pride. The anticipation of exhaultation.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I find it perfectly reasonable to spend more money on a pair of shoes than my entire month&#x27;s food budget. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But ARE YOU KIDDING? Twenty bucks for three skeets of gloss in a clicky tube that makes it hard to properly measure out a dosage? And the tube is CLEAR, so you get openly MOCKED by the rapidly disappearing bar of color.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Unless you&#x27;re already ABSOLUTELY in love with an exact shade, I recommend hunting for a more economical price/design/volume. At this rate, splurge on the higher price point glosses -- get more pucker for your pout, ladies.</li>
            <li> To quell the rumblings of the naysayers, the $20 price point is actually for the supersize tube...it is a .08 oz tube, as opposed to the .04 oz tube they used to sell...It lasts a fairly decent amount of time, and I use mine REGULARLY! The color is great- visible but still sheer; it has a bit of a shimmer to it (but never any obvious glitter- that&#x27;s for a 12 year old!)  and it blends marvelously with other colors or with lip liner, should you choose to wear it. And, it smells lovely. This review comes from someone who has gone through at least 6 tubes of this stuff; i don&#x27;t carry a purse without my stila plum lipglaze.</li>
            <li> i bought the pussycat dolls lip glaze,it was pretty good,but didnt last long... &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;being unfamilar with these exact lip glazes,i have a question... &lt;br /&gt;do these have any glitter/sparkles in them? &lt;br /&gt;im not a very big fan of the glittery stuff,if someone could answear my question i would appreciate it...</li>
            <li> I never thought I would find a lipgloss that I liked as well as Chanel Glossimer (spongetip) or MakeUp Forever (squeezetube).  However, this Stila Lip Glaze has definitely won me over.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I bought Papaya and Starfruit and sometimes can&#x27;t make up my mind on which one to use. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All of the colors in the collection are wearable by just about any complexion.  I don&#x27;t think you can make a mistake. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I like the goop-free twistie tube.  Ingenius and won&#x27;t mess up your purse or makeup bag.  This gloss is extravagantly glossy - just what we want gloss to be.  It lasts without being sticky, taste weird, slip all over your face or get your hair caught in it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough good things - just enjoy this great product.</li>
            <li> I love the colors, especially fruit punch and apriot, but I hate the container that it comes in. You twist the bottom of the pen style casing to dispense the product onto the brush at the other end. You click click click and nothing happens. You click it some more and still nothing happens. You click it again, then suddenly, you have all this gloss over over the brush, too much to use at once, so you end up wasting all this product. The people at Stila counter told me to shake the pen after I click it the first time, but that doesn&#x27;t always work.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After some trial and error, this is how to best use the product. Click it 6-7times, shake a lot, wait, then you should have the perfect amount of product on the brush. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hassel to use, but love the color, smell, and non-stickyness.</li>
            <li> This is my fav lipgloss!!!!! it makes my lips feel soft at harry potter premieres with shine and such, and if im just goin shoppin in oxfordshire, ill use a more neutral color!! this works sooo well!!!! i buy it for all my friends when it&#x27;s thier birthday with some other stuff. its great that u can use two different shades at a time!! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Emma Watson</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m crazy, but I felt like this gloss was one of the tackiest, stickiest glosses I&#x27;d ever tried.  I was absolutely in love with the color I brought home, so I thought I&#x27;d keep trying - maybe it would get better!  Alas, no.  The texture never seemed quite right to me, and it felt like it was hard to get out of the tube (and through the built-in brush).  If it hadn&#x27;t been for the great color, I would have returned it sooner; fortunately Sephora is kind that way and let me bring it back once I was REALLY sure I could live without it.  Sigh.</li>
            <li> i love this gloss. it is one of my favorites besides paula&#x27;s select. it is true that the packaging could be better but i love this color. i have pale skin and dark hair and i think this color is beautiful on me and almost all of my friends.</li>
            <li> Lucky for me, I received a full size tube of this product in Passion Fruit flavor at a Stila event that was happening at my local Sephora, so I didn&#x27;t have to pay...if I did, I probably never would have tried this product on my college student budget. I love this color, it looks great on, and it&#x27;s a color that I never really ever dreamed of picking up and using, and since I received the product, I&#x27;ve bought glosses of similar colors from other brands too. It is a little on the sticky side but it is by no means uncomfortable to wear, and the slight stickyness helps it last longer between reapplications.    For those complaining about the packaging (it is VERY aggravating sometimes, especially when I&#x27;m trying to get out of the house quickly and the gloss just DOES NOT want to come out), I suggest trying Stila&#x27;s It Gloss. It is slightly less sticky, has just as great colors, and totally different, more user friendly packaging. I have it gloss in Sweet and I have gotten many compliments while wearing it. So when lip glaze fails, don&#x27;t give up on Stila, just try the it gloss.</li>
