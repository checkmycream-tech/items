            <li>stuff is easily the best I&#x27;ve tried, from any brand/manufacturer out there.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great, it smells amazing, it has a good hold throughout the day and it doesn&#x27;t look like you dumped a handful of gel on your head.</li>
            <li>Good for texture</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>Received a sample of this after getting a haircut, and it works fairly well.</li>

            <li>Works good.</li>
            <li>Really good product.</li>
            <li>good job, Paul mitchell.</li>
            <li>kind of a classic/&amp;#34;Great Gatsby&amp;#34;-esque look, and this stuff is great.</li>
            <li>Good hold with hardness</li>
            <li>Even during 18 hour days it keeps my hair looking good.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, works as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I believe Mitch Reformer to be the superior option of the 3 for my hair and style.</li>
            <li>And he has great hair, so it works well. :-)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great if you want to be able to style your hair without it looking like you dipped your head in glue.</li>
            <li>This stuff is perfect for me - without it my hair looks like Luke Skywalker in the first Star Wars movie - but with it I&#x27;m one of the Beatles, circa 1968.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it holds without ever being sticky or greasy looking!  </li>
            <li>Go easy on the product and it will work great.</li>
            <li>and she told me it smelled amazing.  </li>
            <li>and I really liked it.</li>
            <li>Product smells good, holds OK.</li>
            <li>(smells kind of like paint)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t kind it.</li>
            <li>nice product, doesnt make my hair sticky</li>
            <li>nice product.</li>
            <li>Nice hold.</li>
            <li>It kind of makes my scalp feel like it can&#x27;t breathe</li>
            <li>And it does kind of stay with you.  </li>
            <li>Kind of the porta-potty concept, to be blunt.</li>
            <li>Provides a fairly strong hold and it seems fairly neutral in scent to me which is nice.</li>
            <li>A good strong breeze will blow your hair</li>
            <li>Very strong musky/black licorice smell which gave me a headache.</li>
            <li>amazing love this product</li>
            <li>This is by far the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I am sure it is perfect for Men or Women who are younger and have good Hair to work with.....  </li>
            <li>and it works great to straighten out certain curls in the morning that just want to do their own thing.</li>
            <li>I think of it as &#x27;clean gunk&#x27; - in a good way.</li>
            <li>Great product I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely, and is easy to style with, even with longer hair (2 inches, give or take).  </li>
            <li>It has a nice scent but not so strong that it smell like men&#x27;s cologne..</li>
            <li>However, the smell went mostly away after a week or so.</li>
            <li>but I do want it to stay in place mostly.</li>
            <li>Able to style my hair but doesn&#x27;t get crunchy.</li>
            <li>I do like the hold, fragrance, and the fact it is mostly matte in finish.</li>
            <li>/crusty (like when you use most gels).</li>
            <li>I like it much better than gel.</li>
            <li>There are better options.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for many years, after salon recommendation.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of mens hair products, and this is definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li>This is a great wax/paste for really holding hair in place.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is the best, longest lasting, most reformable product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Love this gel</li>
            <li>but is cruelty free!</li>
            <li>Maybe better?</li>
            <li>It is ok, like others have mentioned, these are not &amp;#34;strong hold&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>This is my husband&#x27;s favorite brand of hair gel/texturizer.</li>
            <li>Mitch Reformer is easily my favorite.    </li>
            <li>Besides the way it makes my hair look, my favorite thing about this product is how my it feels in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I love that the Reformer is water-based.  </li>
            <li>When using this product, I don&#x27;t notice anything in my hair - it feels nice and light as if there&#x27;s nothing in it.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how others might feel about it, but a couple of nights ago my wife happened to smell my hair when I was sitting with her</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind paying $3-4 a month to feel confident about how my hair looks, and that&#x27;s how I look at a purchase like this.    </li>
            <li>Much better than gel or hairspray for guys.</li>
            <li>Mitch Reformer does all these things, though not so much hold great throughout the day.    </li>
            <li>Definitely the best of the 3.</li>
            <li>just OK.........</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous product for both men and women!  </li>
            <li>It has been my favorite gel to use since the day I bought it.</li>
            <li>This stuff has worked for me better than cheaper axe branded stuff I got at the drugstore.</li>
            <li>so I was very excited to find it here on Amazon for $13.  </li>
            <li>This is half the price, smells great, doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy, and has great flowing hold.</li>
            <li>Mix with Paul Mitchell Dry Wax for a great look every day!</li>
            <li>But overall, this is a great product and one I would recommend to anyone wanting a good hold, but still looks very natural, smells good, pliable, and doesn&#x27;t gum up your hair.</li>
            <li>Ideal for short to medium length hair.  </li>
            <li>and it is not as strong as the Clean cut product which is more waxy.</li>
            <li>This stuff makes it easy for me to get the desired shape and texture.</li>
            <li>You can easily spread it out on your hands and fingers without getting chunks.  </li>
            <li>Easy to work in, and style without looking like theres gel in your hair.</li>
            <li>Strong hold...</li>
            <li>Strong toxic smell.</li>
            <li>This product has one of the strongest smells thats just too strong.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t classify this as a wax or clay, the hold just isn&#x27;t as strong.</li>
            <li>I read a review where someone felt the scent was strong.</li>
            <li>Not as strong holding as they say though.</li>
            <li>It holds well, doesn&#x27;t smell too strongly, and gives me the matte /  texture I prefer.</li>
            <li>And the Barber&#x27;s Classic pomade is shiny and good at smoothing hair, but provides almost no hold - not for me anyways.    </li>
            <li>The product also does not have a strong hold</li>
            <li>It does have a strong smell, and although I kinda like it, I can see how some others might not.</li>
            <li>a bit dry for my perfect liking but cool to have a change up from the &amp;#34;clean cut&amp;#34; or the tea trea shaping cream.</li>
            <li>At first it looks really nice</li>
            <li>The matte finish is great and you can get some pretty good hold out of the stuff all day long.</li>
            <li>It seems to hold fine</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pleasant and masculine.</li>
            <li>But if your looking for a clean look with a strong hold this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li>It is important to note that these are demo sizes and not the 3 oz. size.</li>
            <li>Also great when paired with American Crew Grooming Cream.</li>
            <li>works great for texturing short hair.</li>
            <li>I have been using this reformer for several months and am happy to find a supplier that supplies it at a cheaper price than in the salon or store.</li>
            <li>Great hair gel for men- similar to Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Another thing I like about the Reformer is that you don&#x27;t need a whole lot of this stuff for it to be effective.  </li>
            <li>Good product,holds wild hair in place.</li>
            <li>This hair cream is good for a soft feel to your hair while doing light hair styling.</li>
            <li>Perfect for fine short hair that needs texture with a soft hold</li>
            <li>This product is perfect for my thick mane, it holds and is easily rearranged throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Worth trying!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>I originally ordered this to help style my faux hawk</li>
            <li>You can use more for a stronger hold, but for my hair style it wasn&#x27;t necessary (and if you use more it does become more noticeable in your hair).</li>
            <li>This stuff works great, stays a little softer and thus stickier than their other product, but is an excellent product</li>
            <li>Even after putting a little more in the hold still isn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li>If the Reformer&#x27;s hold is 8-8.5 out of 10, then I&#x27;d say the Clean Cut is about a 6-7 out of 10.  </li>
            <li>great dry hold</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just a habit), and with Mitch Reformer in, my hair feels soft and I don&#x27;t end up with any kind of residue on my hand.  </li>
            <li>It has a distinct pine scent, which I don&#x27;t enjoy</li>
            <li>Adding more product to get a stronger hold isn&#x27;t in the cards, as it tends to leave a white residue the more it is used.  </li>
            <li>(luckily they were returnable).  </li>
            <li>Love it, you can use in dry hair, not sticky, not shining, good smell, reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very matte finish, and the hold is really strong but still lets you mold it throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It also makes it look more natural, rather than, &#x27;oh yeah, he&#x27;s dolloped a load of product on his head!&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes, it is a bit strong and has a bit of a &#x27;medicine-like&#x27; note to it (though I find it to be more of a woodsy scent overall).  </li>
            <li>I love the way this product works - strong, matte hold, doesn&#x27;t get \\&quot;gunky\\&quot; or look white when applied to hair.  </li>
            <li>For those looking for a natural feel with a very light hold, this works well.</li>
            <li>I use this everyday, works great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found, which is rare.</li>
            <li>In my own experience, the Reformer definitely has a stronger hold (while still being flexible).  </li>
            <li>Good for messy or clean looks</li>
            <li>and I have to look good at all times due to my profession.</li>
            <li>It smells fresh and if you wear deodorant, cologne and just wash in general you won&#x27;t be able to smell it after 3 minutes!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s easy to re-style without more product, but that shouldn&#x27;t be what&#x27;s expected with a strong-hold product.  </li>
            <li>I have the popular hairstyle where it&#x27;s short on the sides and back, then fades up to longer hair on top and kinda spiky/swooped - like Adam Levine: http://us.cdn281.fansshare.com/</li>
            <li>It states is offers strong hold</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pliable and you can work it into your hair easily, and it leaves your hair very natural where you can still run your fingers through it without any fuss after applying.</li>
            <li>Also, I find that the longer my hair gets (I keep it short), the more &#x27;gunky&#x27; the Re-works gets when styling.  </li>
            <li>that would have similar results and work a bit better on longer hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll cover the elephant in the room first:  the scent.  </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll definitely pass on getting more of this once it runs out.</li>
            <li>Exactly how it&#x27;s advertised</li>
            <li>Pretty close.</li>
            <li>The packaging/label are kinda lame and uninspiring, but the product is the best.</li>
            <li>Like anything smell related for the most part its subjective.</li>
            <li>This is the first product I apply before anything else goes into it.</li>
            <li>You will notice the difference when you start using higher end products in your hair.</li>
            <li>I like this better than the blue label crew reformer.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It does exactly as expected, however I would have liked a product that has a stronger hold.</li>
            <li>and I must say that this is the first time I&#x27;ve EVER found something that makes my hair do exactly what I want it to each and every time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s usually short on the sides and 1-3\\&quot; on top.  </li>
            <li>I have tried what some consider to be the top 3 options on Amazon: Paul Mitchell Mitch Reformer, Tigi Bed Head Matte Separation Wax, and American Crew Fiber.</li>
            <li>I have pretty curly hair</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s SO much cheaper than buying it in a salon!  </li>
            <li>I paid almost $20 for it at first from my hair salon.  </li>
            <li>I alternate between this and the D:fi D:struct hair creme, which is much more &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; like that the Reformer.</li>
            <li>Yes, it is better than American Crew Fiber.</li>
            <li>Many other Mitch product reviewers have said that they prefer the Clean Cut, which I do think works well.  </li>
            <li>New favorite hair product (old one was B&amp;B Sumo Wax).</li>
            <li>I am  an Older Lady and ware my short hair in kind of a Modern</li>
            <li>Good stuff, fantastic way to secretly shape temperamental hair.</li>
            <li>Good for making your hair look messy without too much shine or making it too sticky so that you can&#x27;t run your hands through it.  </li>
            <li>reference, my hair is about 2\\&quot; long on top, and I use maybe 3/4 of a dime size.</li>
            <li>The end result is similar to the Reformer product but is not applied as easily.</li>
            <li>I keep my hair short/medium length year-around but am very particular of how it looks.</li>
            <li>The consistency is kind of like a paste or slightly creamy clay.  </li>
            <li>I am looking for something that I can style outside the range of 5 seconds after putting it in my hands, something that won&#x27;t shine my hair at all, something that will hold throughout the day, and something that will rinse off easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll hold the hair for a bit, but a strong breeze or any type of humidity is enough to knock the style out of place.  </li>
            <li>Reformer (Red Lid) is labeled as a texturizer with strong hold and a matte finish.</li>
            <li>While labeled as a strong hold I don&#x27;t think it is necessarily so.</li>
            <li>I live in North Carolina, where it gets pretty hot and humid in the summer, and I&#x27;m a runner.  </li>
            <li>It is designed I am sure for younger people who have good thick - normal hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is slightly messy/bed head-y, and this product gives great messy texture while also giving it a great amount of hold and a little amount of shine.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>I typically use Paul Mitchel Re-Works to style my hair, and while I am happy with how it works, I don&#x27;t use it fast enough</li>
            <li>The solution I have came up with to make the Mitch Reformer hold a little better throughout the day is touch it with a little hair spray and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>Great for that short, messy look.</li>
            <li>I have blonde hair, and it can even be seen in my light hair.  </li>
            <li>Although with time and with natural oils in your hair, it doesn&#x27;t smell as fresh at the end of the day, which is understandable.</li>
            <li>Turns out the use Rejuvinator, which can&#x27;t be ordered retail, available from them only.</li>
            <li>However, this will work great with thin hairs or just for the evening events, that way no one will get sticky fingers when touches your hair.</li>
            <li>And even when sweating a lot, I don&#x27;t notice any residue coming from my hair (and it stays reasonably in place and doesn&#x27;t get frizzy).  </li>
            <li>Really recomende it.</li>
            <li>I really like this product, it was recommended to me after I changed my hairstyle to a shorter cut.  </li>
            <li>This is a salon-only product and getting it on Amazon is so much easier.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t linger much once applied to the hair.</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t give you that frozen wet look like a gel.</li>
            <li>product came very fast and was new.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been told that it&#x27;s healthy for your hair in comparison to other products out there.</li>
            <li>Great hold and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It works well, holds really well for my very heavy wavy hair, and also actually smells really great</li>
            <li>/&gt;The Clean Cut (Yellow Lid)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m convinced this product is not Reformer, possibly Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Clean Cut.</li>
            <li>I prefer the Paul Mitchell Clean Cut (yellow lid).</li>
            <li>It makes me feel much hotter while out in the North Carolina sun, particularly when running/exercising.  </li>
            <li>From straight pomade to any number of high priced matte finishes.  </li>
            <li>This stuff gives you more flexibility once you put it in your hair and clumps less than similair products.</li>
            <li>Very similar to Crew Fiber, but a tad more wet in the container, where as Fiber is a bit more dry and pasty.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overly shiny, and is less so the more you retouch your hair throughout the day.</li>
            <li>main issue I have with this is the hold.  </li>
            <li>I spike my hair/wear it messy and don&#x27;t love it when it is very brittle</li>
            <li>I started using this stuff and along with the Paul Mitchell &amp;#34;Clean Cut&amp;#34; (Yellow top), it&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ll use anymore.</li>
            <li>Like the guy who posted the video review about this one and the yellow one, the yellow one is better even though this states it is stronger</li>
            <li>When you add the price difference between SumoTech (~$35-40) vs Reformer (~$18-25), it&#x27;s not a terrible choice to save a few bucks and still have a reasonably close product.</li>
            <li>Reformer is a bit more of a cream when compared to SumoTech, but the effect of hold and low shine is very similar.</li>
            <li>Price is somewhat high or I would have given 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended product.</li>
            <li>need a product that will provide high hold with a low-to-no-shine.</li>
            <li>LS&amp;B Raw Earth for example is MUCH stronger holding, grittier, and more matte finish.</li>
            <li>Just the right about of hold for my straight flat hair.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the extra cost over the cheaper stuff you can find in the store.</li>
            <li>It holds firmly (though the Clean Cut holds a bit stronger) while still allowing the natural look (this one looks a little more natural than the Clean Cut, at leat for my hair length).</li>
            <li>It is not hard at all and didn&#x27;t meet my needs for spiky/messy hair.</li>
            <li>This product is perfect for a strong hold without giving you that nasty gel shine that I can&#x27;t stand.</li>
            <li>It may seem expensive, but a puck of this easily lasts me six months or more.  </li>
            <li>I can still run my fingers through and put it right back into place as if I had just put it on.  </li>
            <li>I know I can&#x27;t be the only person out there who&#x27;s pretty OCD about picking the right products, especially when I&#x27;m spending a little more for \\&quot;higher-end\\&quot; stuff.  </li>
            <li>Though, it seems that using a bit more INITIALLY instead of going back late to add more mitigates the residue (the layering is probably what causes</li>
            <li>If you live in a bug-laden area, avoid this.  </li>
            <li>I like that they have started using a foil seal on the new jar to maintain freshness too.</li>
            <li>Its better than most at not causing your hair to feel dirty by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>Rinsing it off takes a little work too, it doesn&#x27;t come off as easily as the Mitch Reformer.    </li>
            <li>The smell of the Reformer is a little different at first, kind of barber shop-y and maybe a little medicinal, as some other reviewers have noted (although I think of it as being more \\&quot;earthy\\&quot;).  </li>
            <li>And while other reviewers have noted that Clean Cut has a stronger hold, I disagree.  </li>
            <li>It can give that messy look easily while holding your style in place without feeling brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Less is more when applying, I use a dime size total and apply it in 3 doses as I&#x27;m doing my hair in the morning.</li>
            <li>Steer clear.</li>
            <li>No complaints thus far.</li>
            <li>Not real greasy, and it&#x27;s easily pliable after long periods of time.</li>
            <li>What I like about the Reformer is that it gives my hair more texture that D:fi, though it can also mean drying out and wearing off quicker throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Its smell little stronger that the medium holds, put not bad or to long, just for the first 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>{ the down side of this is I have almost white - fine</li>
            <li>Also, if I mess up my hair, I can easily just put it back in place with my hands and it stays (even the pieces with height).  </li>
            <li>Small dab rubbed over palms and into the hair, blow-dried, creates thickness, body, bounce and a greater willingness to stay kinda back out of my face.  </li>
            <li>The scent is mild but smells like your typical salon visit.</li>
            <li>The product it self is like a thick paste and easy to scoop out of the tin (soft feeling product).</li>
            <li>Not thick enough.</li>
            <li>I know there&#x27;s no hard evidence one way or the other about parabens causing cancer (and particularly breast cancer),</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t use any product, my hair gets very frizzy, holds no particular shape, and keeps no separation.</li>
            <li>If you put it in while your hair is still a little wet, it gives a healthy shine that can be brushed out with your fingers as soon as it dries (if you want a truly matte look).  </li>
            <li>That sucks, this stuff certainly ain&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li>You do need to be careful in how much you use.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d rather not worry about it, especially with a wife and young daughter in the house.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make the hair sticky and gives it barely any shine.</li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;m not going to say that Reformer is equal to SumoTech, but it&#x27;s damn near close.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of thin hairs, 3-4 inches on top, with shorter sides...</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it smells WAY too strong.</li>
            <li>but beware...use only a small amount or it will cake up your hair, especially if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li>Extreme hold, very good.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>I am guessing that this product should last a while because you really do not need much product to get the desired effect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a matte finish hair product, but the &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; hold is far weaker than the medium hold in the same line.</li>
            <li>My only real gripe I guess is that it&#x27;s not real strong.</li>
            <li>Not only is it too sticky, leaving it hard to style, but it&#x27;s also a little more shine on my hair than I want.</li>

            <li> Good for texture</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>

            <li> Good hold with hardness</li>
            <li> Even during 18 hour days it keeps my hair looking good.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, works as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I believe Mitch Reformer to be the superior option of the 3 for my hair and style.</li>
            <li> And he has great hair, so it works well. :-)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great if you want to be able to style your hair without it looking like you dipped your head in glue.</li>
            <li> This stuff is perfect for me - without it my hair looks like Luke Skywalker in the first Star Wars movie - but with it I&#x27;m one of the Beatles, circa 1968.  </li>
            <li> I love the way it holds without ever being sticky or greasy looking!  </li>
            <li> Go easy on the product and it will work great.</li>
            <li> and she told me it smelled amazing.  </li>
            <li> and I really liked it.</li>
            <li> Product smells good, holds OK.</li>
            <li> (smells kind of like paint)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t kind it.</li>
            <li> nice product, doesnt make my hair sticky</li>
            <li> nice product.</li>
            <li> Nice hold.</li>
            <li> It kind of makes my scalp feel like it can&#x27;t breathe</li>
            <li> And it does kind of stay with you.  </li>
            <li> Kind of the porta-potty concept, to be blunt.</li>
            <li> Provides a fairly strong hold and it seems fairly neutral in scent to me which is nice.</li>
            <li> A good strong breeze will blow your hair</li>
            <li> Very strong musky/black licorice smell which gave me a headache.</li>
            <li> amazing love this product</li>
            <li> This is by far the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I am sure it is perfect for Men or Women who are younger and have good Hair to work with.....  </li>
            <li> and it works great to straighten out certain curls in the morning that just want to do their own thing.</li>
            <li> I think of it as &#x27;clean gunk&#x27; - in a good way.</li>
            <li> Great product I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> It goes on nicely, and is easy to style with, even with longer hair (2 inches, give or take).  </li>
            <li> It has a nice scent but not so strong that it smell like men&#x27;s cologne..</li>
            <li> However, the smell went mostly away after a week or so.</li>
            <li> but I do want it to stay in place mostly.</li>
            <li> Able to style my hair but doesn&#x27;t get crunchy.</li>
            <li> I do like the hold, fragrance, and the fact it is mostly matte in finish.</li>
            <li> /crusty (like when you use most gels).</li>
            <li> I like it much better than gel.</li>
            <li> There are better options.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for many years, after salon recommendation.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of mens hair products, and this is definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li> This is a great wax/paste for really holding hair in place.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is the best, longest lasting, most reformable product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Love this gel</li>
            <li> but is cruelty free!</li>
            <li> Maybe better?</li>
            <li> It is ok, like others have mentioned, these are not &amp;#34;strong hold&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite brand of hair gel/texturizer.</li>
            <li> Mitch Reformer is easily my favorite.    </li>
            <li> Besides the way it makes my hair look, my favorite thing about this product is how my it feels in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I love that the Reformer is water-based.  </li>
            <li> When using this product, I don&#x27;t notice anything in my hair - it feels nice and light as if there&#x27;s nothing in it.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how others might feel about it, but a couple of nights ago my wife happened to smell my hair when I was sitting with her</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind paying $3-4 a month to feel confident about how my hair looks, and that&#x27;s how I look at a purchase like this.    </li>
            <li> Much better than gel or hairspray for guys.</li>
            <li> Mitch Reformer does all these things, though not so much hold great throughout the day.    </li>
            <li> Definitely the best of the 3.</li>
            <li> just OK.........</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product for both men and women!  </li>
            <li> It has been my favorite gel to use since the day I bought it.</li>
            <li> This stuff has worked for me better than cheaper axe branded stuff I got at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> so I was very excited to find it here on Amazon for $13.  </li>
            <li> This is half the price, smells great, doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy, and has great flowing hold.</li>
            <li> Mix with Paul Mitchell Dry Wax for a great look every day!</li>
            <li> But overall, this is a great product and one I would recommend to anyone wanting a good hold, but still looks very natural, smells good, pliable, and doesn&#x27;t gum up your hair.</li>
            <li> Ideal for short to medium length hair.  </li>
            <li> and it is not as strong as the Clean cut product which is more waxy.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes it easy for me to get the desired shape and texture.</li>
            <li> You can easily spread it out on your hands and fingers without getting chunks.  </li>
            <li> Easy to work in, and style without looking like theres gel in your hair.</li>
            <li> Strong hold...</li>
            <li> Strong toxic smell.</li>
            <li> This product has one of the strongest smells thats just too strong.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t classify this as a wax or clay, the hold just isn&#x27;t as strong.</li>
            <li> I read a review where someone felt the scent was strong.</li>
            <li> Not as strong holding as they say though.</li>
            <li> It holds well, doesn&#x27;t smell too strongly, and gives me the matte /  texture I prefer.</li>
            <li> And the Barber&#x27;s Classic pomade is shiny and good at smoothing hair, but provides almost no hold - not for me anyways.    </li>
            <li> The product also does not have a strong hold</li>
            <li> It does have a strong smell, and although I kinda like it, I can see how some others might not.</li>
            <li> a bit dry for my perfect liking but cool to have a change up from the &amp;#34;clean cut&amp;#34; or the tea trea shaping cream.</li>
            <li> At first it looks really nice</li>
            <li> The matte finish is great and you can get some pretty good hold out of the stuff all day long.</li>
            <li> It seems to hold fine</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s pleasant and masculine.</li>
            <li> But if your looking for a clean look with a strong hold this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> It is important to note that these are demo sizes and not the 3 oz. size.</li>
            <li> Also great when paired with American Crew Grooming Cream.</li>
            <li> works great for texturing short hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this reformer for several months and am happy to find a supplier that supplies it at a cheaper price than in the salon or store.</li>
            <li> Great hair gel for men- similar to Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Another thing I like about the Reformer is that you don&#x27;t need a whole lot of this stuff for it to be effective.  </li>
            <li> Good product,holds wild hair in place.</li>
            <li> This hair cream is good for a soft feel to your hair while doing light hair styling.</li>
            <li> Perfect for fine short hair that needs texture with a soft hold</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for my thick mane, it holds and is easily rearranged throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Worth trying!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> I originally ordered this to help style my faux hawk</li>
            <li> You can use more for a stronger hold, but for my hair style it wasn&#x27;t necessary (and if you use more it does become more noticeable in your hair).</li>
            <li> This stuff works great, stays a little softer and thus stickier than their other product, but is an excellent product</li>
            <li> Even after putting a little more in the hold still isn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li> If the Reformer&#x27;s hold is 8-8.5 out of 10, then I&#x27;d say the Clean Cut is about a 6-7 out of 10.  </li>
            <li> great dry hold</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just a habit), and with Mitch Reformer in, my hair feels soft and I don&#x27;t end up with any kind of residue on my hand.  </li>
            <li> It has a distinct pine scent, which I don&#x27;t enjoy</li>
            <li> Adding more product to get a stronger hold isn&#x27;t in the cards, as it tends to leave a white residue the more it is used.  </li>
            <li> (luckily they were returnable).  </li>
            <li> Love it, you can use in dry hair, not sticky, not shining, good smell, reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very matte finish, and the hold is really strong but still lets you mold it throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It also makes it look more natural, rather than, &#x27;oh yeah, he&#x27;s dolloped a load of product on his head!&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a bit strong and has a bit of a &#x27;medicine-like&#x27; note to it (though I find it to be more of a woodsy scent overall).  </li>
            <li> I love the way this product works - strong, matte hold, doesn&#x27;t get \\&quot;gunky\\&quot; or look white when applied to hair.  </li>
            <li> For those looking for a natural feel with a very light hold, this works well.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday, works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found, which is rare.</li>
            <li> In my own experience, the Reformer definitely has a stronger hold (while still being flexible).  </li>
            <li> Good for messy or clean looks</li>
            <li> and I have to look good at all times due to my profession.</li>
            <li> It smells fresh and if you wear deodorant, cologne and just wash in general you won&#x27;t be able to smell it after 3 minutes!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s easy to re-style without more product, but that shouldn&#x27;t be what&#x27;s expected with a strong-hold product.  </li>
            <li> I have the popular hairstyle where it&#x27;s short on the sides and back, then fades up to longer hair on top and kinda spiky/swooped - like Adam Levine: http://us.cdn281.fansshare.com/</li>
            <li> It states is offers strong hold</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pliable and you can work it into your hair easily, and it leaves your hair very natural where you can still run your fingers through it without any fuss after applying.</li>
            <li> Also, I find that the longer my hair gets (I keep it short), the more &#x27;gunky&#x27; the Re-works gets when styling.  </li>
            <li> that would have similar results and work a bit better on longer hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll cover the elephant in the room first:  the scent.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll definitely pass on getting more of this once it runs out.</li>
            <li> Exactly how it&#x27;s advertised</li>
            <li> Pretty close.</li>
            <li> The packaging/label are kinda lame and uninspiring, but the product is the best.</li>
            <li> Like anything smell related for the most part its subjective.</li>
            <li> This is the first product I apply before anything else goes into it.</li>
            <li> You will notice the difference when you start using higher end products in your hair.</li>
            <li> I like this better than the blue label crew reformer.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> It does exactly as expected, however I would have liked a product that has a stronger hold.</li>
            <li> and I must say that this is the first time I&#x27;ve EVER found something that makes my hair do exactly what I want it to each and every time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s usually short on the sides and 1-3\\&quot; on top.  </li>
            <li> I have tried what some consider to be the top 3 options on Amazon: Paul Mitchell Mitch Reformer, Tigi Bed Head Matte Separation Wax, and American Crew Fiber.</li>
            <li> I have pretty curly hair</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s SO much cheaper than buying it in a salon!  </li>
            <li> I paid almost $20 for it at first from my hair salon.  </li>
            <li> I alternate between this and the D:fi D:struct hair creme, which is much more &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; like that the Reformer.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is better than American Crew Fiber.</li>
            <li> Many other Mitch product reviewers have said that they prefer the Clean Cut, which I do think works well.  </li>
            <li> New favorite hair product (old one was B&amp;B Sumo Wax).</li>
            <li> I am  an Older Lady and ware my short hair in kind of a Modern</li>
            <li> Good stuff, fantastic way to secretly shape temperamental hair.</li>
            <li> Good for making your hair look messy without too much shine or making it too sticky so that you can&#x27;t run your hands through it.  </li>
            <li> reference, my hair is about 2\\&quot; long on top, and I use maybe 3/4 of a dime size.</li>
            <li> The end result is similar to the Reformer product but is not applied as easily.</li>
            <li> I keep my hair short/medium length year-around but am very particular of how it looks.</li>
            <li> The consistency is kind of like a paste or slightly creamy clay.  </li>
            <li> I am looking for something that I can style outside the range of 5 seconds after putting it in my hands, something that won&#x27;t shine my hair at all, something that will hold throughout the day, and something that will rinse off easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll hold the hair for a bit, but a strong breeze or any type of humidity is enough to knock the style out of place.  </li>
            <li> Reformer (Red Lid) is labeled as a texturizer with strong hold and a matte finish.</li>
            <li> While labeled as a strong hold I don&#x27;t think it is necessarily so.</li>
            <li> I live in North Carolina, where it gets pretty hot and humid in the summer, and I&#x27;m a runner.  </li>
            <li> It is designed I am sure for younger people who have good thick - normal hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is slightly messy/bed head-y, and this product gives great messy texture while also giving it a great amount of hold and a little amount of shine.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> I typically use Paul Mitchel Re-Works to style my hair, and while I am happy with how it works, I don&#x27;t use it fast enough</li>
            <li> The solution I have came up with to make the Mitch Reformer hold a little better throughout the day is touch it with a little hair spray and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> Great for that short, messy look.</li>
            <li> I have blonde hair, and it can even be seen in my light hair.  </li>
            <li> Although with time and with natural oils in your hair, it doesn&#x27;t smell as fresh at the end of the day, which is understandable.</li>
            <li> Turns out the use Rejuvinator, which can&#x27;t be ordered retail, available from them only.</li>
            <li> However, this will work great with thin hairs or just for the evening events, that way no one will get sticky fingers when touches your hair.</li>
            <li> And even when sweating a lot, I don&#x27;t notice any residue coming from my hair (and it stays reasonably in place and doesn&#x27;t get frizzy).  </li>
            <li> Really recomende it.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it was recommended to me after I changed my hairstyle to a shorter cut.  </li>
            <li> This is a salon-only product and getting it on Amazon is so much easier.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t linger much once applied to the hair.</li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t give you that frozen wet look like a gel.</li>
            <li> product came very fast and was new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been told that it&#x27;s healthy for your hair in comparison to other products out there.</li>
            <li> Great hold and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It works well, holds really well for my very heavy wavy hair, and also actually smells really great</li>
            <li> /&gt;The Clean Cut (Yellow Lid)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m convinced this product is not Reformer, possibly Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Clean Cut.</li>
            <li> I prefer the Paul Mitchell Clean Cut (yellow lid).</li>
            <li> It makes me feel much hotter while out in the North Carolina sun, particularly when running/exercising.  </li>
            <li> From straight pomade to any number of high priced matte finishes.  </li>
            <li> This stuff gives you more flexibility once you put it in your hair and clumps less than similair products.</li>
            <li> Very similar to Crew Fiber, but a tad more wet in the container, where as Fiber is a bit more dry and pasty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overly shiny, and is less so the more you retouch your hair throughout the day.</li>
            <li> main issue I have with this is the hold.  </li>
            <li> I spike my hair/wear it messy and don&#x27;t love it when it is very brittle</li>
            <li> I started using this stuff and along with the Paul Mitchell &amp;#34;Clean Cut&amp;#34; (Yellow top), it&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ll use anymore.</li>
            <li> Like the guy who posted the video review about this one and the yellow one, the yellow one is better even though this states it is stronger</li>
            <li> When you add the price difference between SumoTech (~$35-40) vs Reformer (~$18-25), it&#x27;s not a terrible choice to save a few bucks and still have a reasonably close product.</li>
            <li> Reformer is a bit more of a cream when compared to SumoTech, but the effect of hold and low shine is very similar.</li>
            <li> Price is somewhat high or I would have given 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended product.</li>
            <li> need a product that will provide high hold with a low-to-no-shine.</li>
            <li> LS&amp;B Raw Earth for example is MUCH stronger holding, grittier, and more matte finish.</li>
            <li> Just the right about of hold for my straight flat hair.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the extra cost over the cheaper stuff you can find in the store.</li>
            <li> It holds firmly (though the Clean Cut holds a bit stronger) while still allowing the natural look (this one looks a little more natural than the Clean Cut, at leat for my hair length).</li>
            <li> It is not hard at all and didn&#x27;t meet my needs for spiky/messy hair.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for a strong hold without giving you that nasty gel shine that I can&#x27;t stand.</li>
            <li> It may seem expensive, but a puck of this easily lasts me six months or more.  </li>
            <li> I can still run my fingers through and put it right back into place as if I had just put it on.  </li>
            <li> I know I can&#x27;t be the only person out there who&#x27;s pretty OCD about picking the right products, especially when I&#x27;m spending a little more for \\&quot;higher-end\\&quot; stuff.  </li>
            <li> Though, it seems that using a bit more INITIALLY instead of going back late to add more mitigates the residue (the layering is probably what causes</li>
            <li> If you live in a bug-laden area, avoid this.  </li>
            <li> I like that they have started using a foil seal on the new jar to maintain freshness too.</li>
            <li> Its better than most at not causing your hair to feel dirty by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> Rinsing it off takes a little work too, it doesn&#x27;t come off as easily as the Mitch Reformer.    </li>
            <li> The smell of the Reformer is a little different at first, kind of barber shop-y and maybe a little medicinal, as some other reviewers have noted (although I think of it as being more \\&quot;earthy\\&quot;).  </li>
            <li> And while other reviewers have noted that Clean Cut has a stronger hold, I disagree.  </li>
            <li> It can give that messy look easily while holding your style in place without feeling brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Less is more when applying, I use a dime size total and apply it in 3 doses as I&#x27;m doing my hair in the morning.</li>
            <li> Steer clear.</li>
            <li> No complaints thus far.</li>
            <li> Not real greasy, and it&#x27;s easily pliable after long periods of time.</li>
            <li> What I like about the Reformer is that it gives my hair more texture that D:fi, though it can also mean drying out and wearing off quicker throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Its smell little stronger that the medium holds, put not bad or to long, just for the first 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> { the down side of this is I have almost white - fine</li>
            <li> Also, if I mess up my hair, I can easily just put it back in place with my hands and it stays (even the pieces with height).  </li>
            <li> Small dab rubbed over palms and into the hair, blow-dried, creates thickness, body, bounce and a greater willingness to stay kinda back out of my face.  </li>
            <li> The scent is mild but smells like your typical salon visit.</li>
            <li> The product it self is like a thick paste and easy to scoop out of the tin (soft feeling product).</li>
            <li> Not thick enough.</li>
            <li> I know there&#x27;s no hard evidence one way or the other about parabens causing cancer (and particularly breast cancer),</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t use any product, my hair gets very frizzy, holds no particular shape, and keeps no separation.</li>
            <li> If you put it in while your hair is still a little wet, it gives a healthy shine that can be brushed out with your fingers as soon as it dries (if you want a truly matte look).  </li>
            <li> That sucks, this stuff certainly ain&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li> You do need to be careful in how much you use.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d rather not worry about it, especially with a wife and young daughter in the house.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make the hair sticky and gives it barely any shine.</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m not going to say that Reformer is equal to SumoTech, but it&#x27;s damn near close.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of thin hairs, 3-4 inches on top, with shorter sides...</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it smells WAY too strong.</li>
            <li> but beware...use only a small amount or it will cake up your hair, especially if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li> Extreme hold, very good.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> I am guessing that this product should last a while because you really do not need much product to get the desired effect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a matte finish hair product, but the &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; hold is far weaker than the medium hold in the same line.</li>
            <li> My only real gripe I guess is that it&#x27;s not real strong.</li>
            <li> Not only is it too sticky, leaving it hard to style, but it&#x27;s also a little more shine on my hair than I want.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male with dark, very thick hair that is cut very short on the sides with lots of length and texture on top.</li>
            <li> It hold your hair in its position with a very small amount and it keeps your hair looking natural and normal without the weird gloss of most hair products.</li>
            <li> I went from really long hair to short spikey hair and still use the same product.  </li>
            <li> It does have decent hold, but it smells like toxic waste.</li>
            <li> It works with long or short hair.  </li>
            <li> Not a bad product but not great either.</li>
            <li> I wear my hair pushed forward and across from the back and up in the front (sort of like a conservatively messy soft side part).  </li>
            <li> -hair......and fine-white-Hair is difficult to retain a strong hold.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a flexible, matte hold (not hard or stiff at all) that allows you to keep pieces separated.  </li>
            <li> I have dirty blond/brown, thick, wavy hair and just began using \\&quot;higher-end\\&quot; hair products a few years ago because I realized they work a lot better and last long enough to make it worth it.  </li>
            <li> this helps and is probably an overly long review for some stuff you put in your hair</li>
            <li> Does not hold up all day long.</li>
            <li> For those of you have thick hairs or wants a longer hold throughout the day try the TIGI Bed Head Men Matte Separation Wax.</li>
            <li> It took me a few tries to get the right amount for the style I was going for, and just a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is a review of Mitch Reformer, bought in person at an authorized retailer (which I suggest - you&#x27;ll know what you&#x27;re getting is authentic and it will probably be less expensive than purchasing here).  </li>
            <li> Gives a matte, dry look.</li>
            <li> It is not STRONG ENOUGH ORHEAVY ENOUGH for me.  </li>
            <li> Barbers Classic Pomade (White Lid) is like thin vaseline.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried various Gatsby (brand) products, American Crew, Johnny B, and a few other drugstore brands.</li>
            <li> , I actually prefer using this with slightly damp hair.  </li>
            <li> I found it a little greasy, and I&#x27;ve switched to another product by the same manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I gives my hair a dry look and its not as greasy as other (cheaper) products out there.</li>
            <li> the passenger door(drivers side was pinned closed) and when I looked in a mirror to see if i had any bruises or cuts, I saw my hair and let me tell you, it was on point.</li>
            <li> I just need to control a lifelong cowlick issue and don&#x27;t like to use hair sprays or anything that makes my hair look shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> use less buy less same results</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few other styling products, including all of the American Crew pucks, Bed Head Separation Wax, some Redken pucks, and the other Mitch pucks as well as PM Tea Tree Shaping Cream</li>
            <li> so it might work for shorter or long hair worn messy.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I thought it was, I wanted the stuff they used on me at stylists&#x27;.</li>
            <li> On a scale of 1-5, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a 3.5-4, so there are other products out there that are stronger holding.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of other hair products over the years.</li>
            <li> Ive used hair gel and all sorts of other product on my hair in my 42 years</li>
            <li> Will never purchase another hair product other than this.</li>
            <li> He won&#x27;t use any other brand, so I think that deserves a 5-star rating.</li>
            <li> only benefit is that will a small amount of water, the product refreshes throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected!</li>
            <li> They even decided not to market in China due to their laws on animal testing.</li>
            <li> The product works pretty well, matte finish as described, however, it has a terrible smell when freshly applied.</li>
            <li> Not fun.    </li>
            <li> It is the only hair product which controls my thick hair without looking greasy or gel-like.</li>
            <li> One thing I hate about most hair products is how stuff they make your hair feel.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t paste me hair down</li>
            <li> regards to the smell reviews about it, I don&#x27;t know what the other people are chatting about!</li>
            <li> Over the past 20 years, I&#x27;ve tried almost every single hair gel gunk out there.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest this for anyone with hair that is 2-in or less</li>
            <li> Even with shipping it&#x27;s still less than going to the salon.  </li>
            <li> I typically run my hand through my hair quite a bit throughout the day (don&#x27;t know why</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it&#x27;s still at the same low hold level.</li>
            <li> Too expensive though, cost per ounce is on par with high end scotch that you instead put into your hair.  </li>
            <li> It is also flexible in that you can move your style throughout the day and adjust it and it will stay at that point until you mess with it again.</li>
            <li> With just a little you have body and avoid the everything-washed-out syndrome.  </li>
            <li> Usually hair products either do one or the other well, but not both.</li>
            <li> The smell takes a little getting used to</li>
            <li> Seems to be easier to get the &#x27;messy&#x27; look that</li>
            <li> my husband uses this everyday.</li>
            <li> I work at a hotel so for the way I styled my hair for work which was messy with some spike</li>
            <li> Never thought of changing until I was dating a Paul Mitchell stylist a few months ago</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look stiff or greasy.</li>
            <li> the hold is not strong at all.</li>
            <li> However, I hate how the Clean Cut (which is petrolatum-based, not water-based like the Reformer) makes my hair feel.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully that was just a bad batch, I really like the product otherwise.</li>
            <li> By only using a small amount, you will receive an all day hold that is not sticky or uncomfortable..  </li>
            <li> Pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it</li>
            <li> The smells not strong at all!</li>
            <li> Lasts all day long without fail and without stickiness or shine and even after wearing it all day</li>
            <li> I will admit that once you pick up the scent, it&#x27;s hard to lose it</li>
            <li> The problem with Tigi Bed Head is that it&#x27;s too sticky and hard to style because of it.</li>
            <li> I have had a hard time finding it, but once I discovered it on Amazon, I order it here now</li>
            <li> so I end up wasting part of the bottle when it dries out a bit and loses effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> Had to take off one star because of another negative for this item.  </li>
            <li> (at least that&#x27;s what my lady says).</li>
            <li> at least the products I&#x27;ve used from the line (just the pucks) are all paraben-free.  </li>
            <li> I tolerate it&#x27;s icky price tag.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean that in a bad way it is a way to make your hair shiny and loosely hold it in place.</li>
            <li> I hate buying stuff that ultimately doesn&#x27;t meet my needs.</li>

            <li> I am a fussy guy when it comes to hair and I have to look good at all times due to my profession. This product is perfect for my thick mane, it holds and is easily rearranged throughout the day. It also makes it look more natural, rather than, &#x27;oh yeah, he&#x27;s dolloped a load of product on his head!&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With regards to the smell reviews about it, I don&#x27;t know what the other people are chatting about! The smells not strong at all! Just ignore them, as that&#x27;s ridiculous! It smells fresh and if you wear deodorant, cologne and just wash in general you won&#x27;t be able to smell it after 3 minutes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The supplier I bought this from got it to me in under 3 days! So impressed with that! So in conclusion, I will be buying it again, the supplier is reliable and don&#x27;t listen to the &#x27;smell moaners&#x27;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars :D</li>
            <li> By only using a small amount, you will receive an all day hold that is not sticky or uncomfortable..  Ideal for short to medium length hair.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Keeps hair in place without shine or stickyness.</li>
            <li> Product came on time as described. Works perfectly. A+++</li>
            <li> I typically use Paul Mitchel Re-Works to style my hair, and while I am happy with how it works, I don&#x27;t use it fast enough so I end up wasting part of the bottle when it dries out a bit and loses effectiveness.  Also, I find that the longer my hair gets (I keep it short), the more &#x27;gunky&#x27; the Re-works gets when styling.  Thus, I was looking for something that comes in a smaller quantity (3oz helps for plane travel too) that would have similar results and work a bit better on longer hair.  So, based on reviews, I went with the Reformer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll cover the elephant in the room first:  the scent.  Yes, it is a bit strong and has a bit of a &#x27;medicine-like&#x27; note to it (though I find it to be more of a woodsy scent overall).  I, nor anyone I asked, found the odor overpowering though.  I will admit that once you pick up the scent, it&#x27;s hard to lose it (you&#x27;ll never forget you&#x27;re wearing the stuff).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main issue I have with this is the hold.  It goes on nicely, and is easy to style with, even with longer hair (2 inches, give or take).  But, the hold just isn&#x27;t there with the amount you have to use (yes, I said &#x27;have to&#x27;...I&#x27;ll explain below).  It&#x27;ll hold the hair for a bit, but a strong breeze or any type of humidity is enough to knock the style out of place.  Yes, it&#x27;s easy to re-style without more product, but that shouldn&#x27;t be what&#x27;s expected with a strong-hold product.  Adding more product to get a stronger hold isn&#x27;t in the cards, as it tends to leave a white residue the more it is used.  I have blonde hair, and it can even be seen in my light hair.  Though, it seems that using a bit more INITIALLY instead of going back late to add more mitigates the residue (the layering is probably what causes it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I actually prefer using this with slightly damp hair.  Seems to be easier to get the &#x27;messy&#x27; look that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s not too bad, but honestly not sure I&#x27;ll purchase it again once this tin runs out in a couple months.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:  Had to take off one star because of another negative for this item.  If you live in a bug-laden area, avoid this.  It seems to attract bugs for miles.  Gnats, flies, even mosquitoes seem to be drawn to the scent of the product.  Each time I&#x27;ve worn this and either been in a buggy area or been outside around dusk, it&#x27;s acted as a magnet that gives a bug zapper a run for it&#x27;s money.  I think I&#x27;ll definitely pass on getting more of this once it runs out.</li>
            <li> Good for texture but beware...use only a small amount or it will cake up your hair, especially if you have fine hair. Go easy on the product and it will work great.</li>
            <li> I stole this from my husband who brought it home from his barber.  I love the way this product works - strong, matte hold, doesn&#x27;t get \\&quot;gunky\\&quot; or look white when applied to hair.  It does, however, have an unfortunate fragrance.  It is not overpowering... but I only gave it 4/5 stars because of this.  Worth trying!</li>
            <li> Matte finish...yes. Strong hold...no. Go with the BedHead Matte Separation instead if you like a lot of hold.</li>
            <li> Returning user of this paste, but this time it smelled horrible when I opened the container. Strong toxic smell. However, the smell went mostly away after a week or so. I did not want to go through the hustle of returning it. Hopefully that was just a bad batch, I really like the product otherwise.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product but not great either. It states is offers strong hold but after it I run it through my hair the hold is not strong at all. Even after putting a little more in the hold still isn&#x27;t great. Once it drys its like there&#x27;s nothing in your hair. I don&#x27;t paste me hair down but I do want it to stay in place mostly. I have medium length hair so it might work for shorter or long hair worn messy. But if your looking for a clean look with a strong hold this isn&#x27;t for you. Pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product has one of the strongest smells thats just too strong.  The times I worn this.. I keep asking myself if I laid a ninja fart, would anyone notice.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday, works great. Able to style my hair but doesn&#x27;t get crunchy. Remains flexible throughout the day without the residue.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;. The product it self is like a thick paste and easy to scoop out of the tin (soft feeling product). I wouldn&#x27;t classify this as a wax or clay, the hold just isn&#x27;t as strong. It&#x27;s very pliable and you can work it into your hair easily, and it leaves your hair very natural where you can still run your fingers through it without any fuss after applying. For those looking for a natural feel with a very light hold, this works well. But if you like something with a defined hold or sculpt that keeps its hold all day, this product might disappoint. I would suggest this for anyone with hair that is 2-in or less</li>
            <li> I do like the hold, fragrance, and the fact it is mostly matte in finish. Although with time and with natural oils in your hair, it doesn&#x27;t smell as fresh at the end of the day, which is understandable. The only downside to this is the pomade clumps your hair, and doesn&#x27;t keep the strands fully separated. I might go back to Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shaping Cream afterwards, or even Dove Men hair styling paste.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after it was shown to me by my hairstylist. It took me a few tries to get the right amount for the style I was going for, and just a little goes a long way. It holds all day even in the southern humidity.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Exactly how it&#x27;s advertised</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo12Z28H6AUKM93]]I am reviewing three similar products in the included video to compare and contrast the products. I spike my hair/wear it messy and don&#x27;t love it when it is very brittle/crusty (like when you use most gels). It is important to note that these are demo sizes and not the 3 oz. size. (In the video they are .35oz. I am guessing that this product should last a while because you really do not need much product to get the desired effect. I read a review where someone felt the scent was strong. It is definitely scented and I actually like the scent of all three. I don&#x27;t feel that it is off putting in the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Barbers Classic Pomade (White Lid) is like thin vaseline. I don&#x27;t mean that in a bad way it is a way to make your hair shiny and loosely hold it in place. It is not hard at all and didn&#x27;t meet my needs for spiky/messy hair. If thats your thing then go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Reformer (Red Lid) is labeled as a texturizer with strong hold and a matte finish. This is why I did the video review. While labeled as a strong hold I don&#x27;t think it is necessarily so. I like the product and it is not as strong as the Clean cut product which is more waxy. This product is the consistency of drying glue. It Best suited me and I really liked it. It can give that messy look easily while holding your style in place without feeling brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Clean Cut (Yellow Lid) Product is labeled as a medium hold / Semi-matte styling cream. I felt that it had the strongest hold. Out of the jar it has the consistency of similar wax type products. The end result is similar to the Reformer product but is not applied as easily. It still doesn&#x27;t appear shiny when on and does not have a brittle finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps and is probably an overly long review for some stuff you put in your hair but I thought it was necessary. I hate buying stuff that ultimately doesn&#x27;t meet my needs.</li>
            <li> keeps my hair lookin goooooooooood. get it for the hair, use it for the ladies. make em say UGHHHHH NA NA NA NAAAaaaaaaaa!</li>
            <li> It definitely did what I wanted it to do. I could reform my hair even after having it in my hair for 8 hours. But the smell...the smell is pungent and sometimes offensive. Unfortunately, the smell is the reason I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again</li>
            <li> This stuff gives you more flexibility once you put it in your hair and clumps less than similair products. Get it!</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I thought it was, I wanted the stuff they used on me at stylists&#x27;. Turns out the use Rejuvinator, which can&#x27;t be ordered retail, available from them only. This stuff works great, stays a little softer and thus stickier than their other product, but is an excellent product Nd I like it much better than gel.</li>
            <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;Introduced to it 4 months ago and I&#x27;m hooked. Ideal for sculpting 2-3 inch hair great finish and holds all day.</li>
            <li> Received a sample of this after getting a haircut, and it works fairly well. However, it smells terrible. I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it but it must be similar to some toxic chemical. It is really gross and I had to throw it away.</li>
            <li> Bought this after using a sample from my barber. All I asked was to make it look like the picture. Pretty close. No complaints thus far.</li>
            <li> The best hair product out there. The packaging/label are kinda lame and uninspiring, but the product is the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for some time. My wife actually likes the smell. Like anything smell related for the most part its subjective. I would go to a salon or whoever carries this locally and take a whiff before not purchasing.  You do need to be careful in how much you use.  It is prone to flaking but this is good news. use less buy less same results</li>
            <li> It seems to hold fine but it has a nasty smell that I hated.  I didn&#x27;t notice it when I bought it but once I put it in my hair I did, and if I had time I would have washed it out before my date.  I wore this on a date and she mentioned that it smelled like a toxic chemical.  There are better options.</li>
            <li> Product smells good, holds OK. Not thick enough. I&#x27;m convinced this product is not Reformer, possibly Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Clean Cut.</li>
            <li> Just the right about of hold for my straight flat hair. I would not suggest for curly hair. Price is somewhat high or I would have given 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for many years, after salon recommendation.  Bought it here to save money and a trip.  This stuff is perfect for me - without it my hair looks like Luke Skywalker in the first Star Wars movie - but with it I&#x27;m one of the Beatles, circa 1968.  Small dab rubbed over palms and into the hair, blow-dried, creates thickness, body, bounce and a greater willingness to stay kinda back out of my face.  I have no idea why they call it &amp;#34;strong hold&amp;#34; because it would only do that if you slathered it on.  With just a little you have body and avoid the everything-washed-out syndrome.  I think of it as &#x27;clean gunk&#x27; - in a good way.</li>
            <li> The product works pretty well, matte finish as described, however, it has a terrible smell when freshly applied. (smells kind of like paint) Will try another product next time because of that.</li>
            <li> I keep my hair short/medium length year-around but am very particular of how it looks. I like to style it but I don&#x27;t like the gelled/greasy/&amp;#34;try too hard&amp;#34; look at all. I started using this stuff and along with the Paul Mitchell &amp;#34;Clean Cut&amp;#34; (Yellow top), it&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ll use anymore. It holds firmly (though the Clean Cut holds a bit stronger) while still allowing the natural look (this one looks a little more natural than the Clean Cut, at leat for my hair length). I&#x27;ve been told that it&#x27;s healthy for your hair in comparison to other products out there. Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 5 months now and I use it every day. This is the first product I apply before anything else goes into it. It works best after blow drying when the heat is still caught in your hair. This stuff makes it easy for me to get the desired shape and texture. The scent is mild but smells like your typical salon visit. I don&#x27;t kind it. You will notice the difference when you start using higher end products in your hair. This is a matte finish, which basically means there will be no shine to your hair when you apply it. Great for that short, messy look. Also great when paired with American Crew Grooming Cream. Spend the money, gather the compliments. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> my husband uses this everyday. product came very fast and was new. works great for texturing short hair.</li>
            <li> I originally ordered this to help style my faux hawk but it didn&#x27;t do the trick but I will say it&#x27;s still a great product. I work at a hotel so for the way I styled my hair for work which was messy with some spike it worked great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of mens hair products, and this is definitely my favorite. It works well, holds really well for my very heavy wavy hair, and also actually smells really great (at least that&#x27;s what my lady says). It doesn&#x27;t leave that &amp;#34;glazed doughnut&amp;#34; look, or any weird specks or &amp;#34;debris&amp;#34; that some products I&#x27;ve tried have. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This paste is the best I&#x27;ve found. its not revolutionary or anything, and its similar to the Crew ones, just not as sticky. Works good.</li>
            <li> Really good product. Very similar to Crew Fiber, but a tad more wet in the container, where as Fiber is a bit more dry and pasty. This product works well into your hair and has good hold, good pliability, and smells great. Not as strong holding as they say though. On a scale of 1-5, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a 3.5-4, so there are other products out there that are stronger holding. LS&amp;B Raw Earth for example is MUCH stronger holding, grittier, and more matte finish. But overall, this is a great product and one I would recommend to anyone wanting a good hold, but still looks very natural, smells good, pliable, and doesn&#x27;t gum up your hair. Good for messy or clean looks I&#x27;ve found, which is rare. Usually hair products either do one or the other well, but not both. So that is another plus!</li>
            <li> This is a great wax/paste for really holding hair in place.  It works with long or short hair.  I went from really long hair to short spikey hair and still use the same product.  My wife uses it too and she has shoulder length hair.  I like that they have started using a foil seal on the new jar to maintain freshness too.</li>
            <li> I like this better than the blue label crew reformer.  Too expensive though, cost per ounce is on par with high end scotch that you instead put into your hair.  A shame.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for a strong hold without giving you that nasty gel shine that I can&#x27;t stand. It is also flexible in that you can move your style throughout the day and adjust it and it will stay at that point until you mess with it again. Great product for shorter cuts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of other hair products over the years. I tried this one on a recommendation from a stylist at Floyd&#x27;s 99, and it didn&#x27;t disappoint. It holds well, doesn&#x27;t smell too strongly, and gives me the matte /  texture I prefer. Definitely worth the extra cost over the cheaper stuff you can find in the store.</li>
            <li> I found it a little greasy, and I&#x27;ve switched to another product by the same manufacturer.</li>
            <li> nice product, doesnt make my hair sticky</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I gives my hair a dry look and its not as greasy as other (cheaper) products out there.</li>
            <li> Like the guy who posted the video review about this one and the yellow one, the yellow one is better even though this states it is stronger</li>
            <li> This product held my hair up and perfect through my car accident that totaled my car. I got out the passenger door(drivers side was pinned closed) and when I looked in a mirror to see if i had any bruises or cuts, I saw my hair and let me tell you, it was on point. good job, Paul mitchell. nice product.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this product exclusively. Nice hold. Doesn&#x27;t look stiff or greasy. The smell takes a little getting used to but it&#x27;s pleasant and masculine.</li>
            <li> Perfect for fine short hair that needs texture with a soft hold</li>
            <li> I have experienced this product twice at the barbers after a hair cut. At first it looks really nice but once I get into my car I can smell the odor it gives off. Very strong musky/black licorice smell which gave me a headache. Came home and washed it out immediatly. I prefer the Paul Mitchell Clean Cut (yellow lid). Very pleasant smell and nice hold that allows you to move your fingers through it without feeling sticky.</li>
            <li> I have been using this reformer for several months and am happy to find a supplier that supplies it at a cheaper price than in the salon or store. Excellent product that I will continue using for many years to come.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best, longest lasting, most reformable product I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ve tried various Gatsby (brand) products, American Crew, Johnny B, and a few other drugstore brands. This is the one that I keep coming back to. I have a lot of thin hairs, 3-4 inches on top, with shorter sides... kind of a classic/&amp;#34;Great Gatsby&amp;#34;-esque look, and this stuff is great. It&#x27;s not overly shiny, and is less so the more you retouch your hair throughout the day. Less is more when applying, I use a dime size total and apply it in 3 doses as I&#x27;m doing my hair in the morning. Lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked for years for a hair product that can hold my hair yet not be shiny or weird looking. My search ended when one day in a salon my stylist recommended this product about 2-3 years ago and I have been using it ever since. It hold your hair in its position with a very small amount and it keeps your hair looking natural and normal without the weird gloss of most hair products. As a person prone to getting dandruff if I use a bad hair product it has also never affected my scalp badly. Love this gel I hope they never stop making it.</li>
            <li> Great hair gel for men- similar to Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s Tsumotech- but is cruelty free!</li>
            <li> Not what I thought. It gathering dust in a drawer.</li>
            <li> amazing love this product</li>
            <li> Might be more expensive than I&#x27;d like. Axe stuff is totally comparable.... Maybe better?</li>
            <li> Good hold with hardness</li>
            <li> It is ok, like others have mentioned, these are not &amp;#34;strong hold&amp;#34;. For those of you have thick hairs or wants a longer hold throughout the day try the TIGI Bed Head Men Matte Separation Wax. However, this will work great with thin hairs or just for the evening events, that way no one will get sticky fingers when touches your hair. ;)</li>
            <li> It does exactly as expected, however I would have liked a product that has a stronger hold. I was told this was the best product for me, it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Ive used hair gel and all sorts of other product on my hair in my 42 years and I must say that this is the first time I&#x27;ve EVER found something that makes my hair do exactly what I want it to each and every time.  Never thought of changing until I was dating a Paul Mitchell stylist a few months ago and she recommended it.  Been buying it at a salon for just over $20 so I was very excited to find it here on Amazon for $13.  Even with shipping it&#x27;s still less than going to the salon.  Lasts all day long without fail and without stickiness or shine and even after wearing it all day I can still run my fingers through and put it right back into place as if I had just put it on.  Will never purchase another hair product other than this.</li>
            <li> Mix with Paul Mitchell Dry Wax for a great look every day! Even during 18 hour days it keeps my hair looking good.</li>
            <li> It smells like cat flea shampoo. It works well but whenever I smell it I think of bathing my cat.</li>
            <li> Extreme hold, very good.&lt;br /&gt;Not greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps all in place.&lt;br /&gt;Great effects! I will buy more.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;Congratulations on the formula!!</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite brand of hair gel/texturizer. He uses it every day! And he has great hair, so it works well. :-) He won&#x27;t use any other brand, so I think that deserves a 5-star rating.</li>
            <li> This is a review of Mitch Reformer, bought in person at an authorized retailer (which I suggest - you&#x27;ll know what you&#x27;re getting is authentic and it will probably be less expensive than purchasing here).  I have dirty blond/brown, thick, wavy hair and just began using \\&quot;higher-end\\&quot; hair products a few years ago because I realized they work a lot better and last long enough to make it worth it.  I wear my hair pushed forward and across from the back and up in the front (sort of like a conservatively messy soft side part).  It&#x27;s usually short on the sides and 1-3\\&quot; on top.  If I don&#x27;t use any product, my hair gets very frizzy, holds no particular shape, and keeps no separation. I&#x27;ve tried quite a few other styling products, including all of the American Crew pucks, Bed Head Separation Wax, some Redken pucks, and the other Mitch pucks as well as PM Tea Tree Shaping Cream (luckily they were returnable).  Mitch Reformer is easily my favorite.    The consistency is kind of like a paste or slightly creamy clay.  You can easily spread it out on your hands and fingers without getting chunks.  I&#x27;d say the hold is about an 8 or 8.5 out of 10.  It&#x27;s a flexible, matte hold (not hard or stiff at all) that allows you to keep pieces separated.  If you put it in while your hair is still a little wet, it gives a healthy shine that can be brushed out with your fingers as soon as it dries (if you want a truly matte look).  I typically run my hand through my hair quite a bit throughout the day (don&#x27;t know why, it&#x27;s just a habit), and with Mitch Reformer in, my hair feels soft and I don&#x27;t end up with any kind of residue on my hand.  Also, if I mess up my hair, I can easily just put it back in place with my hands and it stays (even the pieces with height).  I&#x27;d assume this is why it&#x27;s called \\&quot;Reformer.\\&quot;    Besides the way it makes my hair look, my favorite thing about this product is how my it feels in my hair.  I live in North Carolina, where it gets pretty hot and humid in the summer, and I&#x27;m a runner.  I love that the Reformer is water-based.  When using this product, I don&#x27;t notice anything in my hair - it feels nice and light as if there&#x27;s nothing in it.  And even when sweating a lot, I don&#x27;t notice any residue coming from my hair (and it stays reasonably in place and doesn&#x27;t get frizzy).  One thing I&#x27;ve noticed about just about every other product I&#x27;ve used is that it starts to feel like it&#x27;s melting all over my head when I sweat - nasty and slimy feeling.  Not fun.    Many other Mitch product reviewers have said that they prefer the Clean Cut, which I do think works well.  However, I hate how the Clean Cut (which is petrolatum-based, not water-based like the Reformer) makes my hair feel.  It&#x27;s very greasy and heavy.  It kind of makes my scalp feel like it can&#x27;t breathe and I get greasy gunk on my hand and whenever I run it through my hair.  It makes me feel much hotter while out in the North Carolina sun, particularly when running/exercising.  And while other reviewers have noted that Clean Cut has a stronger hold, I disagree.  In my own experience, the Reformer definitely has a stronger hold (while still being flexible).  If the Reformer&#x27;s hold is 8-8.5 out of 10, then I&#x27;d say the Clean Cut is about a 6-7 out of 10.  And the Barber&#x27;s Classic pomade is shiny and good at smoothing hair, but provides almost no hold - not for me anyways.    The smell of the Reformer is a little different at first, kind of barber shop-y and maybe a little medicinal, as some other reviewers have noted (although I think of it as being more \\&quot;earthy\\&quot;).  And it does kind of stay with you.  I notice the scent at different times throughout the day when wearing this product, but I personally do like it.  I wasn&#x27;t sure how others might feel about it, but a couple of nights ago my wife happened to smell my hair when I was sitting with her and she told me it smelled amazing.  So no problems there for me.    Another thing I like about the Reformer is that you don&#x27;t need a whole lot of this stuff for it to be effective.  It may seem expensive, but a puck of this easily lasts me six months or more.  I don&#x27;t mind paying $3-4 a month to feel confident about how my hair looks, and that&#x27;s how I look at a purchase like this.    Finally, this product is paraben-free.  I know there&#x27;s no hard evidence one way or the other about parabens causing cancer (and particularly breast cancer), but I&#x27;d rather not worry about it, especially with a wife and young daughter in the house.  I don&#x27;t know why Paul Mitchell doesn&#x27;t push this fact in their marketing of the Mitch line, but at least the products I&#x27;ve used from the line (just the pucks) are all paraben-free.  And if you see ingredient lists for the Mitch pucks including parabens online, they&#x27;re incorrect (or counterfeit products).  Trust.    I know I can&#x27;t be the only person out there who&#x27;s pretty OCD about picking the right products, especially when I&#x27;m spending a little more for \\&quot;higher-end\\&quot; stuff.  I can honestly say this has been the best matte styling product I&#x27;ve found, without a doubt.  I hope this has been helpful for you!</li>
            <li> Over the past 20 years, I&#x27;ve tried almost every single hair gel gunk out there.  From straight pomade to any number of high priced matte finishes.  I don&#x27;t do anything crazy with my hair...I just need to control a lifelong cowlick issue and don&#x27;t like to use hair sprays or anything that makes my hair look shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is easily the best I&#x27;ve tried, from any brand/manufacturer out there.  Good stuff, works as advertised.  It&#x27;s a bit cheaper if you buy at Ulta or your nearest big-box beauty aids retailer.  But its so convenient to get it via Prime.</li>
            <li> Works grate. Love it, you can use in dry hair, not sticky, not shining, good smell, reasonable price. Its smell little stronger that the medium holds, put not bad or to long, just for the first 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Really recomende it.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s great if you want to be able to style your hair without it looking like you dipped your head in glue. It&#x27;s a very matte finish, and the hold is really strong but still lets you mold it throughout the day. I plan on using this product until they discontinue it, which is hopefully never!</li>
            <li> Great hold and a little goes a long way. Much better than gel or hairspray for guys. Highly recommended product.</li>
            <li> It does have decent hold, but it smells like toxic waste. I&#x27;m usually not very sensitive to smells, but this stuff is just awful. It does have some fragrance, but it&#x27;s as though it&#x27;s just there to try to mask the foulness. Kind of the porta-potty concept, to be blunt. Steer clear.</li>
            <li> Works great! Lasts for a while.</li>
            <li> Good product,holds wild hair in place.</li>
            <li> I have the popular hairstyle where it&#x27;s short on the sides and back, then fades up to longer hair on top and kinda spiky/swooped - like Adam Levine: http://us.cdn281.fansshare.com/photos/adamlevine/adam-levine-wallpaper-1034979375.jpg    I have tried what some consider to be the top 3 options on Amazon: Paul Mitchell Mitch Reformer, Tigi Bed Head Matte Separation Wax, and American Crew Fiber. I believe Mitch Reformer to be the superior option of the 3 for my hair and style. I am looking for something that I can style outside the range of 5 seconds after putting it in my hands, something that won&#x27;t shine my hair at all, something that will hold throughout the day, and something that will rinse off easily. Mitch Reformer does all these things, though not so much hold great throughout the day.    The problem with Tigi Bed Head is that it&#x27;s too sticky and hard to style because of it. It does well with holding throughout the day and leaves my hair with the matte finish, but if I can&#x27;t style it the way I want, it&#x27;s not going to pass my test. Rinsing it off takes a little work too, it doesn&#x27;t come off as easily as the Mitch Reformer.    The problem with American Crew Fiber is a couple things. Not only is it too sticky, leaving it hard to style, but it&#x27;s also a little more shine on my hair than I want. This was by far the worst to rinse off. There is no way I can recommend American Crew Fiber because of these things.    The solution I have came up with to make the Mitch Reformer hold a little better throughout the day is touch it with a little hair spray and you&#x27;re good to go. I would definitely recommend Mitch Reformer out of the 3 products I tried. Definitely the best of the 3. And the smell doesn&#x27;t bother me at all - I actually kinda preferred it.</li>
            <li> Although, if combined with Paul Mitchel ESP, it works great.  I would not buy this product again.  The product also does not have a strong hold</li>
            <li> a bit dry for my perfect liking but cool to have a change up from the &amp;#34;clean cut&amp;#34; or the tea trea shaping cream. great dry hold</li>
            <li> I like it just OK.........It is not STRONG ENOUGH ORHEAVY ENOUGH for me.  I am  an Older Lady and ware my short hair in kind of a Modern -Version...of the &#x27;&#x27;Spike&amp;#34;.......I do use it and also the Salon I go to for my hair-Cuts has it on Display and she uses it and she uses it on me.......{ the down side of this is I have almost white - fine -hair......and fine-white-Hair is difficult to retain a strong hold.  I am sure it is perfect for Men or Women who are younger and have good Hair to work with.....  It is designed I am sure for younger people who have good thick - normal hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a matte finish hair product, but the &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; hold is far weaker than the medium hold in the same line. Avoid this product if you need a stronger hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only benefit is that will a small amount of water, the product refreshes throughout the day. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s still at the same low hold level.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, it smells amazing, it has a good hold throughout the day and it doesn&#x27;t look like you dumped a handful of gel on your head. The matte finish is great and you can get some pretty good hold out of the stuff all day long. Its not greasy either. I have pretty curly hair and it works great to straighten out certain curls in the morning that just want to do their own thing. This stuff is great.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product for both men and women!  I have a short haircut and use this daily!  I love the way it holds without ever being sticky or greasy looking!  I have had a couple co workers ask me what I use in my hair because they like the look!  It has a nice scent but not so strong that it smell like men&#x27;s cologne..It is definately a product for both sexes.  I have had a hard time finding it, but once I discovered it on Amazon, I order it here now and it&#x27;s SO much cheaper than buying it in a salon!  I paid almost $20 for it at first from my hair salon.  It is around $13 here on Amazon!  Great product I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best hair products I have ever used. Easy to work in, and style without looking like theres gel in your hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  It works well with short hair ~ holding it in place all day and I like how it smells.</li>
            <li> Husband didn&#x27;t like it. Too gooey.</li>
            <li> I alternate between this and the D:fi D:struct hair creme, which is much more &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; like that the Reformer. What I like about the Reformer is that it gives my hair more texture that D:fi, though it can also mean drying out and wearing off quicker throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It has been my favorite gel to use since the day I bought it. Doesn&#x27;t make the hair sticky and gives it barely any shine. When I would run my hand through my hair no white flakes would show up in my hair.</li>
            <li> I am a really big fan of the Bumble &amp; Bumble SumoTech, but I got my haircut on vacation in Seattle (at Raven) and they put me onto Mitch Reformer. Now, I&#x27;m not going to say that Reformer is equal to SumoTech, but it&#x27;s damn near close. When you add the price difference between SumoTech (~$35-40) vs Reformer (~$18-25), it&#x27;s not a terrible choice to save a few bucks and still have a reasonably close product. Reformer is a bit more of a cream when compared to SumoTech, but the effect of hold and low shine is very similar.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected! This is the best thing for my hair and I will continue to order this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it was recommended to me after I changed my hairstyle to a shorter cut.  Good for making your hair look messy without too much shine or making it too sticky so that you can&#x27;t run your hands through it.  Provides a fairly strong hold and it seems fairly neutral in scent to me which is nice.</li>
            <li> This is a salon-only product and getting it on Amazon is so much easier. It is the only hair product which controls my thick hair without looking greasy or gel-like. It has a distinct pine scent, which I don&#x27;t enjoy but it doesn&#x27;t linger much once applied to the hair.</li>
            <li> Great product. Came on time.</li>
            <li> I have ever before&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best hair wax for me</li>
            <li> Not great for longer hair.  Does not hold up all day long.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, fantastic way to secretly shape temperamental hair. Doesn&#x27;t look like you have anything in your hair- this is great stuff. This stuff has worked for me better than cheaper axe branded stuff I got at the drugstore. Guess all hair products aren&#x27;t created equal. That sucks, this stuff certainly ain&#x27;t cheap. But it works, works well, and I constantly get &amp;#34;nice hair&amp;#34; compliments when I use it, so I tolerate it&#x27;s icky price tag.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of gels, goos, waxes etc, and this stuff is completely different than all of those. Gives a matte, dry look. Not real greasy, and it&#x27;s easily pliable after long periods of time. I love that it doesn&#x27;t give you that frozen wet look like a gel. It does have a strong smell, and although I kinda like it, I can see how some others might not. My only real gripe I guess is that it&#x27;s not real strong. A good strong breeze will blow your hair around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, my hair is about 2\\&quot; long on top, and I use maybe 3/4 of a dime size.</li>
            <li> Its better than most at not causing your hair to feel dirty by the end of the day.  It has a pleasant smell.  Probably won&#x27;t get it again though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male with dark, very thick hair that is cut very short on the sides with lots of length and texture on top. Basically like a Nick Wooster cut, except thicker and darker.&lt;br /&gt;I need a product that will provide high hold with a low-to-no-shine. My hair is slightly messy/bed head-y, and this product gives great messy texture while also giving it a great amount of hold and a little amount of shine.&lt;br /&gt;On my search for the best Matte product, this might be it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Yes, it is better than American Crew Fiber.</li>
            <li> One thing I hate about most hair products is how stuff they make your hair feel. This hair cream is good for a soft feel to your hair while doing light hair styling. You can use more for a stronger hold, but for my hair style it wasn&#x27;t necessary (and if you use more it does become more noticeable in your hair).</li>
            <li> New favorite hair product (old one was B&amp;B Sumo Wax). Gives me great flexible hold without being too greasy (compared to Sumo Wax). My only complaint is that it smells WAY too strong. Please note, I didn&#x27;t say it smells bad. I would just rather that my hair product not smell at all.    I found this hair product when I started looking for cruelty-free products. From what information I can find, it seems that Paul Mitchell is dedicated to using NO animal testing. They even decided not to market in China due to their laws on animal testing.</li>
            <li> I used to buy Aveda styling clay but it costs 30 bucks. This is half the price, smells great, doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy, and has great flowing hold.</li>
