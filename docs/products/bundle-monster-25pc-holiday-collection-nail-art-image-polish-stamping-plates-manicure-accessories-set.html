            <li>This is my first plates from Bundle Monster and I absolutely Love&#x27;em!</li>
            <li>Purchased for my grand daughter, she is so excited over this set.</li>
            <li>The stamps are easy to use</li>
            <li>They are easy to use.</li>
            <li>they all seem to transfer just fine.</li>
            <li>but Bundle Monster is perfect and today I placed an order to get the new collection \\&quot;CYO\\&quot; and the organizer case :) definitely will be buying rest of the sets that Bundle Monster has.</li>
            <li>Covers all the holidays, very cute designs and come out very clear!</li>
            <li>The plates are great and there&#x27;s such a variety for any holiday or occasion like a wedding, birthday or baby shower!</li>
            <li>These did arrive with one plate missing, but I contacted BM about it and their customer service was wonderful-</li>
            <li>So many fun designs.  </li>
            <li>so i got free shipping.  </li>
            <li>I am still learning but cant wait to try all the fabulous stamp art.  </li>
            <li>Only problem is I have to keep up with all of them lol.</li>
            <li>The images are very fun.</li>
            <li>I have several other BM sets and they are all really great with many cute options and stamp nicely.</li>
            <li>Quality is consistent from plate-to-plate.. simply top notch.</li>
            <li>Was totally excited to order this bundle.  </li>
            <li>Such a nice product!  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this plate.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive this set.</li>
            <li>I was pleased when i first saw the plates.  </li>
            <li>collection quality is very good maybe one complain on the halloween one with the pumpkin you have to slide the scraper slightly</li>
            <li>Clean images.</li>
            <li>The print comes out with clean lines and you can see all the details on your nail.</li>
            <li>I usually only use nail art for special occasions like holidays, so having so many choices for nail looks each holiday is really nice.  </li>
            <li>I have all 2 series, and this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li>it will scrape the nail polish off and you dont want that just do that image with a light hand but other than that no problems love them!!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s everything from cute to sophisticated, appealing to a wide variety of tastes.</li>
            <li>They came inthe mail very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;There are so many holiday&#x27;s on the plates</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t draw very well, and this opens so many possibilities for me.</li>
            <li>I was doing my friend&#x27;s nails and it took me forever to get the stamp she wanted to come out in full on my stamper.</li>
            <li>Great variety of holiday patterns for young and mature users.</li>
            <li>Bundle Monster ships quickly</li>
            <li>These came quickly.</li>
            <li>Great product was exactly what I wanted and expected.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>but most of the &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; finger stamps would only fit my index and pinky fingers.</li>
            <li>It should be fun experimenting .</li>
            <li>The images are clear and there are so many of them.</li>
            <li>Lots of fun images to choose from for every holiday you can think of and then some.</li>
            <li>The fullsize images are nice and big</li>
            <li>, I should also point out that, like always, the Bundle Monster plates stamp cleanly and clearly, are securely packaged, and always arrive quickly after ordering.  </li>
            <li>Thank you Bundle Monster for never disappointing me.</li>
            <li>I really liked the designs but a lot of them don&#x27;t work and a lot of them are too big.</li>
            <li>but to my surprise they are just right.</li>
            <li>I love how this set includes some of the non-main-stream holidays like Cinco de Mayo and Chinese New Year :-)</li>
            <li>fast delivery, images are cool and something for every celebration of the year!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The etching into the plate is deep enough to create clear beautiful images onto the nail!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve gotten pretty good at it with my other sets.</li>
            <li>And the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>Love the designs on this set, I like most every single one as far as stamping.</li>
            <li>with the help of these it makes it so much easier!</li>
            <li>The only thing I dislike is that I don&#x27;t more than 10 finger to design.</li>
            <li>Compared to similar product which i have Wistonia holiday bundle this seems to have more holidays.</li>
            <li>ok the only reason i bough this set is because i saw a fellow YouTuber use the 4th of July plate in one of her videos....</li>
            <li>These plates have really cute designs for different holidays.</li>
            <li>Others have said that their stamps don&#x27;t always pick up a clear image, but I can&#x27;t stress how important it is to use 100% acetone with all stamping plates.  </li>
            <li>Love the variety of items represented for the different holidays.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Wish there was more designs that I would actually use.</li>
            <li>All the images are clear and cute and new.</li>
            <li>But MOST of them are too big for normal sized fingers.  </li>
            <li>Large size stamps for longer or wider nails.  </li>
            <li>I really like cheeky brand they work really well</li>
            <li>Just what I wanted, fast shipping as described.</li>
            <li>These stamp really well</li>
            <li>Fast shipping 👍 bundle monster plates</li>
            <li>But what I also really appreciate about this collection is the fact that the designs are not just Holiday-themed, but also seasonal.  </li>
            <li>Real bummer.</li>
            <li>You really have to test out all your plates to see which images work</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>at first I thought my nail beds would be too big for the full images</li>
            <li>I appreciate that they have designs for occasions that most other holiday plates don&#x27;t have (graduation, baby shower, etc.).</li>
            <li>This is such a cool idea.  </li>
            <li>Some of the plates are not etched deep enough, but enough of the plates work that this is a good deal.</li>
            <li>I have to say that I LOVE ALL the other designs to!  </li>
            <li>The problem is that more than half of them don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>The images in this particular set are all holiday/event themed, and consist of full nail designs as well as coordinating single images.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait till Christmas nails and new years and valentines day nails.</li>
            <li>I can only fit them on my big toenail.</li>
            <li>and I nails pretty and different.</li>
            <li>The 1st set was not good, but the designs are nice too.</li>
            <li>14yr old loves this set.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wanting to do holiday specific nails but all the other plates I have don&#x27;t really fit the bill since they aren&#x27;t geared specifically towards all the major holidays!</li>
            <li>Rather than just having iconic &amp;#34;holiday&amp;#34; images like Santa or Easter eggs, the designs also feature a wide variety of seasonal and general party-themed plates for other celebratory occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that</li>
            <li>The plates also have a permanent plastic backing that makes them easier and safer to handle, so no sharp edges, yay!    </li>
            <li>I ordered them last fall, so I have used them for Halloween, El Dia de Los Muertos, Thanksgiving, Christmas  and New Years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had stamping plates from this company for a year now and as long as you keep them clean and don&#x27;t overuse the designs, they last a long time and don&#x27;t bend.</li>
            <li>Most of the plates were scratched up and the etching was not deep enough so some of the images are hard to stamp.</li>
            <li>Regular nail polish remover is often infused with vitamin oils that leave a residue on the plates and prevent the image from picking up clearly.  </li>
            <li>This set is so difficult to work with because the designs aren&#x27;t cut deep enough to create a good, in tact stamp.</li>
            <li>Images always stamp crisp, even the extremely fine/detailed ones!</li>
            <li>Had to wait so long for them to get to me, because I live in CR</li>
            <li>Usually the ones with thicker lines don&#x27;t pick up the polish completely, like they are not etched consistently or something.</li>
            <li>And the price point makes them a fantastic value over other stamping plates out there, hands down!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this set to anyone especially to the gals that has wide bed nails</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The stamps are easy to use</li>
            <li> They are easy to use.</li>
            <li> they all seem to transfer just fine.</li>
            <li> but Bundle Monster is perfect and today I placed an order to get the new collection \\&quot;CYO\\&quot; and the organizer case :) definitely will be buying rest of the sets that Bundle Monster has.</li>
            <li> Covers all the holidays, very cute designs and come out very clear!</li>
            <li> The plates are great and there&#x27;s such a variety for any holiday or occasion like a wedding, birthday or baby shower!</li>
            <li> These did arrive with one plate missing, but I contacted BM about it and their customer service was wonderful-</li>
            <li> So many fun designs.  </li>
            <li> so i got free shipping.  </li>
            <li> I am still learning but cant wait to try all the fabulous stamp art.  </li>
            <li> Only problem is I have to keep up with all of them lol.</li>
            <li> The images are very fun.</li>
            <li> I have several other BM sets and they are all really great with many cute options and stamp nicely.</li>
            <li> Quality is consistent from plate-to-plate.. simply top notch.</li>
            <li> Was totally excited to order this bundle.  </li>
            <li> Such a nice product!  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this plate.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this set.</li>
            <li> I was pleased when i first saw the plates.  </li>
            <li> collection quality is very good maybe one complain on the halloween one with the pumpkin you have to slide the scraper slightly</li>
            <li> Clean images.</li>
            <li> The print comes out with clean lines and you can see all the details on your nail.</li>
            <li> I usually only use nail art for special occasions like holidays, so having so many choices for nail looks each holiday is really nice.  </li>
            <li> I have all 2 series, and this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li> it will scrape the nail polish off and you dont want that just do that image with a light hand but other than that no problems love them!!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s everything from cute to sophisticated, appealing to a wide variety of tastes.</li>
            <li> They came inthe mail very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;There are so many holiday&#x27;s on the plates</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t draw very well, and this opens so many possibilities for me.</li>
            <li> I was doing my friend&#x27;s nails and it took me forever to get the stamp she wanted to come out in full on my stamper.</li>
            <li> Great variety of holiday patterns for young and mature users.</li>
            <li> Bundle Monster ships quickly</li>
            <li> These came quickly.</li>
            <li> Great product was exactly what I wanted and expected.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> but most of the &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; finger stamps would only fit my index and pinky fingers.</li>
            <li> It should be fun experimenting .</li>
            <li> The images are clear and there are so many of them.</li>
            <li> Lots of fun images to choose from for every holiday you can think of and then some.</li>
            <li> The fullsize images are nice and big</li>
            <li> , I should also point out that, like always, the Bundle Monster plates stamp cleanly and clearly, are securely packaged, and always arrive quickly after ordering.  </li>
            <li> Thank you Bundle Monster for never disappointing me.</li>
            <li> I really liked the designs but a lot of them don&#x27;t work and a lot of them are too big.</li>
            <li> but to my surprise they are just right.</li>
            <li> I love how this set includes some of the non-main-stream holidays like Cinco de Mayo and Chinese New Year :-)</li>
            <li> fast delivery, images are cool and something for every celebration of the year!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The etching into the plate is deep enough to create clear beautiful images onto the nail!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve gotten pretty good at it with my other sets.</li>
            <li> And the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Love the designs on this set, I like most every single one as far as stamping.</li>
            <li> with the help of these it makes it so much easier!</li>
            <li> The only thing I dislike is that I don&#x27;t more than 10 finger to design.</li>
            <li> Compared to similar product which i have Wistonia holiday bundle this seems to have more holidays.</li>
            <li> ok the only reason i bough this set is because i saw a fellow YouTuber use the 4th of July plate in one of her videos....</li>
            <li> These plates have really cute designs for different holidays.</li>
            <li> Others have said that their stamps don&#x27;t always pick up a clear image, but I can&#x27;t stress how important it is to use 100% acetone with all stamping plates.  </li>
            <li> Love the variety of items represented for the different holidays.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Wish there was more designs that I would actually use.</li>
            <li> All the images are clear and cute and new.</li>
            <li> But MOST of them are too big for normal sized fingers.  </li>
            <li> Large size stamps for longer or wider nails.  </li>
            <li> I really like cheeky brand they work really well</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted, fast shipping as described.</li>
            <li> These stamp really well</li>
            <li> Fast shipping 👍 bundle monster plates</li>
            <li> But what I also really appreciate about this collection is the fact that the designs are not just Holiday-themed, but also seasonal.  </li>
            <li> Real bummer.</li>
            <li> You really have to test out all your plates to see which images work</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> at first I thought my nail beds would be too big for the full images</li>
            <li> I appreciate that they have designs for occasions that most other holiday plates don&#x27;t have (graduation, baby shower, etc.).</li>
            <li> This is such a cool idea.  </li>
            <li> Some of the plates are not etched deep enough, but enough of the plates work that this is a good deal.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I LOVE ALL the other designs to!  </li>
            <li> The problem is that more than half of them don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> The images in this particular set are all holiday/event themed, and consist of full nail designs as well as coordinating single images.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait till Christmas nails and new years and valentines day nails.</li>
            <li> I can only fit them on my big toenail.</li>
            <li> and I nails pretty and different.</li>
            <li> The 1st set was not good, but the designs are nice too.</li>
            <li> 14yr old loves this set.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to do holiday specific nails but all the other plates I have don&#x27;t really fit the bill since they aren&#x27;t geared specifically towards all the major holidays!</li>
            <li> Rather than just having iconic &amp;#34;holiday&amp;#34; images like Santa or Easter eggs, the designs also feature a wide variety of seasonal and general party-themed plates for other celebratory occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that</li>
            <li> The plates also have a permanent plastic backing that makes them easier and safer to handle, so no sharp edges, yay!    </li>
            <li> I ordered them last fall, so I have used them for Halloween, El Dia de Los Muertos, Thanksgiving, Christmas  and New Years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had stamping plates from this company for a year now and as long as you keep them clean and don&#x27;t overuse the designs, they last a long time and don&#x27;t bend.</li>
            <li> Most of the plates were scratched up and the etching was not deep enough so some of the images are hard to stamp.</li>
            <li> Regular nail polish remover is often infused with vitamin oils that leave a residue on the plates and prevent the image from picking up clearly.  </li>
            <li> This set is so difficult to work with because the designs aren&#x27;t cut deep enough to create a good, in tact stamp.</li>
            <li> Images always stamp crisp, even the extremely fine/detailed ones!</li>
            <li> Had to wait so long for them to get to me, because I live in CR</li>
            <li> Usually the ones with thicker lines don&#x27;t pick up the polish completely, like they are not etched consistently or something.</li>
            <li> And the price point makes them a fantastic value over other stamping plates out there, hands down!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this set to anyone especially to the gals that has wide bed nails</li>
            <li> There is a wide variety of images and themes but the full nail images are too small for longer nails and some of the etching is far too shallow.</li>
            <li> it will take me a very long time to use all of them.</li>
            <li> , For the price I would have expected them all to work.</li>
            <li> Plus they got here weeks before I expected them.</li>
            <li> However, 90% of the standalone etched designs are way too wide for my average-sized nail beds.</li>
            <li> I used these stamps CONSTANTLY this past Holiday season.  </li>
            <li> they are the same quality as konad if not better.</li>
            <li> Active nail stamper here</li>
            <li> buy again, just a little pricey compared to other collections..</li>
            <li> The set is a little pricier than I would like</li>
            <li> they mailed me the missing plate immediately</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done a few fall and</li>
            <li> It arrives in a small, sealed plastic pouch, so there&#x27;s very little packaging waste.</li>
            <li> I bought the Pueen set and their full images does not cover my whole nail which I&#x27;m disappointed :(</li>
            <li> Plates are well etched however the designs are SMALL like kid sized fingers.</li>
            <li> I am anxious to try out the holiday designs for the holidays coming.</li>
            <li> All images are etched perfectly; not too shallow causing bald spots, and not too deep causing smearing or bleeding.</li>
            <li> but this time I got my plates late.  </li>
            <li> Sadly they don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I used to be afraid of buying anything</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch of image plates or what</li>
            <li> Very disappointing....</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> This is my 5th Bundle Monster plate set, and it won&#x27;t be my last. Like the others, it is a fabulous set! It arrives in a small, sealed plastic pouch, so there&#x27;s very little packaging waste. All plates come with a blue protective film that should be removed prior to stamping. The plates also have a permanent plastic backing that makes them easier and safer to handle, so no sharp edges, yay!    The images in this particular set are all holiday/event themed, and consist of full nail designs as well as coordinating single images. There&#x27;s everything from cute to sophisticated, appealing to a wide variety of tastes. All images are etched perfectly; not too shallow causing bald spots, and not too deep causing smearing or bleeding. Images always stamp crisp, even the extremely fine/detailed ones! Quality is consistent from plate-to-plate.. simply top notch. You will use this set a lot!    Over all, I would definitely recommend this stamping plate set to anyone wanting to add to their stamping plate collection. And the price point makes them a fantastic value over other stamping plates out there, hands down!</li>
            <li> Large size stamps for longer or wider nails.  Perfect transfer every time.  The very best brand of plates I have used.  Great variety of holiday patterns for young and mature users.</li>
            <li> I specifically bought these plates&lt;br /&gt;For the birthday ones! The plates are great and there&#x27;s such a variety for any holiday or occasion like a wedding, birthday or baby shower! If you&#x27;re into nail stamping I would recommend these plates!!</li>
            <li> I just got these!! Absolutley love them! Had to wait so long for them to get to me, because I live in CR and I have to ship amazon things to my brother&#x27;s addresss int he US but the wait was so worth it, going to use them tonight!!. They are nicely packed and the images look amazing! Will be ordering more BMC stamping plates and probaly polish very soon!!!</li>

            <li> I love these plates. The images are cute and holiday themed, they are etched well and stamp great. These did arrive with one plate missing, but I contacted BM about it and their customer service was wonderful- they mailed me the missing plate immediately and I think they deserve all five stars still. I have several other BM sets and they are all really great with many cute options and stamp nicely. I would recommend this brand of nail stamping plates if you love nail stamping.</li>
            <li> some of them do not work, they are not deep enough, if I knew this ahead of time I don&#x27;t think I would of bought them. I really like cheeky brand they work really well, For the price I would have expected them all to work.</li>

            <li> Great addition to my collection.</li>
            <li> Plates are well etched however the designs are SMALL like kid sized fingers. I don&#x27;t have larger nails but most of the &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; finger stamps would only fit my index and pinky fingers.</li>
            <li> I love this series. Haven&#x27;t used all of the images yet, but the ones I have used were great. There are so many different images to choose from that are perfect for the holidays, and so I am excited to continue using this set as each holiday comes around.</li>
            <li> I received product and check out the different designs on the plates. I am anxious to try out the holiday designs for the holidays coming. It should be fun experimenting . I have all 3 sets of Bundle Monster plates. I like them all. I will have lots of designs to try out on my nails. I am waiting to see if there will be more sets coming up.</li>
            <li> These stamp really well and the designs are really, really cute. Plus they got here weeks before I expected them.</li>
            <li> It was as described and I loved all the difference stamping plates. It&#x27;s a great price for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> I love this set! Its great to have all these holidays in one set. Shipping was fast and great. Totally worth it :D Buy the set!!</li>
            <li> So many fun designs.  14yr old loves this set.  She&#x27;s had no problem with any of these.</li>
            <li> Was totally excited to order this bundle.  Couldn&#x27;t wait to use on my clients.  But MOST of them are too big for normal sized fingers.  If the images were just 3-5% smaller they would work.&lt;br /&gt;Very cute images, disapointed I cant use them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what happened because I ordered from Bundle Monster before but this time I got my plates late.  Delivery was supposed to be March 7  but I got it on March 11.  I also bought another set so i got free shipping.  The plates did not come in a box (both sets), it came in a plastic bag. Most of the plates were scratched up and the etching was not deep enough so some of the images are hard to stamp. And the ones that are not etched deep enough just so happens to be the ones I wanted to use and it was the reason why I bought these. Very disappointing....</li>
            <li> YES!! Finally a great set for the holidays! I love them! During the holidays is when I get inspired more to do nicely done nails LOL and with the help of these it makes it so much easier! Nicely etched. Clean images. Absolutely love them!</li>
            <li> the plates have an image for every holiday and then some. they all seem to transfer just fine. The images are very fun.</li>
            <li> The Bundle Monster 25pc Holiday Collection (nail art image polish stamping) has a really good mix of holiday plates. They have some nice designs in the collection.</li>
            <li> I love these plates!! so many cute choices and large images for longer nails thank you baby jesus!!! lol!!! must have for stampers!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Loved them. Perfect timing for Halloween and thanksgiving. Can&#x27;t wait till Christmas nails and new years and valentines day nails.</li>
            <li> Such a nice product!  I am still learning but cant wait to try all the fabulous stamp art.  Love it.</li>
            <li> although my product arrived as shedule, I found images to be much smaller than I expected.&lt;br /&gt; I won&#x27;t use them, however I gave them to my granddaughter and she loved them. She does her&lt;br /&gt;nails twice a week now. thanx for your product.</li>
            <li> These stamping plates are awesome. The print comes out with clean lines and you can see all the details on your nail. I&#x27;ll be getting the different collections from bundle monster. Awesome customer service, will buy again from seller.</li>
            <li> The stamps are easy to use</li>
            <li> I like this product because it has a great selection of holiday images. I am a armature nail artist, but enjoying doing my nail every week when I can. The images are clear and there are so many of them. The only thing I dislike is that I don&#x27;t more than 10 finger to design. Compared to similar product which i have Wistonia holiday bundle this seems to have more holidays. I have been using stamping are plate for about 2 years now. It meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> ok the only reason i bough this set is because i saw a fellow YouTuber use the 4th of July plate in one of her videos....I have to say that I LOVE ALL the other designs to!  there are some Holiday images in this set that are hard/rare to find....thanksgiving!!!  don&#x27;t think twice about buying this set...JUST DO IT....</li>
            <li> These plates have really cute designs for different holidays. Can&#x27;t wait to use each one!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this set of stamping plates. Etching is very nice and stamps very clear.&lt;br /&gt;I have so many manicure ideas swirling around in my head.</li>
            <li> These are great plates.  You get a lot of bang for your buck. Lots of fun images to choose from for every holiday you can think of and then some.</li>
            <li> This stamping set is so cute and so many great designs. i love it and would recomend it for others.</li>
            <li> I am a repeat customer of bundle monster- they are awesome and transfer well and a lot more affordable the konad.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome set of plates that will cover just about any holiday you can think of, except maybe Groundhog Day. There&#x27;s even designs for weddings, graduations, and baby showers. The designs are a good size and stamp well. Anyone into stamping needs this for their arsenal.</li>
            <li> Eclectic blend. Good for each holiday - including birthdays.</li>
            <li> fast delivery, images are cool and something for every celebration of the year!&lt;br /&gt;would buy again, just a little pricey compared to other collections..</li>
            <li> I always love doing holiday specific nail designs and these are perfect!  There is almost every holiday you can think of.  I can&#x27;t wait to try them all.</li>
            <li> I received my order on time and it was in excellent condition. I picked  these plates because of all the designs to choose from. They are easy to use. I would recommend them to any nail stamper.</li>
            <li> I believe this is the only brand of stamping plates that has a collection designated just for holidays. How awesome is that if it was. Active nail stamper here, Ive heard great things about bundle monster and decided to see myself. The designs are very creative! (BM-H15!) This set includes plates that aren&#x27;t traditionally &#x27;holidays&#x27; such as birthdays, baby showers, and graduations. So there is something for everyone. The etching into the plate is deep enough to create clear beautiful images onto the nail! Recommended for first timers who want to try nail stamping to experienced stampers and for anyone who loves nail art!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this plate. It literally is my favorite plate set of all...regardless of the brand. All the images are clear and cute and new. If you want a great set for any holiday -- even some obscure ones like cinco de mayo -- or even your birthday this is a great set. The fullsize images are nice and big so I can do my toes too! Would be a great first set of plates or nail tech set to have! I cannot give this enough stars!</li>
            <li> I have all 2 series, and this is by far my favorite! These are high quality image plates, my friends are impressed, they stamp really well! My nails look wonderful</li>
            <li> Fast shipping 👍 bundle monster plates ★★★★★ love it 😊</li>
            <li> Great product and a great deal my daughter loves these.</li>
            <li> This is a great collection of holiday stamping images. The problem is that more than half of them don&#x27;t work. I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch of image plates or what but they aren&#x27;t deep enough so that the stamping polish gets into the designs. I would use these all the time if they worked. Sadly they don&#x27;t. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Bundle Monster ships quickly, so I had them in time for Halloween decorating. I just love the designs, something for every occasion. Just finished a Thanksgiving manicure and looking forward to what I&#x27;ll be doing for Christmas. Bundle Monster plates are well-made and stamp perfectly almost every time. And the price is very reasonable. I will always buy Bundle Monster!</li>
            <li> I used these stamps CONSTANTLY this past Holiday season.  I ordered them last fall, so I have used them for Halloween, El Dia de Los Muertos, Thanksgiving, Christmas  and New Years.  All my friends were excited to use them over the Holidays, too!  But what I also really appreciate about this collection is the fact that the designs are not just Holiday-themed, but also seasonal.  Rather than just having iconic &amp;#34;holiday&amp;#34; images like Santa or Easter eggs, the designs also feature a wide variety of seasonal and general party-themed plates for other celebratory occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I should also point out that, like always, the Bundle Monster plates stamp cleanly and clearly, are securely packaged, and always arrive quickly after ordering.  Others have said that their stamps don&#x27;t always pick up a clear image, but I can&#x27;t stress how important it is to use 100% acetone with all stamping plates.  Regular nail polish remover is often infused with vitamin oils that leave a residue on the plates and prevent the image from picking up clearly.  I have always used 100% acetone on my plates and have never had a problem with anything I have ordered from Bundle Monster.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with them, no storage case. But, Pueen for my location was a lot quicker and came with a storage case.</li>
            <li> They came inthe mail very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;There are so many holiday&#x27;s on the plates it will take me a very long time to use all of them.</li>
            <li> great designs with lots of ideas i cant decide what one to do first great for every holiday with plenty of choices. great buy</li>
            <li> Luv it I get them on perfect</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get these stamps to work. 2 of my friends tried with no luck either.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it! It was exactly what I was looking for! I&#x27;ve been wanting to do holiday specific nails but all the other plates I have don&#x27;t really fit the bill since they aren&#x27;t geared specifically towards all the major holidays!</li>
            <li> All holidays happy with the quality</li>
            <li> The plates have every holiday. Only problem is I have to keep up with all of them lol. Great mother daughter time for me and my 6 year old. :)</li>
            <li> Great product was exactly what I wanted and expected. Would recommend to others.  I do gel nails and worked perfect.</li>
            <li> love all holiday images what can i say have 3 plate collection 1 mash 1 bundle and 1 shany love them all&lt;br /&gt;holiday collection quality is very good maybe one complain on the halloween one with the pumpkin you have to slide the scraper slightly bc&lt;br /&gt;otherwise it will scrape the nail polish off and you dont want that just do that image with a light hand but other than that no problems love them!!</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. Will get great fun from these plates.</li>
            <li> These came quickly. Everything I have tried so far has worked great. I&#x27;ve done a few fall and Christmas Mani&#x27;s and they have turned put great. Used these to make decals also and those have come out great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For photos you can check !e out on instagram @hannahsnails11</li>
            <li> The set is a little pricier than I would like but I do love all the designs. I appreciate that they have designs for occasions that most other holiday plates don&#x27;t have (graduation, baby shower, etc.).</li>
            <li> I love the variety of holidays that is included in this plate collection. I use these all the time... there&#x27;s something for every occasion!</li>
            <li> Love the variety of items represented for the different holidays.</li>
            <li> These are a must-have if you like stamping for holidays. I love how this set includes some of the non-main-stream holidays like Cinco de Mayo and Chinese New Year :-) It&#x27;s a great set and the stamps transfer very well.</li>
            <li> Very good quality, works like I wanted it to</li>
            <li> Purchased for my grand daughter, she is so excited over this set. She&#x27;s learning tips and tricks to fingernail art, You&#x27;ll need to buy the stamp and scraper separately.....I bought the double sided stamp set from MASH.</li>
            <li> Cute designs. However, 90% of the standalone etched designs are way too wide for my average-sized nail beds. I can only fit them on my big toenail.</li>
            <li> These are amazing!! I used to be afraid of buying anything but konad.. but now im sold on bundle monster they are the same quality as konad if not better. I cant wait to get some more bundle monster products!!</li>
            <li> Bundlemonster always stamps well. The best part is that now I am ready for any, and every, holiday.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t draw very well, and this opens so many possibilities for me.</li>
            <li> Stamped great images and love that now i have designs for all the holidays, even cinco de mayo!</li>
            <li> Some of the plates are not etched deep enough, but enough of the plates work that this is a good deal.</li>
            <li> Love the designs, some don&#x27;t stamp well.  Usually the ones with thicker lines don&#x27;t pick up the polish completely, like they are not etched consistently or something.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this set. I love nail stamping and I&#x27;ve gotten pretty good at it with my other sets. This set is so difficult to work with because the designs aren&#x27;t cut deep enough to create a good, in tact stamp. I was doing my friend&#x27;s nails and it took me forever to get the stamp she wanted to come out in full on my stamper. Real bummer. I could have gotten a better set for less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desiree.</li>
            <li> I love these! They are perfect for the holidays! The designs are adorable. I can&#x27;t wait to use them. Thank you Bundle Monster for never disappointing me.</li>
            <li> I was pleased when i first saw the plates.  However not all the images work, it is not engraved into the plate evenly, so parts of the picture will print.  You really have to test out all your plates to see which images work</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  Works great!</li>
            <li> Holiday Collection is absolutely adorable!! A must have.  Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I like all of bundle monsters plates. I look forward to using the plates</li>
            <li> Not the best plates. There is a wide variety of images and themes but the full nail images are too small for longer nails and some of the etching is far too shallow.</li>
            <li> Covers all the holidays, very cute designs and come out very clear!</li>
            <li> A good set, transfers well to nails.</li>
            <li> Bundle Monster plates, all holiday images! I love these plates.</li>
            <li> I really liked the designs but a lot of them don&#x27;t work and a lot of them are too big.</li>
            <li> Omg I love these stamps will buy more soon</li>
            <li> Wish there was more designs that I would actually use.</li>
