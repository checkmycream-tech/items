            <li>Had great hold without the flaking.  </li>
            <li>Great hold.</li>

            <li>still a great product and</li>
            <li>Great product with prompt delivery.</li>
            <li>This is a good gel.</li>
            <li>I loved it and used it exclusively, but after moving I couldn&#x27;t find the stuff anywhere.  </li>
            <li>Gel has a great hold for hours, doesn&#x27;t flake and leaves a nice healthy shine.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell like the older version but the hold is the best I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>Not as good as the original cranberry scented one.</li>
            <li>It had a much more &#x27;pungent&#x27; alcohol-like smell.  </li>
            <li>After trying it a couple of times, I noticed it flaked a lot more as well</li>
            <li>Love this gel.</li>
            <li>so I love being able to find such a great deal on Amazon!</li>
            <li>Over the years, I have tried many brands of hair gel.</li>
            <li>I used KMS hair gel for years and it was my favorite product.  </li>
            <li>I have used this KMS hair gel for years and it was my favorite product.</li>
            <li>a loyalist, so now that I have been re-united, it&#x27;s this stuff for life :)</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>It washes off your hands (and your head) easily.  </li>
            <li>In fact, once you get it on your hands, it&#x27;s easy to spread the scent to anything you touch including towels and clothing.  </li>
            <li>The packaging has changed many times, same great KMS inside.</li>
            <li>Good to smooth my very curly hair.</li>
            <li>someone joked about the &amp;#34;old, cheap cologne smell&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Time to hunt for the next great hair gel.  </li>
            <li>The gel has the same great hold</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m familiar with how it performs, smells, etc.  </li>
            <li>I emailed Amazon and they refunded my money for the original purchase price.      </li>
            <li>Have been using this KMS gel in the original &#x27;cranberry&#x27;-scent pink/white container for 11 years now.  </li>
            <li>Ive bought this product in the past and even though it has changed it still is the best out there.</li>
            <li>The best for hard to hold hair</li>
            <li>Prefer the older one better .</li>
            <li>I guess maybe a little when I&#x27;m dispensing it from the bottle but not after that, and product works great.</li>
            <li>it worth the money.</li>
            <li>I am able to wear a hat to work and only on special occasions will I need to apply gel in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Right out of the bottle, I noticed this stuff didn&#x27;t smell like the gel I had used before.  </li>
            <li>Right away I didn&#x27;t recognize the smell.  </li>
            <li>I threw mine out and strongly advise new buyers not to buy this product.</li>
            <li>although I use a large amount of gel, my hair still looks soft and stylish.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, the performance was significantly better (and it did smell different).  </li>
            <li>Holds the best out of the different products that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>This large container will probably last me a year or more.</li>
            <li>For those of you who have relatively short, fine hair and want to have it stay in place and not look a like Bieber, this stuff holds.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tries many hair gels in my time and this one does the job.  </li>
            <li>and I use it straight out of the bottle, but he does add a bit of water to the gel in his hand before applying it to his hair.</li>
            <li>I am a guy who has straight hair.</li>
            <li>It really holds.  </li>
            <li>She confirmed it was just in different packaging.  </li>
            <li>I have a real think hair and this product does not hold unless I have additional hairspray (not KMS product but something</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice the smell...</li>
            <li>However, it is really really stink.</li>
            <li>I use KMS because it doesn&#x27;t really smell.</li>
            <li>Very glue-like, so</li>
            <li>Yes it flaked, but other than that it has super hold !!</li>
            <li>It maintains body and shape with much more definition than foams or other gel products.</li>
            <li>KMS decided to switch to this new blue/gray packaging with a &#x27;pepper&#x27;-scent which is absolutely toxic.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d given it 5 stars if the perfume was less potent.</li>
            <li>I did use a fair amount and although it never flaked, it did look &amp;#34;dusty&amp;#34; if I ran my fingers through my hair or actually tried to run a comb through the dried gel</li>
            <li>But I finally ran out of my stock of gel and headed to my local supply store for more since I had a &amp;#34;special occasion&amp;#34; and needed to wear gel.  </li>
            <li>Anyhow I&#x27;m not crazy, this is smaller than the tub.</li>
            <li>I had to ask where the KMS section was since I didn&#x27;t know they changed packaging design again and skipped right over the entire KMS section.  </li>
            <li>if you use it on dry hair you can style the most stubborn hair out there, and if you apply it to wet hair it will style like a more conventional gel that you would grab at any store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was relieved to see KMS even in a new bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;KMS has lost a long-standing customer with this new putrid odor.</li>
            <li>Compared to the former packaging [ pink bottle top ] this gel doesn&#x27;t provide the \\&quot;hold\\&quot; that I have come to expect from KMS.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not to be one of the &#x27;silent&#x27; complainers, and having been an avid fan of KMS to date, I called up KMS customer support.  </li>
            <li>25.3 oz is a little over the top for an individual.  </li>
            <li>Just to make sure I wasn&#x27;t going crazy, I purchased another authentic bottle from a local salon to compare with.  </li>
            <li>THEY SEND YOU OLD, DECOMPOSING PRODUCT</li>
            <li>I used to use this when I was 20 years old (28 now)</li>
            <li>I am now on the hunt for a true firm gel.  </li>
            <li>It is much softer than other gels and will gently hold your hair for the entire day.  </li>
            <li>they&#x27;re selling the new KMS hair gel in the blue bottle.  </li>
            <li>It works well for my fine, blonde hair without weighing it down or being sticky, and it also holds my husband&#x27;s short hair in place throughout the day without being \\&quot;crunchy.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>There was a different UPC labelling on this new one, but it still had the same toxic gasoline smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The recently changed the packaging to a new blue bottle.  </li>
            <li>My old hair stylist from forever ago sold me some of this stuff back when it had a completely different bottle.  </li>
            <li>I loved this stuff but the blue bottle stinks</li>
            <li>I am so disappointed with this purchase I wrote the company to let them know how much I loved the old stuff.  </li>

            <li> I am so disappointed with this purchase I wrote the company to let them know how much I loved the old stuff.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time and Amazon is one of the few places I can still find it for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The company told me they had to drop the two versions since the other new one did not sell so this replaced the pink one a year ago.</li>
            <li> the new KMS gel has less hold, more shine, and it stinks.</li>
            <li> to be sure that this wasn&#x27;t a one-off bad batch, we purchased a second bottle from a different seller (also on Amazon).  </li>
            <li> I have been buying this gel for as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> Will continue for long, long time.</li>
            <li> It was the only product that would hold down my short, course hair.  </li>
            <li> The usual one squirt wasn&#x27;t enough to control my course hair and a 2nd, even 3rd squirt was needed.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t that was possible until I read the other comments.</li>
            <li> They recently changed the packaging to a new blue bottle and it smells like GASOLINE or something worse.  </li>
            <li> In fact, here&#x27;s a secret: your hair (at least mine does) looks better the day after you use it.</li>
            <li> which is odd, especially since the bottle specifically says,</li>
            <li> For those of you who don&#x27;t want slightly crunchy hair, commit to a smaller size, but give it a whirl nonetheless...</li>
            <li> This product left me a little puzzled.  </li>
            <li> I have tried the other gels they carry adn don&#x27;t like any of them because they get flakey when they dry.</li>
            <li> And if it did, all I had to do was slightly wet</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> usual, like everyone else I cracked the lid open to smell it.  </li>
            <li> More like a disappointed user.  </li>
            <li> The scent has drawn sharp comments from coworkers, and even the faintest hint of it bring an aura of nausea to every member of my family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then take another whiff and have your other friends/family members give it a whiff.  </li>
            <li> If you have thick, heavy hair as I do, this is the only product I&#x27;ve found that can be sucessfully used on wet or dry hair.</li>

            <li> The dab will stay in one place even if you turn your hand upside down.</li>

            <li> Have been using this product for 10 years and has never let me down!  </li>
            <li> but I would imagine any gel after dried would do that.  </li>
            <li> I used to apply it to my hair everyday and sometimes it lasts up to 2 days.</li>
            <li> try this gel, put a bit of it on your towel and let it air for a few hours in a small room.  </li>
            <li> This all led me to believe that either I received a bad bottle OR the bottle had been emptied and refilled with a much cheaper gel.  </li>
            <li> Holds pretty well, but hate the smell.</li>
            <li> They went from first to worst when they changed the formula from the pink one to this.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great product. Hair stays where I have styled it without giving my hair an odd look. My husband and I are both happy users of this product.</li>
            <li> The smell of the product needs to be toned down.  I don&#x27;t know why they changed it.  Regardless, I still like the quality of the gel as it doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel clumped together in spikes.  It is much softer than other gels and will gently hold your hair for the entire day.  I&#x27;d given it 5 stars if the perfume was less potent.</li>
            <li> This product left me a little puzzled.  I&#x27;ve purchased KMS HairStay from regular salons before (in smaller bottles) so I&#x27;m familiar with how it performs, smells, etc.  Right out of the bottle, I noticed this stuff didn&#x27;t smell like the gel I had used before.  It had a much more &#x27;pungent&#x27; alcohol-like smell.  After trying it a couple of times, I noticed it flaked a lot more as well which is odd, especially since the bottle specifically says, \\&quot;doesn&#x27;t flake.\\&quot;    This all led me to believe that either I received a bad bottle OR the bottle had been emptied and refilled with a much cheaper gel.  Just to make sure I wasn&#x27;t going crazy, I purchased another authentic bottle from a local salon to compare with.  Sure enough, the performance was significantly better (and it did smell different).  I emailed Amazon and they refunded my money for the original purchase price.      Buyer beware!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tries many hair gels in my time and this one does the job.  They changed the scent of this gel a few times, and this is by the far the worst.  Otherwise it would get 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Holds pretty well, but hate the smell.</li>
            <li> Love this gel. It works well for my fine, blonde hair without weighing it down or being sticky, and it also holds my husband&#x27;s short hair in place throughout the day without being \\&quot;crunchy.\\&quot; This gel is THICK and I use it straight out of the bottle, but he does add a bit of water to the gel in his hand before applying it to his hair. Great deal on this size product! It&#x27;s hard to find KMS in my area so I love being able to find such a great deal on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I am a guy who has straight hair. If I put nothing on my hair, it will stick up, stick out, and fly around in the wind.  I like to use a little bit of gel to keep my head from looking like a disturbed porcupine.&lt;br /&gt;This KMS gel is VERY thick. If you put a dab of it in the palm of your hand, it will not run.  The dab will stay in one place even if you turn your hand upside down. A little bit goes a long way. This large container will probably last me a year or more. The best thing about this gel is that it is not gooey. It washes off your hands (and your head) easily.  Plus it has a subtle unisex smell (not a perfumey, girly smell). After it dries, you can brush it to soften things up and your hair will still behave. Over the years, I have tried many brands of hair gel. This is the best I have found.</li>
            <li> For those of you who have relatively short, fine hair and want to have it stay in place and not look a like Bieber, this stuff holds.  It really holds.  For those of you who don&#x27;t want slightly crunchy hair, commit to a smaller size, but give it a whirl nonetheless...</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time and Amazon is one of the few places I can still find it for a reasonable price. This big bottle will last for months and months.</li>
            <li> If you have thick, heavy hair as I do, this is the only product I&#x27;ve found that can be sucessfully used on wet or dry hair. It maintains body and shape with much more definition than foams or other gel products. It&#x27;s just hard to find!</li>
            <li> Have been using KMS gel for several years...........EXCELLENT product........will NOT change to anything else</li>
            <li> I have been a faithful KMS styling gel user since the 1980&#x27;s.  It was the only product that would hold down my short, course hair.  I did use a fair amount and although it never flaked, it did look &amp;#34;dusty&amp;#34; if I ran my fingers through my hair or actually tried to run a comb through the dried gel but I would imagine any gel after dried would do that.  And if it did, all I had to do was slightly wet my hands and restyle parts that were unruly or dusty.&lt;br /&gt;Since the late 90&#x27;s I hadn&#x27;t needed to wear gel in my hair on a daily basis.  I am able to wear a hat to work and only on special occasions will I need to apply gel in my hair.  But I finally ran out of my stock of gel and headed to my local supply store for more since I had a &amp;#34;special occasion&amp;#34; and needed to wear gel.  I had to ask where the KMS section was since I didn&#x27;t know they changed packaging design again and skipped right over the entire KMS section.  I was relieved to see KMS even in a new bottle.&lt;br /&gt;As usual, like everyone else I cracked the lid open to smell it.  Right away I didn&#x27;t recognize the smell.  I had to ask the rep if this was the same gel they&#x27;ve always had.  She confirmed it was just in different packaging.  Sadly I was disappointed on the runny consistency I noticed right away in my fingers.  The usual one squirt wasn&#x27;t enough to control my course hair and a 2nd, even 3rd squirt was needed.  The smell!! The smell was horrible after application.  I was embarrassed when in the car with coworkers someone joked about the &amp;#34;old, cheap cologne smell&amp;#34;.  Since we&#x27;re all close, I fessed up and told them it was my hair gel then proceeded to crack my window open.  I washed my hands twice with soap and the smell is still persistent.&lt;br /&gt;I emailed KMS corporate and am curious as to the formula change and horrible smell.  I had heard also of a change in ownership?&lt;br /&gt;I am not bashing KMS.  I am not working for a different product company.  I am an ex-stylist, graduate of the Vidal Sassoon Academy and now just a product user.  More like a disappointed user.  I am now on the hunt for a true firm gel.  I am noticing &amp;#34;firm hold&amp;#34; is used quite often in this business and KMS was the only one that delivered that in their gel.  Not any longer.</li>
            <li> How bad can it be is what I thought after reading others reviews.  I have been buying this gel for as long as I can remember.  I loved this stuff but the blue bottle stinks and when I say stinks I mean I have washed my hands several times and can&#x27;t get the smell off them.  I am so disappointed with this purchase I wrote the company to let them know how much I loved the old stuff.  Two weeks later and no response.  Time to hunt for the next great hair gel.  If anyone finds a similar one let me know</li>
            <li> They went from first to worst when they changed the formula from the pink one to this. The company told me they had to drop the two versions since the other new one did not sell so this replaced the pink one a year ago. The fool who put the perfume in this one is either stupid or did not do any product testing since there are plenty of bad reviews saying this stuff smells like embalming fluid. There should be no scent at all, but women like to have their products \\&quot;smell nice\\&quot; I guess...but they went crazy on this stuff...I threw it out.</li>
            <li> I have a real think hair and this product does not hold unless I have additional hairspray (not KMS product but something stronger).&lt;br /&gt;Good value for the money but does not work for me.</li>
            <li> works well and great product and price.</li>
            <li> Since I bought this for myself I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking.  25.3 oz is a little over the top for an individual.  Off it goes to a friend in the &amp;#34;hair business&amp;#34;.  I needed and bought a smaller size.</li>
            <li> The best for hard to hold hair</li>
            <li> I use this stuff daily and do not get any build up with it nor do i get any flakes as with some holding gels.</li>
            <li> Have been using this KMS gel in the original &#x27;cranberry&#x27;-scent pink/white container for 11 years now.  Had great hold without the flaking.  KMS decided to switch to this new blue/gray packaging with a &#x27;pepper&#x27;-scent which is absolutely toxic.  It smells like someone took gasoline and leaded paint, swirled it together, and dumped it on your hair.  In fact, once you get it on your hands, it&#x27;s easy to spread the scent to anything you touch including towels and clothing.  The scent has drawn sharp comments from coworkers, and even the faintest hint of it bring an aura of nausea to every member of my family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to be sure that this wasn&#x27;t a one-off bad batch, we purchased a second bottle from a different seller (also on Amazon).  There was a different UPC labelling on this new one, but it still had the same toxic gasoline smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to be one of the &#x27;silent&#x27; complainers, and having been an avid fan of KMS to date, I called up KMS customer support.  The telephone rep simply recommended to return the gel, and said that they do not provide any satisfaction guarantee (or offer refunds) for any purchased made outside of a salon, including no support for purchases made on Amazon.  So if you are outside of the 30day Amazon return window, you are out of luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you simply must buy/try this gel, put a bit of it on your towel and let it air for a few hours in a small room.  Then take another whiff and have your other friends/family members give it a whiff.  You&#x27;ll then understand why you&#x27;ll then likely want to return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KMS has lost a long-standing customer with this new putrid odor.</li>
            <li> THEY SEND YOU OLD, DECOMPOSING PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for 10 years and has never let me down!  Holds the best out of the different products that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice the smell...I guess maybe a little when I&#x27;m dispensing it from the bottle but not after that, and product works great.</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t smell the same! I bought a bottle at a beauty supply and it was the same stench. KMS must have changed the formula.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the original cranberry scented one. Will flake. Not super firm hold, but does its job</li>
            <li> This KMS hair gel is the best product I ever used. Will continue for long, long time. The BEST. ..</li>
            <li> Husband loves this since it doesn&#x27;t leave flakes and it smells delightful.  He uses almost every day.  He has tried tons of different gels but as soon as he started getting this one from his hair cutting place he has never gone back.</li>
            <li> Great hold. Terrible smell. Why can&#x27;t this excellent product be made without fragrance? Whoever made the decision to use this &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; should be fired. I threw mine out and strongly advise new buyers not to buy this product.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re selling the new KMS hair gel in the blue bottle.  It&#x27;s not the old one in the white and pink bottle.  beware when you order.  the new KMS gel has less hold, more shine, and it stinks.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for some time. I have limp hair except for a nasty calick in the back. Hairstay allows me to style my hair the way I want and and keep it looking the way I want it all day. I put on the gel after washing my hair, comb it, and let it sit. Then I come back and style it with the blow dryer and brush. I used to buy this stuff where they cut my hair, but they stopped carrying it. I have tried the other gels they carry adn don&#x27;t like any of them because they get flakey when they dry. Happy to find this on Amazom Prime.</li>
            <li> I used to use this when I was 20 years old (28 now) still a great product and I am addicted to the smell.</li>
            <li> This is a good gel. However, it is really really stink. My wife doesnt want to be around everytime I use this KMS.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 10+ years and it keeps my styling in place.</li>
            <li> Gel has a great hold for hours, doesn&#x27;t flake and leaves a nice healthy shine. My kids do not like smell though</li>
            <li> I used KMS hair gel for years and it was my favorite product.  The recently changed the packaging to a new blue bottle.  The gel has the same great hold but now it has a funky smell.</li>
            <li> I think I need to stop using this product, it&#x27;s been like 15 years and I am still using the same gel during this timeframe.  Need to stop using this but it&#x27;s an excellent product, best of all it does not flake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using KMS gel for 25 years. The packaging has changed many times, same great KMS inside. I did not notice any weird or new smell. I don&#x27;t like smelly, perfumy shampoos or gels. I use KMS because it doesn&#x27;t really smell.</li>
            <li> Excellent hair product for a great price.</li>
            <li> Even before opening it i can smell it from across the room. Prefer the older one better . Unless it got change, i would not order again</li>
            <li> I have used this KMS hair gel for years and it was my favorite product. They recently changed the packaging to a new blue bottle and it smells like GASOLINE or something worse.  Compared to the former packaging [ pink bottle top ] this gel doesn&#x27;t provide the \\&quot;hold\\&quot; that I have come to expect from KMS.  I would recommend that you avoid this gel - it really smells bad!</li>
            <li> My old hair stylist from forever ago sold me some of this stuff back when it had a completely different bottle.  I loved it and used it exclusively, but after moving I couldn&#x27;t find the stuff anywhere.  I guess they changed the bottle, but after some detective work I finally found it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, this stuff is legit.  Very glue-like, so if you use it on dry hair you can style the most stubborn hair out there, and if you apply it to wet hair it will style like a more conventional gel that you would grab at any store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a loyalist, so now that I have been re-united, it&#x27;s this stuff for life :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a bunch of different gel brands and I keep coming back to this.  Since I&#x27;ve been using this on and off for 10 years, I finally told myself to just buy the biggest bottle.  Anyhow I&#x27;m not crazy, this is smaller than the tub.</li>
            <li> Great product with prompt delivery. Ive bought this product in the past and even though it has changed it still is the best out there.</li>
            <li> The gel claims it does not flake, but guess what it flakes, maybe I got a knock off or something. I didn&#x27;t that was possible until I read the other comments. Yes it flaked, but other than that it has super hold !!</li>
            <li> Only gel I use, cheaper than any salon prices.</li>
            <li> The best gel i&#x27;ve ever bought.  Not greasy and it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase and the service from Amazon.com!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like the older version but the hold is the best I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;ve used a lot of hair gel over the years.</li>
            <li> Good to smooth my very curly hair.</li>
            <li> Best hair gel I&#x27;ve ever used. Seriously. It&#x27;s the best. No flakes after it dries and holds everything in place. In fact, here&#x27;s a secret: your hair (at least mine does) looks better the day after you use it. Seriously.</li>
            <li> this is the best hair gel I&#x27;ve ever tried. My hair is so frizzy and the humidity affects it badly, I always hated summer bec. of my hair till I tried KMS. it worth the money. I used to apply it to my hair everyday and sometimes it lasts up to 2 days. although I use a large amount of gel, my hair still looks soft and stylish. I love it and I definetely recommend it.</li>
