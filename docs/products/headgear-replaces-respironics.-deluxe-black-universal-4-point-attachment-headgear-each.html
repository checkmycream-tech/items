            <li>Perfect, exactly what I needed to replace the one that came with my mask after the layers started separating</li>
            <li>The tube is great quality and easy to attached.</li>
            <li>After one month of use, the velcro was no longer  effective.  </li>
            <li>how stable and effective the seal is that the mask makes with my face.  </li>
            <li>Feels nice.</li>
            <li>The Velcro holds nicely and does not slip.</li>
            <li>and it was no longer effective at holding my mask in place.</li>
            <li>I am happy for the quick delivery, but this product is an inferior product.</li>
            <li>Great price, quick delivery, received as described / advertised.  </li>
            <li>It fits fine and is good quality fabric.</li>
            <li>This is a great replacement for my other headgrear, it now the best</li>
            <li>was ok but not as nice as the Rem one&#x27;s</li>
            <li>It was a great fit... nice and sturdy with a snug fit that didn&#x27;t stretch out mid-sleep session...</li>
            <li>The replacement gear was exactly what I wanted and fit perfectly with my equipment.</li>
            <li>This headgear was an exact replacement for the original at a very good price!  </li>
            <li>Just as in photo and got here pretty quick very happy thank you</li>

            <li>Very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Good price and quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Very nice and high quality!!  </li>
            <li>AND SAID THAT IS VERY GOOD LIKE THE FIRST ORIGINAL HEADGEAR.</li>
            <li>It works OK, I guess.</li>
            <li>can you give more percise measurements</li>
            <li>Better than the one that came with my cpap mask.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the product I got for this price.</li>
            <li>better than one got from cpap supplier</li>
            <li>They are just okay</li>
            <li>a week I&#x27;m even more pleased.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>The replacement headgear is ok.  </li>
            <li>We can now afford to change headgear more often at this price.</li>
            <li>It is an excellent product for a low price.</li>
            <li>and I am looking forward to many nights of use.</li>
            <li>Restocking fee because opened, and shipping to return would have been way more than cost head.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to sew two of these together to see if it will be better.</li>
            <li>Feels much better this way.</li>
            <li>thank you love getting stuff on Amazon</li>
            <li>I like the swivel connectors, much more convenient that the OEM</li>
            <li>Seems to be much better construction than default head gear.</li>
            <li>So glad that I was able to order the headgear for my husband.  </li>
            <li>I could not be more please or satisfied with this company.</li>
            <li>Its a good quality product and the price is right for the item.</li>
            <li>very good strap, the kind I like using, works well, lasts a usually long time, respironics brand of cpap machine</li>
            <li>Very comfortable, I like the fact that it is easy to adjust.</li>
            <li>It is very comfortable and came very quickly.  </li>
            <li>but it works pretty good</li>
            <li>But for a backup, it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>These are ok, they work fine, but as with all Velcro they tend to lose their abilities to stick after so many uses.  </li>
            <li>Top quality and easy to install</li>
            <li>Very comfortable fit.</li>
            <li>My husband says they fit better than any he has had before .</li>
            <li>My husband has sleep apnea, and he says this head gear is much more comfortable than the one he had before.</li>
            <li>however its thinner and more flimsey than the original respironics mask.</li>
            <li>And it was easy to assemble.</li>
            <li>This is an easy source of replacement parts for my cpap.</li>
            <li>Velcro type attachments appear strong as is the neoprene headgear.</li>
            <li>MOST highly recommended for CPAP users looking for a better fitting headgear (just be sure to keep your mask&#x27;s clips--this is headgear ONLY).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this head gear a year ago and it is still working fine for me.</li>
            <li>Straps are comfortable and easy to adjust.</li>
            <li>but it just fine</li>
            <li>It is comfortable, easily adjustable, light and almost inconspicuous.  </li>
            <li>Great fit, cut an unsure what the purpose of the double Velcro is.</li>
            <li>I guess this would fit about any 4 point cpap mask.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it on a Profile Light (medium).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>For me its perfect for everyday use .</li>
            <li>free</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s snug and secure.</li>
            <li>but I just cant seem to get a comfortable fit.</li>
            <li>Had to modify to fit head.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t fit well or adjust to fit well.  </li>
            <li>Extremely comfortable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable and like the fit better than my old headgear but</li>
            <li>The Velcro did not work on original mask band</li>
            <li>I purchased this to replace the original one that came with my Bipap machine and mask.</li>
            <li>THE ORIGINAL I HAVE LASTED NOT EVEN 2 WEEKS</li>
            <li>Comparable to original equipment.</li>
            <li>The lack of elasticity significantly affects  </li>
            <li>I am terrified to clean it and have it disintegrate at this point.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of goofy with all the stuff on the back.  </li>
            <li>Not a perfect, fit but its nice to wake up with your mask on your nose  NOT blowing air into your ear !!! :)</li>
            <li>I loved it until it started to stretch out over time but not in the standard \\&quot;getting</li>
            <li>He sleeps better &amp; has said this is MUCH more comfortable for him than the standard</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price I paid.</li>
            <li>For the price its not bad but</li>
            <li>Fantastic product and delivered right to my door.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit the same as the original, but is more comfortable.</li>
            <li>but I like it better than the older one.</li>
            <li>Universal and worked well to replace the headgear on a nasal mask that I was able to salvage and get more use out of.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would, however, use this exclusively if they could remedy the issue with the straps narrowing so quickly.</li>
            <li>ordered this, just hoping it MIGHT help &amp; it does make a tremendous difference in his comfort level.  </li>
            <li>But overall it fit nice on</li>
            <li>«hopefully it will last as I have bought three to make sure I don&#x27;t run out when pcs don&#x27;t hold after so many uses</li>
            <li>This one came quick and has done the trick.</li>
            <li>This is my 4th style and by far the most comfortable.</li>
            <li>&gt; The new one works much better for me.</li>
            <li>This headgear strap is a great general replacement for your old or worn CPAP machine.</li>
            <li>In fact last night was the best night of sleep I&#x27;ve had in a long time.  </li>
            <li>Very dissapointed!!</li>
            <li>The head gear is easy to install and is fairly comfortable as far as CPAP/BIPAP headgear goes.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it will last just fine.</li>
            <li>Also, how light weight the material is makes me suspect that what elasticity it does have, will not be very durable either.</li>
            <li>Item fit like a &amp;#34;glove&amp;#34;, and met my expectations with fast shipping</li>
            <li>However, it does not come with any attachements (just the strap and the velco ends are included - no plastic parts), so when you remove your old strap, be sure to keep the plastic clips.</li>
            <li>We are looking for a different kind of attachment for him to use now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be curious to know if even the good reviews here are repeat customers.  </li>
            <li>I have been surprised and pleased by how well this headgear fits.  </li>
            <li>but we worth the money.</li>
            <li>Sturdy velcro construction, well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Exactly what was wanted, but the large size is huge.  </li>
            <li>, i can see that it would have sutited my needs if it were the right size.</li>
            <li>Not elastic, so may not be right for you if you like an elastic head gear.</li>
            <li>Again my husband happy that I could find a replacement for his old, stretched out strap.  </li>
            <li>Seems very soft and easy to adjust.  </li>
            <li>I found that after just a few uses, I had to tighten it more and more.</li>
            <li>The headgear is comfortable, and it has good elasticity which means that it will probably last for a long time.</li>
            <li>The glue let loose and it just kind of disintegrated.  </li>
            <li>fits snug but comfortable the straps that originally came with it were sometimes too tight and the support for the back of your head was not design as good or sturdy</li>
            <li>The first head gear I received was defective.</li>
            <li>That was the reason that I ordered the replacement headgear in the first place.</li>
            <li>pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>We will definately order more in the future.  </li>
            <li>This makes it not completely worthless, but nearly so.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is OK same as the details in the web</li>
            <li>overall satisfied with the product or my application.</li>
            <li>The first two nights</li>
            <li>Order was received quickly and headgear was better than expected.</li>
            <li>Eight adjustable settings really means 2 short velcro pieces on each side of top and bottom of mask.  </li>
            <li>Straps are a little smaller than original, making it slightly more comfortable</li>
            <li>Nice Pruduct.&lt;br /&gt;Lasted  one and a half years before wearing out.</li>
            <li>it was too large for my head even though it is adjustable.</li>
            <li>This one is okay but will not use it again for a replacement the  &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; previously mentioned is worth the money difference.</li>
            <li>Fit properly on a quattro mirage large headgear.</li>
            <li>Respironics brand cost a little more but the quality of their headgear is worth the price.  </li>
            <li>then im use to which makes it feel strange at first and cheap</li>
            <li>No, it isn&#x27;t made real well........</li>
            <li>Went with this one and very comfetable</li>
            <li>It works very well with the mask I purchased its Philips/Respironics</li>
            <li>If you try to attach the Velcro hooks to the fabric farther back (for a tighter fit)</li>
            <li>much cheaper</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t used it much yet</li>
            <li>I thought the price was also reasonable.</li>
            <li>The Resmed mask was elastic enough that you could adjust the Velcro to the fit I wanted, then slide the mask off without undoing the Velcro.  </li>
            <li>I am worried that undoing the Velcro every time I take the mask off will cause the Velcro to wear out unusually soon.  </li>
            <li>I currently use a Respironics Comfort gel nasal mask, but this headgear would fit on the Sullivan nasal masks I had before.</li>
            <li>The straps with the velcro are much thinner than depicted---mainly in that the strap part is thinner than the velcro.</li>
            <li>They work very well for me.</li>
            <li>and it is working very well.  </li>
            <li>The headgear that came with my CPAP mask fell apart after a gentle hand washing.  </li>
            <li>It works very well</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY recommend them to anyone needing CPAP supplies!</li>
            <li>I will defiantly be purchasing my other replacement products from the company since the quality of this headgear was outstanding.</li>
            <li>Product was ok for the first few nights.</li>
            <li>The straps stretched out and the velcro doesnt stick securely after one month of use.</li>
            <li>Seems like a decent product for the price.</li>
            <li>Ill pay more for a better product.</li>
            <li>Overall they work adequately.</li>
            <li>I even dreamed, very vivid dreams;</li>
            <li>Comfortable and have had no issues with them coming loose.</li>
            <li>Seller sent a new one asap, &amp; that one fell apart after 1 week.</li>
            <li>Recommend to anyone who needs a new headgear strap.  </li>
            <li>The new mask said it did not come with headgear</li>
            <li>then either on purpose or by accident the party that shipped the mask also had a new headgear in the box...</li>
            <li>price.&lt;br /&gt;You will have to use your OEM hardware, but it takes a minute to insert the new headgear.</li>
            <li>I think having both straps at the back instead of one over the top is the reason I had a little trouble feeling comfortable with it at first.</li>
            <li>I bought the second as a backup for when the first needs to be replaced.</li>
            <li>its Micky mouse compared to my original and more expensive</li>
            <li>Exactly the same headgear that we were paying around $30 for .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what i need with the big price tag..</li>
            <li>cause my friend sewed new velcro onto my old 1.</li>
            <li>It stretched out some a little quick and doesn&#x27;t feel quite as well make as the original</li>
            <li>I set a very loose fit generally; this band is not up to par.</li>
            <li>Headgear is quite adequate but is made in a thinner mateiral than I expected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable, you don&#x27;t have to have it too tight to hold the mask in place,</li>
            <li>I expect it to last about as long as my original one.</li>
            <li>The head gear is difficult to adjust to a comfortable fit</li>
            <li>My old head gear was streached out.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find out the the attaching clips were not included.</li>
            <li>LOST ITS ELASTICITY TO EARLY....</li>
            <li>been using my old 1 for over a year now.</li>
            <li>It fits as well as headgear I&#x27;ve paid twice as much for, and is made of the same material.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to buy at least one more</li>
            <li>Found out that I had the wrong size mask and was given a used one until my insurance will pay for a new one, The band went with the old mask when replaced with a new mask with a better holding band!</li>
            <li>, THE STUFF THEY PUT IN ORIGINAL PACKAGES ARE CHEAP, THIS IS GOING ON 8 MONTHS AND HASNT FAILED YET</li>
            <li>The structured webbing at the back of the head has distributed the force of the facemask more evenly over his entire face, so now there&#x27;s less pressure on his nose.  </li>
            <li>The headset does stretch but the fixed Velcro attachment points don&#x27;t allow the headset to provide a tight enough mask fit.</li>
            <li>I will see to make my own head gear - this is to small - straps are to small to fit headgear - keeps slipping...</li>
            <li>The material stretches and loses elasticity very quickly.</li>
            <li>At first it appeared it wouldn&#x27;t last long at all, but it has held up quite well..</li>
            <li>Not exactly the same, some of the materials are different from the original one, but it works as intended.</li>
            <li>Bought several makes of headgear and this by far exceeds the comfort of their competition.  </li>
            <li>I chose this for the low price and was surprised by the quality.  </li>
            <li>To narrow bands and the connecting straps do not seem quite right.</li>
            <li>Some reviewers complained about it being cheap, but mine is just starting to fray a tiny bit on the edges of two of the straps.</li>
            <li>Compared to the Resmed head gear I was trying to replace, this was much thinner and less elastic.  </li>
            <li>Instead of one long Velcro with infinite attachment points, each attachment point has 2 fixed (very short) Velcro straps.</li>
            <li>This is not what I expected, cheap material , elastic bands stretched after a few days.</li>

            <li> I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit and very comfortable</li>
            <li> It fits perfectly and is more comfortable than the headgear that came with the CPAP machine.</li>
            <li> It is good quality and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Perfect, exactly what I needed to replace the one that came with my mask after the layers started separating</li>
            <li> The tube is great quality and easy to attached.</li>
            <li> After one month of use, the velcro was no longer  effective.  </li>
            <li> how stable and effective the seal is that the mask makes with my face.  </li>
            <li> Feels nice.</li>
            <li> The Velcro holds nicely and does not slip.</li>
            <li> and it was no longer effective at holding my mask in place.</li>
            <li> I am happy for the quick delivery, but this product is an inferior product.</li>
            <li> Great price, quick delivery, received as described / advertised.  </li>
            <li> It fits fine and is good quality fabric.</li>
            <li> This is a great replacement for my other headgrear, it now the best</li>
            <li> was ok but not as nice as the Rem one&#x27;s</li>
            <li> It was a great fit... nice and sturdy with a snug fit that didn&#x27;t stretch out mid-sleep session...</li>
            <li> The replacement gear was exactly what I wanted and fit perfectly with my equipment.</li>
            <li> This headgear was an exact replacement for the original at a very good price!  </li>
            <li> Just as in photo and got here pretty quick very happy thank you</li>
            <li> It worked fine for what I needed!</li>
            <li> This particular item help it stay in place on my head for a good nights sleep!~</li>
            <li> I like this headgear, very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Good price and quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Very nice and high quality!!  </li>
            <li> AND SAID THAT IS VERY GOOD LIKE THE FIRST ORIGINAL HEADGEAR.</li>
            <li> It works OK, I guess.</li>
            <li> can you give more percise measurements</li>
            <li> Better than the one that came with my cpap mask.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the product I got for this price.</li>
            <li> better than one got from cpap supplier</li>
            <li> They are just okay</li>
            <li> a week I&#x27;m even more pleased.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> The replacement headgear is ok.  </li>
            <li> We can now afford to change headgear more often at this price.</li>
            <li> It is an excellent product for a low price.</li>
            <li> and I am looking forward to many nights of use.</li>
            <li> Restocking fee because opened, and shipping to return would have been way more than cost head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to sew two of these together to see if it will be better.</li>
            <li> Feels much better this way.</li>
            <li> thank you love getting stuff on Amazon</li>
            <li> I like the swivel connectors, much more convenient that the OEM</li>
            <li> Seems to be much better construction than default head gear.</li>
            <li> So glad that I was able to order the headgear for my husband.  </li>
            <li> I could not be more please or satisfied with this company.</li>
            <li> Its a good quality product and the price is right for the item.</li>
            <li> very good strap, the kind I like using, works well, lasts a usually long time, respironics brand of cpap machine</li>
            <li> Very comfortable, I like the fact that it is easy to adjust.</li>
            <li> It is very comfortable and came very quickly.  </li>
            <li> but it works pretty good</li>
            <li> But for a backup, it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> These are ok, they work fine, but as with all Velcro they tend to lose their abilities to stick after so many uses.  </li>
            <li> Top quality and easy to install</li>
            <li> Very comfortable fit.</li>
            <li> My husband says they fit better than any he has had before .</li>
            <li> My husband has sleep apnea, and he says this head gear is much more comfortable than the one he had before.</li>
            <li> however its thinner and more flimsey than the original respironics mask.</li>
            <li> And it was easy to assemble.</li>
            <li> This is an easy source of replacement parts for my cpap.</li>
            <li> Velcro type attachments appear strong as is the neoprene headgear.</li>
            <li> MOST highly recommended for CPAP users looking for a better fitting headgear (just be sure to keep your mask&#x27;s clips--this is headgear ONLY).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this head gear a year ago and it is still working fine for me.</li>
            <li> Straps are comfortable and easy to adjust.</li>
            <li> but it just fine</li>
            <li> It is comfortable, easily adjustable, light and almost inconspicuous.  </li>
            <li> Great fit, cut an unsure what the purpose of the double Velcro is.</li>
            <li> I guess this would fit about any 4 point cpap mask.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it on a Profile Light (medium).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> For me its perfect for everyday use .</li>
            <li> free</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s snug and secure.</li>
            <li> but I just cant seem to get a comfortable fit.</li>
            <li> Had to modify to fit head.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t fit well or adjust to fit well.  </li>
            <li> Extremely comfortable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very comfortable and like the fit better than my old headgear but</li>
            <li> The Velcro did not work on original mask band</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace the original one that came with my Bipap machine and mask.</li>
            <li> THE ORIGINAL I HAVE LASTED NOT EVEN 2 WEEKS</li>
            <li> Comparable to original equipment.</li>
            <li> The lack of elasticity significantly affects  </li>
            <li> I am terrified to clean it and have it disintegrate at this point.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of goofy with all the stuff on the back.  </li>
            <li> Not a perfect, fit but its nice to wake up with your mask on your nose  NOT blowing air into your ear !!! :)</li>
            <li> I loved it until it started to stretch out over time but not in the standard \\&quot;getting</li>
            <li> He sleeps better &amp; has said this is MUCH more comfortable for him than the standard</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> For the price its not bad but</li>
            <li> Fantastic product and delivered right to my door.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit the same as the original, but is more comfortable.</li>
            <li> but I like it better than the older one.</li>
            <li> Universal and worked well to replace the headgear on a nasal mask that I was able to salvage and get more use out of.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would, however, use this exclusively if they could remedy the issue with the straps narrowing so quickly.</li>
            <li> ordered this, just hoping it MIGHT help &amp; it does make a tremendous difference in his comfort level.  </li>
            <li> But overall it fit nice on</li>
            <li> «hopefully it will last as I have bought three to make sure I don&#x27;t run out when pcs don&#x27;t hold after so many uses</li>
            <li> This one came quick and has done the trick.</li>
            <li> This is my 4th style and by far the most comfortable.</li>
            <li> &gt; The new one works much better for me.</li>
            <li> This headgear strap is a great general replacement for your old or worn CPAP machine.</li>
            <li> In fact last night was the best night of sleep I&#x27;ve had in a long time.  </li>
            <li> Very dissapointed!!</li>
            <li> The head gear is easy to install and is fairly comfortable as far as CPAP/BIPAP headgear goes.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure it will last just fine.</li>
            <li> Also, how light weight the material is makes me suspect that what elasticity it does have, will not be very durable either.</li>
            <li> Item fit like a &amp;#34;glove&amp;#34;, and met my expectations with fast shipping</li>
            <li> However, it does not come with any attachements (just the strap and the velco ends are included - no plastic parts), so when you remove your old strap, be sure to keep the plastic clips.</li>
            <li> We are looking for a different kind of attachment for him to use now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be curious to know if even the good reviews here are repeat customers.  </li>
            <li> I have been surprised and pleased by how well this headgear fits.  </li>
            <li> but we worth the money.</li>
            <li> Sturdy velcro construction, well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Exactly what was wanted, but the large size is huge.  </li>
            <li> , i can see that it would have sutited my needs if it were the right size.</li>
            <li> Not elastic, so may not be right for you if you like an elastic head gear.</li>
            <li> Again my husband happy that I could find a replacement for his old, stretched out strap.  </li>
            <li> Seems very soft and easy to adjust.  </li>
            <li> I found that after just a few uses, I had to tighten it more and more.</li>
            <li> The headgear is comfortable, and it has good elasticity which means that it will probably last for a long time.</li>
            <li> The glue let loose and it just kind of disintegrated.  </li>
            <li> fits snug but comfortable the straps that originally came with it were sometimes too tight and the support for the back of your head was not design as good or sturdy</li>
            <li> The first head gear I received was defective.</li>
            <li> That was the reason that I ordered the replacement headgear in the first place.</li>
            <li> pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> We will definately order more in the future.  </li>
            <li> This makes it not completely worthless, but nearly so.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is OK same as the details in the web</li>
            <li> overall satisfied with the product or my application.</li>
            <li> The first two nights</li>
            <li> Order was received quickly and headgear was better than expected.</li>
            <li> Eight adjustable settings really means 2 short velcro pieces on each side of top and bottom of mask.  </li>
            <li> Straps are a little smaller than original, making it slightly more comfortable</li>
            <li> Nice Pruduct.&lt;br /&gt;Lasted  one and a half years before wearing out.</li>
            <li> it was too large for my head even though it is adjustable.</li>
            <li> This one is okay but will not use it again for a replacement the  &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; previously mentioned is worth the money difference.</li>
            <li> Fit properly on a quattro mirage large headgear.</li>
            <li> Respironics brand cost a little more but the quality of their headgear is worth the price.  </li>
            <li> then im use to which makes it feel strange at first and cheap</li>
            <li> No, it isn&#x27;t made real well........</li>
            <li> Went with this one and very comfetable</li>
            <li> It works very well with the mask I purchased its Philips/Respironics</li>
            <li> If you try to attach the Velcro hooks to the fabric farther back (for a tighter fit)</li>
            <li> much cheaper</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it much yet</li>
            <li> I thought the price was also reasonable.</li>
            <li> The Resmed mask was elastic enough that you could adjust the Velcro to the fit I wanted, then slide the mask off without undoing the Velcro.  </li>
            <li> I am worried that undoing the Velcro every time I take the mask off will cause the Velcro to wear out unusually soon.  </li>
            <li> I currently use a Respironics Comfort gel nasal mask, but this headgear would fit on the Sullivan nasal masks I had before.</li>
            <li> The straps with the velcro are much thinner than depicted---mainly in that the strap part is thinner than the velcro.</li>
            <li> They work very well for me.</li>
            <li> and it is working very well.  </li>
            <li> The headgear that came with my CPAP mask fell apart after a gentle hand washing.  </li>
            <li> It works very well</li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY recommend them to anyone needing CPAP supplies!</li>
            <li> I will defiantly be purchasing my other replacement products from the company since the quality of this headgear was outstanding.</li>
            <li> Product was ok for the first few nights.</li>
            <li> The straps stretched out and the velcro doesnt stick securely after one month of use.</li>
            <li> Seems like a decent product for the price.</li>
            <li> Ill pay more for a better product.</li>
            <li> Overall they work adequately.</li>
            <li> I even dreamed, very vivid dreams;</li>
            <li> Comfortable and have had no issues with them coming loose.</li>
            <li> Seller sent a new one asap, &amp; that one fell apart after 1 week.</li>
            <li> Recommend to anyone who needs a new headgear strap.  </li>
            <li> The new mask said it did not come with headgear</li>
            <li> then either on purpose or by accident the party that shipped the mask also had a new headgear in the box...</li>
            <li> price.&lt;br /&gt;You will have to use your OEM hardware, but it takes a minute to insert the new headgear.</li>
            <li> I think having both straps at the back instead of one over the top is the reason I had a little trouble feeling comfortable with it at first.</li>
            <li> I bought the second as a backup for when the first needs to be replaced.</li>
            <li> its Micky mouse compared to my original and more expensive</li>
            <li> Exactly the same headgear that we were paying around $30 for .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what i need with the big price tag..</li>
            <li> cause my friend sewed new velcro onto my old 1.</li>
            <li> It stretched out some a little quick and doesn&#x27;t feel quite as well make as the original</li>
            <li> I set a very loose fit generally; this band is not up to par.</li>
            <li> Headgear is quite adequate but is made in a thinner mateiral than I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable, you don&#x27;t have to have it too tight to hold the mask in place,</li>
            <li> I expect it to last about as long as my original one.</li>
            <li> The head gear is difficult to adjust to a comfortable fit</li>
            <li> My old head gear was streached out.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find out the the attaching clips were not included.</li>
            <li> LOST ITS ELASTICITY TO EARLY....</li>
            <li> been using my old 1 for over a year now.</li>
            <li> It fits as well as headgear I&#x27;ve paid twice as much for, and is made of the same material.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to buy at least one more</li>
            <li> Found out that I had the wrong size mask and was given a used one until my insurance will pay for a new one, The band went with the old mask when replaced with a new mask with a better holding band!</li>
            <li> , THE STUFF THEY PUT IN ORIGINAL PACKAGES ARE CHEAP, THIS IS GOING ON 8 MONTHS AND HASNT FAILED YET</li>
            <li> The structured webbing at the back of the head has distributed the force of the facemask more evenly over his entire face, so now there&#x27;s less pressure on his nose.  </li>
            <li> The headset does stretch but the fixed Velcro attachment points don&#x27;t allow the headset to provide a tight enough mask fit.</li>
            <li> I will see to make my own head gear - this is to small - straps are to small to fit headgear - keeps slipping...</li>
            <li> The material stretches and loses elasticity very quickly.</li>
            <li> At first it appeared it wouldn&#x27;t last long at all, but it has held up quite well..</li>
            <li> Not exactly the same, some of the materials are different from the original one, but it works as intended.</li>
            <li> Bought several makes of headgear and this by far exceeds the comfort of their competition.  </li>
            <li> I chose this for the low price and was surprised by the quality.  </li>
            <li> To narrow bands and the connecting straps do not seem quite right.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers complained about it being cheap, but mine is just starting to fray a tiny bit on the edges of two of the straps.</li>
            <li> Compared to the Resmed head gear I was trying to replace, this was much thinner and less elastic.  </li>
            <li> Instead of one long Velcro with infinite attachment points, each attachment point has 2 fixed (very short) Velcro straps.</li>
            <li> This is not what I expected, cheap material , elastic bands stretched after a few days.</li>
            <li> This one fits my mask properly and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure there is even much if any price difference</li>
            <li> I think it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Specifically, the bands are about 3/4 inch wide when new, mine are now stretched to the point the bands are now about 1/2 inch wide.</li>
            <li> Maybe I like my mask tight, but if it&#x27;s not tight, it leaks.  </li>
            <li> and it was already all stretched out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking all over for one of these straps and the prices were outrageous, but luckily I found you guys and was able to get this at a price I could afford.</li>
            <li> I got 2 of these when my original headgear  failed.</li>
            <li> It just fits differently than my other straps.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for this replacement for a very long time.</li>
            <li> The velcro doesn&#x27;t cleanly attach and rubs against my face and neck which is really uncomfortable when I sleep.</li>
            <li> I am anxious to see how long it lasts as I felt the last one I purchased was actually thicker.</li>
            <li> But... the material stretches out and begins to loose structural integrity in just a week of use.</li>
            <li> Of course the Velcro stayed the same width leaving half of it exposed to rub against my face.</li>
            <li> This one was thin flimsy and you can tell was not made very well.  </li>
            <li> No, I cannot return it and it does not fit my mask properly.</li>
            <li> Within two weeks the Velcro started slipping to the point where every night I have to re-thread the straps through the frame.  </li>
            <li> Choices are too loose or too tight at each point instead of one long Velcro strip at each point to allow you to adjust to your comfort.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s just like any other strap out there.</li>
            <li> Purchased this and one other headgear.  </li>
            <li> Been suffering from my mask not fitting properly.</li>
            <li> Straps are too narrow and stretched out almost immediately.  </li>
            <li> It works, albeit very rough on your skin.  </li>
            <li> noticed some reviews saying that the straps were thin, but my straps are thicker than the old harness</li>
            <li> longer\\&quot; way... it stretched so that the straps became very narrow.</li>
            <li> My original head gear lasted for 3 years, so needless to say, I was not impressed when this one did not last a week!</li>
            <li> Woke up with both cheeks rubbed raw from rough Velcro.  </li>
            <li> Woke up with black foam all over my pillow from it disintegrating.  </li>
            <li> or I just have an odd shaped head or something.</li>
            <li> Overall, just not a good product.</li>
            <li> the Velcro pulls apart because the tension is too tight.</li>
            <li> The straps are a little thiner</li>
            <li> Took a little whle to get them.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely not worth the money or pain!</li>
            <li> I found it a little scratchy around the edges.  </li>
            <li> I flipped it backwards which took a little work to do.</li>
            <li> Do not like it  is not comfortable</li>
            <li> I have had it for a few weeks now and it has already come apart.  </li>
            <li> are to narrow</li>
            <li> Item design would not fit my CPAP device.</li>
            <li> Stretchy material, missing pieces.</li>
            <li> Does not fit the equipment</li>
            <li> I find the straps are too narrow, and the elastic has already worn out after about 2 months.  </li>
            <li> It took me a few nioghts to come to this conclusion.</li>
            <li> However after using it for a few weeks I think it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Compared to my previous headgear this is unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> ALWAYS slips out of the mask, because the bands are too narrow!</li>
            <li> Straps seemed needlessly overcomplicated with no written explanation on how to use them properly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already bought ANOTHER one for a backup, just in case these become hard to find.  </li>
            <li> I have a hard time keeping my head gear on and in place.  </li>
            <li> After a month it loses shape.  </li>
            <li> Not as thick and well-made as the one that came with the machine.</li>
            <li> but the Velcro was so tight that was unable to readjust while wearing it,</li>
            <li> Poor quality product.</li>
            <li> It is thin, fits like a glove without the tension almost no existent while wearing it.</li>
            <li> poorly made, hurts to use it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am extremely unhappy with how shoddy this is.</li>
            <li> Quite uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> but sadly it was already getting awkward and thin a week in to my purchase.</li>
            <li> No wonder health insurance is so expensive.</li>
            <li> I dont know if I ordered the wrong gear</li>
            <li> and if you have a CPCP you know that it is difficult with any nasal mask to sleep on your side.....</li>
            <li> The straps are very thin comparatively.  </li>
            <li> Very poorly made.  </li>
            <li> Was really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate it, it wont stay on the straps</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Velcro ends are worthless!  </li>
            <li> This headgear is horrible, the Velcro does not stay attached</li>
            <li> the cheapest junk and horribly designed.  </li>

            <li> I have been using Cpap for 7 yrs and this has to be the best head strap I ever used.  It&#x27;s comfortable, you don&#x27;t have to have it too tight to hold the mask in place, so now I don&#x27;t have marks on my face from my mask.  No leaks.  In fact last night was the best night of sleep I&#x27;ve had in a long time.  I even dreamed, very vivid dreams; which is a way to know you went into deep REM.  I will be ordering extra.</li>
            <li> perfect…..good price also.</li>
            <li> The Velcro on the straps were wider than the strap which caused skin irritation.</li>
            <li> Seems like a decent product for the price. I had to go to the post office and pay for shipping!?!?  It&#x27;s not the $1.28 its the inconvenience, I ordered this and had it shipped to my house for a reason. Was really disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is a very good replacement headgear.  It fits perfectly and is more comfortable than the headgear that came with the CPAP machine.</li>
            <li> The head gear is easy to install and is fairly comfortable as far as CPAP/BIPAP headgear goes. But... the material stretches out and begins to loose structural integrity in just a week of use. Specifically, the bands are about 3/4 inch wide when new, mine are now stretched to the point the bands are now about 1/2 inch wide. I have to continually tighten the Velcro straps to maintain a seal. I set a very loose fit generally; this band is not up to par.</li>
            <li> The first head gear I received was defective. Seller sent a new one asap, &amp; that one fell apart after 1 week. My original head gear lasted for 3 years, so needless to say, I was not impressed when this one did not last a week!</li>
            <li> was ok but not as nice as the Rem one&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Yes it fits, no it doesn&#x27;t last.  No, it isn&#x27;t made real well........I&#x27;m not sure there is even much if any price difference - I went back to the OEM head gear.</li>
            <li> Not exactly the same, some of the materials are different from the original one, but it works as intended.</li>
            <li> The straps stretched out and the velcro doesnt stick securely after one month of use.</li>
            <li> excellent 100% recommended</li>
            <li> Do not like it  is not comfortable</li>
            <li> Respironics brand cost a little more but the quality of their headgear is worth the price.  This one fits my mask properly and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> The head gear is difficult to adjust to a comfortable fit but I like it better than the older one.</li>
            <li> It worked fine for what I needed!</li>
            <li> I went with another mask with a different head gear smaller in design.&lt;br /&gt; The new one works much better for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this headgear for about a month and it&#x27;s already coming apart.  It&#x27;s very comfortable and like the fit better than my old headgear but the foam in the webbing in the back is coming apart from the fabric.</li>
            <li> To narrow bands and the connecting straps do not seem quite right. It works OK, I guess.</li>
            <li> No directions for proper sizing! No directions at all!</li>
            <li> very comfortable headgear!</li>
            <li> Product was ok for the first few nights. But it does not last. The material stretches and loses elasticity very quickly. I found that after just a few uses, I had to tighten it more and more. And once the material stretches, the hook part of the velcro is exposed and rubs against my face. I would not recommend this product at all.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit and very comfortable</li>
            <li> Great replacement headgear.</li>
            <li> Get what you pay for.  This think fell a part in a month. Woke up with black foam all over my pillow from it disintegrating.  I will pay the extra money next time and by the official Respironics part. This one was thin flimsy and you can tell was not made very well.  Definitely would not buy this part again.</li>
            <li> Poor quality product. Not comparable to Resperonics.</li>
            <li> I like this headgear, very comfortable. a good replacement for the gear that comes with your CPAP device. I think it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> What a great leap in headgear.  It is comfortable, easily adjustable, light and almost inconspicuous.  I sleep like a baby.</li>
            <li> The Velcro did not work on original mask band so thought I would see if this would work. It did work maybe to well.  did not come off while sleeping but the Velcro was so tight that was unable to readjust while wearing it,Found out that I had the wrong size mask and was given a used one until my insurance will pay for a new one, The band went with the old mask when replaced with a new mask with a better holding band!</li>
            <li> Almost NO flex! ALWAYS slips out of the mask, because the bands are too narrow! Velcro ends are worthless!  DONT PAY FOR THIS! GET THE BRAND NAME or you will REGRET IT!</li>
            <li> as advertised - good service</li>
            <li> I got 2 of these when my original headgear  failed. Not a perfect, fit but its nice to wake up with your mask on your nose  NOT blowing air into your ear !!! :)</li>
            <li> These are ok, they work fine, but as with all Velcro they tend to lose their abilities to stick after so many uses.  Comfortable and have had no issues with them coming loose.</li>
            <li> I am happy for the quick delivery, but this product is an inferior product. I have had it for a few weeks now and it has already come apart.  I would not recommend this product and will never buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely unhappy with how shoddy this is.</li>
            <li> Just as in photo and got here pretty quick very happy thank you</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price I paid. Universal and worked well to replace the headgear on a nasal mask that I was able to salvage and get more use out of. I would probably but another if the need arises.</li>
            <li> it was too large for my head even though it is adjustable. can you give more percise measurements, i can see that it would have sutited my needs if it were the right size.</li>
            <li> Great price, quick delivery, received as described / advertised.  Recommend to anyone who needs a new headgear strap.  Better than the one that came with my cpap mask.</li>
            <li> the price was great and more convenient to order, than thru the insurance company it fits perfectly and is very comfortable</li>
            <li> I bought this head gear a year ago and it is still working fine for me. Some reviewers complained about it being cheap, but mine is just starting to fray a tiny bit on the edges of two of the straps. I never unclip the straps from my mask, I just pull the mask off and on over my head. And this head gear still has quite of bit of stretch.  I am pleased with the product I got for this price.</li>
            <li> This headgear strap is a great general replacement for your old or worn CPAP machine. However, it does not come with any attachements (just the strap and the velco ends are included - no plastic parts), so when you remove your old strap, be sure to keep the plastic clips. Otherwise, it&#x27;s just like any other strap out there.</li>
            <li> It was a great fit... nice and sturdy with a snug fit that didn&#x27;t stretch out mid-sleep session... I loved it until it started to stretch out over time but not in the standard \\&quot;getting longer\\&quot; way... it stretched so that the straps became very narrow. Of course the Velcro stayed the same width leaving half of it exposed to rub against my face. Quite uncomfortable. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would, however, use this exclusively if they could remedy the issue with the straps narrowing so quickly. Even if it lasted a month I&#x27;d buy them... but sadly it was already getting awkward and thin a week in to my purchase. Oh well. On to find another one.</li>
            <li> better than one got from cpap supplier</li>
            <li> This is not what I expected, cheap material , elastic bands stretched after a few days.</li>
            <li> Hubby&#x27;s been doing CPAP therapy for almost two years now and his biggest problem has been dealing with pressure points on the bridge of his nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this, just hoping it MIGHT help &amp; it does make a tremendous difference in his comfort level.  The structured webbing at the back of the head has distributed the force of the facemask more evenly over his entire face, so now there&#x27;s less pressure on his nose.  He sleeps better &amp; has said this is MUCH more comfortable for him than the standard headgear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A winner!  I&#x27;ve already bought ANOTHER one for a backup, just in case these become hard to find.  MOST highly recommended for CPAP users looking for a better fitting headgear (just be sure to keep your mask&#x27;s clips--this is headgear ONLY).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  Just FYI, his mask is a Respironics AMARA, though I think this headgear would work well with ANY four-point setup.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace the original one that came with my Bipap machine and mask. It works well as a replacement however its thinner and more flimsey than the original respironics mask. Not sturdy at all but like i said it works, fits around my head with no problem. For the price its not bad but next time Ill pay more for a better product.</li>
            <li> This headgear was an exact replacement for the original at a very good price!  I recommend it for anyone looking for headgear so simple to apply that my 89 year-old mother-in-law can do it!</li>
            <li> My old head gear was streached out. Went with this one and very comfetable</li>
            <li> For the price is a good deal. The straps are a little thiner then im use to which makes it feel strange at first and cheap but it works pretty good</li>
            <li> Bought several makes of headgear and this by far exceeds the comfort of their competition.  It is thin, fits like a glove without the tension almost no existent while wearing it. Don&#x27;t know about the longevity of the product but will keep you informed.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find out the the attaching clips were not included. That was the reason that I ordered the replacement headgear in the first place. I had to go back and reengineer it that it could be used</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this item . It is good quality and very easy to use. I bought the second as a backup for when the first needs to be replaced. I definitely would recommend this item to friends and family</li>
            <li> Straps seemed needlessly overcomplicated with no written explanation on how to use them properly. Overall they work adequately. They are just okay</li>
            <li> The new mask said it did not come with headgear so i bought this one... then either on purpose or by accident the party that shipped the mask also had a new headgear in the box...que sera...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;always good to have a spare</li>
            <li> Seems very soft and easy to adjust.  I guess this would fit about any 4 point cpap mask.  I&#x27;m using it on a Profile Light (medium).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week I&#x27;m even more pleased.  Very comfortable.</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD! MY HUSBAND NEEDS THIS TO SLEEP AND SAID THAT IS VERY GOOD LIKE THE FIRST ORIGINAL HEADGEAR. TKS</li>
            <li> It works very well with the mask I purchased its Philips/Respironics so you know that it&#x27;s good quality for CPAP mask usage so I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> After one month of use, the velcro was no longer  effective.  It&#x27;s not a quality product.  I would not recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just received an e-mail from vendor. Vendor said that these are to be replaced every 30 days.  If you are looking for a durable product, this is not it.</li>
            <li> No, I cannot return it and it does not fit my mask properly.</li>
            <li> The headset does stretch but the fixed Velcro attachment points don&#x27;t allow the headset to provide a tight enough mask fit. If you try to attach the Velcro hooks to the fabric farther back (for a tighter fit) the Velcro pulls apart because the tension is too tight. Instead of one long Velcro with infinite attachment points, each attachment point has 2 fixed (very short) Velcro straps. If you use the shortest one it leaves the longest strap dangling abt 2&amp;#34; in front of the mask. No paperwork came with the headset.</li>
            <li> I need remstarplus series m cushions</li>
            <li> The product I received was the standard respironics headgear.  It does not have the same webbing in the back as is pictured.</li>
            <li> LOST ITS ELASTICITY TO EARLY....AND VELCRO DIDN&#x27;T LAST</li>
            <li> Took a little whle to get them. Postal problem not company problem. My husband says they fit better than any he has had before . Will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> I hate it, it wont stay on the straps are to narrow, I gave it every chance but after 2 weeks I bought a different one and chucked it in the trash</li>
            <li> this product arrived on time,and it fits great.</li>
            <li> its Micky mouse compared to my original and more expensive</li>
            <li> For me its perfect for everyday use .</li>
            <li> Nice Pruduct.&lt;br /&gt;Lasted  one and a half years before wearing out. Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Holds the cpap in place pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;Just ordered another may just get two at this price to make my min. free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;So much cheaper then those medical supply places. No wonder health insurance is so expensive.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product and delivered right to my door.  FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it much yet cause my friend sewed new velcro onto my old 1. been using my old 1 for over a year now. So now I use this as my back up. Works on my Resmed mask.</li>
            <li> This headgear is horrible, the Velcro does not stay attached and I am always having to adjust it. I will never buy this type again.</li>
            <li> The replacement headgear is ok.  I preferred the older one I had because it had less on the back of the head.  This one is over made,&lt;br /&gt;Also, don&#x27;t  like the loop attachments for the</li>
            <li> Item design would not fit my CPAP device.</li>
            <li> Stretchy material, missing pieces. Had to be replaced or duct taped once a week. Not rwalistic.</li>
            <li> It works, albeit very rough on your skin.  After a month it loses shape.  You get what you pay for, so no grieve here.</li>
            <li> THE ORIGINAL I HAVE LASTED NOT EVEN 2 WEEKS, THE STUFF THEY PUT IN ORIGINAL PACKAGES ARE CHEAP, THIS IS GOING ON 8 MONTHS AND HASNT FAILED YET</li>
            <li> Awesome headgear, great fit, great deal.</li>
            <li> Does not fit the equipment</li>
            <li> Respironics headgear was of good quality a number of years ago.  NOW it the cheapest junk and horribly designed.  Very dissapointed!!</li>
            <li> Perfect fit. Had I known it would have worked out for me so well, I would have ordered another one at the time. Good price and quick shipping.</li>
            <li> product as discribed.  Fit properly on a quattro mirage large headgear. Comparable to original equipment. Velcro type attachments appear strong as is the neoprene headgear.</li>
            <li> Top quality and easy to install</li>
            <li> Very comfortable, I like the fact that it is easy to adjust.</li>
            <li> Exactly the same headgear that we were paying around $30 for . We will definately order more in the future.  We can now afford to change headgear more often at this price.</li>
            <li> I like it. It&#x27;s snug and secure. I hope the tiny velcro connectors hold up - that&#x27;s my only worry.</li>
            <li> It worked well with the Mask I purchased. I thought the price was also reasonable. And it was easy to assemble.</li>
            <li> I dont know if I ordered the wrong gear or I just have an odd shaped head or something. It just fits differently than my other straps. It does work but I just cant seem to get a comfortable fit.</li>
            <li> It is very comfortable and came very quickly.  Compared to my previous headgear this is unbelievable.  The fit is perfect for me.  I can&#x27;t sing enough praises for it.</li>
            <li> fits snug but comfortable the straps that originally came with it were sometimes too tight and the support for the back of your head was not design as good or sturdy</li>
            <li> It is what it says it is, headgear for cpaps and I would presume could work for those who use a bipap as well seeing as it is headgear that goes on the mask itself.</li>
            <li> It is an excellent product for a low price. The gel insert makes the mask very comfortable to wear and it increased my CPAP compliance greatly.</li>
            <li> Compared to the Resmed head gear I was trying to replace, this was much thinner and less elastic.  The lack of elasticity significantly affects  how stable and effective the seal is that the mask makes with my face.  This makes it not completely worthless, but nearly so.  I also have doubts about its durability.  The Resmed mask was elastic enough that you could adjust the Velcro to the fit I wanted, then slide the mask off without undoing the Velcro.  That does not seem possible with this head gear.  I am worried that undoing the Velcro every time I take the mask off will cause the Velcro to wear out unusually soon.  Also, how light weight the material is makes me suspect that what elasticity it does have, will not be very durable either.</li>
            <li> The attachment started falling apart after four months of use. The neoprene does not hold up well with sweat or tossing and turning. It started pilling off after two months of use and is hanging on by a thread. I am terrified to clean it and have it disintegrate at this point. We are looking for a different kind of attachment for him to use now.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband. At first it appeared it wouldn&#x27;t last long at all, but it has held up quite well..it&#x27;s a good price and it works. Not as thick and well-made as the one that came with the machine.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a very nice headgear for masks.  Has great adjustable straps and I am looking forward to many nights of use.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time keeping my head gear on and in place.  This particular item help it stay in place on my head for a good nights sleep!~</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t the one I needed. Wish you would show a picture from all sides</li>
            <li> This seems to be the correct replacement for my Respironics mask.  The material seems a bit different from the one that came with my mask, but it fits correctly, and works well.  Good price.&lt;br /&gt;You will have to use your OEM hardware, but it takes a minute to insert the new headgear.</li>
            <li> I like it.  My husband and I both use CPAP.  The price was great.  I would buy again. It was shipped as described.</li>
            <li> Good headgear. Sometimes these things just unravel and wear out.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m having to place a piece of cotton over my head at night.  I&#x27;m allergic to whatever product this is made from.  I&#x27;ve never had this problem before.</li>
            <li> Within two weeks the Velcro started slipping to the point where every night I have to re-thread the straps through the frame.  There is no elasticity at all with these straps, which has occasionally caused issues when I flip from side to side.  The straps are very thin comparatively.  Overall, just not a good product. I&#x27;d be curious to know if even the good reviews here are repeat customers.  Not me.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit the same as the original, but is more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Not made with quality materials.</li>
            <li> Great fit, cut an unsure what the purpose of the double Velcro is. But overall it fit nice on my respironics has piece. Hopefully the Velcro lasts!</li>
            <li> It fits as well as headgear I&#x27;ve paid twice as much for, and is made of the same material. I currently use a Respironics Comfort gel nasal mask, but this headgear would fit on the Sullivan nasal masks I had before. I&#x27;m going to buy at least one more so I can rotate them and make washing them easier.</li>
            <li> The replacement gear was exactly what I wanted and fit perfectly with my equipment. I will defiantly be purchasing my other replacement products from the company since the quality of this headgear was outstanding.</li>
            <li> I received this product and it was not as shown in the picture. The straps with the velcro are much thinner than depicted---mainly in that the strap part is thinner than the velcro. The result? The velcro doesn&#x27;t cleanly attach and rubs against my face and neck which is really uncomfortable when I sleep.</li>
            <li> Order was received quickly and headgear was better than expected. It fits and looks sturdy enough to hold up well.</li>
            <li> I find the straps are too narrow, and the elastic has already worn out after about 2 months.  Maybe I like my mask tight, but if it&#x27;s not tight, it leaks.  I won&#x27;t be purchasing again.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> They work very well for me. I am very pleased</li>
            <li> Hello. I have been searching for this replacement for a very long time. This is a very very good price . The best I&#x27;ve seen. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This product works well.  I started using one as soon as I got it and it is working very well.  The price is really good.</li>
            <li> «hopefully it will last as I have bought three to make sure I don&#x27;t run out when pcs don&#x27;t hold after so many uses</li>
            <li> Woke up with both cheeks rubbed raw from rough Velcro.  Eight adjustable settings really means 2 short velcro pieces on each side of top and bottom of mask.  Choices are too loose or too tight at each point instead of one long Velcro strip at each point to allow you to adjust to your comfort.  If you choose the smaller setting the left over part is constantly flipping around your face.  This product is definitely not worth the money or pain!</li>
            <li> I have a ResMed CPAP Machine.  Got it the middle of December.  My insurance only allows a Headgear Replacement at six months.  I have had mine five months and it was already all stretched out.  Purchased this and one other headgear.  This one is really nice!  I like the way it hugs my head and keeps that nasal mask  in place.  I am a side sleeper.....and if you have a CPCP you know that it is difficult with any nasal mask to sleep on your side.....even if you have a CPAP pillow!  This headgear is the best!</li>
            <li> Very nice and high quality!!  Great price!!</li>
            <li> I have a machine&lt;br /&gt;It is OK same as the details in the web&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again maybe in future</li>
            <li> This strap has a couple of ways to adjust it. It fits the mouth/nose piece perfectly.  I am anxious to see how long it lasts as I felt the last one I purchased was actually thicker.</li>
            <li> Item fit like a &amp;#34;glove&amp;#34;, and met my expectations with fast shipping</li>
            <li> Great price and works well. Accommodates both x-large and x-small sizes.  For best fit eliminate what you do not need. It took me a few nioghts to come to this conclusion. I am very happy with the product now,  There is no guidance to point you in this direction. Was a 3 star now a 5 star</li>
            <li> The tube is great quality and easy to attached. Straps are comfortable and easy to adjust. Shipments and turnaround time was excellent. This is an easy source of replacement parts for my cpap.</li>
            <li> I chose this for the low price and was surprised by the quality.  I bought 2 of them and have one for a spare,  Been suffering from my mask not fitting properly. This one fits well,</li>
            <li> The headgear that came with my CPAP mask fell apart after a gentle hand washing.  The glue let loose and it just kind of disintegrated.  This one came quick and has done the trick.</li>
            <li> Exactly what was wanted, but the large size is huge.  Had to modify to fit head.  Restocking fee because opened, and shipping to return would have been way more than cost head.</li>
            <li> very good strap, the kind I like using, works well, lasts a usually long time, respironics brand of cpap machine</li>
            <li> I have been surprised and pleased by how well this headgear fits.  This is my 4th style and by far the most comfortable.</li>
            <li> Its a good quality product and the price is right for the item. overall satisfied with the product or my application.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. It fits fine and is good quality fabric. I will but again when this wears out.</li>
            <li> Was hoping for something stronger.  I&#x27;m going to sew two of these together to see if it will be better.</li>
            <li> poorly made, hurts to use it.</li>
            <li> I fits good. Feels nice. It stretched out some a little quick and doesn&#x27;t feel quite as well make as the original but we worth the money.</li>
            <li> Excelent product for the price!  The first two nights I found it a little scratchy around the edges.  I flipped it backwards which took a little work to do. Feels much better this way.</li>
            <li> This headgear was even nicer than I thought when I ordered it. Sturdy velcro construction, well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable fit. Excellent replacement for my original strap. I expect it to last about as long as my original one. The Velcro holds nicely and does not slip.</li>
            <li> It works very well thank you love getting stuff on Amazon</li>
            <li> It grate realy happy with it</li>
            <li> they do the job. I like the swivel connectors, much more convenient that the OEM</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t fit well or adjust to fit well.  mostly my fault may have ordered wrong product</li>
            <li> A great replacement strap - good value for price. Straps are a little smaller than original, making it slightly more comfortable</li>
            <li> The headgear is comfortable, and it has good elasticity which means that it will probably last for a long time.</li>
            <li> I will see to make my own head gear - this is to small - straps are to small to fit headgear - keeps slipping...</li>
            <li> This is a great replacement for my other headgrear, it now the best but it just fine,the was unbeatable,So i tried it.</li>
            <li> Very poorly made.  Straps are too narrow and stretched out almost immediately.  Velcro doesn&#x27;t hold.  I would never buy this again nor would I recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have not tried this product yet.  I thought I was get the nasal pods included in the order, so I will let you know after I try it.</li>
            <li> I think having both straps at the back instead of one over the top is the reason I had a little trouble feeling comfortable with it at first. However after using it for a few weeks I think it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed some reviews saying that the straps were thin, but my straps are thicker than the old harness and I&#x27;m sure it will last just fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what i need with the big price tag.. I would definitely recommend for any one who want to replace there straps..</li>
            <li> Perfect, exactly what I needed to replace the one that came with my mask after the layers started separating and it was no longer effective at holding my mask in place. Seems to be much better construction than default head gear. Not elastic, so may not be right for you if you like an elastic head gear.</li>
            <li> Es muy parecido al producto anterior. Es tambien de muy confortable y de muy buena calidad. Recomiendo al vendedor. Llego tal como lo pactamos.</li>
            <li> My husband has sleep apnea, and he says this head gear is much more comfortable than the one he had before.</li>
            <li> Thank you. I&#x27;ve been looking all over for one of these straps and the prices were outrageous, but luckily I found you guys and was able to get this at a price I could afford. thanks.</li>
            <li> This item changed my life! Birds are chirping, sun is shining and I can&#x27;t beat the women off with a stick!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of goofy with all the stuff on the back.  Since I shower at night, it leaves my hair a wreck.  But for a backup, it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> So glad that I was able to order the headgear for my husband.  He gets his rest and so do I.</li>
            <li> Again my husband happy that I could find a replacement for his old, stretched out strap.  He is quiet and content now.</li>
            <li> Headgear is quite adequate but is made in a thinner mateiral than I expected.</li>
            <li> Got 2 types to see what the difference was between the ResMed Mirage/Mirage FX.  This one is okay but will not use it again for a replacement the  &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; previously mentioned is worth the money difference.</li>
            <li> I could not be more please or satisfied with this company. They were the best to deal with. I would HIGHLY recommend them to anyone needing CPAP supplies!</li>
            <li> Extremely comfortable.</li>
    </ol>
