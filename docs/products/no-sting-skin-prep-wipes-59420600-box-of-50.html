            <li>Awesome price with rapid shipping.</li>
            <li>no issues with product Great seller.</li>
            <li>packaged good and priced I guess where it should be.  </li>
            <li>Another good product to prevent skin from opening up on reddened areas.</li>
            <li>I will be carrying it when I travel for sure!  </li>
            <li>perfect, absolutly what i needed and came in a timely manner, thank you so much.</li>
            <li>SIMPLY THE BEST OF ITS KIND!  </li>
            <li>Good product, I have tried several and these work the best.</li>
            <li>It makes taking off the tape very easy and stops skin irritation.</li>
            <li>I have used  many times before.</li>
            <li>Love this product-easy to use</li>
            <li>but at a better price.</li>
            <li>Do not wait 30 minutes or more after using this to apply the dressing.</li>
            <li>Also, if you do wear a pain patch, be sure to not get the ointment from the wipes under where the patch will be.</li>
            <li>IT IS THE BEST!!!!!So I ordered more, myself...</li>
            <li>The No-Sting by Smith and Nephew is simply the best.  </li>
            <li>No-Sting Skin Prep Wipes made a huge difference on the longevity of the sticking power.</li>
            <li>But, if used properly, this is a great product</li>
            <li>It comes in handy, sealed packets, which keeps the interior pads moist until they are ready to be used which extends &amp;#34;shelf-life&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Most importantly, to me, is the fact that the wipes can be used on very sensitive/raw skin without the unbearable sting of alcohol - hence the name: &amp;#34;NO-STING&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Quick service&lt;br /&gt;Product not as good as regular skin</li>
            <li>Right product at the right price!</li>
            <li>It will create a barrier and the medicine will not be absorbed correctly.</li>
            <li>These wipes are Great for assisting in healing sensitive skin or bruised skin especially for someone who is bedridden.  </li>
            <li>This was exactly what was needed for use with Brava...and cost less than ordering from Brava ~ great price and deal</li>
            <li>use it around a wound (not on wound) prior to applying a bandage or dressing with tape -  Bandage will stay on a full week or more and mine was in a &amp;#34;delicate&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>will be back for more since I use continually</li>
            <li>exactly what I needed for my BRAVA</li>
            <li>But I would advise you try first one package of 50.  </li>
            <li>I have to change bandages frequently, and was advised early on in the wound care to use this product to help the bandages better adhere between changes.  </li>
            <li>wipe  Product sealed in envelopes already dry in many cases.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper to order them through Amazon than to have them ordered by Walgreens Pharmacy.</li>
            <li>While delivery was quick  I would not order again because of low quality of product.</li>
            <li>Definitely the same product that costs much more through your local pharmacy.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I needed and was not available at local stores.</li>

            <li> Good product, I have tried several and these work the best.</li>
            <li> I have used  many times before. packaged good and priced I guess where it should be.  will be back for more since I use continually</li>
            <li> exactly what I needed for my BRAVA</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I needed and was not available at local stores. It made 100% difference  in the affected area.</li>
            <li> I break out from adhesive patches, I thought these would prepare my skin so that would not happen with the patches for bladder control, but I still break out. Leaves large ugly red spots where I put the patches and takes days for that reddish spot to disappear. Guess will have to give up using the patches and resort to something else. Pills I guess with exercises.</li>
            <li> I have fragile skin. I dread any tape as per band aids etc because it tears my skin when removing the tape. A friend, who has the same issue, told me of this product. I ordered it immediately....it arrived promptly. Haven&#x27;t had to use it yet. I will be carrying it when I travel for sure!  Thank you, Marigold E.</li>
            <li> I have tried several skin prep products this year while dealing with my husband&#x27;s colostomy. This one is the one that is least likely to sting.</li>
            <li> Love this product-easy to use</li>
            <li> Duo-Derm was a product used on my bed ridden elderly mother to prevent pressure point damage along with regular turning.  No-Sting Skin Prep Wipes made a huge difference on the longevity of the sticking power.</li>
            <li> These items work perfectly.  Decreases my workload in a husband who is disabled due to the first Iraq War,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
            <li> Definitely the same product that costs much more through your local pharmacy. Same product but at a better price. Works Great!</li>
            <li> This was exactly what was needed for use with Brava...and cost less than ordering from Brava ~ great price and deal</li>
            <li> Quick service&lt;br /&gt;Product not as good as regular skin wipe  Product sealed in envelopes already dry in many cases.  While delivery was quick  I would not order again because of low quality of product.</li>
            <li> I have to change bandages frequently, and was advised early on in the wound care to use this product to help the bandages better adhere between changes.  It actually works.  But I would advise you try first one package of 50.  I bought 2, because I&#x27;d also bought some adhesive removal wipes.  It turns out you use about 2 of those to one of these prep wipes.  I think my order of 100 prep wipes constitutes a life-time supply!</li>
            <li> My neurologist suggested I try this product because my skin was breaking out under &amp;#34;tegaderms&amp;#34; I was using to keep my pain patches from coming off. I had post neurosurgery pain. Wow. What a difference. No itching. No breaking out. No nothing. However, the directions given are not right. Do not wait 30 minutes or more after using this to apply the dressing. It doesn&#x27;t work when it is dried out. Apply the wipe(s), wait 1-2 minutes, and then apply the dressing. Also, if you do wear a pain patch, be sure to not get the ointment from the wipes under where the patch will be. It will create a barrier and the medicine will not be absorbed correctly. But, if used properly, this is a great product</li>
            <li> perfect, absolutly what i needed and came in a timely manner, thank you so much. Would recommend to anyone that requires a protectant for constant wearing of bandaids or bandage on their skin</li>
            <li> Awesome price with rapid shipping. no issues with product Great seller. Thanks</li>
            <li> Another good product to prevent skin from opening up on reddened areas. and it helps protect skin from tape burns. Timely delivery!</li>
            <li> These wipes are Great for assisting in healing sensitive skin or bruised skin especially for someone who is bedridden.  We discovered them after the hospital staff used these wipes on an elderly patient in our family.  It&#x27;s much cheaper to order them through Amazon than to have them ordered by Walgreens Pharmacy.</li>
            <li> I have a shin/leg wound and have been on a Wound Vac..When the home nurses come to change the bandages..they use this to prep the skin..IT IS THE BEST!!!!!So I ordered more, myself...</li>
            <li> If you have a wound that the bandage has to be changed regularly, this product is a requirement.  It makes taking off the tape very easy and stops skin irritation.</li>
            <li> SIMPLY THE BEST OF ITS KIND!  I have tried probably every brand and type of skin preparation wipes made.  The No-Sting by Smith and Nephew is simply the best.  It comes in handy, sealed packets, which keeps the interior pads moist until they are ready to be used which extends &amp;#34;shelf-life&amp;#34;.  Most importantly, to me, is the fact that the wipes can be used on very sensitive/raw skin without the unbearable sting of alcohol - hence the name: &amp;#34;NO-STING&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Right product at the right price!</li>
            <li> use it around a wound (not on wound) prior to applying a bandage or dressing with tape -  Bandage will stay on a full week or more and mine was in a &amp;#34;delicate&amp;#34; location.  But you can&#x27;t shower with dressing on.  Protects skin from irritation.</li>
