            <li>So glad i picked this up.</li>
            <li>I love it and will buy it from now on.</li>
            <li>would like to add that when we ordered this product in July 2011, we paid $17.95 with free SuperSaver shipping (on orders over $25).  </li>
            <li>His skin is totally smooth now.</li>
            <li>But what I like most of all is that we didn&#x27;t have to purchase a whole ProActiv kit or</li>
            <li>I make sure to use it as my last step in the shower to make sure i wash off all the conditionair resedue from my hair aso.</li>
            <li>I was glad they were new and not opened like I was worried about.</li>
            <li>My son has severe acne and uses this along with a prescription ointment, so far this product is working better than anything else he has tried.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;To begin with, it arrived super fast.</li>
            <li>it leaves your back a bit dry but follow it up with a light moistorizer and you are good to go</li>
            <li>My first impression was the quality of the product.</li>
            <li>After the first used, I did saw a difference.</li>
            <li>its better then the deep- cleansing wash.</li>
            <li>It may seem expensive but its worth it for the great results.</li>
            <li>Trust me it really works</li>
            <li>Skipping within days will not give you results fast.</li>
            <li>Really, he&#x27;s just a boy who sweats and</li>
            <li>This has been a God send for my daughter she has suffered with breakouts for years this soap has really helped</li>
            <li>I brought this because i really didn&#x27;t want to spend the money on the body wash</li>
            <li>I tried many products like the Neutrogena Pink Grapefruit scrub and clean&amp;clear products for bacne.</li>
            <li>I suffered from mild acne on my back</li>
            <li>My face is cleaner and lighter and my chest is completely clear!</li>
            <li>My teenagers love this product, not sure if it&#x27;s because of a fad.</li>

            <li>I was really having second thoughts about this product, but I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But for my back, it didn&#x27;t do that much</li>
            <li>Applying the bar directly to your skin allows the exfoliation of the beads in the bar to remove what it needs to remove.</li>
            <li>and my skin is softer and has cleared up completely.</li>
            <li>This product really works and I noticed an immediate change in my facial skin.</li>
            <li>I completely understand that everybody&#x27;s skin is different.</li>
            <li>I recently started applying the bar directly to my skin instead of lathering it in my hand and then applying it to my skin (face and body).</li>

            <li> I completely understand that everybody&#x27;s skin is different. I suffer from minor acne on my face but have severe acne on my chest, back and shoulders. I was really having second thoughts about this product, but I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To begin with, it arrived super fast. That same day I used the product at night since it must be used twice a day. My first impression was the quality of the product. The bar itself its in a good size and it smells great. I used the bar twice a day (morning and night). After the first used, I did saw a difference. My skin was lighter and smoother. A single bar should last at least on my experience about on average of two weeks. These two bars lasted me about a month and I have to say that it does makes a difference. My face is cleaner and lighter and my chest is completely clear! But for my back, it didn&#x27;t do that much but I am completely satisfied with this product. It has changed my life and now I feel more confident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend this to anyone! All you need is a little push. Trust me it really works but you must used it as directed. Skipping within days will not give you results fast. You will see a difference at least in the first two weeks. I am very satisfied and I will order more soon!</li>
            <li> I bought these ProActive cleansing bars for my daughter, who has occasional acne breakouts on her shoulders and upper back.  We&#x27;ve tried all kinds of astringents, body washes, back scrubbers, and acne medications with mixed results.  The bottom line is that she has the best luck when keeping her hair pulled up off her shoulders and keeping her skin clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These bars work well to remove body oil and keep pores open.  The little beads in these bars gently exfoliate dead skin, and the salicylic acid combats acne and dries out pimples.  But what I like most of all is that we didn&#x27;t have to purchase a whole ProActiv kit or regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to add that when we ordered this product in July 2011, we paid $17.95 with free SuperSaver shipping (on orders over $25).  The same product is now $25, which will impact whether we order it again.</li>
            <li> My son likes this body bar for back acne.  Really, he&#x27;s just a boy who sweats and his pores get clogged, but nonetheless, he is convinced it is &amp;#34;backne&amp;#34;, so I buy him this soap.  He swears it works.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected and arrived in a timely manner. I was glad they were new and not opened like I was worried about.</li>
            <li> Received in a timely matter.  Excellent price, nearly twice the amount at the mall.</li>
            <li> This has been a God send for my daughter she has suffered with breakouts for years this soap has really helped</li>
            <li> I brought this because i really didn&#x27;t want to spend the money on the body wash so i figure the soap would be just as good. It smells great, not the strong, and it lathers great and rinses clean. I have been using Proactiv for about a year and the results are great so i figures lets give the soap a try you never hear anything about it so maybe after this review it will get some time to shine</li>
            <li> Does well if you sweat a lot like I do, and smells good too</li>
            <li> Ive used the Proactiv bar soap every day since I&#x27;ve received it.  I purchased it mainly for my back and shoulders hoping it would help clear up painful and unattractive \\&quot;blemishes\\&quot;. I&#x27;ve not noticed ANY improvement to date and I&#x27;ve been using for around 2 1/2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I bought this bar a few months ago because it was cheaper than buying the 3 step system. I was not pleased at first because it left my skin really dry and did not keep me from having breakouts like the cleanser did. I recently started applying the bar directly to my skin instead of lathering it in my hand and then applying it to my skin (face and body). Applying the bar directly to your skin allows the exfoliation of the beads in the bar to remove what it needs to remove. Now my skin looks just as good as it did when I used the cleanser! I would suggest this as a replacement to the cleanser because it lasts way longer and is easier to use!</li>
            <li> Cleared up my teenagers back in 3 days! His skin is totally smooth now. He is very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> My son has been very happy with this soap in clearing up his back.  We&#x27;ll keep ordering it as needed.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap for my teenage boys.  They use it twice a day (for about a month now) and It helps keep the acne to a minimum.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my granddaughter and she loves it, I will be ordering this again, as well as, the Proactiv Mask.</li>
            <li> This bar of soap does wonders for my skin. I suffered from mild acne on my back and i&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 months now and my skin is softer and has cleared up completely.</li>
            <li> I tried many products like the Neutrogena Pink Grapefruit scrub and clean&amp;clear products for bacne. They were not sufficient. I even tried the Proactiv Deep Cleansing wash (ok product but doesn&#x27;t last long). This is the BEST product i ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;This summer has been the worst for my bacne, chest and shoulders, just horrible. I work outside where I sweat a lot and that makes it worse. I knew i wanted to try another Proactiv product but I didn&#x27;t have a kiosk at my mall. I was travelling and went to a bigger mall and was considering picking up another Deep Cleansing wash but I flew and only had a carry-on and couldn&#x27;t have anything over 100mLs. So i decided to give the bar a try. So glad i picked this up. It cleared up and smoothed out my back within 3 days of using it. In my opinion...its better then the deep- cleansing wash. Its less expensive and more travel friendly.&lt;br /&gt;How i use it...i shower at night use the bar with no luffa or wash cloth, just the bar. I use it all over my body. Then in the morning i put a shower cap on and use the bar again. I keep it in a travel soap container so my family doesn&#x27;t use it and only take it out for my showers. It may seem expensive but its worth it for the great results. Im going on vacation soon to Florida and now I&#x27;m not self-conscience of my back when I&#x27;m going to wear a bathing suit</li>
            <li> Like this product.  My son has severe acne and uses this along with a prescription ointment, so far this product is working better than anything else he has tried.  And does not leave his face dry or splotchy.</li>
            <li> My son like body soap use in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Great price plus two bars soap. I would recommend proactive for someone has trouble with break out.</li>
            <li> My teenagers love this product, not sure if it&#x27;s because of a fad. They prefer it over their Perscription acne cream.</li>
            <li> This product really works and I noticed an immediate change in my facial skin. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Works awesome for adult acne....Lov.e this soap</li>
            <li> This really works if you use it everyday</li>
            <li> I got this product for my outbreaks on my back. it works wonders and all my outbreaks are gone. I make sure to use it as my last step in the shower to make sure i wash off all the conditionair resedue from my hair aso. it leaves your back a bit dry but follow it up with a light moistorizer and you are good to go</li>
            <li> i brought the soap for my son&lt;br /&gt;this is like the 4 or 6 th bar of soap that we have brought</li>
            <li> I use it on my face because the regular Proactiv system never worked for me. I love it and will buy it from now on.</li>
