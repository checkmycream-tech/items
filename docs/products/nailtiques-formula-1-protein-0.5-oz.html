            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>My nails are healthy and growing.</li>
            <li>and I have never had such strong, wonderful nails.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased before it is very good to keep your nails healthy and long.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for several years and nothing works as well for keeping nails healthy and beautiful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for many years and it really helps to maintain healthy, nice nails.</li>
            <li>It keeps my nails strong.  </li>
            <li>I had long beautiful nails</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money!</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t worked as great as when I first starting using it!</li>
            <li>My nails are very brittle and peel easily.  </li>
            <li>If you make sure your natural oils are swabbed with polish remover before applying, you will notice a tremendous difference.</li>
            <li>Helps to build strong and vibrant nails in the time indicated.  </li>
            <li>When I first purchased this item it ripped the top layer of my nail off UNTIL I read a review that said to make sure your nails have been swabbed with polish remover and do not have natural oils left on the nail.  </li>
            <li>Once I made sure my nails were dry and clean, Nailtique had a 100% positive effect on the growth and health of my nails.  </li>
            <li>It really works!  </li>
            <li>Feel comfortable scaling back to a convenient , quick drying product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried about 30 products; this is the first that really works.</li>
            <li>This product makes my nails look and feel healthy every single time I put it on.</li>
            <li>I have been using it and my nails in 1 weeks look great and are tough.</li>
            <li>thanks so much.</li>
            <li>it arrived fast.</li>
            <li>It really work.</li>
            <li>Probably not as much protection but have used formula 2 for almost 2 years</li>
            <li>and I am certain you will notice that your nails will grow long and strong.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure that the first time you use the product, your nail has been wiped down with nail polish remover.</li>
            <li>After years and years of crumbling nails from my medications, Nailtiques Formula 1 has given me strong, long nails again.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>after using for a few days ,i opened bottle and top separated from brush.</li>
            <li>Maybe b/c it was old.  </li>
            <li>Was the older bottle, looked slightly yellow.  </li>
            <li>This was recommended by my doctor&#x27;s aesthetician &amp; though it is expensive, the results are amazing with or without color.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> repeat customer, arrived THE NEXT DAY.  Ridiculous.  Love it!  thanks so much.</li>
            <li> love it my nails are beautiful</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my Mom because she could no longer find it in the stores. This was my second order for her.  She says it helps her nails grow.</li>
            <li> My nails are very brittle and peel easily.  When I first purchased this item it ripped the top layer of my nail off UNTIL I read a review that said to make sure your nails have been swabbed with polish remover and do not have natural oils left on the nail.  Once I made sure my nails were dry and clean, Nailtique had a 100% positive effect on the growth and health of my nails.  Follow the directions and reapply every other day and I am certain you will notice that your nails will grow long and strong.  If you make sure your natural oils are swabbed with polish remover before applying, you will notice a tremendous difference. FYI - You don&#x27;t need to remove Nailtique every time you reapply.  You can reapply without harm to your nail.  Just make sure that the first time you use the product, your nail has been wiped down with nail polish remover. You can use before nail polish as an undercoat and an overcoat and continue using until you want to refresh your nail polish.</li>
            <li> have used Nailtiques for 20 years, both 1 and 2 - it is the best strengthener on the market. I&#x27;ve converted many friends!</li>
            <li> The best nail formula out there.  Helps to build strong and vibrant nails in the time indicated.  I have been using it and my nails in 1 weeks look great and are tough.</li>
            <li> After years and years of crumbling nails from my medications, Nailtiques Formula 1 has given me strong, long nails again. I&#x27;ve tried about 30 products; this is the first that really works. I&#x27;ve shared it with friends and they also had great results. I use it as a basecoat, topcoat, and between polish layers without any peeling problems.</li>
            <li> I purchased the wrong bottle, I should have bought the no. 2.  All of my nails broke off now they are worse than ever.  It made my nails very thin and weak.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 4 years now and I have never had such strong, wonderful nails. I had acrylics put on years ago and they ruined my nails until I started using Nailtiques. They are now healthy and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Because this works well for peeling dry nails. I use once a week and use two coats and it keeps my nails for peeling so that nail polish stays on. Great product.</li>
            <li> My nails grow like crazy with this stuff. I started w type 2.  Now i use this one religiously over Polish</li>
            <li> This is by far the best product I have ever used!  It&#x27;s the only one that worked and I have tried many!</li>
            <li> I love what this is doing to my nails.  They are sturdier than I thought they would be.  thank you!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love Nailtique! Best stuff ever!!!</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for 1 months now, I see no improvement. For less $ you can use clear nail polish and get the same result.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. It&#x27;s  the only one that works on my thin and splitting nails. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This definitely strengthens your nails!  The only downside...it has formaldehyde.  I just realized this and I&#x27;ve been using this product for awhile.  I probably won&#x27;t reorder.</li>
            <li> I used this years ago and was pleased to see that it still works.</li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT, OK PRICE</li>
            <li> after using for a few days ,i opened bottle and top separated from brush.</li>
            <li> This product makes my nails look and feel healthy every single time I put it on. I use it as a base coat and top coat....I even use it alone to just get a nice shine. Totally worth the money!</li>
            <li> This is another product that I have used for years, and found it at a good price on Amazon!  My nails grow faster and are firmer, when I use &amp;#34;Nailtiques.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years -- it WORKS!!  Excellent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchase this item several times and it works great!  It keeps my nails strong.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I keep meaning to take before and after pictures for this review but I forget.  I have an awful habit of picking and biting my nails, so I wanted to try this to strengthen and lengthen them.  It really works!  It makes me nails SO much stronger which is great because when I go to bite them they don&#x27;t break and then I stop.  It also seems to help them grow faster but I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s the nail polish itself or just because I can&#x27;t pick at them.</li>
            <li> Only problem bottle is too small.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff I wish that I could still get it at the store</li>
            <li> My wife says it works great.</li>
            <li> gives my nails extra strength!</li>
            <li> For more than twenty years I have used Nailtiques 1.  No longer do my nails split or peal.&lt;br /&gt;Just one coat once a week preserves and strengthens my nails.  I do appreciate the&lt;br /&gt;manicurist who directed me toward Nailtiques.</li>
            <li> this product is good for maintaining health nails. I ordered it for a client of mine, who swears by it. I do believe it helps the nails remain healthy.</li>
            <li> Nailtiques are the only thing that makes my nails grow! When I get lazy and stop putting it on, they break and are weak. Great seller and it arrived fast.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and nothing works as well for keeping nails healthy and beautiful. It is amazing.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product at a great price.  Helps keeps weak nail hard and your manicure for longer wear.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is the only way I can have nails! If I don&#x27;t use it they split, tear and are very weak. There is another product that is similar to this but Nailtique is spelled different. That one is cheaper but it doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve been using this for many years and it really helps to maintain healthy, nice nails.</li>
            <li> Was the older bottle, looked slightly yellow.  did not seem to work as well as what I am used to.  Maybe b/c it was old.  I would ask for refund, but I just had a baby last week and can&#x27;t go to post office to return it.&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nailtiques for 9 months and it worked great the first three months. I had long beautiful nails but soon after my nails all seemed to crack. It hasn&#x27;t worked as great as when I first starting using it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased before it is very good to keep your nails healthy and long.  My nails no longer chip like before.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Hooked on this product! Formula 1 and 2 are incredible!</li>
            <li> Came on time, great product. Thank you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month. It really work. My nails are healthy and growing. I definitely would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Dries faster than formula 2 and shinier.  Probably not as much protection but have used formula 2 for almost 2 years so nails beautiful and strong.  Remarkable improvement.  Feel comfortable scaling back to a convenient , quick drying product.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my doctor&#x27;s aesthetician &amp; though it is expensive, the results are amazing with or without color.</li>
