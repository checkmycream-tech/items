            <li>I do not sleep well, maybe 2 to 4 hours of sleep a night, so the bags are catching up over the years.</li>
            <li>I got a nice email from a gentleman</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;who asked how I liked it.</li>
            <li>High quality, and excellent ingredients.</li>
            <li>It does not have a pleasant fragrance, more research and development should be made in order for this product to be more viable.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product, love how light the cream goes on and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s basically a Vitamin C serum and seems to be good for eliminating fine lines &amp; keep puffiness under control.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best eye cream I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>This Vitamin C Eye Gel was a steal &amp; AMAZING quality. :-)</li>
            <li>Very light, non greasy eye gel.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t able to see any results with the eye creams I&#x27;ve used.  </li>

            <li>Love the gel.  </li>
            <li>so i just used it on the rest of my face and it was ok.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>What I like most is the consistency of it.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t oily like most products.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>and i love results until now.</li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m already buying 2 more to give it to my mother and mother in law.</li>
            <li>Sometimes need to add more moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li>I am glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li>After using it for 2 weeks, I&#x27;ve noticed that my wrinkles under the eyes are a lot more defined.  </li>
            <li>The formulation is quite nice an applies smoothly.  </li>
            <li>LOVE THIS EYE GEL.  </li>
            <li>WILL ORDER MORE.  </li>
            <li>Love this under eye cream.</li>
            <li>Be sure to use your ring finger to apply it (its your weakest finger</li>
            <li>Eating healthy and drinking lots of water can help....</li>
            <li>I have been using this Vitamin C eye cream for about a month and have noticed lovely results around my eye area....</li>
            <li>The listed ingredients are fabulous too!  </li>
            <li>I also really appreciate the email letter I got from the company wanting to make sure I was happy with the product.</li>
            <li>Worked ok.</li>
            <li>After many years of not sleeping and fatigue I ended up with severe bags under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty good.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that the under-eye area appears more smooth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fortunate in that I don&#x27;t have too many fine lines, but I do have the puffy eyes</li>
            <li>I am so pleased that Bonapiel works so good with my sensitive skin -</li>
            <li>I strongly recomend it.</li>
            <li>i liked the eye cream very much.</li>
            <li>I also love using this eye cream before applying makeup (specially in the morning) because it lets my concealer and foundations stay on my skin (specifically on my eye area) without looking cakey.</li>
            <li>I love the consistency of this product which is more like a gel that absorbs into the skin very well vs a cream that may just sit on top of the skin.  </li>
            <li>The gel spreads well, does not irritate at all and is pretty much nicely odorless.  </li>
            <li>I have tried the Best Eye Cream for Dark Circles and Puffiness.</li>
            <li>I like that it does well underneath my make up and doesn&#x27;t cause a caked up appearance in the fine lines.</li>
            <li>It is light and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>This stuff quickly made it better.</li>
            <li>It feels more like a serum and quickly absorbs.</li>
            <li>this product works cumulatively, taking good short term effects to awesome long term results, THEN...</li>
            <li>this product works cumulatively, taking good short term effects to awesome long term results, THEN...</li>
            <li>It is perfect after a night of little sleep.</li>
            <li>the smell of this eye gel is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I have used this for a few weeks and my verdict is this is really a great eye gel!  </li>
            <li>This is really great stuff if you want instant results.</li>
            <li>I primarily got it because I started developing some puffiness under one of my eyes</li>
            <li>and i really cant tell you why, honestly i don&#x27;t know</li>
            <li>monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation).</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been very gentle on my skin and most importantly, it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy with it so far.  </li>
            <li>Easily glides on the skin and quickly absorbs.</li>
            <li>Still in my first month and have to check on the youthful, wrinkle free - ness this has to provide but am confident it will in its time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly some days I&#x27;m not sure; it depends on how I slept that night, lol.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smoothly and feels cool and calming.  </li>
            <li>I did not notice any significant difference in the appearance of the eyes and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Worth every cent!</li>
            <li>Good product after only a couple of weeks of use</li>
            <li>I also like how cool it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>Product soaks in quickly.</li>
            <li>It has a gel like consistency and applies evenly and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>but it is not greasy and it penetrates the eye area quickly..........</li>
            <li>I waited the required month to write my review and it was worth it.</li>
            <li>The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I was sent a complimentary bottle of Bonapiel Vitamin C Eye Gel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually tried a good bit of products and haven&#x27;t seen the results as fast as this one.</li>
            <li>Used this to help with my bags under my eyes and noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li>The price was right with the ratings Bonapiel was given.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>now apply it right before I go to bed.</li>
            <li>Looks like there is more in the bottle than there actually is apparently.</li>
            <li>just got this and so far it is nice but too early to tell yet.</li>
            <li>It gave me a rash the first night I used it.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I&#x27;ve had more sleepless nights than I can count and my eyes are showing it more and more each day.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclaimer: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>Since I am an avid product reviewer and blogger</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really enjoying this eye gel, especially the consistency.</li>
            <li>Shipped and delivered as promised &#x3D; FAST!</li>
            <li>The gel reduced my under eye puffiness after the first use.</li>
            <li>This is my second order and I really love this eye serum.......</li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>You could easily pay much more for a similar product of the same quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this product for a very short time so cannot give it a fair rating yet.  </li>
            <li>I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all).</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Apply your Vitamin C Eye Gel 1/2 inch or so above your upper lash line and below your lower lash line, then while you&#x27;re sleeping,&lt;br /&gt;it will travel on its own and stop right around your crows feet, where you wanted it in the first place!&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
            <li>I can certainly see a difference.</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this product</li>
            <li>I will certainly continue to use this eye preparation.</li>
            <li>Off late with my long work hours and even after trying my best to sleep really well , my puffy eyes never seemed to go away.</li>
            <li>All I can say is it really worked on my puffy eyes</li>
            <li>The situation has been much improved since using the Eye Gel.  </li>
            <li>It feels very relaxing</li>
            <li>for anyone who wants this product too.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product.  </li>
            <li>I knew the &amp;#34;BIG SALE&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;REDUCED PRICE&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;1 DAY SALE&amp;#34; advertisements were just to snag customers and the product isn&#x27;t ever really on sale</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>SO MUCH</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soothing and reduces the crow&#x27;s feet and bagginess under the eye.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m dispensing into very close to the nozzle</li>
            <li>I cannot swear that I&#x27;ve seen much improvement.</li>
            <li>I cannot swear that I&#x27;ve seen much improvement.</li>
            <li>But my eyes get very watery.</li>
            <li>Even though it feels like water, it isn&#x27;t as gentle.</li>
            <li>it really moisturizies</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>Thanks again, Josephine</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>I finally got the product, better late than never of course i had to chase it, good old post office the box came to me mangled no fault of the companies</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for other consumers like myself.</li>
            <li>The puffiness was reduced significantly and is lasting.</li>
            <li>It is better than the other brands I&#x27;d  tried.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>I put a tiny squeeze under each eye and leave it for about 5 minutes or so and it perks them right up!  </li>
            <li>BTW, I have tried many products for dark and puffy eyes for over a year now.</li>
            <li>I have had dark puffy eyes for many years.</li>
            <li>The pump container is less than predictable in that it dispenses a fairly forceful squirt!</li>
            <li>the skin seems more elastic, looks visibly fresher and seems less wrinkled.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second bottle and will definitely order more when it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li>/&gt;A must buy and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these two products............</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, feels gentle and soothing.  </li>
            <li>I am 73 years old and there isn&#x27;t much out there for&lt;br /&gt;us</li>
            <li>but it takes its toll on my eyes making them darker than they normally would be so i have been using this for a day</li>
            <li>I normally use Vitamin C serum because Vitamin C works so well on my skin.</li>
            <li>I love the firm texture it leaves.</li>
            <li>a week to 10 days worth of product left in my bottle.</li>
            <li>a week to 10 days worth of product left in my bottle.</li>
            <li>(Optimistically) slight fading would be my honest answer after only 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>have only been using it for about a week, but I saw a difference after the first day.&lt;br /&gt;The feel and</li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t think it would be a dramatic visual, but I could see a difference and, more importantly, feel it.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t clear up puffiness immediately, but after it&#x27;s on for a while it seems to help.</li>
            <li>This eye cream is actually a clear gel.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work so far, usingfor like a month.</li>
            <li>I am 65 years old, and decided to try it because the reviews were favorable.  </li>
            <li>I selected this product because it is natural with vitamin C.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my mid-30s and have a 1 year old and a 4 month old.  </li>
            <li>a 52 year old healthcare professional and a skincare marketer&#x27;s dream consumer, (i.e., I&#x27;ve shelled out</li>

            <li>As for the purple-rust colored, 180 degree, Italian heritage (thanks Nonna) circles that look like I have on brown eye shadow</li>
            <li>old gals</li>
            <li>She also loves that the product is made out of natural products that help your skin, instead of hiding the problems.</li>
            <li>So far see slight visible reduction in lines under eyes, but will continue to use for full results.</li>
            <li>She loves this product because it helps her look good even when she is very tired from work.  </li>
            <li>(apparently I am getting old!).  </li>
            <li>I feel 15 faithful days of use is not long enough to adequately review the full potential of Bonapiel Vitamin C Eye Gel or other similar serums.</li>
            <li>Fine lines are slightly diminished when used in conjunction with eye specific moisturizers.</li>
            <li>Okay product but not convincing enough to make me want to add Bonapiel to my eye care arsenal.</li>
            <li>Fine lines are slightly diminished when used in conjunction with eye specific moisturizers.</li>
            <li>Okay product but not convincing enough to make me want to add Bonapiel to my eye care arsenal.</li>
            <li>I have been loving this eye cream lately as it gets rid of the dry patches on the corners of my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products that make big claims but this is one of the few that actually does what is says it will do.</li>
            <li>Using no other cream except this morning and night</li>
            <li>I am a highly allergic person and I have always afraid to use any product that will make me an allergic reaction; with this product I felt safe from the first application and my eyes changed dramatically, to the third application I could see the difference.</li>
            <li>This seemed to work pretty well for my dark circles,but felt like it was drying out my eye area skin.</li>
            <li>I did not notice even the smallest change for better or worse.  </li>
            <li>Still no change for better or worse.  </li>
            <li>No more puffiness, my eyes are more active and respond well, the swellings all gone.</li>
            <li>the seal on the product was not broken, i have not been getting much sleep lately</li>
            <li>It has decreased some darkness and puffiness but is not as effective as I expected.</li>
            <li>and it hasn&#x27;t really done anything to lessen dark circles.</li>
            <li>I can rub it under my eyes, let it get absorbed into my skin, and then apply my makeup and eyeliner/mascara as usual.  </li>
            <li>and I really do believe I am actually seeing a decrease in the dark circles.  </li>

            <li> I do not sleep well, maybe 2 to 4 hours of sleep a night, so the bags are catching up over the years.</li>
            <li> I got a nice email from a gentleman</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;who asked how I liked it.</li>
            <li> High quality, and excellent ingredients.</li>
            <li> It does not have a pleasant fragrance, more research and development should be made in order for this product to be more viable.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, love how light the cream goes on and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically a Vitamin C serum and seems to be good for eliminating fine lines &amp; keep puffiness under control.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best eye cream I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> This Vitamin C Eye Gel was a steal &amp; AMAZING quality. :-)</li>
            <li> Very light, non greasy eye gel.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t able to see any results with the eye creams I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love the gel.  </li>
            <li> so i just used it on the rest of my face and it was ok.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> What I like most is the consistency of it.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t oily like most products.</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> and i love results until now.</li>
            <li> and i love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already buying 2 more to give it to my mother and mother in law.</li>
            <li> Sometimes need to add more moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> I am glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> After using it for 2 weeks, I&#x27;ve noticed that my wrinkles under the eyes are a lot more defined.  </li>
            <li> The formulation is quite nice an applies smoothly.  </li>
            <li> LOVE THIS EYE GEL.  </li>
            <li> WILL ORDER MORE.  </li>
            <li> Love this under eye cream.</li>
            <li> Be sure to use your ring finger to apply it (its your weakest finger</li>
            <li> Eating healthy and drinking lots of water can help....</li>
            <li> I have been using this Vitamin C eye cream for about a month and have noticed lovely results around my eye area....</li>
            <li> The listed ingredients are fabulous too!  </li>
            <li> I also really appreciate the email letter I got from the company wanting to make sure I was happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Worked ok.</li>
            <li> After many years of not sleeping and fatigue I ended up with severe bags under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty good.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that the under-eye area appears more smooth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fortunate in that I don&#x27;t have too many fine lines, but I do have the puffy eyes</li>
            <li> I am so pleased that Bonapiel works so good with my sensitive skin -</li>
            <li> I strongly recomend it.</li>
            <li> i liked the eye cream very much.</li>
            <li> I also love using this eye cream before applying makeup (specially in the morning) because it lets my concealer and foundations stay on my skin (specifically on my eye area) without looking cakey.</li>
            <li> I love the consistency of this product which is more like a gel that absorbs into the skin very well vs a cream that may just sit on top of the skin.  </li>
            <li> The gel spreads well, does not irritate at all and is pretty much nicely odorless.  </li>
            <li> I have tried the Best Eye Cream for Dark Circles and Puffiness.</li>
            <li> I like that it does well underneath my make up and doesn&#x27;t cause a caked up appearance in the fine lines.</li>
            <li> It is light and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This stuff quickly made it better.</li>
            <li> It feels more like a serum and quickly absorbs.</li>
            <li> this product works cumulatively, taking good short term effects to awesome long term results, THEN...</li>
            <li> this product works cumulatively, taking good short term effects to awesome long term results, THEN...</li>
            <li> It is perfect after a night of little sleep.</li>
            <li> the smell of this eye gel is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a few weeks and my verdict is this is really a great eye gel!  </li>
            <li> This is really great stuff if you want instant results.</li>
            <li> I primarily got it because I started developing some puffiness under one of my eyes</li>
            <li> and i really cant tell you why, honestly i don&#x27;t know</li>
            <li> monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation).</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been very gentle on my skin and most importantly, it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with it so far.  </li>
            <li> Easily glides on the skin and quickly absorbs.</li>
            <li> Still in my first month and have to check on the youthful, wrinkle free - ness this has to provide but am confident it will in its time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Honestly some days I&#x27;m not sure; it depends on how I slept that night, lol.</li>
            <li> It goes on so smoothly and feels cool and calming.  </li>
            <li> I did not notice any significant difference in the appearance of the eyes and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Worth every cent!</li>
            <li> Good product after only a couple of weeks of use</li>
            <li> I also like how cool it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> Product soaks in quickly.</li>
            <li> It has a gel like consistency and applies evenly and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> but it is not greasy and it penetrates the eye area quickly..........</li>
            <li> I waited the required month to write my review and it was worth it.</li>
            <li> The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I was sent a complimentary bottle of Bonapiel Vitamin C Eye Gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually tried a good bit of products and haven&#x27;t seen the results as fast as this one.</li>
            <li> Used this to help with my bags under my eyes and noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li> The price was right with the ratings Bonapiel was given.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> now apply it right before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> Looks like there is more in the bottle than there actually is apparently.</li>
            <li> just got this and so far it is nice but too early to tell yet.</li>
            <li> It gave me a rash the first night I used it.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I&#x27;ve had more sleepless nights than I can count and my eyes are showing it more and more each day.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Disclaimer: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li> Since I am an avid product reviewer and blogger</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying this eye gel, especially the consistency.</li>
            <li> Shipped and delivered as promised &#x3D; FAST!</li>
            <li> The gel reduced my under eye puffiness after the first use.</li>
            <li> This is my second order and I really love this eye serum.......</li>
            <li> This product really works!</li>
            <li> You could easily pay much more for a similar product of the same quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for a very short time so cannot give it a fair rating yet.  </li>
            <li> I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all).</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Apply your Vitamin C Eye Gel 1/2 inch or so above your upper lash line and below your lower lash line, then while you&#x27;re sleeping,&lt;br /&gt;it will travel on its own and stop right around your crows feet, where you wanted it in the first place!&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
            <li> I can certainly see a difference.</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I will certainly continue to use this eye preparation.</li>
            <li> Off late with my long work hours and even after trying my best to sleep really well , my puffy eyes never seemed to go away.</li>
            <li> All I can say is it really worked on my puffy eyes</li>
            <li> The situation has been much improved since using the Eye Gel.  </li>
            <li> It feels very relaxing</li>
            <li> for anyone who wants this product too.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product.  </li>
            <li> I knew the &amp;#34;BIG SALE&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;REDUCED PRICE&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;1 DAY SALE&amp;#34; advertisements were just to snag customers and the product isn&#x27;t ever really on sale</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> SO MUCH</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soothing and reduces the crow&#x27;s feet and bagginess under the eye.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m dispensing into very close to the nozzle</li>
            <li> I cannot swear that I&#x27;ve seen much improvement.</li>
            <li> I cannot swear that I&#x27;ve seen much improvement.</li>
            <li> But my eyes get very watery.</li>
            <li> Even though it feels like water, it isn&#x27;t as gentle.</li>
            <li> it really moisturizies</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> Thanks again, Josephine</li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> I finally got the product, better late than never of course i had to chase it, good old post office the box came to me mangled no fault of the companies</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for other consumers like myself.</li>
            <li> The puffiness was reduced significantly and is lasting.</li>
            <li> It is better than the other brands I&#x27;d  tried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I put a tiny squeeze under each eye and leave it for about 5 minutes or so and it perks them right up!  </li>
            <li> BTW, I have tried many products for dark and puffy eyes for over a year now.</li>
            <li> I have had dark puffy eyes for many years.</li>
            <li> The pump container is less than predictable in that it dispenses a fairly forceful squirt!</li>
            <li> the skin seems more elastic, looks visibly fresher and seems less wrinkled.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle and will definitely order more when it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;A must buy and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend these two products............</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, feels gentle and soothing.  </li>
            <li> I am 73 years old and there isn&#x27;t much out there for&lt;br /&gt;us</li>
            <li> but it takes its toll on my eyes making them darker than they normally would be so i have been using this for a day</li>
            <li> I normally use Vitamin C serum because Vitamin C works so well on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love the firm texture it leaves.</li>
            <li> a week to 10 days worth of product left in my bottle.</li>
            <li> a week to 10 days worth of product left in my bottle.</li>

            <li> have only been using it for about a week, but I saw a difference after the first day.&lt;br /&gt;The feel and</li>
            <li> If someone saw a before and after picture I don&#x27;t think it would be a dramatic visual, but I could see a difference and, more importantly, feel it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it would be a dramatic visual, but I could see a difference and, more importantly, feel it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clear up puffiness immediately, but after it&#x27;s on for a while it seems to help.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is actually a clear gel.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work so far, usingfor like a month.</li>
            <li> I am 65 years old, and decided to try it because the reviews were favorable.  </li>
            <li> I selected this product because it is natural with vitamin C.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid-30s and have a 1 year old and a 4 month old.  </li>

            <li> As for the purple-rust colored, 180 degree, Italian heritage (thanks Nonna) circles that look like I have on brown eye shadow</li>
            <li> old gals</li>
            <li> She also loves that the product is made out of natural products that help your skin, instead of hiding the problems.</li>
            <li> So far see slight visible reduction in lines under eyes, but will continue to use for full results.</li>
            <li> She loves this product because it helps her look good even when she is very tired from work.  </li>
            <li> (apparently I am getting old!).  </li>
            <li> I feel 15 faithful days of use is not long enough to adequately review the full potential of Bonapiel Vitamin C Eye Gel or other similar serums.</li>
            <li> Fine lines are slightly diminished when used in conjunction with eye specific moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Okay product but not convincing enough to make me want to add Bonapiel to my eye care arsenal.</li>
            <li> Fine lines are slightly diminished when used in conjunction with eye specific moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Okay product but not convincing enough to make me want to add Bonapiel to my eye care arsenal.</li>
            <li> I have been loving this eye cream lately as it gets rid of the dry patches on the corners of my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products that make big claims but this is one of the few that actually does what is says it will do.</li>
            <li> Using no other cream except this morning and night</li>
            <li> I am a highly allergic person and I have always afraid to use any product that will make me an allergic reaction; with this product I felt safe from the first application and my eyes changed dramatically, to the third application I could see the difference.</li>
            <li> This seemed to work pretty well for my dark circles,but felt like it was drying out my eye area skin.</li>
            <li> I did not notice even the smallest change for better or worse.  </li>
            <li> Still no change for better or worse.  </li>
            <li> No more puffiness, my eyes are more active and respond well, the swellings all gone.</li>
            <li> the seal on the product was not broken, i have not been getting much sleep lately</li>
            <li> It has decreased some darkness and puffiness but is not as effective as I expected.</li>
            <li> and it hasn&#x27;t really done anything to lessen dark circles.</li>
            <li> I can rub it under my eyes, let it get absorbed into my skin, and then apply my makeup and eyeliner/mascara as usual.  </li>
            <li> and I really do believe I am actually seeing a decrease in the dark circles.  </li>
            <li> I do have very few fine lines and a little puffiness under my eye, so I thought this might help that too.</li>
            <li> I rub it in softly under my eyes and there was no burning or irritation to my eyes as with some other under eye products</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really notice any different  on small wrinkle lines.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit too early too see an effect from the active combinations.  </li>
            <li> A tiny bit goes a long way so one bottle will last.</li>
            <li> , It didn&#x27;t reduce my lines or the dark circles, I think il just grow old Gracefully, anyways they did refund me</li>
            <li> A tiny bit goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> Even with just one pump, it doesn&#x27;t last long tho.  </li>
            <li> so you wont pull too hard) and after making the dots, gently pat them in.&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
            <li> I do not suffer from dark circles, but can say it helps with puffiness especially after a very short night of sleep.</li>
            <li> I will order again and continue ordering for as long as it does the trick.</li>
            <li> At certain times of the month, my wife doesn&#x27;t get enough sleep and always looks tired.</li>
            <li> Since moving from San Diego to Nashville, the skin underneath my eyes has been dry and funky.</li>
            <li> I am 60 years old but the wrinkles around my eyes are less noticeable the dark circles are gone.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed  change under my eyes and my husband has told me that my eyes do not look as puffy or as dark as they did before - a definite plus for me.  </li>
            <li> When I applied it, the skin around my eyes got a slight sting, and  redness for a short time.</li>
            <li> It applies easily and is not too thin or too thick.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I could see a difference in a very short period of time, a few days.</li>
            <li> This had absolutely no effect on me, after a month of using it .</li>
            <li> Waste of money but was given money back.</li>
            <li> The one pump amount varies from baby pea-sized to regular pea-sized; very small but sufficient to cover upper eyelids and the under eye socket area of  both eyes.</li>
            <li> My eye&#x27;s wrinkles are less visible and the area isn&#x27;t dry anymore.  </li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t last long, its not a cream or what I would call a Gel, its just a thick liquid thats almost odorless</li>
            <li> I am 45 and tryed other expensice eye gels, and deffinitely I would buy this item again.</li>
            <li> and I have used different brands of eye creams in the past that did not quite work well for me.</li>
            <li> strangely enough, i feel like this actually made my dark circles worse.</li>
            <li> Too late to send it back so will discard it like I have done with others that don&#x27;t work.</li>

            <li> I still have dark circles after a month of using it correctly day and night.</li>
            <li> This seems to be lightening my dark circles, but it dries my skin.</li>

            <li> Sometimes I get an slight itchy feeling too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Mostly due to late hours during military service.  </li>

            <li> Just After A Few Uses.</li>
            <li> Putting this under my eyes each morning &amp; could tell a difference within a few days.  </li>
            <li> but since I had two surgeries last year, it had become worse.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use it everyday</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this, faithfully, morning and night, for a few weeks, and it has done nothing for the puffiness under my eyes, which is what I bought it to help correct.</li>
            <li> I think I can already see small results in the few days I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li> Not sure just got this week.....</li>
            <li> It does not deliver as promised;ate least in my case.  </li>
            <li> She tried this eye cream and it slowly fades the circles and puffiness from around her eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the disappointment.</li>
            <li> I was tired of looking tired</li>
            <li> why am i so tired.</li>
            <li> It has even helped in clearing the dark circles under my eyes which I thought was impossible.</li>
            <li> In the mornings, my eyes look like crap - all baggy and dark.  </li>
            <li> but this was way to expensive for vitamin c.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have not seen any results at all.</li>
            <li> I tried it for a couple of weeks , used it  day and night, but unfortunately I saw no change.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is not worth the price the vendor is charging, and I am very disappointed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The reason I bought this was for the puffiness under the eyes but after almost 30 days I have seen no improvement.  Using no other cream except this morning and night I thought I would.  I bought it after reading all the great reviews but I guess some things do not work for everybody. Too late to send it back so will discard it like I have done with others that don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Very light, non greasy eye gel. But not a miracle worker.</li>
            <li> Awesome Produce Reduced Puffiness Just After A Few Uses.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best eye cream I&#x27;ve used.  Believe me, I&#x27;ve tried a lot.  I&#x27;m fortunate in that I don&#x27;t have too many fine lines, but I do have the puffy eyes and I wasn&#x27;t able to see any results with the eye creams I&#x27;ve used.  But Bonapiel eye gel is giving me results.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I am a highly allergic person and I have always afraid to use any product that will make me an allergic reaction; with this product I felt safe from the first application and my eyes changed dramatically, to the third application I could see the difference.</li>
            <li> I waited the required month to write my review and it was worth it. All I can say is it really worked on my puffy eyes I am so happy also I used it twice a day like required</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work so far, usingfor like a month.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my girl friend recently, Her review is below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using it for about a week, but I saw a difference after the first day.&lt;br /&gt;The feel and the smell of this eye gel is fantastic. It&#x27;s soft, feels gentle and soothing.  I like the softness and the feel of the skin around my eyes after using it.  A tiny bit goes a long ways. Easily glides on the skin and quickly absorbs.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. I did not recieve the vitamin eye gel.</li>
            <li> Love the gel.  I put it around my eyes, and mouth.</li>
            <li> strangely enough, i feel like this actually made my dark circles worse. i dont know why. so i just used it on the rest of my face and it was ok. but this was way to expensive for vitamin c. there are no miracle ingredients in this little bottle.</li>
            <li> Product soaks in quickly. I have noticed a gradual lightening of the dark circles that I have suffered from for years. I like that it does well underneath my make up and doesn&#x27;t cause a caked up appearance in the fine lines. A tiny bit goes a long way so one bottle will last. Good value.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. After only one week I can notice a big difference in the bags and puffiness under my eyes. I love this product. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Putting this under my eyes each morning &amp; could tell a difference within a few days.  This is a keeper.  Even with just one pump, it doesn&#x27;t last long tho.  Looks like there is more in the bottle than there actually is apparently.</li>
            <li> Good product after only a couple of weeks of use I can certainly see a difference. I will definitely continue to use.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a few weeks and my verdict is this is really a great eye gel!  It goes on so smoothly and feels cool and calming.  I have noticed that the under-eye area appears more smooth and I really do believe I am actually seeing a decrease in the dark circles.  I will purchase this again!</li>
            <li> Used this to help with my bags under my eyes and noticed a difference right away. This is really great stuff if you want instant results.</li>
            <li> Great product ! Smells great and it is very effective. What I like most is the consistency of it. It isn&#x27;t oily like most products.</li>
            <li> It gave me a rash the first night I used it. I waited about a week and tried it again, and I have not had anymore issues. Love the product. I had someone tell my yesterday that I was 28..... but don&#x27;t tell them that I am actually 46!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for a very short time so cannot give it a fair rating yet.  I&#x27;m hoping it lives up to its great reviews tho.</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye cream for almost a month now. I am 65 years old, and decided to try it because the reviews were favorable.  Unfortunately I have not seen any results at all. It is not worth the price the vendor is charging, and I am very disappointed.  I would assume the reviews I read we&#x27;re for younger adults, who don&#x27;t have the aging puffiness or  bags.  I hope this review helps.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the product!  I primarily got it because I started developing some puffiness under one of my eyes (apparently I am getting old!).  The situation has been much improved since using the Eye Gel.  And as a side benefit, I&#x27;d say the little wrinkles that started showing up a few years ago are less noticeable as well.  So all in all I think it&#x27;s great. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Being  a guy and at 32; I am usually not a big believer in beauty creams or enhancements. Off late with my long work hours and even after trying my best to sleep really well , my puffy eyes never seemed to go away. I have never been recommended of this product but only read the reviews of Amazon. The price was right with the ratings Bonapiel was given.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now apply it right before I go to bed. Once a day. No more puffiness, my eyes are more active and respond well, the swellings all gone. Still in my first month and have to check on the youthful, wrinkle free - ness this has to provide but am confident it will in its time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A must buy and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was tired of looking tired so thought I would try this. Have only had the product a short time and use it twice a day. I think I can already see small results in the few days I&#x27;ve used it. Can&#x27;t wait to see the results after 30 days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the fact that seller emailed a follow-up w/ tips. Way to go!!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products that make big claims but this is one of the few that actually does what is says it will do. I will buy this  again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I use it in the morning before work and before bed at night. I think my under-eye area has gotten a bit lighter. Honestly some days I&#x27;m not sure; it depends on how I slept that night, lol.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, love how light the cream goes on and absorbs quickly. So far see slight visible reduction in lines under eyes, but will continue to use for full results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eye cream for about a week  and i love results until now. My eye&#x27;s wrinkles are less visible and the area isn&#x27;t dry anymore.  It feels very relaxing and i love it. I&#x27;m already buying 2 more to give it to my mother and mother in law.</li>
            <li> Feels nice on the face . Haven&#x27;t really notice any different  on small wrinkle lines. Sometimes need to add more moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C Eye Gel was a steal &amp; AMAZING quality. :-) A+++ for anyone who wants this product too.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this anti aging eye cream. I could see a difference in a very short period of time, a few days. The puffiness was reduced significantly and is lasting. It has even helped in clearing the dark circles under my eyes which I thought was impossible. It is light and easy to apply. I am glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> I selected this product because it is natural with vitamin C.  I have very sensitive skin and this product has not harmed my skin in any way.  I have noticed  change under my eyes and my husband has told me that my eyes do not look as puffy or as dark as they did before - a definite plus for me.  I would certainly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over two weeks and what I am noticing is that I am using less concealer. I have been using a Vit C serum for my face for a while now and have had wonderful results so I decided to add this for my eyes. Very happy I did!! BTW, I have tried many products for dark and puffy eyes for over a year now. I have had this problem for a while but since I had two surgeries last year, it had become worse. This one gave me hope that something could actually help!!</li>
            <li> This gel underneath my eyes made my eyes always feel sleepy.  After using it for 2 weeks, I&#x27;ve noticed that my wrinkles under the eyes are a lot more defined.  I will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I just received this product.  It&#x27;s a bit too early too see an effect from the active combinations.  The formulation is quite nice an applies smoothly.  The packaging is also very nice.</li>
            <li> I did not notice any significant difference in the appearance of the eyes and wrinkles. It does not have a pleasant fragrance, more research and development should be made in order for this product to be more viable.</li>
            <li> Best eye gel I have ever used!  I am 60 years old but the wrinkles around my eyes are less noticeable the dark circles are gone.  Use twice a day &amp; see improvement in 14 days.</li>
            <li> I got this cream for a really low price. I have been using it for about 2 weeks and it has helped me a lot. Great product</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a week.  There is a noticeable difference in the skin under my eyes.  The darkness is diminished and so have some of the wrinkles.  This is the only eye preparation that I have ever used that made a difference.  I will certainly continue to use this eye preparation.</li>
            <li> Excellent!  I love my eye cream!  Give it a try you want regret it. I got this product half price.  Hurry and see if its still on sale.  I luv Amazon!  Gail Baglioni</li>
            <li> It applies easily and is not too thin or too thick. It has a gel like consistency and applies evenly and absorbs quickly. It has a bit of a cooling sensation and that def helps de-puffing my under eye. I rub it in softly under my eyes and there was no burning or irritation to my eyes as with some other under eye products can cause this for me. I do not suffer from dark circles, but can say it helps with puffiness especially after a very short night of sleep. I was sent this to review, but that does not reflect my opinion of the product.</li>
            <li> I am 45 and tryed other expensice eye gels, and deffinitely I would buy this item again. I strongly recomend it. Great for using each morning !</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product.  I knew the &amp;#34;BIG SALE&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;REDUCED PRICE&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;1 DAY SALE&amp;#34; advertisements were just to snag customers and the product isn&#x27;t ever really on sale (they just make it look like it is).  Even so, I gave it a shot.  I&#x27;m in my mid-30s and have a 1 year old and a 4 month old.  Needless to say, I&#x27;ve had more sleepless nights than I can count and my eyes are showing it more and more each day.  I used this faithfully morning and night for 30 days.  I did not notice even the smallest change for better or worse.  I then went a week without it, thinking I&#x27;d notice a difference.  Nope.  Still no change for better or worse.  Save your money and don&#x27;t buy into the hype.  It&#x27;s not worth the disappointment.</li>
            <li> Not sure just got this week.....</li>
            <li> Since moving from San Diego to Nashville, the skin underneath my eyes has been dry and funky. This stuff quickly made it better. I will order again and continue ordering for as long as it does the trick.</li>
            <li> I have had dark puffy eyes for many years. Mostly due to late hours during military service.  This eye cream while not removing them, makes them appear less noticeable. After all, at 68, something&#x27;s just won&#x27;t go away. My wife also uses the cream and is very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I like this product. I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen the results as stated for the moneyI on this product.  Will not be buying this product again. Hope this helps others.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS EYE GEL.  WILL ORDER MORE.  CAN SEE SOME RESULTS.  THANKS SO MUCH</li>
            <li> In the mornings, my eyes look like crap - all baggy and dark.  I put a tiny squeeze under each eye and leave it for about 5 minutes or so and it perks them right up!  Horray! :D</li>
            <li> I still have dark circles after a month of using it correctly day and night.</li>
            <li> This had absolutely no effect on me, after a month of using it .</li>
            <li> Waste of money but was given money back.</li>
            <li> This seems to be lightening my dark circles, but it dries my skin. I can&#x27;t use it everyday so will probably not get the benefit of its lightening properties.</li>
            <li> I did not notice a difference under my eyes and I used the entire bottle.</li>
            <li> I have been loving this eye cream lately as it gets rid of the dry patches on the corners of my eyes. It also gets rid of the perpetual under eye puffiness that I suffer from every time I wake up. I have very sensitive skin and I have used different brands of eye creams in the past that did not quite work well for me. I am so pleased that Bonapiel works so good with my sensitive skin - I have never felt any kind of burning sensation when I use this. I also love using this eye cream before applying makeup (specially in the morning) because it lets my concealer and foundations stay on my skin (specifically on my eye area) without looking cakey. It&#x27;s been very gentle on my skin and most importantly, it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for other consumers like myself. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
            <li> I finally got the product, better late than never of course i had to chase it, good old post office the box came to me mangled no fault of the companies thank goodness the seal on the product was not broken, i have not been getting much sleep lately and i really cant tell you why, honestly i don&#x27;t know but it takes its toll on my eyes making them darker than they normally would be so i have been using this for a day and i was told my eyes look rested why am i so tired. I keep telling them its this product but no one believes me, i guess this will be my little secret!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation). I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all). Your experience may differ. The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I normally use Vitamin C serum because Vitamin C works so well on my skin. I figured using an eye gel with Vitamin C might be a good idea as well.  The bottle is nice and a good size. Customer service is great too.  I really like this product. It is pretty good. It doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation or dryness on my skin and it definitely helps with the puffiness and darkness under my eyes. I also like how cool it feels on my skin. I like that I can rub it under my eyes, let it get absorbed into my skin, and then apply my makeup and eyeliner/mascara as usual.  I will definitely be using this product often.    Since I am an avid product reviewer and blogger I was sent a complimentary bottle of Bonapiel Vitamin C Eye Gel. All opinions expressed are solely my own.</li>
            <li> im not order this eye cream but I ordered for anti-cellulite for body. it is very good and love it!</li>
            <li> It is better than the other brands I&#x27;d  tried. However, it only works for my upper eyes the lower eyes puffiness remains.</li>
            <li> Did not work for the puffiness under my eye. Noticed no difference and I just finish the entire tube last night.</li>
            <li> worked well had dark circles been seeing a noticable difference would use it again</li>
            <li> This eye gel is awesome.  I&#x27;m 65 and understand there is no miracle that can take my face back to 20 but this gel does it&#x27;s job.  It&#x27;s very soothing and reduces the crow&#x27;s feet and bagginess under the eye.  I&#x27;m on my second bottle and will definitely order more when it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> Great eye cream at a great price for a review of the product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying this eye gel, especially the consistency. My skin drinks it in. It is perfect after a night of little sleep. It is a great accompaniment to the Vitamin C serum. High quality, and excellent ingredients. You could easily pay much more for a similar product of the same quality.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.  Already seeing results.  Looking forward to even more!!!!</li>
            <li> i liked the eye cream very much. the product goes on very smoothly and makes my eye area feel good. I am in my 60s  and i feel it has improved my dark circles</li>
            <li> Love this under eye cream. It feels more like a serum and quickly absorbs. I love the firm texture it leaves.</li>
            <li> A nice eye-gel.  Have noticed less puffiness.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> still have dark circles after 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with it so far.  Doesn&#x27;t clear up puffiness immediately, but after it&#x27;s on for a while it seems to help.</li>
            <li> Shipped and delivered as promised &#x3D; FAST! The seller emailed me 5-04-14, to ask if I wanted to review the product and offered these extra tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ \\&quot;Apply your Vitamin C Eye Gel 1/2 inch or so above your upper lash line and below your lower lash line, then while you&#x27;re sleeping,&lt;br /&gt;it will travel on its own and stop right around your crows feet, where you wanted it in the first place!&lt;br /&gt;+ Be sure to use your ring finger to apply it (its your weakest finger so you wont pull too hard) and after making the dots, gently pat them in.&lt;br /&gt;+ In addition to nourishing your skin from the outside, you also need to take care of it from the inside. Eating healthy and drinking lots of water can help....&lt;br /&gt;+ Get 8 hours of sleep so that all of your organs, including your skin, have time to renew. Include night creams in your regimen to aid in skin toning and wrinkle reducing.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a 52 year old healthcare professional and a skincare marketer&#x27;s dream consumer, (i.e., I&#x27;ve shelled out $ and time trialed everything from drugstore offerings to La Prairie; health food blends to dermatologist exclusives) I feel 15 faithful days of use is not long enough to adequately review the full potential of Bonapiel Vitamin C Eye Gel or other similar serums. My observations to date are: #1  The pump container is less than predictable in that it dispenses a fairly forceful squirt! The gel liquefies further upon contact with body temperature skin--think watery! The one pump amount varies from baby pea-sized to regular pea-sized; very small but sufficient to cover upper eyelids and the under eye socket area of  both eyes. I&#x27;ve learned to \\&quot;thump\\&quot; the bottom of the container against the palm of my hand to eliminate air pockets and, I keep my ring and middle fingers of the hand I&#x27;m dispensing into very close to the nozzle so I don&#x27;t share any product with my bathroom sink!  #2  The gel reduced my under eye puffiness after the first use. If someone saw a before and after picture I don&#x27;t think it would be a dramatic visual, but I could see a difference and, more importantly, feel it. #3  As for the purple-rust colored, 180 degree, Italian heritage (thanks Nonna) circles that look like I have on brown eye shadow 24/7? I cannot swear that I&#x27;ve seen much improvement. (Optimistically) slight fading would be my honest answer after only 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I will use the entire bottle, update this review at a future date and consider repurchase. IF.. this product works cumulatively, taking good short term effects to awesome long term results, THEN...I&#x27;m sold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE MAY 24, 2014: There is still approx. a week to 10 days worth of product left in my bottle. BUT, after THIRTY-FIVE DAYS of vigilant 2X a day use, I see NO IMPROVEMENT IN DARK CIRCLES! Sigh! On the plus side, the gel is effective at immediate reduction of puffiness. Fine lines are slightly diminished when used in conjunction with eye specific moisturizers. Okay product but not convincing enough to make me want to add Bonapiel to my eye care arsenal. Not a repurchase for me!re I don&#x27;t think it would be a dramatic visual, but I could see a difference and, more importantly, feel it. #3  As for the purple-rust colored, 180 degree, Italian heritage (thanks Nonna) circles that look like I have on brown eye shadow 24/7?

            <li> I have been using this Vitamin C eye cream for about a month and have noticed lovely results around my eye area....the skin seems more elastic, looks visibly fresher and seems less wrinkled.  I love the consistency of this product which is more like a gel that absorbs into the skin very well vs a cream that may just sit on top of the skin.  The gel spreads well, does not irritate at all and is pretty much nicely odorless.  The listed ingredients are fabulous too!  I also really appreciate the email letter I got from the company wanting to make sure I was happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Worked ok. But my eyes get very watery.</li>
            <li> Disappointing, it did Nothing and it didn&#x27;t last long, its not a cream or what I would call a Gel, its just a thick liquid thats almost odorless, It didn&#x27;t reduce my lines or the dark circles, I think il just grow old Gracefully, anyways they did refund me</li>
            <li> I had tried many eye creams and this one is THE BEST!!, I will keep purchasing this product.&lt;br /&gt;I am a happy customer.</li>
            <li> I have tried the Best Eye Cream for Dark Circles and Puffiness. I got it for my dark circles because it was under $40.00. I do have very few fine lines and a little puffiness under my eye, so I thought this might help that too. I tried it for a couple of weeks , used it  day and night, but unfortunately I saw no change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is in a pump container, it feels like it might be made of glass. This eye cream is actually a clear gel. Even though it feels like water, it isn&#x27;t as gentle.When I applied it, the skin around my eyes got a slight sting, and  redness for a short time. Sometimes I get an slight itchy feeling too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping this eye gel would work but it looks like I bought an inferior product.</li>
            <li> I thought I needed lower blepharoplasty surgery because of the bags under my eyes. I do not sleep well, maybe 2 to 4 hours of sleep a night, so the bags are catching up over the years. I have tried numerous eye products for the puffiness but the Offernova is &amp;#34;freakin awesome&amp;#34;. After using the product my hubby says I look refreshed, which he never used that phrase before on me. Worth every cent! &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It has decreased some darkness and puffiness but is not as effective as I expected.</li>
            <li> This is my second order and I really love this eye serum.......it really moisturizies but it is not greasy and it penetrates the eye area quickly..........I also ordered the youth serum and I like this product as well......I am 73 years old and there isn&#x27;t much out there for&lt;br /&gt;us old gals.........Highly recommend these two products............Marie</li>
            <li> It does not deliver as promised;ate least in my case.  I&#x27;ll just keep trying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically a Vitamin C serum and seems to be good for eliminating fine lines &amp; keep puffiness under control.  I&#x27;ve used it twice a day for about 2 weeks + and it hasn&#x27;t really done anything to lessen dark circles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this, faithfully, morning and night, for a few weeks, and it has done nothing for the puffiness under my eyes, which is what I bought it to help correct.</li>
            <li> My wife has to deal with dark circles and puffiness around her eyes because she is an accountant. At certain times of the month, my wife doesn&#x27;t get enough sleep and always looks tired. She tried this eye cream and it slowly fades the circles and puffiness from around her eyes. It really works. She loves this product because it helps her look good even when she is very tired from work.  She also loves that the product is made out of natural products that help your skin, instead of hiding the problems.</li>
            <li> Didnt work so well for me. But the customer service is  AWESOME. I got a nice email from a gentleman&lt;br /&gt;who asked how I liked it. When I said not so well, he did explain to me that different creams will not work&lt;br /&gt;exactly the same on everyone. I give the product 1 star, and the customer service 10 stars.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything for the puffiness</li>
            <li> After many years of not sleeping and fatigue I ended up with severe bags under my eyes.  Nothing I tried before worked.  While I have years of undoing to do regarding my eyes, I have seen a reduction in puffiness. I look somewhat younger.  I believe this is a great product. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> just got this and so far it is nice but too early to tell yet. After a month of using twice a day I&#x27;ll report on how well it worked.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this producr. I&#x27;ve actually tried a good bit of products and haven&#x27;t seen the results as fast as this one.</li>
            <li> This seemed to work pretty well for my dark circles,but felt like it was drying out my eye area skin.Needed a moisturizer over it.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;5-Star Rating – as always, it is a pleasure dealing with Amazon. Thank you&amp;#34;  The product is great.  Would purchase again.  Thanks again, Josephine</li>
            <li> This product really works!</li>
