            <li>This one works a lot better.</li>
            <li>just ok.</li>
            <li>Sure you can spend alot more on those fancy name brand units.</li>
            <li>This is a budget trimmer.it works pretty good.</li>
            <li>Power was more than adequate and switch is better than twist start models</li>
            <li>Nose hair trimmers seem to damage quite easily.</li>
            <li>Seems to be working fine.</li>
            <li>For the price it was fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cuts fine and do the job, but is just too cheap.</li>

            <li>Powerful!</li>
            <li>It is a fairly cheap made item, however I was really impressed by how good the cutting head cuts.</li>
            <li>Clean hairs in nose</li>
            <li>works well and the pice is right!  </li>
            <li>But at this price, plus free shipping, they are well worth it.</li>
            <li>I have had several electric nose hair trimmers, this is by far the best for a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>If you need a nose trimmer and just want something electric to do the job quickly don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this.</li>
            <li>Nothing special but worth what I paid for it.</li>
            <li>Thanks seller!!</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>so I got my money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>Most of the circular trimmers don&#x27;t trim that close near the visible part of your nostril</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this tool and don&#x27;t get confused by the \\&quot;travel size\\&quot; in the description box.</li>
            <li>trimmer will stall sometimes which is fun.</li>
            <li>So far, it is working fine.</li>
            <li>The most recent battery operated trimmer was a &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; and cost around $20.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what its supposed to do.</li>
            <li>This is my first nose hair trimmer</li>
            <li>Really does the job!</li>
            <li>Arrived a few days later than I thought, but it works great and the price was right!</li>
            <li>Product exactly as advertised and arrived fast.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is almost exactly the same as most other trimmers I have paid much more for.</li>
            <li>a matter of fact, I ordered a second one just in case this one ever breaks and the product was shipped very quickly as well.</li>
            <li>Good quality and should last a long time!</li>
            <li>Cheap and low quality, works alright but doesn&#x27;t pick up everywhere.</li>
            <li>These trimmers are much easier to use that attempting to navigate your nose or ear with scissors.</li>
            <li>This does not cut as close you would expect but it works very well.</li>
            <li>does the job nicely, at a reasonable price&lt;br</li>
            <li>It shipped really fast but came without a battery.</li>
            <li>I really like this product for its quality and for its price.</li>
            <li>the staff is very helpful.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>But really, why would?</li>
            <li>It is fast, comfortabe to use and efficient.</li>
            <li>I highly recomend it Another home run for Amazon!</li>
            <li>It works, and I wasn&#x27;t expecting my nose to be plucked clean by any means, but there was more nose hair left than I expected after I finished.</li>
            <li>Very cheap had to less with it a bit to get it to work.</li>
            <li>sooner or later, I&#x27;ll surely get one that will serve for several years&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>This inexpensive trimmer performs much better than more expensive nose trimmers.</li>
            <li>Used it and it instantly cleaned my nose and the sound is so tolerable, not too loud like others.</li>
            <li>Better than the more expensive ones</li>
            <li>When I saw this trimmer and the low price, I thought, &amp;#34;This is worth a try...</li>
            <li>Sometimes they are fine other times</li>
            <li>is all you need to achieve complete ecstasy.</li>
            <li>I am actually surprised at how well it works considering the price of it.</li>
            <li>The most reliable is a pair of small scissors!</li>
            <li>ok for the price but not great.</li>

            <li> Product works wonders 4&#x27; me!</li>
            <li> awesome tool for grooming, a must have.</li>
            <li> Very cheap had to less with it a bit to get it to work. But it does the job.</li>
            <li> Nose hair trimmers seem to damage quite easily. I swear this is like the third one I have bought in two years. This time I decided to go cheaper.</li>
            <li> Product exactly as advertised and arrived fast.</li>
            <li> Cheap and low quality, works alright but doesn&#x27;t pick up everywhere. I guess you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> It works, and I wasn&#x27;t expecting my nose to be plucked clean by any means, but there was more nose hair left than I expected after I finished. Does the job well enough though</li>
            <li> This is a budget trimmer.it works pretty good. I go through alot of this style of trimmer so I purchased two. It was under ten dollars with shipping.this is all you need to achieve complete ecstasy.</li>
            <li> I  am pleased with the product</li>
            <li> I have owner several nose and ear trimmers over the past 20 years. The most reliable is a pair of small scissors! The most recent battery operated trimmer was a &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; and cost around $20. I thought, &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve finally go one that will last a long time!&amp;#34;. Not so, it died as did all the other battery operated trimmers I have purchased. When I saw this trimmer and the low price, I thought, &amp;#34;This is worth a try... sooner or later, I&#x27;ll surely get one that will serve for several years&amp;#34;. I like this trimmer. So far, it is working fine. Why don&#x27;t I simply use scissors? These trimmers are much easier to use that attempting to navigate your nose or ear with scissors. Give this trimmer a try.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what its supposed to do. I would recommend it to other people. Good buy for price</li>
            <li> This does not cut as close you would expect but it works very well. If you want a closer cut you have to work for it but it can be done. I am actually surprised at how well it works considering the price of it. If you need a nose trimmer and just want something electric to do the job quickly don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this.</li>
            <li> I love this and and is very happy with it. The delivery was on time and that is a plus also.</li>
            <li> Just received yesterday. This inexpensive trimmer performs much better than more expensive nose trimmers. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> works great, good price fast delivery</li>
            <li> works well and the pice is right!  I have used others which worked the same and are much more expensive</li>
            <li> It is a fairly cheap made item, however I was really impressed by how good the cutting head cuts.</li>
            <li> Great Price, Nice Ear &amp; Nose Hair Trimmer. You aren&#x27;t going to beat this product in terms of value. Really love it.</li>
            <li> does the job nicely, at a reasonable price&lt;br /&gt;she love&#x27;s that I have it</li>
            <li> Absolutely outstanding.  My previous nose hair clipper was part of an overall rechargeable trimmer set.  It broke after many uses so I got my money&#x27;s worth.  I started looking for just the nose hair trimmer and this had good reviews and with shipping was about $6 so I gave it a shot.  Most of the circular trimmers don&#x27;t trim that close near the visible part of your nostril (I know too much info), but this one does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a matter of fact, I ordered a second one just in case this one ever breaks and the product was shipped very quickly as well.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this tool and don&#x27;t get confused by the \\&quot;travel size\\&quot; in the description box. It&#x27;s a medium size tool that fits perfectly in any adult&#x27;s hand. It shipped really fast but came without a battery. It only uses 1 AA battery, so wasn&#x27;t a problem. Used it and it instantly cleaned my nose and the sound is so tolerable, not too loud like others. I really like this product for its quality and for its price. No pain at all...</li>
            <li> Works great for no name brand.  Price was also great.  In the past I had a Panasonic that was about 10 times as much and lasted me about 2 years.  Now we&#x27;ll just have to wait and see how long this one will last...for the price if it last me about year or two, I&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
            <li> This is my first nose hair trimmer and I&#x27;m very glad I got it. Picture does a good job of telling the kind of quality you will get. It gets the job done with minimal discomfort. Not much more I can say on how well it lasts. Have not had it long.</li>
            <li> Had a similar one for years that finally crapped out. This one works a lot better. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Nice product, works well and is cheap.&lt;br /&gt;And the staff is very helpful.</li>
            <li> The product has the words &amp;#34;facial hair grooming trimmer&amp;#34; right in the title, which should be flagged as false advertising.  This product is not meant for facial hair.  Don&#x27;t take it from me, the operating instructions even say &amp;#34;This trimmer is designed only for cutting nose or ear hairs.  Do not attempt to use it for any other purpose&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;m sorry, but if your instructions tell you not to use something as it is described by it&#x27;s TITLE, there&#x27;s a serious problem.  The company eventually gave me a refund for it, but it took an email, several calls during working hours, and a message before I happened to get an answer from them.</li>
            <li> I have had several electric nose hair trimmers, this is by far the best for a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> This product arrived well on time &amp; was well packaged. I have to admit, for the price, I thought it was going to be an OK product, but not a great product! It was a great product! I am very pleased with this trimmer and it operates smoothly and flawlessly! I would recommend this trimmer to anyone!</li>
            <li> This trimmer is almost exactly the same as most other trimmers I have paid much more for. These things generally work very well for around 6 months, then either stop working or the blades dull. But at this price, plus free shipping, they are well worth it. I bought two so I wouldn&#x27;t have to order another for a while.</li>
            <li> Works great!! Thanks seller!!</li>
            <li> Seems to be working fine. A little chintzy feeling but for the price can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cuts fine and do the job, but is just too cheap.</li>
            <li> ok for the price but not great.</li>
            <li> Looking for the cheapest one you can find? This is it for a reason. Usually I can tolerate cheap products, but this was just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Junk, flimsy and does not work all that well.</li>
            <li> Better than the more expensive ones</li>
            <li> Really does the job! Clean hairs in nose well!</li>
            <li> Present. Not great construction just ok. crome colored plastic. trimmer will stall sometimes which is fun. My poor Dad thinks i am torturing him when I  start to use it and then it just stops, &amp;#34;keep going&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;are you done&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;you just started&amp;#34;. Good grief! Sometimes they are fine other times they just stink. Meh.</li>
            <li> recipient said the product worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> Works well for such an inexpensive item!  It does the job!</li>
            <li> Nothing special but worth what I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Powerful! What a value!</li>
            <li> Beats using scissors.</li>
            <li> For the price it was fine. It came as advertised. Power was more than adequate and switch is better than twist start models</li>
            <li> L bought it for my son,he says it does not do the job</li>
            <li> Arrived a few days later than I thought, but it works great and the price was right! I recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> So so so so so so happy with my product. Fast shipping. Zero problems. Thanks.</li>
            <li> As usual, the price knocked it out of the park. It was delivered in a flash. Best of all, it does a great job! Sure you can spend alot more on those fancy name brand units. But really, why would? It gets the job done. It is fast, comfortabe to use and efficient. I highly recomend it Another home run for Amazon!</li>
            <li> BAD PACKAGED.THE NAME IS GONCON ALSO CHINA MADE..ITS GOOD AND PAIN FREE</li>
            <li> not good at all but hey u get what u pay for unit dose not stay on when useing it and it dose not cut close at all</li>
            <li> This little cordless hair remover works great! Good quality and should last a long time!</li>
