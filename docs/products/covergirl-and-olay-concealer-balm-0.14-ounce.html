            <li>It blends perfectly with my Covergirl/Olay makeup.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this concealer.  </li>
            <li>I think it works fairly well!</li>
            <li>It blends in beautifully with my foundation</li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>This is the most effective way to cover them up, and at a great price!</li>
            <li>Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do at a fair price.  </li>
            <li>nice texture and finish.</li>
            <li>Nice consistency, covers well, dewy finish, buildable, blends well</li>
            <li>/&gt;I might have been able to ignore with that, and say \\&quot;good enough\\&quot;, IF the application was anything at all like it should have been.</li>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s the best for me so far.</li>
            <li>the quality is great, i really like it!</li>
            <li>When I checked out the makeup in the Tube, there was a dent in the top of the concealer, so it had opened either while in inventory  or packaging for shipment.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better now that it has the Olay in it.</li>
            <li>The oil of Olay added ingredient makes it much better too.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found anything else that does a better job.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, great product.</li>
            <li>I love this concealer.  </li>
            <li>It does not have a creamy consistency, and I had to add a coat of Hope in A Tube eye cream (by Philosophy) on top, to even get it to spread</li>
            <li>It is creamy and easy to blend.</li>
            <li>It blends well and does not clump into fine lines under the eye.</li>
            <li>There are so many expensive cover products out there, yet I have used Cover Girl for years and it works the absolute best.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping and exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I have been using Cover girl products for 30 years, and they are reasonably priced and get better and better, especially this particular product.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t figured out yet if if makes me break out because I am trying a couple of different products right now, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;fair\\&quot; matches my skin color really well.  </li>
            <li>I really like this concealer.</li>
            <li>I think it goes on easily, stays on for a long time, and doesn&#x27;t look pasty like some concealers do.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Within a few hours of applying, I had to add MORE eye cream on top, because it was beginning to look dry and \\&quot;cracked\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>only reason I am giving it 2 stars is:&lt;br /&gt;1)  the price, which is very reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;2)  the shade selection, which includes several choices, meaning, you could probably find a better match than I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li>I have black circles under my eyes, and I have tried many products.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I bought it in the \\&quot;light\\&quot; shade (which I have used before in the Cover Girl Smoothers Concealer, which was a nice, neutral light beige), and was disappointed to find that THIS version of light is very yellow on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is to thick and does not go on your skin very smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I purchased it because I was looking for an extra-creamy concealer that wouldn&#x27;t be difficult to spread under the eyes, and would offer good coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First of all, the product is very, very dry, has no \\&quot;slip\\&quot; at all.</li>
            <li>I purchased this due to other reviews and was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>I always come back to this old standard because it works.  </li>

            <li> than that, I can&#x27;t recommend this concealer, as it does not \\&quot;glide on\\&quot; (again, this from the package), it feels dry, and doesn&#x27;t last after application.</li>
            <li> I found this concealer to be way too dry for me...</li>
            <li> This is one product I can not live without.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased Covergirl concealer in the past and didn&#x27;t really care for it as the texture was just too heavy.</li>
            <li> and I only have to purchase a new one approximately once yearly.  </li>
            <li> The texture is still too heavy and it seems to illuminate all of the tiny lines under my eyes instead of concealing anything.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> nice texture and finish. i should have gotten the lighter color, but that was my fault. the quality is great, i really like it!</li>
            <li> I like the product; but when it arrived, there was a slit in the package.  When I checked out the makeup in the Tube, there was a dent in the top of the concealer, so it had opened either while in inventory  or packaging for shipment.  I&#x27;ve used it anyway  I smoothed off the tip and used it without a problem.  It blends well and does not clump into fine lines under the eye.</li>
            <li> I have a strange cast to my skin, I&#x27;m a northern european mutt and am constantly pale, plus have a slight greyish cast.  I also have terrible dark circles under my eyes that are always there.  This is the most effective way to cover them up, and at a great price!</li>
            <li> I found this concealer to be way too dry for me... no matter what I tried for application (fingers, brush, sponge), it still ended up looking cakey</li>
            <li> I purchased this due to other reviews and was not disappointed.  I have now purchased this a few times.  I have learned to use concealer AFTER putting on makeup.  Otherwise the makeup washes away the concealer. Then some powder to set it all and done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased Covergirl concealer in the past and didn&#x27;t really care for it as the texture was just too heavy. I ordered this concealer to try it thinking that maybe it would be different with the Olay inside. It wasn&#x27;t. The texture is still too heavy and it seems to illuminate all of the tiny lines under my eyes instead of concealing anything. I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> It is to thick and does not go on your skin very smoothly.  It cakes up and gets into the creases.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I have black circles under my eyes, and I have tried many products.  I always come back to this old standard because it works.  It&#x27;s much better now that it has the Olay in it.</li>
            <li> There are so many expensive cover products out there, yet I have used Cover Girl for years and it works the absolute best. It is creamy and goes well under foundation. The oil of Olay added ingredient makes it much better too. For the price it&#x27;s the best for me so far. I haven&#x27;t found anything else that does a better job. I have been using Cover girl products for 30 years, and they are reasonably priced and get better and better, especially this particular product.</li>
            <li> This product lasts me forever and I only have to purchase a new one approximately once yearly.  Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do at a fair price.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I like this product. It glided on smoothy.</li>
            <li> This is one product I can not live without.  It blends perfectly with my Covergirl/Olay makeup.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great product.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and exactly what I wanted. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Nice consistency, covers well, dewy finish, buildable, blends well</li>
            <li> I love this concealer.  The \\&quot;fair\\&quot; matches my skin color really well.  I think it goes on easily, stays on for a long time, and doesn&#x27;t look pasty like some concealers do.  I&#x27;m happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Target after reading about it in In Style Magazine. I purchased it because I was looking for an extra-creamy concealer that wouldn&#x27;t be difficult to spread under the eyes, and would offer good coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t find it in this product.  I bought it in the \\&quot;light\\&quot; shade (which I have used before in the Cover Girl Smoothers Concealer, which was a nice, neutral light beige), and was disappointed to find that THIS version of light is very yellow on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might have been able to ignore with that, and say \\&quot;good enough\\&quot;, IF the application was anything at all like it should have been. It was not.  First of all, the product is very, very dry, has no \\&quot;slip\\&quot; at all. It does not have a creamy consistency, and I had to add a coat of Hope in A Tube eye cream (by Philosophy) on top, to even get it to spread evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a few hours of applying, I had to add MORE eye cream on top, because it was beginning to look dry and \\&quot;cracked\\&quot;.  Where&#x27;s the balm?  Where is the \\&quot;moisture-locking\\&quot; formula they talk about on the package?  It&#x27;s not here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I am giving it 2 stars is:&lt;br /&gt;1)  the price, which is very reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;2)  the shade selection, which includes several choices, meaning, you could probably find a better match than I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I can&#x27;t recommend this concealer, as it does not \\&quot;glide on\\&quot; (again, this from the package), it feels dry, and doesn&#x27;t last after application.</li>

            <li> I am very happy with this concealer.  It blends in beautifully with my foundation</li>
            <li> I really like this concealer. It is creamy and easy to blend. I haven&#x27;t figured out yet if if makes me break out because I am trying a couple of different products right now, but so far so good.</li>
