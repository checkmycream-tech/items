            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>While it did amazing things with my lashes, I wanted to gouge my eyes out while wearing it.</li>
            <li>Amazingly buildable without clumping.  </li>
            <li>To pay $38 would make one think it would be an amazing product.</li>
            <li>Amazing mascara.  </li>
            <li>My daughter is a stylist and she turned me on to this amazing product.  </li>
            <li>They kind of just clumped together.</li>
            <li>Loving these fiber extensions.</li>
            <li>I have also noticed an improvement in my own lashes.  </li>
            <li>Love love love Cherry Blooms!!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very easy to use</li>
            <li>Tried a lot of mascaras and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>My lashes look great and feels light weight and comfortable.</li>
            <li>The only thing I really loved is it washed off so good no streaks!</li>
            <li>When its time to take them off they come off so easily with warm water.</li>
            <li>Easy to remove, when you want to, in the shower with warm water.  </li>
            <li>Just ok.</li>
            <li>For the price I don&#x27;t think it is that much better than mascara.</li>
            <li>Wish there were more applications in the fiber lashes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li>More like a night thing.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love the fullness</li>
            <li>then more t. gel.</li>
            <li>so you have more t. gel than fibers</li>
            <li>I am the most pickiest person when it comes to Mascaras.</li>
            <li>Take it from the most pickiest person when it comes to mascaras.</li>
            <li>mascara is much better and made from safer ingredients.  </li>
            <li>LOVE.</li>
            <li>I can see why this has top marks.</li>
            <li>I had to put on so many coats in order to see anything.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find that the wand had so many fibers on it</li>
            <li>cherry blooms, you&#x27;re going to love it.</li>
            <li>but perhaps it&#x27;s getting better as my lashes improve.</li>
            <li>I also stopped curling my lashes, I found that the application is easier and the end result is better without it.</li>
            <li>(I do pump this otherwise too many fibers stick to the wand.</li>
            <li>I love seeing all of the fibers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I love seeing all of the fibers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Love this eyelash product......</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather pay $7 for Maybelline and get better results.</li>
            <li>Glad I got it.</li>
            <li>A TRY TO SEE IF WORK BETTER</li>
            <li>BUT NOTTT WAY YOUNIQUE IS 1000% BETTER</li>

            <li>I AM GOING TO TRY ANOTHER BRAND LOVE ALPHA TO SEE IF IS BETTER DAN YOUNIQUE</li>
            <li>I have tried others cheaper and with better results</li>
            <li>I love this product...</li>
            <li>The result is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>but otherwise I love this product</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried them &amp;#34;all&amp;#34; :)</li>
            <li>I love the look although no one mentioned any noticeable difference except one friend that I told about it.  </li>
            <li>But I noticed and I felt better.  </li>
            <li>Comes off very clean.</li>
            <li>cool product... helps extend and looks nice</li>
            <li>Lasts all day long without flaking and best of all, EASY to remove.  </li>
            <li>The original version was so much better.</li>
            <li>Other than that, they are wonderful!</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non-irritating, easy to use</li>
            <li>Easy to use, no fibers flaking during the day</li>
            <li>is easy</li>
            <li>is easy</li>
            <li>Easy to Use.  </li>
            <li>It does come of easily in the shower.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easy to remove too.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy just follow directions.  </li>
            <li>I wear contact lenses, it does not irritate, and its easy to remove at end of day.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to apply</li>
            <li>My own lashes are now longer and curled up completely on their own.</li>
            <li>I have light colored and short lashes and on my first try, I was very impressed.  </li>
            <li>But this is a great alternative and gives a similar effect</li>
            <li>Looks great when you just put it on especially after you curl your lashes, but after maybe about 4 hours then my lashes were no longer curled and and lots of fibres under my eyes even after I did the recommended brushing on of mascara afterwards.</li>
            <li>Cherry Blooms is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>, you may find fallen fibers on your cheeks; I use a make-up sponge to lightly brush them away after my application is done, before I coat lower lashes.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not sticky and they&#x27;re so easy to clean up.</li>
            <li>, you may find fallen fibers on your cheeks; I use a make-up sponge to lightly brush them away after my application is done, before I coat lower lashes.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not sticky and they&#x27;re so easy to clean up.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>I cannot emphasize enough how great this is.  </li>
            <li>I just wash them off in the shower, or use some cheap eye makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>Its a quick easy way to get beautiful long lashes.  </li>
            <li>The other wonderful thing is that you wake up with fabulous lashes - no overnight smearing all over the pillow - just pretty eyes in the morning.  </li>
            <li>My new favorite!</li>
            <li>At first I thought I was getting better at the application</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>It took a bit of practice, I admit - but the effort was SO WORTH IT!  </li>
            <li>Very easily and quickly applied and lasts all day with absolutely zero flaking, running, or irritation.</li>
            <li>I am so glad i found this product because now, i cant live without it!!</li>
            <li>This is THE best eyelash extension and thickener wrapped into a complete long wearing, non-flaking mascara that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>And they also didnt look as full.</li>
            <li>Love them - they are easy to use and easy to remove and they really look natural!!</li>
            <li>I was so excited as soon as I got it that I had to try it right away.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and gentle on the eyes</li>
            <li>Luckily Amazon was kind of enough to refund me the money even though the supplier refused to honor their 30 day warranty.</li>
            <li>On a more positive note, they did seem to last longer than most mascara I wore.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have very high expectations for this product, but I was wonderfully surprised at how effective it was.</li>
            <li>Was satisfied with application &amp; results...looks natural &amp; no smudging</li>
            <li>It is worth EVERY penny</li>
            <li>IT is better than the old version of Younique 3D.</li>
            <li>There is no extra length or thickness of any kind.</li>
            <li>but well worth the results.  </li>
            <li>IS WORTH  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product, I never wear false eyelashes.</li>
            <li>One HUGE and unexpected benefit to this mascara (which is a great mascara on its own) is that the beeswax is ridiculously beneficial for lash growth!</li>
            <li>and I can point you in the right direction.</li>
            <li>Repeat these steps on the right eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Coming off not so great pretty messy.</li>
            <li>I love it more than ANY other fiber mascara out there!  </li>
            <li>I kept my eyes barely opened while I was applying the fibers to make sure nothing fell in my eyes.</li>
            <li>Nice and long eye lashes .</li>
            <li>First of all, if you use them as directed, you will absolutely have gorgeous, long lashes.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, curls the lashes and they are longer and natural looking.</li>
            <li>Wish this added a tiny bit more volume.</li>
            <li>In fact I think it feels better than my regular mascara.</li>
            <li>Regular mascara works better</li>
            <li>I applied the mascara first (about 20 applications as directed) then applied the fibers and OMG</li>
            <li>Cherry Blooms is much better than regular mascara.  </li>
            <li>IS BETTER THAN REGULAR MASCARA</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first to get this product, but after watching some videos on how to apply it, decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been hooked on Cherry Blooms from the first time I wore it about a year ago.</li>
            <li>Using this product as part of my daily makeup, and I&#x27;ve received many compliments on the length and fullness of my lashes.</li>
            <li>No melting on hot days.</li>
            <li>Remember to coat lashes with the first product to set the fibers.  </li>
            <li>I pretty much had just gave up.</li>
            <li>IS OK IF U LOOKING FOR LONG LASHES ....</li>
            <li>Very simple to apply and easy to remove.</li>
            <li>As easy to put on as regular mascara.  </li>
            <li>It does work great but the flaking is tough to handle.</li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>really irritated my eyes after a couple of days</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re Real.)     </li>
            <li>I really like the product.  </li>
            <li>Even my lashes that were growing straight out are cooperative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>Got it thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks for the speedy shipping.</li>
            <li>Am curious to find out how many weeks product lasts.</li>
            <li>, I believe actually that a Facebook ad popped up, and the reviews seemed to say it was better for sensitive eyes.    </li>
            <li>The only thing I really liked the look of was individual eyelash extensions</li>
            <li>Although there was little difference in the lenght, I can honestly say that this product did not give you the &amp;#34;spider lashes&amp;#34; look of many of other fibre mascaras.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are almost non existent, they are super short and very sparse.  </li>
            <li>They are long, flirty, and fabulous.  </li>
            <li>so I made sure I applied it starting from the middle of my lashes up.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly reccommend this product..</li>
            <li>So, after a couple months&#x27; of usage, I have a little more feedback.</li>
            <li>and I have full long eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>(I am right handed) and I open both.</li>
            <li>I wiggle the brush from left to right as I draw the brush upward.</li>
            <li>Do the same on the right eye.</li>
            <li>Do the same on the right eye.</li>
            <li>It does make your eyelashes very long and full</li>
            <li>Just beautiful long, thick lashes!</li>
            <li>This is my new signature mascara.</li>
            <li>Work quickly, the fibers won&#x27;t stick to dry mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very natural.</li>
            <li>(I am very sensitive).</li>
            <li>(complaint of many other brands) and easy to remove (I use baby oil).  </li>
            <li>and they look natural to boot!</li>
            <li>After several uses, I found it works pretty well at extending my lashes.</li>
            <li>cost is higher than regular mascara</li>
            <li>I only use it for special occasions, not daily wear.  </li>
            <li>The key is more transplanting gel and less fibers.</li>
            <li>I love the gel part of this two step mascara, but the 2nd step, the &amp;#34;fibre&amp;#34; shed during the day and leave an unslightly mess under &amp; around the eyes...</li>
            <li>but this turned out to be more like a regular mascara that flaked little fibers on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>Amazing product that I am addicted to.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes and was worried about irritation.  </li>
            <li>Dramatically lengthens lashes and the results look completely natural.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>Then they told me that I needed to contact the manufacturer directly.</li>
            <li>It does clump, if you use too much of either the 1st or 2nd step.</li>
            <li>it is not messy.</li>
            <li>AN FILLS NATURAL ...</li>
            <li>BY FAR YOUNIQUE</li>
            <li>bit of advice....if you don&#x27;t have a natural curl to your lashes, us a curler before applying,</li>
            <li>If you want a more feathery look, simply use less!</li>
            <li>Love this, Makes getting eyelash extension a think of the past!</li>
            <li>I wear contacts and have to be a little more careful about not letting the fibers get into my eyes  </li>
            <li>and you literally only take it off with just soap and water only when you&#x27;re ready.</li>
            <li>After about 3 hours, it flakes off into my eyes which causes major irritation as I wear contacts.</li>
            <li>You need a good coat of the t. gel, then some fibers (really important: NOT from the base of your lashes on the fibers, ONLY from mid lash up</li>
            <li>soft after application, not crunchy like they do after using regular mascara.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll</li>
            <li>I have barely there lashes, and this gives my lashes the appearance of an additional row.  </li>
            <li>I am IN LOVE and ADDICTED to this product.</li>
            <li>So sorry you couldn&#x27;t overcome your tragic application and enjoy this great product!</li>
            <li>I was hoping for more dramatic effect.</li>
            <li>although it adds a few minutes to my daily morning routine and with a little practice, I got better and faster with the application.  </li>
            <li>Take the extra few seconds to do a few more coats</li>
            <li>I also love the fact you have total control over how dramatic you want them to look.</li>
            <li>So I washed my face and waited about an hour for my lashes to dry out completely.</li>
            <li>I am a 60 year-old grandmother that had long, lush lashes in my younger years.  </li>
            <li>I found that if I use 5-10 swipes of the step 1 and then about the same for step 2 then wait about 5 mins to apply the step 1 again, seems to really cut down on the clumps.</li>
            <li>It really makes a mess of your lashes but don&#x27;t worry about that.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe the dramatic results It created - and so easy in literally 55 secs per eye.</li>

            <li> Great product - I&#x27;ve tried others but they aren&#x27;t as good quality.  </li>
            <li> My lashes haven&#x27;t looked so good in years.  </li>
            <li> Oh, and good luck getting Younique off.</li>

            <li> I love cherry blooms!  </li>
            <li> :) It&#x27;s been worn by me to the gym on my 3 hour workout days with no smearing or flaking!</li>
            <li> Works great, easy to apply and remove.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> While it did amazing things with my lashes, I wanted to gouge my eyes out while wearing it.</li>
            <li> Amazingly buildable without clumping.  </li>
            <li> To pay $38 would make one think it would be an amazing product.</li>
            <li> Amazing mascara.  </li>
            <li> My daughter is a stylist and she turned me on to this amazing product.  </li>
            <li> They kind of just clumped together.</li>
            <li> Loving these fiber extensions.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed an improvement in my own lashes.  </li>
            <li> Love love love Cherry Blooms!!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very easy to use</li>
            <li> Tried a lot of mascaras and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> My lashes look great and feels light weight and comfortable.</li>
            <li> The only thing I really loved is it washed off so good no streaks!</li>
            <li> When its time to take them off they come off so easily with warm water.</li>
            <li> Easy to remove, when you want to, in the shower with warm water.  </li>
            <li> Just ok.</li>
            <li> For the price I don&#x27;t think it is that much better than mascara.</li>
            <li> Wish there were more applications in the fiber lashes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li> More like a night thing.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love the fullness</li>
            <li> then more t. gel.</li>
            <li> so you have more t. gel than fibers</li>
            <li> I am the most pickiest person when it comes to Mascaras.</li>
            <li> Take it from the most pickiest person when it comes to mascaras.</li>
            <li> mascara is much better and made from safer ingredients.  </li>
            <li> LOVE.</li>
            <li> I can see why this has top marks.</li>
            <li> I had to put on so many coats in order to see anything.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find that the wand had so many fibers on it</li>
            <li> cherry blooms, you&#x27;re going to love it.</li>
            <li> but perhaps it&#x27;s getting better as my lashes improve.</li>
            <li> I also stopped curling my lashes, I found that the application is easier and the end result is better without it.</li>
            <li> (I do pump this otherwise too many fibers stick to the wand.</li>
            <li> I love seeing all of the fibers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I love seeing all of the fibers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Love this eyelash product......</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather pay $7 for Maybelline and get better results.</li>
            <li> Glad I got it.</li>
            <li> A TRY TO SEE IF WORK BETTER</li>
            <li> BUT NOTTT WAY YOUNIQUE IS 1000% BETTER</li>

            <li> I AM GOING TO TRY ANOTHER BRAND LOVE ALPHA TO SEE IF IS BETTER DAN YOUNIQUE</li>
            <li> I have tried others cheaper and with better results</li>
            <li> I love this product...</li>
            <li> The result is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> but otherwise I love this product</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried them &amp;#34;all&amp;#34; :)</li>
            <li> I love the look although no one mentioned any noticeable difference except one friend that I told about it.  </li>
            <li> But I noticed and I felt better.  </li>
            <li> Comes off very clean.</li>
            <li> cool product... helps extend and looks nice</li>
            <li> Lasts all day long without flaking and best of all, EASY to remove.  </li>
            <li> The original version was so much better.</li>
            <li> Other than that, they are wonderful!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non-irritating, easy to use</li>
            <li> Easy to use, no fibers flaking during the day</li>
            <li> is easy</li>
            <li> is easy</li>
            <li> Easy to Use.  </li>
            <li> It does come of easily in the shower.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re easy to remove too.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy just follow directions.  </li>
            <li> I wear contact lenses, it does not irritate, and its easy to remove at end of day.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to apply</li>
            <li> My own lashes are now longer and curled up completely on their own.</li>
            <li> I have light colored and short lashes and on my first try, I was very impressed.  </li>
            <li> But this is a great alternative and gives a similar effect</li>
            <li> Looks great when you just put it on especially after you curl your lashes, but after maybe about 4 hours then my lashes were no longer curled and and lots of fibres under my eyes even after I did the recommended brushing on of mascara afterwards.</li>
            <li> Cherry Blooms is fabulous.  </li>
            <li> , you may find fallen fibers on your cheeks; I use a make-up sponge to lightly brush them away after my application is done, before I coat lower lashes.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not sticky and they&#x27;re so easy to clean up.</li>

            <li> They&#x27;re not sticky and they&#x27;re so easy to clean up.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> I cannot emphasize enough how great this is.  </li>
            <li> I just wash them off in the shower, or use some cheap eye makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> Its a quick easy way to get beautiful long lashes.  </li>
            <li> The other wonderful thing is that you wake up with fabulous lashes - no overnight smearing all over the pillow - just pretty eyes in the morning.  </li>
            <li> My new favorite!</li>
            <li> At first I thought I was getting better at the application</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> It took a bit of practice, I admit - but the effort was SO WORTH IT!  </li>
            <li> Very easily and quickly applied and lasts all day with absolutely zero flaking, running, or irritation.</li>
            <li> I am so glad i found this product because now, i cant live without it!!</li>
            <li> This is THE best eyelash extension and thickener wrapped into a complete long wearing, non-flaking mascara that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> And they also didnt look as full.</li>
            <li> Love them - they are easy to use and easy to remove and they really look natural!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited as soon as I got it that I had to try it right away.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and gentle on the eyes</li>
            <li> Luckily Amazon was kind of enough to refund me the money even though the supplier refused to honor their 30 day warranty.</li>
            <li> On a more positive note, they did seem to last longer than most mascara I wore.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have very high expectations for this product, but I was wonderfully surprised at how effective it was.</li>
            <li> Was satisfied with application &amp; results...looks natural &amp; no smudging</li>
            <li> It is worth EVERY penny</li>
            <li> IT is better than the old version of Younique 3D.</li>
            <li> There is no extra length or thickness of any kind.</li>
            <li> but well worth the results.  </li>
            <li> IS WORTH  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, I never wear false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> One HUGE and unexpected benefit to this mascara (which is a great mascara on its own) is that the beeswax is ridiculously beneficial for lash growth!</li>
            <li> and I can point you in the right direction.</li>
            <li> Repeat these steps on the right eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Coming off not so great pretty messy.</li>
            <li> I love it more than ANY other fiber mascara out there!  </li>
            <li> I kept my eyes barely opened while I was applying the fibers to make sure nothing fell in my eyes.</li>
            <li> Nice and long eye lashes .</li>
            <li> First of all, if you use them as directed, you will absolutely have gorgeous, long lashes.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, curls the lashes and they are longer and natural looking.</li>
            <li> Wish this added a tiny bit more volume.</li>
            <li> In fact I think it feels better than my regular mascara.</li>
            <li> Regular mascara works better</li>
            <li> I applied the mascara first (about 20 applications as directed) then applied the fibers and OMG</li>
            <li> Cherry Blooms is much better than regular mascara.  </li>
            <li> IS BETTER THAN REGULAR MASCARA</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first to get this product, but after watching some videos on how to apply it, decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been hooked on Cherry Blooms from the first time I wore it about a year ago.</li>
            <li> Using this product as part of my daily makeup, and I&#x27;ve received many compliments on the length and fullness of my lashes.</li>
            <li> No melting on hot days.</li>
            <li> Remember to coat lashes with the first product to set the fibers.  </li>
            <li> I pretty much had just gave up.</li>
            <li> IS OK IF U LOOKING FOR LONG LASHES ....</li>
            <li> Very simple to apply and easy to remove.</li>
            <li> As easy to put on as regular mascara.  </li>
            <li> It does work great but the flaking is tough to handle.</li>
            <li> It really works.  </li>
            <li> really irritated my eyes after a couple of days</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re Real.)     </li>
            <li> I really like the product.  </li>
            <li> Even my lashes that were growing straight out are cooperative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> Got it thanks</li>
            <li> Thanks for the speedy shipping.</li>
            <li> Am curious to find out how many weeks product lasts.</li>
            <li> , I believe actually that a Facebook ad popped up, and the reviews seemed to say it was better for sensitive eyes.    </li>
            <li> The only thing I really liked the look of was individual eyelash extensions</li>
            <li> Although there was little difference in the lenght, I can honestly say that this product did not give you the &amp;#34;spider lashes&amp;#34; look of many of other fibre mascaras.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are almost non existent, they are super short and very sparse.  </li>
            <li> They are long, flirty, and fabulous.  </li>
            <li> so I made sure I applied it starting from the middle of my lashes up.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly reccommend this product..</li>
            <li> So, after a couple months&#x27; of usage, I have a little more feedback.</li>
            <li> and I have full long eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> (I am right handed) and I open both.</li>
            <li> I wiggle the brush from left to right as I draw the brush upward.</li>
            <li> Do the same on the right eye.</li>
            <li> Do the same on the right eye.</li>
            <li> It does make your eyelashes very long and full</li>
            <li> Just beautiful long, thick lashes!</li>
            <li> This is my new signature mascara.</li>
            <li> Work quickly, the fibers won&#x27;t stick to dry mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very natural.</li>
            <li> (I am very sensitive).</li>
            <li> (complaint of many other brands) and easy to remove (I use baby oil).  </li>
            <li> and they look natural to boot!</li>
            <li> After several uses, I found it works pretty well at extending my lashes.</li>
            <li> cost is higher than regular mascara</li>
            <li> I only use it for special occasions, not daily wear.  </li>
            <li> The key is more transplanting gel and less fibers.</li>
            <li> I love the gel part of this two step mascara, but the 2nd step, the &amp;#34;fibre&amp;#34; shed during the day and leave an unslightly mess under &amp; around the eyes...</li>
            <li> but this turned out to be more like a regular mascara that flaked little fibers on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> Amazing product that I am addicted to.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes and was worried about irritation.  </li>
            <li> Dramatically lengthens lashes and the results look completely natural.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> Then they told me that I needed to contact the manufacturer directly.</li>
            <li> It does clump, if you use too much of either the 1st or 2nd step.</li>
            <li> it is not messy.</li>
            <li> AN FILLS NATURAL ...</li>
            <li> BY FAR YOUNIQUE</li>
            <li> bit of advice....if you don&#x27;t have a natural curl to your lashes, us a curler before applying,</li>
            <li> If you want a more feathery look, simply use less!</li>
            <li> Love this, Makes getting eyelash extension a think of the past!</li>
            <li> I wear contacts and have to be a little more careful about not letting the fibers get into my eyes  </li>
            <li> and you literally only take it off with just soap and water only when you&#x27;re ready.</li>
            <li> After about 3 hours, it flakes off into my eyes which causes major irritation as I wear contacts.</li>
            <li> You need a good coat of the t. gel, then some fibers (really important: NOT from the base of your lashes on the fibers, ONLY from mid lash up</li>
            <li> soft after application, not crunchy like they do after using regular mascara.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll</li>
            <li> I have barely there lashes, and this gives my lashes the appearance of an additional row.  </li>
            <li> I am IN LOVE and ADDICTED to this product.</li>
            <li> So sorry you couldn&#x27;t overcome your tragic application and enjoy this great product!</li>
            <li> I was hoping for more dramatic effect.</li>
            <li> although it adds a few minutes to my daily morning routine and with a little practice, I got better and faster with the application.  </li>
            <li> Take the extra few seconds to do a few more coats</li>
            <li> I also love the fact you have total control over how dramatic you want them to look.</li>
            <li> So I washed my face and waited about an hour for my lashes to dry out completely.</li>
            <li> I am a 60 year-old grandmother that had long, lush lashes in my younger years.  </li>
            <li> I found that if I use 5-10 swipes of the step 1 and then about the same for step 2 then wait about 5 mins to apply the step 1 again, seems to really cut down on the clumps.</li>
            <li> It really makes a mess of your lashes but don&#x27;t worry about that.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe the dramatic results It created - and so easy in literally 55 secs per eye.</li>
            <li> So sorry you couldn&#x27;t overcome your tragic application and enjoy this great product!&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, with just the mascara, come back to the left eye.</li>
            <li> Read everything I could about 3D eyelash extensions and chose one that used black fibers rather than white as well as dried quickly.  </li>
            <li> This could be a user error, I don&#x27;t know but its my only issue and its a minor issue.  </li>
            <li> I found it strange that someone left a 1 star review for fallen fibers.</li>
            <li> I found it strange that someone left a 1 star review for fallen fibers.</li>
            <li> but it does last a long time</li>
            <li> Starting with the mascara, (don&#x27;t pump the wand, it will dry out the mascara prematurely)</li>
            <li> spent applying several coats.</li>
            <li> be using this product as long as I can afford it.</li>
            <li> U have to have long lashes to begin with</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take me long to get the hang of applying it, and now can do it in a matter of minutes.</li>
            <li> I thought those days were long gone.  </li>
            <li> I have long, but blond eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> As my lashes slowly grew back, they were growing straight out due to the weight of the strip lashes</li>
            <li> Do watch the application videos (it&#x27;s the same technique as Younique and any other fibre lash mascara.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought other similar items but this has no competition.  </li>
            <li> and long!  </li>
            <li> The same effect as mascara in my opinion, Not worth the price nor time</li>
            <li> the stopper on the wand of the gel is loose and I need tweezers each time to pull it out from the handle.</li>
            <li> I actually have less mess with this than with regular mascara.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m older and my eyelashes were starting to get thin, but these make them thick and lush again....</li>
            <li> but they didn&#x27;t last long enough and having them redone would have cost a small fortune over time!  </li>
            <li> You get these tiny little fibers in and under your eyes.</li>
            <li> It does take a little practice, but by the third use, I was a pro.  </li>
            <li> For the last month I had been trying out at least 8 different mascaras per week from brand names to the ones in the drug stores.</li>
            <li> It even comes off with a few swipes of a makeup wipe, again I think easier than my regular mascara</li>
            <li> and I have tried a few different variations.</li>
            <li> : When I&#x27;m in the shower, I wet my face and wipe downward on my lashes with my index finger.</li>
            <li> : When I&#x27;m in the shower, I wet my face and wipe downward on my lashes with my index finger.</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how long and full my lashes look after only one application.</li>
            <li> I am in my 50&#x27;s and used to have long thick lashes when I was younger.  </li>
            <li> LONG LASHES  FILLS STIFF</li>
            <li> but I am careful to not pump it and only need to use one application- seriously</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product - and I&#x27;m hard to please!!</li>
            <li> I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because I find the fibers tend to fall off and create dark lines under my eyes sometimes.  </li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the hype nor the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a solution to thin, short eyelashes for a long time.  </li>
            <li> After daily use for a month, this tube is no longer overflowing with fibers so the pumping isn&#x27;t as necessary) and immediately begin the same type of application, starting at the lash base and wiggling as I move upward.</li>
            <li> Read the previous reviews for help with application.</li>
            <li> And, I&#x27;ve counted on it to add some glamour by wearing it to black tie events.</li>
            <li> Takes a little practice</li>
            <li> my eyelashes are long and with tons of volume!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I noticed little difference in using this product versus my everyday Rimmel mascara.  </li>
            <li> Biggest waste of money.</li>
            <li> SEE FEW FIBERS COMING OFF</li>
            <li> No residue left behind.</li>
            <li> Messy messy messy!</li>
            <li> Starting at the lash base, pull the wand upward in slow, steady strokes.</li>

            <li> No more smudges.  </li>
            <li> Sorry I spent the money on this product</li>
            <li> I am a supersensitive contact wearer with delicate allergies...</li>
            <li> I found this to be equivalent to clumpy, thick mascara.</li>
            <li> I will also put some lash domination (bare minerals) on after to thicken the base up</li>
            <li> I apply to my left eye from base to lash tips.</li>
            <li> No more painful curling.  </li>
            <li> I tried a similar product from another company and was very disappointed, not knowing what to expect.  </li>
            <li> I have to admit I was so skeptical because this would be like the 40th mascara I would be trying out.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s when things went completely wrong.</li>
            <li> I got the fibers in my eyes, which was very irritating.  </li>
            <li> My lashes have always been on the longer side, but this mascara makes me look like I&#x27;m wearing false lashes!!  </li>
            <li> Very fake looking.</li>
            <li> so bad that when I got to a mirror it was scary!</li>
            <li> I have to say I am totally disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Sorely disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I hate it.</li>
            <li> If your lashes clump, take the mascara wand and start and the base of the lashes again and pull upward.</li>
            <li> If your lashes clump, take the mascara wand and start and the base of the lashes again and pull upward.</li>
            <li> So I opened my eye to see the results and HOLY CRAP</li>
            <li> I HATED it.</li>
            <li> I would even combine them and I hated the way my lashes looked.</li>
            <li> but I was disappointed with the results !</li>
            <li> and it drives me absolutely insane when they are itchy/sore.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have very high expectations for this product, but I was wonderfully surprised at how effective it was. Very simple to apply and easy to remove.</li>
            <li> Just ok. For the price I don&#x27;t think it is that much better than mascara. Fake lashes look much better than this.</li>
            <li> Love this ! I get a lot of compliments on my eyelashes but took one star away cause fibers stick to eye lids after applied I use a q-tip to remove . Nice and long eye lashes .</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like this at all. I should have sent it back for a refund.</li>
            <li> Over hyped. It does not extend your lashes noticeably if at all. The same effect as mascara in my opinion, Not worth the price nor time spent applying several coats.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in a timely manner but I was disappointed with the results !</li>
            <li> I like the product.  Wish there were more applications in the fiber lashes.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do what it states.</li>
            <li> The very best mascara I have ever used.  Easy to apply, curls the lashes and they are longer and natural looking.</li>
            <li> cool product... helps extend and looks nice</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, I never wear false eyelashes. But this is a great alternative and gives a similar effect it&#x27;s very easy to use and I will definitely buy it again and keep using it.</li>
            <li> I love the gel part of this two step mascara, but the 2nd step, the &amp;#34;fibre&amp;#34; shed during the day and leave an unslightly mess under &amp; around the eyes...even after 20-30 strokes of step one &amp; step three &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; mascara. Messy messy messy!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok. Looks great when you just put it on especially after you curl your lashes, but after maybe about 4 hours then my lashes were no longer curled and and lots of fibres under my eyes even after I did the recommended brushing on of mascara afterwards. And they also didnt look as full. They kind of just clumped together. I&#x27;ve tried this now on multiple occasions and it just wont hold up all day. More like a night thing. But then dont sweat or touch your eyes. Gets everywhere.</li>
            <li> I am in my 50&#x27;s and used to have long thick lashes when I was younger.  I love this product.  They look like my younger lashes. Very natural.</li>
            <li> I love this!!  It really works.  I put the mascara on... then the fibers to the length I chose ... then the mascara again.  Its a quick easy way to get beautiful long lashes.  I will also put some lash domination (bare minerals) on after to thicken the base up</li>
            <li> I love the fullness this product givesxmy lashes!  I have sensitive eyes and was worried about irritation.  Works great, easy to apply and remove.</li>
            <li> After about 3 hours, it flakes off into my eyes which causes major irritation as I wear contacts. It does work great but the flaking is tough to handle.</li>
            <li> really irritated my eyes after a couple of days</li>
            <li> Cherry Blooms is fabulous.  My lashes haven&#x27;t looked so good in years.  My lashes&lt;br /&gt;feel soft after application, not crunchy like they do after using regular mascara.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be using this product as long as I can afford it.</li>
            <li> Great product - I&#x27;ve tried others but they aren&#x27;t as good quality.  Easy to apply and gentle on the eyes (I am very sensitive).</li>
            <li> Was satisfied with application &amp; results...looks natural &amp; no smudging</li>
            <li> This is great mascara, no smudges, stays put all day. Only problem is that sometimes my lashes look a tad spidery. Wish this added a tiny bit more volume. Not inexpensive but it has lasted for over 3 months now....</li>
            <li> I tried a similar product from another company and was very disappointed, not knowing what to expect.  I got the fibers in my eyes, which was very irritating.  The Cherry Blooms was easier to apply and I could actually see an improvement in my lashes.  I found out that the products do take some practice and getting used to but I was happy with the results.  I only use it for special occasions, not daily wear.  This product did not cause any irritation.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. Dramatically lengthens lashes and the results look completely natural.</li>
            <li> Sooooo much better than Younique!!! I have sensitive eyes and it drives me absolutely insane when they are itchy/sore. I tried Younique because several girlfriends were selling it. While it did amazing things with my lashes, I wanted to gouge my eyes out while wearing it. It made them SO itchy/watery/runny/screaming sore that two hours in I&#x27;d look like a raccoon. I was embarrassed on two occasions by it making my eyes water so bad that when I got to a mirror it was scary! Oh, and good luck getting Younique off. You need to sandblast your face.     I found Cherry Blooms online, I believe actually that a Facebook ad popped up, and the reviews seemed to say it was better for sensitive eyes.    I can tell you without a doubt that this product is a million times better!!! It doesn&#x27;t itch, water, make me tear up... AT ALL!!! In fact I think it feels better than my regular mascara. It is worth EVERY penny even though it&#x27;s more expensive, you won&#x27;t be disappointed. It even comes off with a few swipes of a makeup wipe, again I think easier than my regular mascara (Benefit They&#x27;re Real.)     One thing... Do watch the application videos (it&#x27;s the same technique as Younique and any other fibre lash mascara.) The key is more transplanting gel and less fibers. You need a good coat of the t. gel, then some fibers (really important: NOT from the base of your lashes on the fibers, ONLY from mid lash up or they can fall in your eyes and they&#x27;ll drive you nuts) then more t. gel. Take the extra few seconds to do a few more coats so you have more t. gel than fibers and you will love this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> I am the most pickiest person when it comes to Mascaras. I used to use the Younique 3D mascara, I would swear by it.  On or about June 15th 2015 they upgraded their version. I HATED it. The original version was so much better. For the last month I had been trying out at least 8 different mascaras per week from brand names to the ones in the drug stores. I would even combine them and I hated the way my lashes looked. I came across Cherry Blooms while I was researching fiber mascaras online. I have to admit I was so skeptical because this would be like the 40th mascara I would be trying out. I pretty much had just gave up. I LOVED IT. IT is better than the old version of Younique 3D. I have regular size lashes and with just 2 coats of this cherry blooms mascara my eyelashes are long and with tons of volume!!!!!! This is my new signature mascara. Its $60 but to me that does not matter!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!! Take it from the most pickiest person when it comes to mascaras.</li>
            <li> Not impressed. Regular mascara works better</li>
            <li> Younique 3D Fiber Lashes+ mascara is much better and made from safer ingredients.  I would suggest trying that instead.  I saw someone say you are supposed to apply the gel from the Cherry Blossoms product 20 times before the fibers?  Younique&#x27;s only takes 1 coat of gel, 1 coat of fiber and then 1 coat to seal the fibers on. If you want to try 3D let me know and I can point you in the right direction.</li>
            <li> It did not keep my lashes curled. It is not waterproof. It smudged and made my kids oily. I hate it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect! Easy to apply. Just follow the directions as listed. Works well even with contacts. LOVE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought other similar items but this has no competition.  It&#x27;s non-irritating, easy to use and you literally only take it off with just soap and water only when you&#x27;re ready. I forget I&#x27;m even wearing it.  My friends and family are purchasing it especially after they read the non-harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> I had been having eyelash extensions applied - to the tune of $100 a month. What a wonderful alternative.  I highly recommend this product - and I&#x27;m hard to please!!</li>
            <li> Starting flaking off about an hour after I put it on.  Used it several different times and got the same result every time</li>
            <li> Amazing! Read the previous reviews for help with application. So happy I bought this!    So, after a couple months&#x27; of usage, I have a little more feedback. First of all, if you use them as directed, you will absolutely have gorgeous, long lashes. If you want a more feathery look, simply use less! You can also create different lash looks with your application. I prefer a cat&#x27;s eye, so I use the fibers on the outer third of my lashes. Voila!    One HUGE and unexpected benefit to this mascara (which is a great mascara on its own) is that the beeswax is ridiculously beneficial for lash growth! My own lashes are now longer and curled up completely on their own. It&#x27;s like Miracle Grow for your lashes. Wonderful!</li>
            <li> Loving these fiber extensions. So simple to put on and remove and they look natural to boot! I also love the fact you have total control over how dramatic you want them to look. So glad I found Cherry blooms!</li>
            <li> Have to give this 5 stars.  Read everything I could about 3D eyelash extensions and chose one that used black fibers rather than white as well as dried quickly.  I have light colored and short lashes and on my first try, I was very impressed.  Easy to use, no fibers flaking during the day (complaint of many other brands) and easy to remove (I use baby oil).  I have tried all sorts of mascara but this one gives my lashes great length.  I can see why this has top marks.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for more dramatic effect. but this turned out to be more like a regular mascara that flaked little fibers on my cheeks. The only thing I really loved is it washed off so good no streaks! not sure I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I love cherry blooms!  I was nervous after reading some of the reviews but this works so great, I can&#x27;t believe how awesome it is.  My eyelashes are almost non existent, they are super short and very sparse.  When I used to put on regular mascara, it took a minimum of 5 min if not longer.  I had to put on so many coats in order to see anything.  It takes my no longer than 20 seconds to use cherry blooms.  I only use 1 coat and I have full long eyelashes.  I didn&#x27;t find that the wand had so many fibers on it and no fibers fell on my face.  I actually have less mess with this than with regular mascara.  AND cherry blooms are non-toxic, they have a score of 0 on the EWG website!  Get cherry blooms, you&#x27;re going to love it.</li>
            <li> I really like the product.  I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because I find the fibers tend to fall off and create dark lines under my eyes sometimes.  This could be a user error, I don&#x27;t know but its my only issue and its a minor issue.  Other than that, they are wonderful!</li>
            <li> It says it doesn&#x27;t flake but it does. You get these tiny little fibers in and under your eyes. It does make your eyelashes very long and full</li>
            <li> I am IN LOVE and ADDICTED to this product. I had major lash damage from poor quality lash extensions and worse quality glue. I was using strip lashes for over a year to conceal the damage. As my lashes slowly grew back, they were growing straight out due to the weight of the strip lashes so I had to use an eye lash curler every day. We all see the damage that eye lash curlers do, the evidence is on the silicone pad! A fellow salon owner (and my former boss) recommended this product to me. Her lashes looked incredible so of course I had to have it. There&#x27;s a bit of a learning curve with this stuff and I didn&#x27;t find any of the online tutorials helpful so hopefully this will be helpful to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Cherry Blooms for over a month and I have tried a few different variations. My lashes are FINALLY growing back rapidly. At first I thought I was getting better at the application but perhaps it&#x27;s getting better as my lashes improve. I also stopped curling my lashes, I found that the application is easier and the end result is better without it. Even my lashes that were growing straight out are cooperative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hold both tubes between my fingers with my left hand (I am right handed) and I open both. Starting with the mascara, (don&#x27;t pump the wand, it will dry out the mascara prematurely) I apply to my left eye from base to lash tips. I wiggle the brush from left to right as I draw the brush upward. I work from the outer lashes inward. Work quickly, the fibers won&#x27;t stick to dry mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as the left eye has ample mascara I remove the fiber wand (I do pump this otherwise too many fibers stick to the wand. After daily use for a month, this tube is no longer overflowing with fibers so the pumping isn&#x27;t as necessary) and immediately begin the same type of application, starting at the lash base and wiggling as I move upward. It really makes a mess of your lashes but don&#x27;t worry about that. Repeat these steps on the right eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, with just the mascara, come back to the left eye. Starting at the lash base, pull the wand upward in slow, steady strokes. Don&#x27;t wiggle. I use this final step to straighten out the fibers. If your lashes clump, take the mascara wand and start and the base of the lashes again and pull upward. Do the same on the right eye. You can do up to 4 applications but I have found that one application is plenty when I use this technique. I use the mascara to coat my lower lashes. It&#x27;s not recommended to apply fibers to lower lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removal is easy: When I&#x27;m in the shower, I wet my face and wipe downward on my lashes with my index finger. I love seeing all of the fibers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, you may find fallen fibers on your cheeks; I use a make-up sponge to lightly brush them away after my application is done, before I coat lower lashes. I found it strange that someone left a 1 star review for fallen fibers. Really? They&#x27;re not sticky and they&#x27;re so easy to clean up. So sorry you couldn&#x27;t overcome your tragic application and enjoy this great product!&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, with just the mascara, come back to the left eye.

            <li> Love this eyelash product......iit does everything  I&#x27;m  expecting from it.</li>
            <li> Cherry Blooms fibre lash mascara is amazing! I was shocked at how long and full my lashes look after only one application. I am so glad i found this product because now, i cant live without it!!</li>
            <li> It clumps and sheds. Definitely not worth the hype nor the price. You can get the same effect with waterproof mascara for $6.00!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.  Amazingly buildable without clumping.  Lasts all day long without flaking and best of all, EASY to remove.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Biggest waste of money. Second jar with fiber in it falls all over your face. Very fake looking. Sorry I spent the money on this product</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me at all. I was so excited as soon as I got it that I had to try it right away. So I washed my face and waited about an hour for my lashes to dry out completely. I applied the mascara first (about 20 applications as directed) then applied the fibers and OMG that&#x27;s when things went completely wrong. It says not to apply the fibers too close to the eye balls so I made sure I applied it starting from the middle of my lashes up. I kept my eyes barely opened while I was applying the fibers to make sure nothing fell in my eyes. I immediately noticed that the fibers were falling on my face so I stopped and applied the mascara again to seal the fibers. So I opened my eye to see the results and HOLY CRAP my eye lashes looked the same as if I had applied regular mascara and the fibers were falling in my eyes. They do not feel good, let me tell you! So I decided to re-apply to see if they would get any longer or fuller but NOPE, that didn&#x27;t work either.&lt;br /&gt;Right then and there I decided that this product was not for me. So I went back to the Amazon website and tried to return the item. The next day I woke up and my eyes blood red and swollen.  I got an email from the supplier saying that I need to follow the instructions on the back of the package in order to return the product. When I looked at the box all it said was 30 Day Money Back Guaranteed (or something like that). So I responded and told the supplier that there were no instructions on how to return the product. Then they told me that I needed to contact the manufacturer directly. HUH???? I have NEVER in my life had to contact a manufacturer when I buy a product that doesn&#x27;t work for me. So I contacted Amazon and they filed a claim for me which the supplier rejected. Luckily Amazon was kind of enough to refund me the money even though the supplier refused to honor their 30 day warranty. I will never buy from this supplier again nor do I recommend Cherry Blooms Brush on Fiber Eyelashes.</li>
            <li> After reading the advertisement about Cherry Blooms Eyelash Extensions I was anxious to order it. I have to say I am totally disappointed.  There is no extra length or thickness of any kind. To pay $38 would make one think it would be an amazing product. I&#x27;d rather pay $7 for Maybelline and get better results. Ladies, save your money!</li>
            <li> Amazing mascara.  I can have the eyelashes I&#x27;ve always wanted without any hassle.  Stays on all day.  I love it!!</li>
            <li> It is so good I want to be a reseller for this company!  You wouldn&#x27;t believe my before and after photos.</li>
            <li> Easy to Use.  Looks good but the stopper on the wand of the gel is loose and I need tweezers each time to pull it out from the handle.</li>
            <li> Very easily and quickly applied and lasts all day with absolutely zero flaking, running, or irritation.</li>
            <li> When I 1st used this product, I thought I&#x27;m returning it. After several uses, I found it works pretty well at extending my lashes. It does clump, if you use too much of either the 1st or 2nd step. I found that if I use 5-10 swipes of the step 1 and then about the same for step 2 then wait about 5 mins to apply the step 1 again, seems to really cut down on the clumps. It does come of easily in the shower. I now use this almost every day.</li>
            <li> Cherry Blooms is much better than regular mascara.  Takes a little practice but well worth the results.  I would recommend this to anyone who needs thicker, longer lashes.</li>
            <li> Got it thanks I think it is working.</li>
            <li> Will buy again it is not messy.</li>
            <li> They do not extend your lashes maybe make them fuller but not longer. U have to have long lashes to begin with</li>
            <li> Great product. Glad I got it.</li>
            <li> IS OK IF U LOOKING FOR LONG LASHES .... IS BETTER THAN REGULAR MASCARA HOW EVER THIS DURING THE DAY  U  MAE SEE FEW FIBERS COMING OFF ...I BOUGHT YOUNIQUE  3 WEEKS AGO AND  I GIVE CHERRY BLOOMS A TRY TO SEE IF WORK BETTER BUT NOTTT WAY YOUNIQUE IS 1000% BETTER GIVE U FULLER LASHES AN FILLS NATURAL ...WITH CHERRY  LONG LASHES  FILLS STIFF IS JUST OK  NOT IMPRESS AND FOR THE PRICE NO WAY .....I AM GOING TO TRY ANOTHER BRAND LOVE ALPHA TO SEE IF IS BETTER DAN YOUNIQUE BY FAR YOUNIQUE IS WORTH  TO BUY......</li>
            <li> Amazing product that I am addicted to. Not only does it increase the length and volume of my lashes, it does not smear or come off when I cry (yes, it has been tested several times) I am on my 3rd set and each one has lasted me about 2 months with daily use- but I am careful to not pump it and only need to use one application- seriously, it works so well 2 applications would make me look cartoonish. I cannot emphasize enough how great this is.  I am a woman in my 50&#x27;s but I think this is an ageless product.</li>
            <li> It is over rated. I have tried others cheaper and with better results</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Comes off very clean. No residue left behind. Tried a lot of mascaras and this one is by far the best. It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> Love this, Makes getting eyelash extension a think of the past!</li>
            <li> I love this product...cost is higher than regular mascara but it does last a long time and I have no irritation like I do with regular mascara.  My lashes look great.  Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first to get this product, but after watching some videos on how to apply it, decided to give it a try. It didn&#x27;t take me long to get the hang of applying it, and now can do it in a matter of minutes. The result is fantastic! I&#x27;m older and my eyelashes were starting to get thin, but these make them thick and lush again....and long!  They&#x27;re easy to remove too. I just wash them off in the shower, or use some cheap eye makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I will never be without this product!&lt;br /&gt;One bit of advice....if you don&#x27;t have a natural curl to your lashes, us a curler before applying, just like you would do for regular mascara.</li>
            <li> Wonderul and amazing product!!!</li>
            <li> This is THE best eyelash extension and thickener wrapped into a complete long wearing, non-flaking mascara that I have ever used. I&#x27;ve been hooked on Cherry Blooms from the first time I wore it about a year ago. I couldn&#x27;t believe the dramatic results It created - and so easy in literally 55 secs per eye. :) It&#x27;s been worn by me to the gym on my 3 hour workout days with no smearing or flaking! And, I&#x27;ve counted on it to add some glamour by wearing it to black tie events. I use Cherry Blooms as my every day mascara with only one application. I have never had a problem with it flaking into my eyes... I am a supersensitive contact wearer with delicate allergies... Never one issue with Cherry Blooms.  Just beautiful long, thick lashes! I wish I could give it 6 stars!!</li>
            <li> Love love love Cherry Blooms!!  It took a bit of practice, I admit - but the effort was SO WORTH IT!  Using this product as part of my daily makeup, and I&#x27;ve received many compliments on the length and fullness of my lashes.</li>
            <li> This is the best product ever. My lashes look great and feels light weight and comfortable. When its time to take them off they come off so easily with warm water. Also, this company has awesome customer service. I highly reccommend this product..</li>
            <li> My daughter is a stylist and she turned me on to this amazing product.  I am a 60 year-old grandmother that had long, lush lashes in my younger years.  I thought those days were long gone.  I have never found a product (have tried them all from Maybelline to Chanel and everything in between) do what this product does.  I have 19 year-old lashes again!  They are long, flirty, and fabulous.  One application does it and you are hooked.  I have also noticed an improvement in my own lashes.  No more painful curling.  No more smudges.  No melting on hot days. Easy to remove, when you want to, in the shower with warm water.  The other wonderful thing is that you wake up with fabulous lashes - no overnight smearing all over the pillow - just pretty eyes in the morning.  I never want to be out of this product.  This should be on Subscribe and Save!</li>
            <li> My new favorite! Thanks for the speedy shipping.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy just follow directions.  Coming off not so great pretty messy.</li>
            <li> As easy to put on as regular mascara.  It definitely makes your lashes appear longer.  I love it</li>
            <li> Flaky but otherwise I love this product</li>
            <li> It does take a little practice, but by the third use, I was a pro.  I wear contact lenses, it does not irritate, and its easy to remove at end of day.  Remember to coat lashes with the first product to set the fibers.  I have no problem with flaking.  I have barely there lashes, and this gives my lashes the appearance of an additional row.  Am curious to find out how many weeks product lasts.</li>
            <li> Love them - they are easy to use and easy to remove and they really look natural!!</li>
            <li> I keep thinking the people that are giving these 5 stars are using a different product. I found this to be equivalent to clumpy, thick mascara. On a more positive note, they did seem to last longer than most mascara I wore. But I won&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
            <li> Still on the fence. .</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!!  My lashes have always been on the longer side, but this mascara makes me look like I&#x27;m wearing false lashes!!  I love it more than ANY other fiber mascara out there!  The fibers don&#x27;t fall in my eyes, they stick in the mascara to lengthen and thicken them.  I hope they keep making this product.  Its the best out there and I&#x27;ve tried them &amp;#34;all&amp;#34; :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a solution to thin, short eyelashes for a long time.  I&#x27;ve tried lots and lots of mascaras and several of the liquid growth products that are on the market.  The only thing I really liked the look of was individual eyelash extensions but they didn&#x27;t last long enough and having them redone would have cost a small fortune over time!  I&#x27;d about given up when I came across this product quite accidently.  It is easy to apply although it adds a few minutes to my daily morning routine and with a little practice, I got better and faster with the application.  I wear contacts and have to be a little more careful about not letting the fibers get into my eyes  I love the look although no one mentioned any noticeable difference except one friend that I told about it.  But I noticed and I felt better.  I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I have long, but blond eyelashes.  I noticed little difference in using this product versus my everyday Rimmel mascara.  Dissappointed.  Although there was little difference in the lenght, I can honestly say that this product did not give you the &amp;#34;spider lashes&amp;#34; look of many of other fibre mascaras.</li>
            <li> Sorely disappointed in this product. I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re any eyelash extensions in the one container.</li>
