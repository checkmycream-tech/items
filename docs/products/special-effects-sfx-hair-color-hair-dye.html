            <li>This is the best product to use if you&#x27;re looking for any awesome shade of funky color.</li>
            <li>10 years ago I&#x27;m so happy to see!</li>
            <li>Great!</li>
            <li>One of the best colors I have ever used!</li>
            <li>lol  </li>
            <li>It looked great the 1st day but now is just a drab, gray color.</li>
            <li>It is great.</li>
            <li>Was so happy with the result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Virgin Rose mix well with either of the blues to create beautiful violet colours and pinkish purples.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was so bright that it looked like artificial/synthetic extensions!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Enjoy your great color, hope this helps!</li>
            <li>Special Effects dyes are wonderful.</li>
            <li>This color has brought me many interesting conversations with all sorts of people, but the best ones were always from the elderly!</li>
            <li>Virgin Rose starts out a bright magenta color that almost looks purple in some lighting.</li>
            <li>Love this brand; love their colors!!</li>
            <li>Most important HAVE FUN!!!!!</li>
            <li>Keep clorox handy for your tub.</li>
            <li>Virgin Rose</li>
            <li>and she smiled and said,</li>
            <li>The color is nice however it does not have the staying power of the darker blues.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used hair dye for 15 years, and this product is decent, but not the best for its price.</li>
            <li>I love Special Effects and had great luck getting my hair</li>
            <li>More beautiful and unexpected colour in the world is always a good thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a really great hairdye; it&#x27;s long-lasting (for what it is: no semipermanent stays around a good while), the colors are rich and have a good fade (they don&#x27;t tend to be murky and bland while fading out, just softer and muted), and my hair feels great and is shiny and healthy-looking post-process.</li>
            <li>Use color safe shampoo and conditioners to help maintain the color.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Use generous amounts of color &amp; be sure to comb through.</li>
            <li>Longer is Better.</li>
            <li>Even with all the precautions I took (well-ventilated room, making sure bleached hair was on top of head as it processed etc.)</li>
            <li>It made me feel more myself than I have in years.</li>
            <li>I love these SE dyes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Manic panic is better .</li>
            <li>I wish I&#x27;d stuck with blues first up, then I&#x27;d be free to do more blues, or purples or greens over the top any time I liked, or all three.</li>
            <li>I wish I&#x27;d stuck with blues first up, then I&#x27;d be free to do more blues, or purples or greens over the top any time I liked, or all three.</li>
            <li>Love special effects.</li>
            <li>The colours are great and you can buy a few and mix your own even better unique colours, plus the formula doesn&#x27;t harm your hair or smell toxic and give you a headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You divide hair into the sections you want and then wrap up the bits of hair separately in foil, held secure with a pin, when you&#x27;ve put the dye on.</li>
            <li>When I rinsed it out my hair was a tie dye of blond and light purple.</li>
            <li>Color is gorgeous and has major staying power.</li>
            <li>This product is simply a cheap knockoff of legitimate Special Effects.</li>
            <li>My hair was bleached to white so the color was amazing!.</li>
            <li>have significant issues with chemical sensitivities (as part of the severe neurological disease I have called Myalgic Encephalomyelitis - see the HFME site for info on it, if you want to).</li>
            <li>have significant issues with chemical sensitivities (as part of the severe neurological disease I have called Myalgic Encephalomyelitis - see the HFME site for info on it, if you want to).</li>
            <li>and then the intense in-your-face is-that-even-your-real-hair blue started to mellow out to a nice bright blue.&lt;br /&gt;After 2-4 weeks it starts fading.</li>
            <li>and I was surprised to find it looks even better as it fades!</li>
            <li>I have been dying my hair &amp;#34;abnormal&amp;#34; colors for 13 years, and have exclusively used SPECIAL EFFECTS hair dye for 12.</li>
            <li>To get the longest life out of your SFX color, use a sulfate-free shampoo that is specially formulated for color care.</li>
            <li>Word to the wise, though: If you plan to dye your hair with Special Effects and do periodic upkeep on the color, purchase several bottles at once.</li>
            <li>Do not cleanse hair for at least 24 hours (48 is best if you can stand it) after processing.</li>
            <li>I actually love how it faded out better than the original blue.</li>
            <li>Blue Haired Freak is the most lovely colour</li>
            <li>super brightness lasted about a week</li>
            <li>so the colour has sunk right into the hair, but I&#x27;d love a magic instant SE dye removal product!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color is vibrant and does not fade easily.</li>
            <li>Gonna mix it up and get Atomic Pink next! :D</li>
            <li>I love how bright and light it is compared to the deep fresh, full-strength and quite dark</li>
            <li>Good dye if you are looking for something with extreme staying power.</li>
            <li>only problem...or less than perfect thing...</li>
            <li>It is the best, and if you pre-lighten, and take special care when washing (I &amp;#34;un-poo&amp;#34; meaning no shampoo, I use certain conditioners to cleanse hair or use WEN when I can afford it), your color will last indefinitely with little fade-out.</li>
            <li>The result was an amazing INTENSE royal cobalt blue.</li>
            <li>My hair is very light blonde, but doesn&#x27;t take dye</li>
            <li>Making my hair all pretty colours was my way of celebrating the fact that finally my health is slowlyimproving and that maybe soon my life will be about more than just basic survival...and have a bit more fun and life and colour in it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Directions say for deeper color results, bleach hair first.</li>
            <li>Should say...for any color results bleach hair first.</li>
            <li>My favorite blue hair dye.</li>
            <li>Pretty.</li>
            <li>ONLY BLEACH ROOTS if you are touching up.</li>
            <li>My 5 bottles will last me many years probably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I can re-dye most of it blue.</li>
            <li>I might even have a go at mixing the dye with conditioner when I put some on next to try and get a more pastel colour (as I have seen people demonstrate well on some online videos).</li>
            <li>Then leave it for 1 - 2 hours or more depending on how deep you want the colours.</li>
            <li>I think it looks better not going all the way to the roots, personally.</li>
            <li>Plus doing it this way avoids all regrowth issues and means I only will have to re-bleach every 4 months or more.</li>

            <li>every 2ish weeks cause of how fast my hair grows!</li>
            <li>One other thing I have noticed is that people love to ask about the color!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sonic Green and Blue Haired Freak mixed together make the most beautiful aqua and turquoise colour.</li>
            <li>Just the other day at the grocery store, I had an old lady walk up to me just to say that she loved my pink hair and had always wanted to try bright colors when she was young, but that it wasn&#x27;t allowed.</li>
            <li>then more Virgin Rose and finally a chunk of Sonic Green.</li>
            <li>Lovely!&lt;br /&gt;Eventually (after ~2 months) it starts fading out completely, becoming the original silvery-ashy bleached blonde starting from the tips.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It came out an absolute disaster</li>
            <li>Color doesn&#x27;t hold very well.  </li>
            <li>Or Blue Haired Freak in the middle gradually turning into a violet colour on the edges...and all in bright soft pastel tones.</li>
            <li>As it is this bottle means you have to work out how muchyou&#x27;ll need ahead of time and squirt that amount onto something ready to use, instead of just dipping your brush in a pot as you go - which is so much easier.</li>
            <li>The pink is more limiting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t help me cope with every day that much</li>
            <li>Bassett, HFMEyou&#x27;ll need ahead of time and squirt that amount onto something ready to use, instead of just dipping your brush in a pot as you go - which is so much easier.</li>
            <li>The pink is more limiting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t help me cope with every day that much</li>
            <li>I was very pleased.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I got a sort of ombre effect going on with light teal, sky blue and lavender.</li>
            <li>After this, the color doesn&#x27;t really change at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now about a month later the fun of doing my first recent dye job has faded though I have some more ambitious ideas and am trying to wash out the colours now as much as possible</li>
            <li>Making my hair all pretty colours was my way of celebrating the fact that finally my health is slowly improving and that maybe soon my life will be about more than just basic survival...and have a bit more fun and life and colour in it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fantastic color as long as it&#x27;s applied to pre-bleached hair.</li>
            <li>The seller was fast and efficient but the product itself kind of sucks.</li>
            <li>advice if you like to change things around is to maybe avoid the pinks, as they are far more colourfast than some of the other colours.</li>

            <li>but now and then when I see a glimpse of blue or another colour in my hair&#x27;s reflection it makes me smile...</li>

            <li>Make sure your hair is COMPLETELY DRY with hair dryer to really open the hair cuticle.</li>
            <li>I bought the Blue Haired Freak and right when it came in the mail I applied it to my hair.</li>
            <li>colors are pretty cool, but they dont last long as all</li>
            <li>started off doing my long fringe (about 1/4 of my head) in Virgin Rose on the left, then Blue Haired Freak and</li>
            <li>But other than that its worth it !</li>
            <li>Pretty low maintenance, which is what I was after.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pretty low maintenance, which is what I was after.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seems exspensive at first but one tiny bottle lasts FOREVER!</li>
            <li>: Any shade of blue is going to require more maintenance than other colors.</li>
            <li>In the well-bleached parts, it fades to a lighter blue, then a really pretty pastel lavender.</li>
            <li>But when the magenta color does start to \\&quot;fade\\&quot; it changes to a color very close to freshly dyed Atomic Pink!</li>
            <li>I used Special Effects Blue Haired Freak on pre-bleached/toned hair (peekaboo highlights) and left it on for 15-30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Even when hair was freshly dyed back then it was nowhere near as VIBRANT and deeply chromatic as any of the SE dyes are.</li>
            <li>The folks who make it only do so a couple times a year, so you will have to go on a hunt for it at certain times if you need it year-round.</li>
            <li>Just wish that when I made a large purchase, they would not come individually wrapped in plastic.</li>
            <li>Buy a brand that comes complete with dye, bleach, gloves.</li>
            <li>I had my hair professionally bleached, but did the dying at home.</li>
            <li>The rest of my hair is natural brown coloured.</li>
            <li>The rest of my hair is natural brown coloured.</li>
            <li>I used excess coloring and left it on for longer when it wasn&#x27;t really changing my (pre bleached) hairs color.</li>
            <li>so I have to bleach my roots but the rest of my hair takes dye pretty well, since it&#x27;s long from being virgin hair.</li>
            <li>If you wash your hair a lot, it will fade the color, but there is more than enough in the bottle for a few gos.</li>
            <li>The pink in particular is very stubborn to get out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this product to add more blue to my blue black hair.</li>
            <li>I dye every two to three months and Special Effects doesn&#x27;t destroy my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was really amazed at how long and well</li>
            <li>(I can&#x27;t stand up long so that really annoys me.)</li>
            <li>(I can&#x27;t stand up long so that really annoys me.)</li>
            <li>Or pink becoming purple, then turning into blue and then on the right a big chunk of green....</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t re-applied at all and the color is still hot pink after 4 months!</li>
            <li>If you put old towels down in the bathroom and wear an old shirt when you dye, and gloves, clean-up isn&#x27;t very hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Colourful hair dyes have come so far since I last</li>
            <li>only critique of the product is that a jar with a screw off lid would be far easier to use.</li>
            <li>&gt;:o)</li>
            <li>This stuff barely dyed my well-bleached hair and faded in two days.</li>
            <li>thinking Blue Haired Freak in the middle with Blue Haired Freak mixed with Sonic Green on either side...in a nice graduation from one to the other.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not willing to bleach a six-year-old&#x27;s hair, and this came highly recommended as a dye that wouldn&#x27;t require a preliminary bleach job if your natural hair color was blonde/dirty blonde.</li>
            <li>want to get rid of as much of the pink as possible</li>
            <li>you want to go colourful just for the school holidays, SE pinks are not a good idea, unless you are okay with dyeing hair dark brown or black right before school</li>
            <li>I left it on my hair for about 2-3 hours, like I normally do, and it was pretty light in color, and only lasted about 10 washes before it looked so bad</li>

            <li> The color is vibrant and does not fade easily.</li>
            <li> Gonna mix it up and get Atomic Pink next! :D</li>
            <li> I love how bright and light it is compared to the deep fresh, full-strength and quite dark</li>
            <li> Good dye if you are looking for something with extreme staying power.</li>
            <li> only problem...or less than perfect thing...</li>
            <li> It is the best, and if you pre-lighten, and take special care when washing (I &amp;#34;un-poo&amp;#34; meaning no shampoo, I use certain conditioners to cleanse hair or use WEN when I can afford it), your color will last indefinitely with little fade-out.</li>
            <li> The result was an amazing INTENSE royal cobalt blue.</li>
            <li> My hair is very light blonde, but doesn&#x27;t take dye</li>
            <li> Making my hair all pretty colours was my way of celebrating the fact that finally my health is slowlyimproving and that maybe soon my life will be about more than just basic survival...and have a bit more fun and life and colour in it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Directions say for deeper color results, bleach hair first.</li>
            <li> Should say...for any color results bleach hair first.</li>
            <li> My favorite blue hair dye.</li>
            <li> Pretty.</li>
            <li> ONLY BLEACH ROOTS if you are touching up.</li>
            <li> My 5 bottles will last me many years probably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I can re-dye most of it blue.</li>
            <li> I might even have a go at mixing the dye with conditioner when I put some on next to try and get a more pastel colour (as I have seen people demonstrate well on some online videos).</li>
            <li> Then leave it for 1 - 2 hours or more depending on how deep you want the colours.</li>
            <li> I think it looks better not going all the way to the roots, personally.</li>
            <li> Plus doing it this way avoids all regrowth issues and means I only will have to re-bleach every 4 months or more.</li>

            <li> every 2ish weeks cause of how fast my hair grows!</li>
            <li> One other thing I have noticed is that people love to ask about the color!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sonic Green and Blue Haired Freak mixed together make the most beautiful aqua and turquoise colour.</li>
            <li> Just the other day at the grocery store, I had an old lady walk up to me just to say that she loved my pink hair and had always wanted to try bright colors when she was young, but that it wasn&#x27;t allowed.</li>
            <li> then more Virgin Rose and finally a chunk of Sonic Green.</li>
            <li> Lovely!&lt;br /&gt;Eventually (after ~2 months) it starts fading out completely, becoming the original silvery-ashy bleached blonde starting from the tips.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It came out an absolute disaster</li>
            <li> Color doesn&#x27;t hold very well.  </li>
            <li> Or Blue Haired Freak in the middle gradually turning into a violet colour on the edges...and all in bright soft pastel tones.</li>
            <li> As it is this bottle means you have to work out how muchyou&#x27;ll need ahead of time and squirt that amount onto something ready to use, instead of just dipping your brush in a pot as you go - which is so much easier.</li>
            <li> The pink is more limiting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t help me cope with every day that much</li>
            <li> Bassett, HFMEyou&#x27;ll need ahead of time and squirt that amount onto something ready to use, instead of just dipping your brush in a pot as you go - which is so much easier.</li>

            <li> I was very pleased.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I got a sort of ombre effect going on with light teal, sky blue and lavender.</li>
            <li> After this, the color doesn&#x27;t really change at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now about a month later the fun of doing my first recent dye job has faded though I have some more ambitious ideas and am trying to wash out the colours now as much as possible</li>

            <li> Fantastic color as long as it&#x27;s applied to pre-bleached hair.</li>
            <li> The seller was fast and efficient but the product itself kind of sucks.</li>
            <li> advice if you like to change things around is to maybe avoid the pinks, as they are far more colourfast than some of the other colours.</li>

            <li> I bought the Blue Haired Freak and right when it came in the mail I applied it to my hair.</li>
            <li> colors are pretty cool, but they dont last long as all</li>
            <li> started off doing my long fringe (about 1/4 of my head) in Virgin Rose on the left, then Blue Haired Freak and</li>
            <li> But other than that its worth it !</li>
            <li> Pretty low maintenance, which is what I was after.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pretty low maintenance, which is what I was after.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seems exspensive at first but one tiny bottle lasts FOREVER!</li>
            <li> : Any shade of blue is going to require more maintenance than other colors.</li>
            <li> In the well-bleached parts, it fades to a lighter blue, then a really pretty pastel lavender.</li>
            <li> But when the magenta color does start to \\&quot;fade\\&quot; it changes to a color very close to freshly dyed Atomic Pink!</li>
            <li> I used Special Effects Blue Haired Freak on pre-bleached/toned hair (peekaboo highlights) and left it on for 15-30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Even when hair was freshly dyed back then it was nowhere near as VIBRANT and deeply chromatic as any of the SE dyes are.</li>
            <li> The folks who make it only do so a couple times a year, so you will have to go on a hunt for it at certain times if you need it year-round.</li>
            <li> Just wish that when I made a large purchase, they would not come individually wrapped in plastic.</li>
            <li> Buy a brand that comes complete with dye, bleach, gloves.</li>
            <li> I had my hair professionally bleached, but did the dying at home.</li>
            <li> The rest of my hair is natural brown coloured.</li>
            <li> The rest of my hair is natural brown coloured.</li>
            <li> I used excess coloring and left it on for longer when it wasn&#x27;t really changing my (pre bleached) hairs color.</li>
            <li> so I have to bleach my roots but the rest of my hair takes dye pretty well, since it&#x27;s long from being virgin hair.</li>
            <li> If you wash your hair a lot, it will fade the color, but there is more than enough in the bottle for a few gos.</li>
            <li> The pink in particular is very stubborn to get out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this product to add more blue to my blue black hair.</li>
            <li> I dye every two to three months and Special Effects doesn&#x27;t destroy my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was really amazed at how long and well</li>
            <li> (I can&#x27;t stand up long so that really annoys me.)</li>
            <li> (I can&#x27;t stand up long so that really annoys me.)</li>
            <li> Or pink becoming purple, then turning into blue and then on the right a big chunk of green....</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t re-applied at all and the color is still hot pink after 4 months!</li>
            <li> If you put old towels down in the bathroom and wear an old shirt when you dye, and gloves, clean-up isn&#x27;t very hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Colourful hair dyes have come so far since I last</li>
            <li> only critique of the product is that a jar with a screw off lid would be far easier to use.</li>
            <li> &gt;:o)</li>
            <li> This stuff barely dyed my well-bleached hair and faded in two days.</li>
            <li> thinking Blue Haired Freak in the middle with Blue Haired Freak mixed with Sonic Green on either side...in a nice graduation from one to the other.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not willing to bleach a six-year-old&#x27;s hair, and this came highly recommended as a dye that wouldn&#x27;t require a preliminary bleach job if your natural hair color was blonde/dirty blonde.</li>
            <li> want to get rid of as much of the pink as possible</li>
            <li> you want to go colourful just for the school holidays, SE pinks are not a good idea, unless you are okay with dyeing hair dark brown or black right before school</li>
            <li> I left it on my hair for about 2-3 hours, like I normally do, and it was pretty light in color, and only lasted about 10 washes before it looked so bad</li>
            <li> Blue Haired Freak is a little brighter and less violet-tinged than my normal electric blue mixed with blue velvet, but i really like the &amp;#34;true blue&amp;#34; color.</li>
            <li> I actually expected it to bleed out a lot naturally, but for some reason, for me it only bled out a very tiny bit the first shampoo afterwards and after that did not bleed out, at least visibly.</li>
            <li> I feel it is still well-worth it though, seeing as how it&#x27;ll last a really long time, and the actual dyes are so non-toxic too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> It is messy and color washes out for a long time in shower, but the color is still just as vibrant in my hair as when I put it in.</li>
            <li> They are *very* long lasting if you apply them to bleached hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was surprised how little dye I had to use too.</li>
            <li> My hair has been pink for about a year, and I dyed it blue using a punky colour dye.</li>
            <li> I have used this about 5x since it lasts SO LONG!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend going colourful, in a big way or even only in a small section of hair, to anyone whose job allows it... and especially anyone that is ill or for other reasons just needs or wants a bit of fun and excessive colourfulness.</li>

            <li> My daughter had the tips of her dark brown hair bleached out prior to using this color &amp; the color washed out in under a week.</li>
            <li> Made my hair look black and not blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However will try again soon, Might not have lightened my hair enough.</li>
            <li> and it MAYBE lightened by a half shade, looks just about the same.</li>
            <li> His hair doesn&#x27;t look blue at all, just a slightly darker brown.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to go a little lighter on my shade of blue, this is the lightest offered.</li>
            <li> The dye turned my hair a hideous black/blue color, it was nothing like I expected.</li>
            <li> I use ION stain remover for what i get on my skin accidentally, but bar soap and elbow grease work too, just be careful of your skin.</li>
            <li> Also, don&#x27;t condition your hair after pre-lightening (I use ION powder lightener with vol 30 1:1 to get to pale blond from medium-dark brunette, takes about 15 min for my hair texture, everyone is different).</li>
            <li> People often think my hair is fake because of how vibrant the blue is.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t stay in well at all, even after bleaching my hair to near white and only rinsing with cold water.</li>
            <li> It fades faster than any other brand I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> other dyes.</li>
            <li> in short, not very good.</li>
            <li> Even though I followed all of the instructions (left the dye on for 20 minutes), it barely altered his dirty blonde hair.  </li>

            <li> After a few weeks it had faded pretty badly, and I got this dye because I thought from other reviews on this that it would last a lot longer then</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used SFX haircolor since I was 15 and it never let me down.  </li>

            <li> In the not-as-well-bleached parts (like a little bit at roots, for ex), it fades to a blueish teal and then a pastel teal.</li>
            <li> This is just a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> It washes out in one shampoo and leaves my hair with a green, algae-like color.</li>
            <li> Just save yourself the trouble and stock up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product just out of plain fear that it would end up like mine.</li>
            <li> Very very bad dye , it dyed over as a grey blue which was NOT the color expected, and it faded out to grey.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(I know it is impossible, as these dyes stain the hair really</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed due to the fact that I had use two bottles of the dye, which is over $40, not even counting the professional bleaching I had done prior.</li>
            <li> This felt like a small way of reclaiming my non-ill personality a bit too.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this brand; love their colors!!</li>
            <li> Followed directions and there was no color change in my hair at all.  Directions say for deeper color results, bleach hair first. Should say...for any color results bleach hair first. Buy a brand that comes complete with dye, bleach, gloves. This is just a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> It washes out in one shampoo and leaves my hair with a green, algae-like color.</li>
            <li> I love Special Effects and had great luck getting my hair the color I wanted. If you wash your hair a lot, it will fade the color, but there is more than enough in the bottle for a few gos.</li>
            <li> colors are pretty cool, but they dont last long as all</li>
            <li> Fantastic color as long as it&#x27;s applied to pre-bleached hair. Use color safe shampoo and conditioners to help maintain the color.</li>
            <li> Product came on time, so this has nothing to do with the seller themselves - just the actual product. The dye turned my hair a hideous black/blue color, it was nothing like I expected. I have dyed my hair since I was 12, I would say well over 50 times and have never had a problem. I had my hair professionally bleached, but did the dying at home. It came out an absolute disaster and I will be buying black hair dye to cover it up. I was very disappointed due to the fact that I had use two bottles of the dye, which is over $40, not even counting the professional bleaching I had done prior. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product just out of plain fear that it would end up like mine. UGH.</li>
            <li> I love this product. The color is vibrant and does not fade easily.</li>
            <li> Color doesn&#x27;t hold very well.  I&#x27;ve used hair dye for 15 years, and this product is decent, but not the best for its price.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to add more blue to my blue black hair. It helps but I Def need to get a darker shade next time. This is the best product to use if you&#x27;re looking for any awesome shade of funky color. It last the longest. Beats Manic Panics Butt lol  I&#x27;ve used SFX haircolor since I was 15 and it never let me down.  I&#x27;ve dyed my hair lots of funky colors off and on for years now.</li>
            <li> I bought the Blue Haired Freak and right when it came in the mail I applied it to my hair. My hair was bleached to white so the color was amazing!. I never stop getting compliments at my job. People often think my hair is fake because of how vibrant the blue is. What i didn&#x27;t like was that I had to redo it like every once a week. But other than that its worth it !</li>
            <li> Made my hair look black and not blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However will try again soon, Might not have lightened my hair enough.</li>
            <li> My favorite blue hair dye. Love special effects. And when the blue wears off it turns into purple. A lavender color. Pretty. Wish I could post a pic of it.</li>
            <li> I have been dying my hair &amp;#34;abnormal&amp;#34; colors for 13 years, and have exclusively used SPECIAL EFFECTS hair dye for 12. It is the best, and if you pre-lighten, and take special care when washing (I &amp;#34;un-poo&amp;#34; meaning no shampoo, I use certain conditioners to cleanse hair or use WEN when I can afford it), your color will last indefinitely with little fade-out. Blue Haired Freak is a little brighter and less violet-tinged than my normal electric blue mixed with blue velvet, but i really like the &amp;#34;true blue&amp;#34; color. Dyed 3 weeks ago and it MAYBE lightened by a half shade, looks just about the same. But again, how you cleanse your hair makes ALL the difference, and I also use ION COLOR BRILLIANCE After Color Treatment, then After Color Sealer to lock in my color after processing. Also, don&#x27;t condition your hair after pre-lightening (I use ION powder lightener with vol 30 1:1 to get to pale blond from medium-dark brunette, takes about 15 min for my hair texture, everyone is different). This is the only time i use a &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; shampoo to get the bleach out. Make sure your hair is COMPLETELY DRY with hair dryer to really open the hair cuticle. This lets the maximum amout of color to penetrate the hair shaft. ONLY BLEACH ROOTS if you are touching up. Use generous amounts of color &amp; be sure to comb through. I cover my colored sections with hair foil &amp; pin it up. Leave on at least 45 min. preferably with some heat. Longer is Better. Do not cleanse hair for at least 24 hours (48 is best if you can stand it) after processing. Enjoy your great color, hope this helps! Oh, and if you didnt already know, COVER EVERYTHING you dont want dyed. It will get EVERYWHERE! DONT FORGET GLOVES &amp; SKIN PROTECTION! Keep clorox handy for your tub. I use ION stain remover for what i get on my skin accidentally, but bar soap and elbow grease work too, just be careful of your skin. Most important HAVE FUN!!!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter had the tips of her dark brown hair bleached out prior to using this color &amp; the color washed out in under a week. And it was done in a salon!! It looked great the 1st day but now is just a drab, gray color. And she&#x27;s only 17... She bought some Manic Panic and we&#x27;re going to give it a try this weekend. I would not recommend this color.</li>
            <li> Special Effects dyes are wonderful. The colours are great and you can buy a few and mix your own even better unique colours, plus the formula doesn&#x27;t harm your hair or smell toxic and give you a headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Sonic Green&lt;br /&gt;* Blue Velvet&lt;br /&gt;* Blue Haired Freak&lt;br /&gt;* Virgin Rose&lt;br /&gt;* Burgundy Wine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem...or less than perfect thing...I am finding with them is that they are taking agggges to wash out. They are *very* long lasting if you apply them to bleached hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I know it is impossible, as these dyes stain the hair really so the colour has sunk right into the hair, but I&#x27;d love a magic instant SE dye removal product!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The long-lastingness of the dyes is not a problem at all if you have one colour or pattern of colours that you want to keep for months and months. It is great. I was really amazed at how long and well the colour lasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colourful hair dyes have come so far since I last did them over 10 years ago I&#x27;m so happy to see! The colour used to fade as soon as you looked at it. Even when hair was freshly dyed back then it was nowhere near as VIBRANT and deeply chromatic as any of the SE dyes are. I was surprised how little dye I had to use too. My 5 bottles will last me many years probably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sonic Green and Blue Haired Freak mixed together make the most beautiful aqua and turquoise colour. Burgundy Wine or Virgin Rose mix well with either of the blues to create beautiful violet colours and pinkish purples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started off doing my long fringe (about 1/4 of my head) in Virgin Rose on the left, then Blue Haired Freak and then more Virgin Rose and finally a chunk of Sonic Green. Was so happy with the result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now about a month later the fun of doing my first recent dye job has faded though I have some more ambitious ideas and am trying to wash out the colours now as much as possible so I can start with an almost blank canvas. It is hard going though. I have washed my hair about a dozen times this week with harsh dishwashing detergent and it still hasn&#x27;t faded all that much even though I&#x27;ve left the soap on for over an hour. The pink in particular is very stubborn to get out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(If you want to go colourful just for the school holidays, SE pinks are not a good idea, unless you are okay with dyeing hair dark brown or black right before school starts.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to get rid of as much of the pink as possible so I can re-dye most of it blue. Blue Haired Freak is the most lovely colour and I was surprised to find it looks even better as it fades! I might even have a go at mixing the dye with conditioner when I put some on next to try and get a more pastel colour (as I have seen people demonstrate well on some online videos). I love how bright and light it is compared to the deep fresh, full-strength and quite dark colours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thinking Blue Haired Freak in the middle with Blue Haired Freak mixed with Sonic Green on either side...in a nice graduation from one to the other. Or Blue Haired Freak in the middle gradually turning into a violet colour on the edges...and all in bright soft pastel tones. A bit like Dame Edna&#x27;s hair but without the perm! Or pink becoming purple, then turning into blue and then on the right a big chunk of green....like a little colour chart...lovely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All you need to do bits of hair different colours is a tinting brush and some hair pins and tinfoil. You divide hair into the sections you want and then wrap up the bits of hair separately in foil, held secure with a pin, when you&#x27;ve put the dye on. Then leave it for 1 - 2 hours or more depending on how deep you want the colours. If you put old towels down in the bathroom and wear an old shirt when you dye, and gloves, clean-up isn&#x27;t very hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only critique of the product is that a jar with a screw off lid would be far easier to use. As it is this bottle means you have to work out how muchyou&#x27;ll need ahead of time and squirt that amount onto something ready to use, instead of just dipping your brush in a pot as you go - which is so much easier. Plus sometimes I&#x27;ve had to hit the bottom of the bottle hard and wait awhile to get dye to come out as it tends to gel in the bottom of the bottle. (I can&#x27;t stand up long so that really annoys me.) This product repackaged in a little fat easy-open jar would be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice if you like to change things around is to maybe avoid the pinks, as they are far more colourfast than some of the other colours. I wish I&#x27;d stuck with blues first up, then I&#x27;d be free to do more blues, or purples or greens over the top any time I liked, or all three. The pink is more limiting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have significant issues with chemical sensitivities (as part of the severe neurological disease I have called Myalgic Encephalomyelitis - see the HFME site for info on it, if you want to). I got around these by only bleaching and dyeing my hair starting about an inch form the roots - so none of the dyes or bleaches touch the scalp and the skin at all. The rest of my hair is natural brown coloured. I think it looks better not going all the way to the roots, personally. Plus doing it this way avoids all regrowth issues and means I only will have to re-bleach every 4 months or more. Pretty low maintenance, which is what I was after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bleach is smelly and toxic though, even if you don&#x27;t apply it to the scalp. Even with all the precautions I took (well-ventilated room, making sure bleached hair was on top of head as it processed etc.) it did give me a half hour headache. I used Manic Panic&#x27;s one. I feel it is still well-worth it though, seeing as how it&#x27;ll last a really long time, and the actual dyes are so non-toxic too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been too ill to do anything with my hair at all really for about a decade. Making my hair all pretty colours was my way of celebrating the fact that finally my health is slowly improving and that maybe soon my life will be about more than just basic survival...and have a bit more fun and life and colour in it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being very ill means boring clothes and hair (and even music and room decorations and other things) and not being able to do so many things that make up who you are. This felt like a small way of reclaiming my non-ill personality a bit too. It made me feel more myself than I have in years. It is a small thing but to me, symbolic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t help me cope with every day that much, it is all still really hard each day...but now and then when I see a glimpse of blue or another colour in my hair&#x27;s reflection it makes me smile...as does planning which combinations of colours I&#x27;ll do next. I love these SE dyes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend going colourful, in a big way or even only in a small section of hair, to anyone whose job allows it... and especially anyone that is ill or for other reasons just needs or wants a bit of fun and excessive colourfulness. More beautiful and unexpected colour in the world is always a good thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy dyeing everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jodi Bassett, HFMEyou&#x27;ll need ahead of time and squirt that amount onto something ready to use, instead of just dipping your brush in a pot as you go - which is so much easier.

            <li> Didn&#x27;t stay in well at all, even after bleaching my hair to near white and only rinsing with cold water.</li>
            <li> My son has been asking for blue hair for a while, so I bought this in blue haired freak.  Even though I followed all of the instructions (left the dye on for 20 minutes), it barely altered his dirty blonde hair.  His hair doesn&#x27;t look blue at all, just a slightly darker brown.  He&#x27;s really disappointed.  I&#x27;m not willing to bleach a six-year-old&#x27;s hair, and this came highly recommended as a dye that wouldn&#x27;t require a preliminary bleach job if your natural hair color was blonde/dirty blonde.</li>
            <li> The only hair dye I will ever buy! lasts for 6months-1 yrs after bleaching hair. It is messy and color washes out for a long time in shower, but the color is still just as vibrant in my hair as when I put it in. Fades a little over time but not much! I have used this about 5x since it lasts SO LONG! Semi permanent that outlasts hair salon hair dye AA++</li>
            <li> Got Deep Purple! I mix it with conditioner because I have a ton if hair and I wanted it to last longer, and the color a bit brighter. Seems exspensive at first but one tiny bottle lasts FOREVER! And that&#x27;s WITH me fixing my roots every 2ish weeks cause of how fast my hair grows! Color is gorgeous and has major staying power. Gonna mix it up and get Atomic Pink next! :D</li>
            <li> The seller was fast and efficient but the product itself kind of sucks. It fades faster than any other brand I&#x27;ve used so I have to recolor weekly. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product...</li>
            <li> Very very bad dye , it dyed over as a grey blue which was NOT the color expected, and it faded out to grey. Would not recommended. Manic panic is better .</li>
            <li> Word to the wise, though: If you plan to dye your hair with Special Effects and do periodic upkeep on the color, purchase several bottles at once. The folks who make it only do so a couple times a year, so you will have to go on a hunt for it at certain times if you need it year-round. Just save yourself the trouble and stock up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a really great hairdye; it&#x27;s long-lasting (for what it is: no semipermanent stays around a good while), the colors are rich and have a good fade (they don&#x27;t tend to be murky and bland while fading out, just softer and muted), and my hair feels great and is shiny and healthy-looking post-process. I dye every two to three months and Special Effects doesn&#x27;t destroy my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: Any shade of blue is going to require more maintenance than other colors. To get the longest life out of your SFX color, use a sulfate-free shampoo that is specially formulated for color care. &gt;:o)</li>
            <li> Great! Just wish that when I made a large purchase, they would not come individually wrapped in plastic.</li>
            <li> I used Special Effects Blue Haired Freak on pre-bleached/toned hair (peekaboo highlights) and left it on for 15-30 minutes. The result was an amazing INTENSE royal cobalt blue. It was so bright that it looked like artificial/synthetic extensions!&lt;br /&gt;I had no problems with this staining anything whatsoever (skin, bathtub, sink, pillow) I actually expected it to bleed out a lot naturally, but for some reason, for me it only bled out a very tiny bit the first shampoo afterwards and after that did not bleed out, at least visibly. Nothing was stained! I was very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;The super brightness lasted about a week and then the intense in-your-face is-that-even-your-real-hair blue started to mellow out to a nice bright blue.&lt;br /&gt;After 2-4 weeks it starts fading. I actually love how it faded out better than the original blue. In the well-bleached parts, it fades to a lighter blue, then a really pretty pastel lavender. In the not-as-well-bleached parts (like a little bit at roots, for ex), it fades to a blueish teal and then a pastel teal. So I got a sort of ombre effect going on with light teal, sky blue and lavender. Lovely!&lt;br /&gt;Eventually (after ~2 months) it starts fading out completely, becoming the original silvery-ashy bleached blonde starting from the tips.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to try all the SFX colors!</li>
            <li> This product is simply a cheap knockoff of legitimate Special Effects. This stuff barely dyed my well-bleached hair and faded in two days.</li>
            <li> Virgin Rose starts out a bright magenta color that almost looks purple in some lighting. After about two months the magenta color started to fade. But when the magenta color does start to \\&quot;fade\\&quot; it changes to a color very close to freshly dyed Atomic Pink! After this, the color doesn&#x27;t really change at all. I haven&#x27;t re-applied at all and the color is still hot pink after 4 months! Good dye if you are looking for something with extreme staying power. One other thing I have noticed is that people love to ask about the color! This color has brought me many interesting conversations with all sorts of people, but the best ones were always from the elderly! Just the other day at the grocery store, I had an old lady walk up to me just to say that she loved my pink hair and had always wanted to try bright colors when she was young, but that it wasn&#x27;t allowed. So I told her she could always try it now and she smiled and said, \\&quot;I guess I just might!\\&quot; and walked away. One of the best colors I have ever used!</li>
            <li> I wanted to go a little lighter on my shade of blue, this is the lightest offered. The color is nice however it does not have the staying power of the darker blues. With this shade I have to recolor every 2 weeks instead of 3 1/2 to 4 with the darker blues. Think I&#x27;ll stick with Blue Mayhem from now on!</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed. I used excess coloring and left it on for longer when it wasn&#x27;t really changing my (pre bleached) hairs color. When I rinsed it out my hair was a tie dye of blond and light purple. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for about two years now. My hair is very light blonde, but doesn&#x27;t take dye well so I have to bleach my roots but the rest of my hair takes dye pretty well, since it&#x27;s long from being virgin hair. My hair has been pink for about a year, and I dyed it blue using a punky colour dye. After a few weeks it had faded pretty badly, and I got this dye because I thought from other reviews on this that it would last a lot longer then other dyes. I left it on my hair for about 2-3 hours, like I normally do, and it was pretty light in color, and only lasted about 10 washes before it looked so bad I had to re-dye it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in short, not very good. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, not for how expensive it is.</li>
