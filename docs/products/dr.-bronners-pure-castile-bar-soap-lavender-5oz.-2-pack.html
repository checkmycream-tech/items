            <li>Could use it for laundry and etc, but in its bar form, much better for shower use.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this Lavender bar soap from Dr Bronner&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>of my all time favorite soaps.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell the greatest definitely not like lavender</li>
            <li>but nonetheless it&#x27;s safe for my kids to use</li>
            <li>A bit pricey for soap, but it&#x27;s organic and I love the company, too.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t hesitate trying it, you will love it, no matter what scent.</li>
            <li>Love this soap...</li>
            <li>I love the smell of lavender, too.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try a bar with fewer chemicals than what I was already using and this is fitting the bill.</li>
            <li>Of the three, this one is definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li>She wanted more of it.</li>
            <li>Love this product (lavender).  </li>
            <li>Will continue to buy this (and have already ordered more).  </li>
            <li>Love it..</li>
            <li>and I love how it lathers up on my washcloth.  </li>
            <li>I just love the way it smells up the bathroom when not in use.  </li>
            <li>I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s liquid soaps</li>
            <li>will get more when this is gone .Dr.</li>
            <li>Bronner has many types.</li>
            <li>The pain was gone instantly (much more effective than fresh aloe plant!)</li>
            <li>I love the light smell of lavender that it leaves on my skin</li>
            <li>(And just a couple other ingredients)  Works wonderfully!  </li>
            <li>This is the best soap -- I&#x27;m so glad I order it through Amazon, as I don&#x27;t have a natural health/food store in my new location.</li>
            <li>Nothing special, there are better products on the market.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely more expensive than Fels Naptha, as I buy it to make homemade laundry soap, but it works really good and smells very pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Shiny and clean and easy to use as a shampoo and body wash.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and my clothes smell so fresh</li>
            <li>-- it&#x27;s very clean and fresh, not at all cloying or</li>
            <li>Feels clean.</li>
            <li>and my clothes are clean.</li>
            <li>Smells nice....and seems to get you squeaky clean.....</li>
            <li>It has such a pleasant scent</li>
            <li>Is made in the USA by one of the most ethical companies in the world.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also found this to be true.</li>
            <li>It is no wonder, really, when they have so many toxic chemicals in them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes me feel so fresh and so clean, cleam</li>
            <li>It seems quite mild and moisturizing -- I even use it on my face.</li>
            <li>Plus it dissolves quickly instead of turning all waxy.</li>
            <li>well packaged and arrived quickly .</li>
            <li>skin stayed soft into the following day that&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>The soap leaves me feeling fresh and even a bit relaxed.  </li>
            <li>If I take the shower right away, no burn!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s why:  I loved the lavender scent when the soap was dry, but when I wet the soap to use it, it didn&#x27;t smell nice at all.  </li>
            <li>This hydrating trick also helps me stay really energetic and it even keeps you cooler internally, so that you don&#x27;t overheat from fun in</li>
            <li>but this soap greatly reduces cleanse and is gentle enough that it does not dry out one&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>Love this Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap, I alternate this with the Tea Tree Oil one.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure that makes a big difference.  </li>
            <li>The lavender smell is not overwhelming but pleasant.</li>
            <li>I love all natural, far healthier for your hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend first gave me a bar of this soap not too long ago and this soap really is magic...</li>
            <li>Strange, but I didn&#x27;t like the soap when so many did.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll see that this soap is purely natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;All-One Hemp LAVENDER PURE - CASTILE SOAP MADE WITH ORGANIC OILS</li>
            <li>Both bars of soap cleans the skin really well without stripping the skin.</li>
            <li>It also perfumes your whole bathroom as it sits in your soap dish.  </li>
            <li>scent is there, but once the clothes come out of the dryer, I don&#x27;t really smell it, so it&#x27;s not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this soap!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to find an environmentally friendly soap (one that gets good marks at ewg.org) that cleans well, isn&#x27;t too expensive and isn&#x27;t drying.</li>
            <li>By showering immediately before and after sun exposure, I was able to stay out in the sun without sunblock for an extra twenty minutes (entirely exposed) without burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>drinking plenty of water and eating fresh fruit, especially watermelons and tomatoes.</li>
            <li>This implies that cleaner skin burns less easily.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased the 6 pack and Amazon was much cheaper than both REI and Target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We have soft water</li>
            <li>I first discovered lavender&#x27;s impact on sunburns when a friend who works with essential oils put lavender essential oil on my sunburn.</li>
            <li>Gets your hands clean, last long enough and has organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for anyone with very sensitive, dry, and acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>The bars are a little on the pricy side but totally worth it.</li>
            <li>The rose scented soap have a very weak scent.</li>
            <li>of all, it&#x27;s organic and uses only natural ingredients.....</li>
            <li>/&gt;Adding this soap adds a whole other dimension.</li>
            <li>It left my skin soft to touch into the next day.</li>
            <li>It is a little more expensive than what I normally get but not by too much</li>
            <li>Even if I got close to sun-burning or started to burn, using this soap actually heals the skin so fast and effectively that the sunburn never materializes or gets bad.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no longer experiencing the super dry skin I usually have here in Arizona.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap in our vacation home, which has soft water, and in our main home, which has very hard water that&#x27;s fed through a softener.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other things that I&#x27;ve noticed increase how long I can stay in the sun without burning:</li>
            <li> The lavender scent was completely  gone and was replaced by a sharp, sour scent.  </li>
            <li> It lathers well and rinses easily, a single bar lasts a long time and the soap isn&#x27;t drying.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t leave my skin dry or itchy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I let the soap dry, and voila!</li>
            <li> I typically use a different type of soap in my homemade laundry soap.</li>
            <li> A tad expensive but worth the cost.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not really into bar soaps</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also heard that sunburns are partially caused by the &amp;#34;toxins&amp;#34; in our sweat &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; onto our skin.</li>
            <li> I am a repeat buyer of the product, I do mix in other scents besides lavender, but this is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> and the burn cleared up faster than any other sunburn</li>
            <li> /&gt;This has been an important line of research to me because I breakout from sunscreen/sunblock and the smell of sunblock makes me feel very ill.</li>
            <li> so my laundry soap costs are way down.</li>
            <li> Use just a scoop or less in HE washers.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> Stay away from dry/dense foods (like animal products, nuts, beans, oils and avocados) until you&#x27;ve been out of the sun for at least four hours.</li>
            <li> Not good.  </li>
            <li> (I tried using the liquid castile soap for that purpose and was not happy with the result.)</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong ordering this soap.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really go wrong with this brand.  </li>
            <li> I know this soap is expensive, however...</li>

            <li> The perfect soap.  I make my own laundry detergent using this soap.  So many uses. The scent is not overpowering and is refreshing and calming.  You can&#x27;t go wrong ordering this soap.</li>
            <li> Bought this to make homemade laundry detergent. Smells heavenly - oh my!! Love this.&lt;br /&gt;And it works in my detergent, too!!</li>
            <li> works great for my homemade laundry detergent</li>
            <li> Dr. Bonner&#x27;s Organic Lavender Soap is really good soap. It didn&#x27;t leave my skin dry or itchy.&lt;br /&gt;My skin stayed soft into the following day that&#x27;s great. The soap smelled great. I wish it had a more of a lavender scent to it. I wanted it to make my bathroom smell like lavender. The lavender scented soap is a stronger scent than the rose scented one. The rose scented soap have a very weak scent. I didn&#x27;t smell any rose scent at all. Both bars of soap cleans the skin really well without stripping the skin. It left my skin soft to touch into the next day.</li>
            <li> product and service superb</li>
            <li> I love all natural, far healthier for your hair and scalp. Also, using just this, my hair is the waviest it&#x27;s ever been and NOT frizzy. Shiny and clean and easy to use as a shampoo and body wash. Feels clean. Could use it for laundry and etc, but in its bar form, much better for shower use.</li>
            <li> Made 5 gallons of liquid laundry detergent w this soap. (And just a couple other ingredients)  Works wonderfully!  Smells great.</li>
            <li> Smells delightful and grates very easily!</li>
            <li> smell this.....its a dream.....</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this Lavender bar soap from Dr Bronner&#x27;s.  I use it in the shower and also for making my own laundry soap.&lt;br /&gt;Grate 4oz and mix with 1cup of Borax and 1 cup of Washing Soda.&lt;br /&gt;It is the best smelling laundry detergent.  Use just a scoop or less in HE washers.&lt;br /&gt;One of my all time favorite soaps.</li>
            <li> Smells great, suds up nicely, hydrates skin.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell the greatest definitely not like lavender but nonetheless it&#x27;s safe for my kids to use</li>
            <li> Love this Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap, I alternate this with the Tea Tree Oil one.  Can&#x27;t really go wrong with this brand.  A bit pricey for soap, but it&#x27;s organic and I love the company, too.</li>
            <li> I know this soap is expensive, however... This soap is amazing!  If you like lavender scent, then this is the soap for you.  What&#x27;s best is it&#x27;s very gentle on the skin.  It also perfumes your whole bathroom as it sits in your soap dish.  Just take a look at the ingredients I&#x27;ve listed below and you&#x27;ll see that this soap is purely natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to list some of the information on the bar (as well as ingredients in case you have any known allergies):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-One Hemp LAVENDER PURE - CASTILE SOAP MADE WITH ORGANIC OILS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS:  Organic Coconut Oil, Organic Palm Oil, Sodium Hydroxide, Water, Lavandin Extract, Organic Olive Oil, Organic Fair Deal Hemp Oil, Organic Jojoba Oil, Lavender Extract, Sea Salt, Citric Acid, Tocopherol</li>
            <li> I make my own laundry detergent and one ingredient is Bar Soap, I love the smell of it, just a great product.</li>
            <li> This soap is the best I have ever used!  Don&#x27;t hesitate trying it, you will love it, no matter what scent. I was hesitant because I&#x27;m used to French and Italian brands. This is better and it&#x27;s made right here in the great USA!!!</li>
            <li> Love this soap...the smell is amazing!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this! I typically use a different type of soap in my homemade laundry soap. I decided to try this on the recommendation of a friend. I&#x27;m glad I did! It seems to be working well and my clothes are clean. I love the smell of lavender, too. I wanted to try a bar with fewer chemicals than what I was already using and this is fitting the bill. It is a little more expensive than what I normally get but not by too much so my laundry soap costs are way down. Which is nice considering we are a family of six! :)</li>
            <li> Well, this very and so good n every sense this is one of the best.,etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find an environmentally friendly soap (one that gets good marks at ewg.org) that cleans well, isn&#x27;t too expensive and isn&#x27;t drying. In the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s line, I&#x27;ve tried liquid castile soap, shikakai soap, and this bar soap (all in the lavender scent). Of the three, this one is definitely my favorite. It lathers well and rinses easily, a single bar lasts a long time and the soap isn&#x27;t drying. I&#x27;ve used this soap in our vacation home, which has soft water, and in our main home, which has very hard water that&#x27;s fed through a softener. This performs well in both situations. It seems quite mild and moisturizing -- I even use it on my face. I&#x27;m no longer experiencing the super dry skin I usually have here in Arizona. Finally, I like the herbal scent -- it&#x27;s very clean and fresh, not at all cloying or sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried using this soap as a shampoo. (I tried using the liquid castile soap for that purpose and was not happy with the result.)</li>
            <li> Love the smell and my clothes smell so fresh</li>
            <li> I am a repeat buyer of the product, I do mix in other scents besides lavender, but this is one of my favorites. Gets your hands clean, last long enough and has organic ingredients. Is made in the USA by one of the most ethical companies in the world.</li>
            <li> Love the soap and it was a good buy</li>
            <li> Smells devine, cleans like a champ.  I&#x27;m a huge fan of Dr. Bronners!</li>
            <li> Strange, but I didn&#x27;t like the soap when so many did.  Here&#x27;s why:  I loved the lavender scent when the soap was dry, but when I wet the soap to use it, it didn&#x27;t smell nice at all.  The lavender scent was completely  gone and was replaced by a sharp, sour scent.  Not good.  I let the soap dry, and voila! it smelled like lavender again.  Go figure.  Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely more expensive than Fels Naptha, as I buy it to make homemade laundry soap, but it works really good and smells very pleasant.  Plus it dissolves quickly instead of turning all waxy.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this soap is wonderful! I love the light smell of lavender that it leaves on my skin and it also makes my bathroom smell so wonderul.  I gave two bars to friends and now they use it. Great product!</li>
            <li> Like this soap a lot!  The lavender smell is not overwhelming but pleasant.</li>
            <li> My mother received this as a gift last year. She wanted more of it. She loves it for her face. It is rich and creamy and it has good oils.</li>
            <li> Love this product (lavender).  Use it to shower as well as make laundry soap (with washing soda and baking soda).  Will continue to buy this (and have already ordered more).  Sometimes the price at Amazon is the cheapest and sometimes it&#x27;s not - REI and Target also sell.  I recently purchased the 6 pack and Amazon was much cheaper than both REI and Target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is there, but once the clothes come out of the dryer, I don&#x27;t really smell it, so it&#x27;s not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> Smells nice....and seems to get you squeaky clean.....</li>
            <li> Nothing special, there are better products on the market.</li>
            <li> Love it.. I have terribly dry skin, my hand split and peel daily.  This soup cleans efficiently and without drying out my hands.  A tad expensive but worth the cost.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend first gave me a bar of this soap not too long ago and this soap really is magic...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not really into bar soaps but this soap greatly reduces cleanse and is gentle enough that it does not dry out one&#x27;s skin. It also tightens up the skin on your face while moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;Best of all, it&#x27;s organic and uses only natural ingredients.....Highly recommended for anyone with very sensitive, dry, and acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> This soap has the best smell and I love how it lathers up on my washcloth.  We have soft water so I&#x27;m sure that makes a big difference.  The soap leaves me feeling fresh and even a bit relaxed.  I just love the way it smells up the bathroom when not in use.  It has such a pleasant scent and I appreciate that.</li>
            <li> Beautiful scent and great lather</li>
            <li> I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s liquid soaps so I figured I would give the bars a try. The bars are a little on the pricy side but totally worth it. I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing these again.</li>
            <li> The amazing thing about lavender being in the soap is what it does for burns. I first discovered lavender&#x27;s impact on sunburns when a friend who works with essential oils put lavender essential oil on my sunburn. The pain was gone instantly (much more effective than fresh aloe plant!) and the burn cleared up faster than any other sunburn I&#x27;d ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also heard that sunburns are partially caused by the &amp;#34;toxins&amp;#34; in our sweat &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; onto our skin. This implies that cleaner skin burns less easily. I&#x27;ve also found this to be true. By showering immediately before and after sun exposure, I was able to stay out in the sun without sunblock for an extra twenty minutes (entirely exposed) without burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adding this soap adds a whole other dimension. Even if I got close to sun-burning or started to burn, using this soap actually heals the skin so fast and effectively that the sunburn never materializes or gets bad. I&#x27;ve tested it. An hour in the sun with no lavender-soap shower and I turn red within two hours of coming inside. If I take the shower right away, no burn!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been an important line of research to me because I breakout from sunscreen/sunblock and the smell of sunblock makes me feel very ill. It is no wonder, really, when they have so many toxic chemicals in them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other things that I&#x27;ve noticed increase how long I can stay in the sun without burning: drinking plenty of water and eating fresh fruit, especially watermelons and tomatoes. Stay away from dry/dense foods (like animal products, nuts, beans, oils and avocados) until you&#x27;ve been out of the sun for at least four hours. This hydrating trick also helps me stay really energetic and it even keeps you cooler internally, so that you don&#x27;t overheat from fun in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this soap!</li>
            <li> Love it!  This is the best soap -- I&#x27;m so glad I order it through Amazon, as I don&#x27;t have a natural health/food store in my new location.</li>
            <li> Cleans well  smells good good product</li>
            <li> A great smell and lathers well ,soothing to the skin and a good cleanser. well packaged and arrived quickly . will get more when this is gone .Dr. Bronner has many types.</li>
            <li> Makes me feel so fresh and so clean, cleam</li>
