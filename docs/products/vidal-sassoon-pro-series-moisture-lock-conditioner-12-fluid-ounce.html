            <li>i will be purchasing this product :)</li>
            <li>You need very little to get a good lather on the shampoo and the conditioner works best if you use the smallest amount to coat the hair.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy with this product and would highly recommend this to friends and family.</li>
            <li>I actually loved this product very much.</li>
            <li>The conditioner though, the scent was much stronger and smelled amazing!</li>
            <li>Also, I liked it so much, I went out and bought more already!    </li>
            <li>While I normally use something that is specifically designed for color protection, if I stopped coloring my hair this would be a great option.</li>
            <li>first it smelled really good</li>
            <li>The conditioner worked pretty good.</li>

            <li>The scent wasn&#x27;t near as good as the accompanying shampoo, but that&#x27;s ok because the shampoo made up for it!  </li>
            <li>The best thing, though, other than the wonderful scent, was that my hair stayed clean-feeling into the next day.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to give this one a try!</li>
            <li>After drying, I found that my hair still has the lift I enjoy so much and feels really great.</li>
            <li>Paired with the shampoo it is the perfect treat for winter dry hair.  </li>
            <li>the ends are soft, plus the scent is just fresh and wonderful.  </li>
            <li>The scents is wonderful, and left my hair feeling fantastic.</li>

            <li>The conditioner is light weight and really makes my hair feel nice</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t smell at all like the shampoo that goes with it which really did smell nice.</li>

            <li>&amp;#34; and smelled fantastic (it reminds me of honeysuckles).&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li>the difference in the  smooth texture and the touch of the moisture it add</li>
            <li>I went to a few stores today and priced this and the shampoo and was really happy to see that they&#x27;re both under $4!</li>

            <li>If you like the &#x27;clean&#x27; smell you will like this product.  </li>
            <li>My hair felt sqeaky clean and for it not being from the salon</li>
            <li>The conditioner had a good consistency and left my hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I was completely surprised on how much I love this!</li>
            <li>This did a great job on that, without weighing down my REALLY fine hair.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great product that works just as great as some of the more expensive salon brands without the high price tag.  </li>
            <li>also was a great detangler for my hair while wet</li>
            <li>its the best stuff ever made for people who have sensitive hair scalp my hair use to be long</li>

            <li>Overall, it is a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a bit clingy, which I actually consider a good thing.</li>
            <li>It smells so good, and it definitely moisturizers your hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; near the scalp, but sun, sand and salt water from the beach this summer kind of fried the ends.</li>
            <li>It was soft, behaved well, and I couldn&#x27;t stop myself from running my own fingers through it.</li>
            <li>Not a bad smell at all but nothing that lingers.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this product and recommend it to other, especially since it&#x27;s budget friendly!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great smooth texture, which I leave in my hair for a few minutes before rinsing out.  </li>
            <li>And another added plus is that this conditioner smells so yummy - fresh &amp; clean.  </li>
            <li>I have no complaints about this product it does what it says and its super affordable.</li>

            <li>It left my hair feeling smooth and silky soft along with having a great fragrance.  </li>
            <li>but I feel like I had to use more of this than my normal conditioner to get all the tangles out of my hair.</li>

            <li>I guess either my hair is not as dry as I thought it was, or this was a bit much in addition to the Vidal Sassoon Moisture Lock shampoo (which was great), so I had to stop using it and went back to good old reliable Suave with keratin.</li>

            <li>I received a sample of this conditioner to sample for no charge, but will definitely be buying a full-size bottle as it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li>That is instead of shampooing my hair first I use conditioner.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this conditioner!</li>
            <li>I was only able to use this conditioner twice, since I used a trial size bottle.  </li>
            <li>I only used the conditioner mid-hair to the ends because that is where I needed it most.</li>
            <li>So much you almost feel like you don&#x27;t need the conditioner!</li>
            <li>and you have a trio that really works to keep the frizzies at bay!</li>
            <li>I like to wash my hair first and leave the conditioner in while I wash the rest of my body.</li>
            <li>But they work great for my thick hair.</li>
            <li>Totally buy more.</li>
            <li>Most definitely recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>and I noticed it on my first try.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The first day I used it, my hair felt softer and was easier to comb.</li>
            <li>Thanks Vidal Sassoon!</li>
            <li>My air ended up soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Thanks to VS for sending me a sample to try!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying some more.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner made my hair shiny, smooth, and soft.</li>
            <li>I was given a chance to try this thanks to Infulenster!</li>
            <li>Also, its nice and creamy so you don&#x27;t need much for it to go a long way.</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and silky after using it, and it looks fantastic.</li>
            <li>That is how soft and smooth it made my hair feel.</li>
            <li>It made my hair feel soft and light.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair silky and manageable and I really like the scent!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say this conditioner and shampoo combo was only &#x27;ok&#x27;.</li>
            <li>It is subtle and clean like a high end salon product and lasts for days, which is wonderful when you&#x27;re constantly on the go.</li>
            <li>My hair has been really flat and lifeless for months, then I tried this conditioner (and it&#x27;s coordinating shampoo),  My hair has been bouncy, shiny and fantastic ever since!  </li>
            <li>This conditioner rinses clean but makes my hair feel soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>The shampoo leaves your hair squeaky clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Soft, shiny &amp; smelled clean.</li>
            <li>My ends are super dry and get tangled really easily now that I am growing my hair out.  </li>
            <li>It is thick without being goopy, absorbed well and provided good slip for easier detangling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very creamy and works great at moisturizing my thick hair.  </li>
            <li>If you remember cream-rinses or when we use to call certain conditioners cream-rinses, this is exactly what this is.</li>
            <li>I really love how it smells and it holds the smell all day long in your hair.  </li>
            <li>This product had a great smell and it left my hair soft enough to blow out without leaving it frizzy.  </li>
            <li>It is not always easy to find a great moisturizing conditioner that has a formula that wont weigh it down or make it feel heavy.</li>
            <li>The conditioner rinses clean and when my hair dried, it was so much softer!!!!</li>
            <li>Receiving this from Influenster was exciting a new line of Vidal Sassoon</li>
            <li>My curls were super soft, bouncy and the comb ran through my hair with no problem.</li>
            <li>Could be my hair is really dry, but I felt more of a difference with the shampoo and heat protector than I did with this.</li>
            <li>The texture of my hair is softer and silkier than previous, and it just feels so nice when I run my hand through it.  </li>
            <li>My hair continues to get back to healthy and shiny state that it normal is in,</li>
            <li>its easier to brush through the hair, and its super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>It has such a strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li>ok, the conditioning process was very pleasing I have long hair</li>
            <li>but I would like to use it again to be certain</li>
            <li>This conditioner made my hair super smooth and easier to brush while wet.  </li>
            <li>It really works out any tangles in the shower and leaves my hair super soft and manageable after a shower.</li>
            <li>It really does lock in moisture and leaves my hair feeling super soft.</li>
            <li>This conditioner was good and thick, which is nice, however id did not weigh my hair down in anyway.</li>
            <li>Maybe for shorter hair, but for longer fine hair, its much too heavy, and isnt exceptional enough to really HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li>i have dry frizzy curly hair, and this left my hair manageable, soft, and definitely smelled wonderful!</li>
            <li>I have very very dry hair because of the extensive bleaching and dyeing of my hair and then I continue to color it myself once the bright funky colors fade.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner must be used together, the smell lasts most of the day, but wow is it too heavy for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have very thick straight hair and suffer from fly aways</li>
            <li>I really like this conditioner.</li>
            <li>It smells really good!&amp;#34;  I told him it was my hair.  </li>
            <li>It works well, however using too much can make your hair almost too moisturized, and that can lead to puffy hair.</li>
            <li>After shampoo my color treated and heat damaged hair really needs pampering</li>
            <li>It smelled very mechanical.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t have as much slip as I would have preferred with my conditioners.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>my hair has just been so much nicer.</li>
            <li>Even though I was part of a program that provided me the samples of this product for free - the above review is comprised solely of my opinions of the product.</li>
            <li>but I noticed immediately how much softer it made my hair.</li>
            <li>I did leave the conditioner in my hair for a couple of minutes to really allow the product to saturate and condition my hair.</li>
            <li>It really helped my damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>this is has really changed how my hair feels..</li>
            <li>This product really locks moisture and makes your hair feel hydrated.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Now, I am very picky about conditioners.  </li>
            <li>I really like it-</li>
            <li>You do have to rinse is very thoroughly, though...</li>
            <li>I really like how the VS Products are very hydrating for hair.</li>
            <li>I will be using the whole regimen of shampoo, conditioner, heat protect spray.  </li>
            <li>It really is salon quality.</li>
            <li>this stuff works really well if you need added moisture.</li>
            <li>and now I can, my hair is so shiny and manageable now thanks to VS.</li>
            <li>received the product above for free to review.</li>
            <li>I really like using this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>So when I shop for conditioners, I&#x27;m looking for something that will really moisturizer my hair, and keep that moisture locked in for the whole day.</li>
            <li>Influenster sent me this product to test and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really heat style.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Vidal Sassoon</li>
            <li>I really like the scent of this.</li>
            <li>I recommend that after washing you leave this in, comb it through and then pin it up, rinsing it out at the very end of your shower.</li>
            <li>I received the product to test for free, but I will definitely be adding it to my routine.</li>
            <li>but I used this and it leaves my hair shining and looking so healthy, and there is no heavy residue left on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>We have struggled to find a good smelling, thick, and frizz reducing conditioner--but this product is all 3.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is thick and creamy and smells good.</li>
            <li>Vidal Sassoon has the answer to flat hair caused by super moisturizing conditioners!</li>
            <li>I love the new line of products that they have made for all hair types, plus this is a company that has a long history of selling quality products for affordable prices.</li>
            <li>you have very long hair, a conditioner helping to detangle is a HUGE plus, and one of the first things you notice when its lacking.</li>
            <li>I still need to use my professional brand deep conditioner a few days a week, but its a good product that I will keep in my rotation!</li>
            <li>My hair is more manageable and super soft with less flyaways.</li>
            <li>It took very little of this product to condition my hair which is a huge surprise!!</li>
            <li>My hair was starting to dry out from my old product but this has renewed the moisture in my hair and now it is soft and silky smooth, not to mention it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think that this did anything for my hair that most other conditioners don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Overall, I really like using the whole set together to get the full effect.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product for anyone who needs a moisture rich conditioner.</li>
            <li>like I only need to use a palm full to work it through my whole head.  </li>
            <li>Would be perfect for shorter hair - my very long, very thick hair required a LOT of this product to cover.</li>
            <li>I have  fine, brittle , dry hair.</li>
            <li>It worked just fine at conditioning my hair and keeping it from feeling or looking dry.</li>
            <li>I have used Vidal Sasson products in the past and hadn&#x27;t been too thrilled about the outcome.</li>
            <li>I have my bottle still in my shower, and I will use it as a light deep moisturizer (yes, is kind of that thick) once or twice a week, but not with every hair wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair looks full and bouncy, but the shine is back and the frizzies practically disappeared.</li>
            <li>Plus it doesn&#x27;t feel like it weighs my hair down like most conditioners.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and flyaway and this conditioner made my hair very soft without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>I have super fine and curly hair, so my hair has a tendency to dry out and frizz if not cared for properly.  </li>
            <li>I think this will become my new staple must have conditioner!</li>
            <li>My hair was left clean, soft and ready to go.</li>
            <li>I only recently tried the VS line of products through Influenster, and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>I have really curly, long, full hair and have to use a ton of conditioner every time I wash my hair.  </li>
            <li>As I have gotten older and years of coloring my hair, the moisture in my hair is non-existant.</li>
            <li>..it left my hair smooth, soft, &amp; silky....</li>
            <li>I used this in place of my Moroccan Oil conditioner during my wash day routine and it performed well, not up to MO standards but decent.  </li>
            <li>It definitely locks in the moisture, keeping my unruly hair soft and smooth between washings.</li>
            <li>It rinses clean fairly quickly, and my hair retains volume all day despite the fact that this is a moisturizing product; others would leave my hair looking limp after a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>can definitely see myself buying more of this to use in the future!</li>
            <li>It rinses clean fairly quickly, and my hair retains volume all day despite the fact that this is a moisturizing product; others would leave my hair looking limp after a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>I can definitely see myself buying more of this to use in the future!</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to receive this is Vidal Sassoon Pro Series via infuser</li>
            <li>After rinsing I sprayed my hair with a leave in conditioner and my hair was easy to comb through, no tangles, and super soft when it dried.</li>
            <li>I use a hot flat iron on my hair daily, and it gets damaged easily.</li>
            <li>My long hair is extremely soft after use and is easy comb through after my shower and at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>Cant beat the price for a drugstore product with high end results</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend pairing it with the Moisture lock shampoo, root lift spray and the repair heat</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have super thick, curly, frizzy hair.. and this product really helps to smooth it out.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a little more from it in terms of moisturizing</li>
            <li>This new pro series moisture lock conditioner and shampoo is a brand new way to treat your hair!</li>
            <li>This conditioner works really well on my curly hair to keep it moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>I bleached my hair about a month ago, and this has by far beat out my high end brand, saving me a lot of money!</li>
            <li>I used it in place of my normal conditioner.  </li>
            <li>So I look for conditioners that aren&#x27;t heavy and leave oily residue, but are good enough to leave my ends silky and soft.  </li>
            <li>I received it for free to try out and was a little leary at first to be trying a new shampoo and conditioner...</li>
            <li>I live in a area with high humidity and my hair sometimes resembles straw.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner because it leaves my hair silky and soft, without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li>, I mean come on it gets bleached regularly, ain&#x27;t gonna happen, but it&#x27;s so nice!</li>
            <li>I have been faithful to my normal brand for years and was nervous to try something new</li>
            <li>Normally I use a huge palm-full sized amount of other conditioners</li>
            <li>It dried to be very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I am a new fan of this</li>
            <li>The products live up to my expectations for the brand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always on the lookout for rich, creamy conditioners that soften and moisturize my natural tresses that tend to be on the dry side.</li>
            <li>Honestly do not care for the smell very much, but other than that it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>It has such a nice scent to it and didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling heavy and oily.  </li>
            <li>It allows my hair to get the deep conditioning it is yearning for while at the same time keeping my strands light and airy.</li>
            <li>I have super dry hair</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel very soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>It made my hair very soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>so my head was very sensitive to combing or brushing it</li>
            <li>After blowdrying, it was very soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>It only smells &#x27;ok&#x27; and really has little detangling properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair was so soft that it felt like it still had conditioner in it!</li>
            <li>Static and flyway&#x27;s will be a thing of the past.  </li>
            <li>I washed my hair last night with the shampoo first and then used the conditioner</li>
            <li>I usually have to use much much more conditioner than i do shampoo.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by this conditioner!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used VS since I was a teenager, and then I only tried their hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li>I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>It didnt weigh it down and pull the wave out, just calmed the frizz and made it silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands and this one doesn&#x27;t leave a slimy film on my hair, my shower etc, not this one, it rinses clean.  </li>
            <li>My color treated, long, thick, curly hair demands a great conditioner (especially since I live in a humid climate).</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, smooth, and less frizz.</li>
            <li>I apply the conditioner right after I shampoo my hair, then rinse and  let air dry.</li>
            <li>I paired it with the accompanying shampoo, and that really does maximize the effect...trying it again with a different product yielded less fabulous results.</li>
            <li>I would agree with others who have fine hair that say this leaves you with a heavy, waxy feeling.</li>
            <li>it can be almost impossible to have a good hair day!</li>
            <li>My hair ended up super soft and it did not make my hair greasy, which tends to happen with other conditioners</li>
            <li>I have coarse, dry hair due to lots of color treatment and it&#x27;s nice to find a conditioner that makes my hair soft once I&#x27;m out of the shower.</li>
            <li>but at the same time, my hair feels really moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>I received this conditioner for to review, and I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>It kept my curls soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li>I am very pleasantly surprised by this product.</li>
            <li>However, it got the job done on my AA naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>so I definitely didn&#x27;t expect a drugstore brand to make that much of a difference.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by this conditioner</li>
            <li>My hair was extremely soft .</li>
            <li>I was happily surprised when the feeling stayed even after I rinsed the hair.</li>
            <li>The moisture, smooth and silk feel without the heavy excess of greasy hair.</li>
            <li>It give shine, control on my wild hair.</li>
            <li>Helps detangle my knotty hair and leaves it feeling soft.</li>
            <li>I have natural 3C hair and this conditional</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even realize that my hair could be fixed.</li>
            <li>The claim is that it \\&quot;cleanses and quenches hair&#x27;s thirst, helping to seal in moisture and leaving hair soft and silky\\&quot; and</li>
            <li>It was really soft and also felt healthier.</li>
            <li>so one day she took me to the store and told me to pick out some hair products when I was like 16 years old</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this as my everyday conditioner.</li>
            <li>It is bouncy and soft and has life again</li>
            <li>My old conditioner is in the trash and this has replaced it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these products for a week now &amp; was pleasantly surprised at how well they worked.</li>
            <li>so I was really surprised at how well they worked for my hair</li>

            <li>My hair is thin and color treated so this product works wonders to help trap in moisture and make my hair look fabulous!</li>
            <li>The shampoo had a faint smell that was nice.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and it makes it very manageable and soft.  </li>
            <li>I have VERY long fine hair, and this conditioner is not easy to rinse out.</li>
            <li>My normally dry, frizzy hair is now soft and silky!!</li>
            <li>I have long, thin, fine textured, loosely curled hair that needs extra special moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>I would only purchase again if in a major pinch.</li>
            <li>conditioner is rich, and creamy without weighing your hair down, which can be a big problem with other moisturizing conditioners.</li>
            <li>it seemed to weigh down my hair a bit too much</li>
            <li>I can remember using Vidal Sassoon shampoo and conditioner way back when, when it came in a large dark brown bottle.  </li>
            <li>even though I have baby fine hair, it wasn&#x27;t overly heavy, so it didn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few different new shampoos and conditioners in order to adjust to the new weather</li>
            <li>I have oily hair near my scalp and dry ends.  </li>
            <li>I find my hair to be dry after washing and this product helped keep it soft when used with the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s helped my dry hair come alive.  </li>
            <li>I have long, frizzy/curly hair and this conditioner left my hair soft and managable.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I had to rinse for a few extra minutes.</li>
            <li>It did not dry my hair out, but it did not add any extra moisture.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this conditioner and it was thick and creamy without weighing down my hair.</li>
            <li>hair is very long, and I was surprised that I didn&#x27;t have to use a lot of the product to properly coat my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is very long, and I was surprised that I didn&#x27;t have to use a lot of the product to properly coat my hair.</li>
            <li>I need a shampoo that makes my hair feel soft and brushable not coarse and dry.  </li>
            <li>I have long and naturally wavy hair, so I style it by blowdrying and using a flat iron.</li>
            <li>Its not bad, but its not exceptional.</li>
            <li>I REALLY like this conditioner (as well as the shampoo!), but the scent leaves a little to be desired for me!</li>
            <li>My curls are always frizzy and I am always concerned that certain conditioners will be extremely heavy on my curls.</li>
            <li>I have very dry and natural curly hair.</li>
            <li>This was effectively conditioning and left my hair smoother  and with no fly aways and seemed to make my split ends less obvious.</li>
            <li>I really was hesitant to try this and not sure if this product would work for me because I have very fine, thin hair that is extremely dry.</li>
            <li>This item clearly performs at expected level.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a great product for some, but it just wasn&#x27;t right for my hair type.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and it left my hair feeling very nice.</li>
            <li> First off, I won&#x27;t buy something for my hair that doesn&#x27;t have a great scent and this conditioner has a floral scent that lasts for days.</li>

            <li> I am so happy with this product and would highly recommend this to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I actually loved this product very much.</li>

            <li> Also, I liked it so much, I went out and bought more already!    </li>
            <li> While I normally use something that is specifically designed for color protection, if I stopped coloring my hair this would be a great option.</li>
            <li> first it smelled really good</li>
            <li> The conditioner worked pretty good.</li>
            <li> I loved how soft and healthy my hair felt after I used it!  </li>
            <li> The scent wasn&#x27;t near as good as the accompanying shampoo, but that&#x27;s ok because the shampoo made up for it!  </li>
            <li> The best thing, though, other than the wonderful scent, was that my hair stayed clean-feeling into the next day.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to give this one a try!</li>
            <li> After drying, I found that my hair still has the lift I enjoy so much and feels really great.</li>
            <li> Paired with the shampoo it is the perfect treat for winter dry hair.  </li>
            <li> the ends are soft, plus the scent is just fresh and wonderful.  </li>
            <li> The scents is wonderful, and left my hair feeling fantastic.</li>

            <li> It leaves your hair feeling soft and smelling great.</li>

            <li> I tested this product at no cost (complimentary of Influenster) but all opinions are my own.</li>

            <li> It made my hair easy to run my fingers through when I was done.</li>
            <li> It has a nice soft scent so you don&#x27;t have to worry if you don&#x27;t liked scented conditioners.  </li>
            <li> I have really long, not the good kind of wavy hair.  </li>

            <li> Scent is always a huge factor for me-</li>
            <li> It always seems to add to the already tangles in my hair, but once I tried Vidal Moisture Lock conditioner, I felt a huge difference.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is light weight and really makes my hair feel nice</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t smell at all like the shampoo that goes with it which really did smell nice.</li>
            <li> A great bargain for such a luscious product.  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34; and smelled fantastic (it reminds me of honeysuckles).&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li> the difference in the  smooth texture and the touch of the moisture it add</li>
            <li> I went to a few stores today and priced this and the shampoo and was really happy to see that they&#x27;re both under $4!</li>

            <li> The smell is great, it smells very similar to the shampoo, fresh and ozone-y, but it also has a hint of sweetness.</li>
            <li> If you like the &#x27;clean&#x27; smell you will like this product.  </li>
            <li> My hair felt sqeaky clean and for it not being from the salon</li>
            <li> The conditioner had a good consistency and left my hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I was completely surprised on how much I love this!</li>
            <li> This did a great job on that, without weighing down my REALLY fine hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great product that works just as great as some of the more expensive salon brands without the high price tag.  </li>
            <li> also was a great detangler for my hair while wet</li>
            <li> its the best stuff ever made for people who have sensitive hair scalp my hair use to be long</li>
            <li> but overall I thought it was pretty great.</li>

            <li> Overall, it is a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit clingy, which I actually consider a good thing.</li>
            <li> It smells so good, and it definitely moisturizers your hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; near the scalp, but sun, sand and salt water from the beach this summer kind of fried the ends.</li>
            <li> It was soft, behaved well, and I couldn&#x27;t stop myself from running my own fingers through it.</li>
            <li> Not a bad smell at all but nothing that lingers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product and recommend it to other, especially since it&#x27;s budget friendly!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great smooth texture, which I leave in my hair for a few minutes before rinsing out.  </li>

            <li> I have no complaints about this product it does what it says and its super affordable.</li>

            <li> It left my hair feeling smooth and silky soft along with having a great fragrance.  </li>
            <li> but I feel like I had to use more of this than my normal conditioner to get all the tangles out of my hair.</li>
            <li> and I noticed that it seemed to make my hair feel pretty smooth after using it.</li>

            <li> first off the smell is great, it doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling like a teenager but more like a put together 20-40  year old, meaning not really sweet and fruity.</li>
            <li> The thickness of the conditioner is great, it&#x27;s not thin like some other brands.</li>
            <li> I guess either my hair is not as dry as I thought it was, or this was a bit much in addition to the Vidal Sassoon Moisture Lock shampoo (which was great), so I had to stop using it and went back to good old reliable Suave with keratin.</li>
            <li> That is why I love that I was able to find a product that gives me a natural healthy shine, that tames fly-a-ways, and wont weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li> I switched out my normal conditioner for Vidal Sassoon and  I love how it made my hair soft and smooth for days.</li>
            <li> detangle knots, my fingers glide right through</li>
            <li> i used it right after shampooing my hair with moisture lock shampoo and it had a lot of slip.</li>
            <li> The conditioner added just the right about of moisture to my hair without making it feel greasy.  </li>
            <li> It is really creamy and it washes out fully leaving my hair feeling clean and shiny without any build-up or waxy feeling.  </li>
            <li> my hair is very frizzy normally and the ends feel like straw most of the time...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry if my hair will look and feel clean because it always is thanks to this conditioner.</li>
            <li> on  my new &amp;#34;rock my natural hair&amp;#34; and loving it.</li>
            <li> This is conditioner took my post-shower hair comb from 20 long minutes to just 7 or 8 for which I&#x27;m thrilled.</li>
            <li> This is a great daily use moisturizer, although I might still recommend a deep weekly treatment.</li>
            <li> It rinses easily as well, after I&#x27;ve rinsed it from my hair leaving it feeling soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s finally nice to find a product that rejuvenates my hair and really puts moisture back in it!</li>
            <li> It rinses out easily leaving my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> this is a wonderful product expescially use out as a system using all the moisture lock series, this product is not that expensive can be purchased very easily via this Amazon your local convenience store</li>
            <li> I first tested this product at no cost, but I liked it so much that I went to buy a big bottle.</li>
            <li> I am incredibly pleased to have found something that makes my hair nice and isn&#x27;t expensive, plus it&#x27;s easy to find!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The feeling it left my hair with was clean and tangle free.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and a lot of it, and this conditioner left my hair feeling soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> i love trying new products and this one by far met my needs!</li>
            <li> Love it, and will be buying in the future!</li>
            <li> It always leaves my hair smooth, shiny, soft, and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this conditioner to sample for no charge, but will definitely be buying a full-size bottle as it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li> That is instead of shampooing my hair first I use conditioner.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this conditioner!</li>
            <li> I was only able to use this conditioner twice, since I used a trial size bottle.  </li>
            <li> I only used the conditioner mid-hair to the ends because that is where I needed it most.</li>
            <li> So much you almost feel like you don&#x27;t need the conditioner!</li>
            <li> and you have a trio that really works to keep the frizzies at bay!</li>
            <li> I like to wash my hair first and leave the conditioner in while I wash the rest of my body.</li>
            <li> But they work great for my thick hair.</li>
            <li> Totally buy more.</li>
            <li> Most definitely recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> and I noticed it on my first try.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The first day I used it, my hair felt softer and was easier to comb.</li>
            <li> Thanks Vidal Sassoon!</li>
            <li> My air ended up soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Thanks to VS for sending me a sample to try!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying some more.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner made my hair shiny, smooth, and soft.</li>
            <li> I was given a chance to try this thanks to Infulenster!</li>
            <li> Also, its nice and creamy so you don&#x27;t need much for it to go a long way.</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and silky after using it, and it looks fantastic.</li>
            <li> That is how soft and smooth it made my hair feel.</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel soft and light.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair silky and manageable and I really like the scent!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say this conditioner and shampoo combo was only &#x27;ok&#x27;.</li>
            <li> It is subtle and clean like a high end salon product and lasts for days, which is wonderful when you&#x27;re constantly on the go.</li>
            <li> My hair has been really flat and lifeless for months, then I tried this conditioner (and it&#x27;s coordinating shampoo),  My hair has been bouncy, shiny and fantastic ever since!  </li>
            <li> This conditioner rinses clean but makes my hair feel soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> The shampoo leaves your hair squeaky clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Soft, shiny &amp; smelled clean.</li>
            <li> My ends are super dry and get tangled really easily now that I am growing my hair out.  </li>
            <li> It is thick without being goopy, absorbed well and provided good slip for easier detangling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very creamy and works great at moisturizing my thick hair.  </li>
            <li> If you remember cream-rinses or when we use to call certain conditioners cream-rinses, this is exactly what this is.</li>
            <li> I really love how it smells and it holds the smell all day long in your hair.  </li>
            <li> This product had a great smell and it left my hair soft enough to blow out without leaving it frizzy.  </li>
            <li> It is not always easy to find a great moisturizing conditioner that has a formula that wont weigh it down or make it feel heavy.</li>
            <li> The conditioner rinses clean and when my hair dried, it was so much softer!!!!</li>
            <li> Receiving this from Influenster was exciting a new line of Vidal Sassoon</li>
            <li> My curls were super soft, bouncy and the comb ran through my hair with no problem.</li>
            <li> Could be my hair is really dry, but I felt more of a difference with the shampoo and heat protector than I did with this.</li>
            <li> The texture of my hair is softer and silkier than previous, and it just feels so nice when I run my hand through it.  </li>
            <li> My hair continues to get back to healthy and shiny state that it normal is in,</li>
            <li> its easier to brush through the hair, and its super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> It has such a strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li> ok, the conditioning process was very pleasing I have long hair</li>
            <li> but I would like to use it again to be certain</li>
            <li> This conditioner made my hair super smooth and easier to brush while wet.  </li>
            <li> It really works out any tangles in the shower and leaves my hair super soft and manageable after a shower.</li>
            <li> It really does lock in moisture and leaves my hair feeling super soft.</li>
            <li> This conditioner was good and thick, which is nice, however id did not weigh my hair down in anyway.</li>
            <li> Maybe for shorter hair, but for longer fine hair, its much too heavy, and isnt exceptional enough to really HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li> i have dry frizzy curly hair, and this left my hair manageable, soft, and definitely smelled wonderful!</li>
            <li> I have very very dry hair because of the extensive bleaching and dyeing of my hair and then I continue to color it myself once the bright funky colors fade.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner must be used together, the smell lasts most of the day, but wow is it too heavy for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick straight hair and suffer from fly aways</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner.</li>
            <li> It smells really good!&amp;#34;  I told him it was my hair.  </li>
            <li> It works well, however using too much can make your hair almost too moisturized, and that can lead to puffy hair.</li>
            <li> After shampoo my color treated and heat damaged hair really needs pampering</li>
            <li> It smelled very mechanical.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t have as much slip as I would have preferred with my conditioners.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> my hair has just been so much nicer.</li>
            <li> Even though I was part of a program that provided me the samples of this product for free - the above review is comprised solely of my opinions of the product.</li>
            <li> but I noticed immediately how much softer it made my hair.</li>
            <li> I did leave the conditioner in my hair for a couple of minutes to really allow the product to saturate and condition my hair.</li>
            <li> It really helped my damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> this is has really changed how my hair feels..</li>
            <li> This product really locks moisture and makes your hair feel hydrated.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Now, I am very picky about conditioners.  </li>
            <li> I really like it-</li>
            <li> You do have to rinse is very thoroughly, though...</li>
            <li> I really like how the VS Products are very hydrating for hair.</li>
            <li> I will be using the whole regimen of shampoo, conditioner, heat protect spray.  </li>
            <li> It really is salon quality.</li>
            <li> this stuff works really well if you need added moisture.</li>
            <li> and now I can, my hair is so shiny and manageable now thanks to VS.</li>
            <li> received the product above for free to review.</li>
            <li> I really like using this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> So when I shop for conditioners, I&#x27;m looking for something that will really moisturizer my hair, and keep that moisture locked in for the whole day.</li>
            <li> Influenster sent me this product to test and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really heat style.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Vidal Sassoon</li>
            <li> I really like the scent of this.</li>
            <li> I recommend that after washing you leave this in, comb it through and then pin it up, rinsing it out at the very end of your shower.</li>
            <li> I received the product to test for free, but I will definitely be adding it to my routine.</li>
            <li> but I used this and it leaves my hair shining and looking so healthy, and there is no heavy residue left on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> We have struggled to find a good smelling, thick, and frizz reducing conditioner--but this product is all 3.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is thick and creamy and smells good.</li>
            <li> Vidal Sassoon has the answer to flat hair caused by super moisturizing conditioners!</li>
            <li> I love the new line of products that they have made for all hair types, plus this is a company that has a long history of selling quality products for affordable prices.</li>
            <li> you have very long hair, a conditioner helping to detangle is a HUGE plus, and one of the first things you notice when its lacking.</li>
            <li> I still need to use my professional brand deep conditioner a few days a week, but its a good product that I will keep in my rotation!</li>
            <li> My hair is more manageable and super soft with less flyaways.</li>
            <li> It took very little of this product to condition my hair which is a huge surprise!!</li>
            <li> My hair was starting to dry out from my old product but this has renewed the moisture in my hair and now it is soft and silky smooth, not to mention it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think that this did anything for my hair that most other conditioners don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Overall, I really like using the whole set together to get the full effect.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product for anyone who needs a moisture rich conditioner.</li>
            <li> like I only need to use a palm full to work it through my whole head.  </li>
            <li> Would be perfect for shorter hair - my very long, very thick hair required a LOT of this product to cover.</li>
            <li> I have  fine, brittle , dry hair.</li>
            <li> It worked just fine at conditioning my hair and keeping it from feeling or looking dry.</li>
            <li> I have used Vidal Sasson products in the past and hadn&#x27;t been too thrilled about the outcome.</li>
            <li> I have my bottle still in my shower, and I will use it as a light deep moisturizer (yes, is kind of that thick) once or twice a week, but not with every hair wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair looks full and bouncy, but the shine is back and the frizzies practically disappeared.</li>
            <li> Plus it doesn&#x27;t feel like it weighs my hair down like most conditioners.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and flyaway and this conditioner made my hair very soft without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I have super fine and curly hair, so my hair has a tendency to dry out and frizz if not cared for properly.  </li>
            <li> I think this will become my new staple must have conditioner!</li>
            <li> My hair was left clean, soft and ready to go.</li>
            <li> I only recently tried the VS line of products through Influenster, and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> I have really curly, long, full hair and have to use a ton of conditioner every time I wash my hair.  </li>
            <li> As I have gotten older and years of coloring my hair, the moisture in my hair is non-existant.</li>
            <li> ..it left my hair smooth, soft, &amp; silky....</li>
            <li> I used this in place of my Moroccan Oil conditioner during my wash day routine and it performed well, not up to MO standards but decent.  </li>
            <li> It definitely locks in the moisture, keeping my unruly hair soft and smooth between washings.</li>
            <li> It rinses clean fairly quickly, and my hair retains volume all day despite the fact that this is a moisturizing product; others would leave my hair looking limp after a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> can definitely see myself buying more of this to use in the future!</li>
            <li> It rinses clean fairly quickly, and my hair retains volume all day despite the fact that this is a moisturizing product; others would leave my hair looking limp after a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> I can definitely see myself buying more of this to use in the future!</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive this is Vidal Sassoon Pro Series via infuser</li>
            <li> After rinsing I sprayed my hair with a leave in conditioner and my hair was easy to comb through, no tangles, and super soft when it dried.</li>
            <li> I use a hot flat iron on my hair daily, and it gets damaged easily.</li>
            <li> My long hair is extremely soft after use and is easy comb through after my shower and at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Cant beat the price for a drugstore product with high end results</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend pairing it with the Moisture lock shampoo, root lift spray and the repair heat</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have super thick, curly, frizzy hair.. and this product really helps to smooth it out.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a little more from it in terms of moisturizing</li>
            <li> This new pro series moisture lock conditioner and shampoo is a brand new way to treat your hair!</li>
            <li> This conditioner works really well on my curly hair to keep it moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li> I bleached my hair about a month ago, and this has by far beat out my high end brand, saving me a lot of money!</li>
            <li> I used it in place of my normal conditioner.  </li>
            <li> So I look for conditioners that aren&#x27;t heavy and leave oily residue, but are good enough to leave my ends silky and soft.  </li>
            <li> I received it for free to try out and was a little leary at first to be trying a new shampoo and conditioner...</li>
            <li> I live in a area with high humidity and my hair sometimes resembles straw.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner because it leaves my hair silky and soft, without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> , I mean come on it gets bleached regularly, ain&#x27;t gonna happen, but it&#x27;s so nice!</li>
            <li> I have been faithful to my normal brand for years and was nervous to try something new</li>
            <li> Normally I use a huge palm-full sized amount of other conditioners</li>
            <li> It dried to be very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I am a new fan of this</li>
            <li> The products live up to my expectations for the brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always on the lookout for rich, creamy conditioners that soften and moisturize my natural tresses that tend to be on the dry side.</li>
            <li> Honestly do not care for the smell very much, but other than that it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> It has such a nice scent to it and didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling heavy and oily.  </li>
            <li> It allows my hair to get the deep conditioning it is yearning for while at the same time keeping my strands light and airy.</li>
            <li> I have super dry hair</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel very soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> It made my hair very soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> so my head was very sensitive to combing or brushing it</li>
            <li> After blowdrying, it was very soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> It only smells &#x27;ok&#x27; and really has little detangling properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair was so soft that it felt like it still had conditioner in it!</li>
            <li> Static and flyway&#x27;s will be a thing of the past.  </li>
            <li> I washed my hair last night with the shampoo first and then used the conditioner</li>
            <li> I usually have to use much much more conditioner than i do shampoo.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this conditioner!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used VS since I was a teenager, and then I only tried their hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> It didnt weigh it down and pull the wave out, just calmed the frizz and made it silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands and this one doesn&#x27;t leave a slimy film on my hair, my shower etc, not this one, it rinses clean.  </li>
            <li> My color treated, long, thick, curly hair demands a great conditioner (especially since I live in a humid climate).</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, smooth, and less frizz.</li>
            <li> I apply the conditioner right after I shampoo my hair, then rinse and  let air dry.</li>
            <li> I paired it with the accompanying shampoo, and that really does maximize the effect...trying it again with a different product yielded less fabulous results.</li>
            <li> I would agree with others who have fine hair that say this leaves you with a heavy, waxy feeling.</li>
            <li> it can be almost impossible to have a good hair day!</li>
            <li> My hair ended up super soft and it did not make my hair greasy, which tends to happen with other conditioners</li>
            <li> I have coarse, dry hair due to lots of color treatment and it&#x27;s nice to find a conditioner that makes my hair soft once I&#x27;m out of the shower.</li>
            <li> but at the same time, my hair feels really moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li> I received this conditioner for to review, and I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> It kept my curls soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li> I am very pleasantly surprised by this product.</li>
            <li> However, it got the job done on my AA naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> so I definitely didn&#x27;t expect a drugstore brand to make that much of a difference.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this conditioner</li>
            <li> My hair was extremely soft .</li>
            <li> I was happily surprised when the feeling stayed even after I rinsed the hair.</li>
            <li> The moisture, smooth and silk feel without the heavy excess of greasy hair.</li>
            <li> It give shine, control on my wild hair.</li>
            <li> Helps detangle my knotty hair and leaves it feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I have natural 3C hair and this conditional</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even realize that my hair could be fixed.</li>
            <li> The claim is that it \\&quot;cleanses and quenches hair&#x27;s thirst, helping to seal in moisture and leaving hair soft and silky\\&quot; and</li>
            <li> It was really soft and also felt healthier.</li>
            <li> so one day she took me to the store and told me to pick out some hair products when I was like 16 years old</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this as my everyday conditioner.</li>
            <li> It is bouncy and soft and has life again</li>

            <li> The smell was a major turn off for me.</li>
            <li> and second it made my hair feel so soft!</li>
            <li> I actually don&#x27;t use the conditioner and shampoo in a traditional way, although it works well using it traditionally, my hair much prefers reverse washing!</li>
            <li> This is a major plus to me, as I prefer not to wash my hair</li>
            <li> I really think for my my haircare needs (very dry).</li>
            <li> , I would normally go for a more expensive brand</li>
            <li> The product left my hair soft, shiny and workable.</li>

            <li> This conditioner makes my hair really soft throughout the entire day.</li>

            <li> I would only purchase again if in a major pinch.</li>
            <li> conditioner is rich, and creamy without weighing your hair down, which can be a big problem with other moisturizing conditioners.</li>
            <li> it seemed to weigh down my hair a bit too much</li>
            <li> I can remember using Vidal Sassoon shampoo and conditioner way back when, when it came in a large dark brown bottle.  </li>
            <li> even though I have baby fine hair, it wasn&#x27;t overly heavy, so it didn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different new shampoos and conditioners in order to adjust to the new weather</li>
            <li> I have oily hair near my scalp and dry ends.  </li>
            <li> I find my hair to be dry after washing and this product helped keep it soft when used with the shampoo.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s helped my dry hair come alive.  </li>
            <li> I have long, frizzy/curly hair and this conditioner left my hair soft and managable.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I had to rinse for a few extra minutes.</li>
            <li> It did not dry my hair out, but it did not add any extra moisture.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this conditioner and it was thick and creamy without weighing down my hair.</li>
            <li> hair is very long, and I was surprised that I didn&#x27;t have to use a lot of the product to properly coat my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is very long, and I was surprised that I didn&#x27;t have to use a lot of the product to properly coat my hair.</li>
            <li> I need a shampoo that makes my hair feel soft and brushable not coarse and dry.  </li>
            <li> I have long and naturally wavy hair, so I style it by blowdrying and using a flat iron.</li>
            <li> Its not bad, but its not exceptional.</li>
            <li> I REALLY like this conditioner (as well as the shampoo!), but the scent leaves a little to be desired for me!</li>
            <li> My curls are always frizzy and I am always concerned that certain conditioners will be extremely heavy on my curls.</li>
            <li> I have very dry and natural curly hair.</li>
            <li> This was effectively conditioning and left my hair smoother  and with no fly aways and seemed to make my split ends less obvious.</li>
            <li> I really was hesitant to try this and not sure if this product would work for me because I have very fine, thin hair that is extremely dry.</li>
            <li> This item clearly performs at expected level.  </li>
            <li> The smell is fantastic, I have thick hair and only needed a minimal amount to work through my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, less frizzy than normal, and stays that way through rough days.</li>
            <li> I use about half of what I normally would use with my regular conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I like the fresh scent, and its not overwhelming!</li>
            <li> I used this product everyday for two weeks prior to writing this review - this is my new go-to conditioner!    </li>
            <li> It is not a super thick formula so it makes it easy to distribute through hair where you need it.</li>
            <li> Normally it&#x27;s a tangled frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> A little really did go a long way.</li>
            <li> My hair was damaged from coloring and using a flat iron on it daily.</li>
            <li> The damage from the flat iron is definitely clearing up.  </li>
            <li> I typically use morrocan oil type products, but I got the Vidal Sassoon shampoo and conditioner is a recent VoxBox, and was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> Formula is a little heavy for everyday use on my fine hair as it weighs it down a little, but I would definitely purchase to use as a once a week treatment or for using when I wanted an ultra smooth look.</li>
            <li> however this product i only really need a small walnut sized amount...</li>
            <li> I have such dry, coarse hair</li>
            <li> Though I would not recommend this to anyone with curly or flat hair as it will weigh you down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> so far I haven&#x27;t felt like it weighs down my hair-</li>
            <li> However, this doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down; it keeps it soft and manageable all day</li>
            <li> I have a short hairstyle and my hair often feels dry during the day and oily at night.</li>
            <li> If your hair is dry through and through, you might have to use it all over for different results.</li>
            <li> My hair has never been extremely dry or frizzy but it definitely is always in need of additional moisture.</li>
            <li> I only put conditioner on the ends of my hair and sometimes my hair continues to feel dry and brittle on the ends.</li>
            <li> I have coarse dry hair and need all the moisture that I can get.</li>
            <li> My hair is coarse, color-treated and sometimes dry.</li>
            <li> I have color-treated, thick, short hair, so certain brands tend to reak havoc on my hair, causing it to become dry and brittle, not Vidal Sassoon&#x27;s Pro Series Moisture Lock Shampoo &amp; Conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I have long, highlighted hair that tends to be dry (I blow dry and flat iron on a daily basis).</li>
            <li> It was not dry and frizzy like when I used other, salon quality products.</li>
            <li> The products are in line with the long time salon quality reputation of the brand.</li>
            <li> I have extremely long hair, and it tends to get frizzy and unruly.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, fine hair and a LOT of it</li>
            <li> I rinsed using both cold and hot water and had the same results, soft and silky!</li>
            <li> I use to use an additional leave in conditioner for my long hair but don&#x27;t need it with the Vidal Sassoon Pro Series Moisture conditioner!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting some for my daughter and her long hair too!</li>
            <li> I only put conditioner on my ends due to an oily scalp, and so for me, a conditioner has to protect without getting me greasy.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry hair</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I am always searching for conditioners that add moisture to my otherwise dry damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it is seriously dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> My hair tends to be dry and nothing ever seems to work.</li>
            <li> It is no longer dry and brittle and I do not have to deal with the frizz any longer.</li>
            <li> Even though I have somewhat oily hair, the ends are just dry and lifeless, but not anymore after using this conditioner.</li>
            <li> help prevent dry or damaged-looking hair\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I have combination hair (oily scalp and dry ends)</li>
            <li> My hair is colored treated and dry by nature</li>
            <li> let it air dry and went to bed.</li>
            <li> it did moisturize and not make my hair feel dry.</li>
            <li> dry my hair comb it with no problems and walk out the door.</li>
            <li> My hair didn&#x27;t feel dry after styling.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the product and its texture, not too thick not too thin.</li>
            <li> This conditioner didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, it left no residue</li>
            <li> This smells good like the shampoo, but I am a little disappointed in this being that is</li>
            <li> My hair was so soft &amp; silky &amp; had very few tangles.</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling slightly stronger and it didn&#x27;t feel brittle after shampoo and conditioning.</li>
            <li> My hair was getting very dry and brittle since I swim two-thxree times a week.</li>
            <li> It also had become very dry, brittle and frizzy.</li>
            <li> My hair is damaged from drying and dying and is often very dry.</li>
            <li> My hair is just passed my shoulders, thick, takes forever to blow dry and often ends up feeling dried out from coloring and too much heat.  </li>
            <li> this took a little extra.</li>
            <li> (but the label shows no sign of such ingredient on it), leaving my hair a little greasy.</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry, thin and frizzy, it&#x27;s very damaged from all of the bleaching</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve always had really dry and damaged hair due to coloring, overuse of heat, etc.</li>
            <li> It made my hair softer, but didn&#x27;t give me the moisture I had expected.</li>
            <li> I am of African-American descent and have natural, thick, kinky-curly hair.</li>
            <li> If you have dry hair you should give it a try!!</li>
            <li> I tend to have a dry scalp from time to time and with winter fast approaching, I&#x27;m on the look out for products that will defend my scalp from the dry cold weather.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> My hair feels mousterized and tame, but I can not get over the generic smell.</li>
            <li> I also am prone to an oily scalp even though I have very thick hair that looks dried out if I don&#x27;t use the right kinds of shampoos and conditioners and this conditioner was not to heavy in leaving my scalp greasy and heavy looking upon blow dry; but just enough silkiness to get the moisture lock</li>
            <li> Then I flat iron my hair just about everyday</li>
            <li> My curls are really tight and can be dry at times.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that this conditioner would be right for my hair, since a lot of products that claim to moisturize weigh my hair down and make it look oily by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I am extremely picky about what I use on my hair.</li>
            <li> Along with all of the other benefits that I have mentioned...</li>
            <li> I do find, however, that leaves white residue when hair dries, I am not sure if it&#x27;s film or dandruff, though I rinse it out thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Due to my  oily scalp, I do wash my hair every  morning.  </li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t like using bath products with sodium laurel sulfate and other chemicals due to skin cancer in my family, so</li>
            <li> I could also tell a difference, in that my hair didn&#x27;t seem as frizzy as with other shampoo.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> The moisture level is great...but not for someone who has extremely coarse/dry hair (which my curly hair is).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This happened after only a few uses also, I can&#x27;t wait until I&#x27;ve used it a bit longer!</li>
            <li> After towel drying my hair and using the VS Heat and Protect Spray, my hair did seem smoother and not as frizzy due to the humidity.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick, course hair, and am constantly looking for something that will actually make brushing my hair out less of a task!</li>
            <li> and it was only enough to do 1 section of my hair because i have very thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, natural, curly hair.</li>
            <li> Usually it takes me a long time to comb out my hair.</li>
            <li> My only complaint with this product is the smell.</li>
            <li> Lately I had started noticing my hair looking lackluster and frizzy in the back and on the ends.</li>
            <li> Second, it is really thick and feels like you are locking in</li>
            <li> This is a thick conditioner that you can still use daily.</li>
            <li> I have thick, frizzy, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Conditioners I have tried in the past always left my hair feeling weighed down, really heavy.</li>
            <li> With this product it leaves my hair feeling moistured and not the weighed down oily feeling that some moisture shampoos and conditioners can cause.</li>
            <li> and it did not weight it down</li>
            <li> Every conditioner I tried seemed to make no difference or it would weigh my hair down and make it oily.</li>
            <li> Also was less tangles.</li>
            <li> The problem I often run into is that conditioners weigh down the little bit of hair I have.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have really long and thick hair that can be unruly at times.</li>
            <li> My hair tends to be weighed down by heavy conditioners</li>
            <li> My hair tends to be weighed down by heavy conditioners</li>
            <li> My hair is no longer dull or dry and I have to thank this conditioner for it.</li>
            <li> , it moisture my hair so doesn&#x27;t look dry and dull anymore</li>
            <li> hair is very long, thick, &amp; wavy</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair that can get dry on the ends, and this gets the job done.</li>
            <li> If you have thick dry hair you need to try this product because it worked for me...</li>
            <li> After just a few days I can see my hair is softer with less split ends.</li>
            <li> no significant effect</li>
            <li> I am a little torn on this product.</li>
            <li> I received a sample size to try and I didn&#x27;t think it would be enough for my thick hair!</li>
            <li> but my hair felt a little heavy after use</li>
            <li> I expected it to leave my hair moisturized afterwards and was pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I heat style it everyday.</li>
            <li> I like trying rinse out conditioners for conditioner wash - rinsing the hair with a rinse out conditioner instead of using a harsh, sulfate shampoo.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference within just a few days of using the products, with how my hair felt and looked.  </li>
            <li> My hair does not feel frizzy, heavy, or anything now.</li>
            <li> This conditioner does not leave a heavy feeling.</li>
            <li> I have been using Vidal Sassoon Pro Series Moisture Lock Conditioner for a few days now and can already tell a difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I believe my damage will be gone after using this product for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be caught dead telling people to buy it.</li>
            <li> Even after my hair was dried and styled I could still smell the conditioner.</li>
            <li> It is creamy but it felt too heavy and it smells a lot like Silicone</li>
            <li> that when when dried.</li>
            <li> I do have obnoxiously long and thick hair and usually use about a quarter size glob</li>
            <li> I have wavy to curly  hair that comes down to about the end of my shoulder blades and all I need is about a small palm size amount if that helps at all.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair and finding a conditioner that tames my locks and helps keep it looking manageable is hard to find.</li>
            <li> This conditioner made the combing process MUCH quicker and less painful, and my hair kept its bounce because it wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;weighed down&amp;#34; under the weight of my conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have hair down to my waist and it is hard to manage at times</li>
            <li> Lightweight  moisture smooths and softens with weighing hair down or effecting texture negatively.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, dry &amp; unruly hair.</li>
            <li> This one was a little hard to review.</li>
            <li> it took very little conditioner to get all of my hair saturated with product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how else to describe it.</li>
            <li> I was used to taming my hair in the crazy humidity of south Florida and when we moved it completely screwed me up.  </li>
            <li> I apply it and let it sit as usual, but instead of rinsing it out I apply my shampoo and shampoo it out then rinse.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that is somewhat oily if I don&#x27;t wash it everyday</li>
            <li> For the past 20 years I have had frizzy hair that I had to straighten because my waves were so frizzy.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t just making an unfair comparison to a different brand.  </li>
            <li> I tried the Vidal Sassoon Moisture Lock conditioner for a couple weeks, replacing my usual shampoos (Garnier, Dove, Aveda and Bumble &amp; Bumble).  </li>
            <li> I usually have to use a lot to make my hair feel silky and covered however, this one I felt</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually use conditioner</li>
            <li> I usually use Bio Silk afterwards but there was no need.</li>
            <li> I have to wash my hair at least every day and found myself needing a clarifier after a few days of using both.  </li>
            <li> It was difficult to rinse out however, and left a residue on my hair that I would be concerned about building up over time.</li>
            <li> but I was not sure if it would stay</li>
            <li> and i have to say that i have seen a difference in my usually frizzy and dull hair.</li>
            <li> Usually I have to use a ton of conditioner, but this formula is so thick &amp; creamy</li>
            <li> I have thick, medium length hair, so I need quite a bit of conditioner.  </li>
            <li> and it is thick and fizzy,</li>
            <li> The formula is thick which I think helps it from running off your hair when applying.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is thick and coats all of my hair.</li>
            <li> I have naturally thick hair</li>
            <li> A true testament about this conditioner, is that I needed a haircut so bad before testing this item - and now after a couple weeks of using it, no one could ever tell!!!  </li>
            <li> or if I use the wrong product - I will admit that I was concerned that this moisture condidtioner was going to leave my hair weighed down and oily looking.</li>
            <li> The subtle scent was not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I typically buy expensive Shampoo and Conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about trying Vidal Sassoon products, but I was in a pinch.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Liked it, but not necessarily loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If the shampoo was complete crap</li>
            <li> I have thin curly hair, so I need lots of moisture to add weight to my curls.</li>
            <li> Conditioning, you&#x27;re doing it wrong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I can not use it.</li>
            <li> I rinse with cold water to lock in shine and moisture.  </li>
            <li> One thing my hair desperately needs is moisture.</li>
            <li> In the winter I suffer from staticky hair which drives me crazy when I take off my hat.  </li>
            <li> I was wrong!</li>
            <li> With fall and winter in the air the cold weather always flops my hair!  </li>
            <li> Disappointed!</li>
            <li> expensive Shampoo and Conditioners and Hello Vidal Sassoon!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was gifted a lovely Vidal Sassoon gift pack from Voxbox with shampoo, conditioner and heat &amp; protect spray.I was a little skeptical about trying Vidal Sassoon products, but I was in a pinch. I must say, Im very impressed! I have long, thick, wavy, frizzy hair. A simple shampoo and conditioning- My hair is smoothe and beautiful. It didnt weigh it down and pull the wave out, just calmed the frizz and made it silky smooth. Im quite Impressed! I love how light the conditioner is. I will definitly be buying it in the future!</li>
            <li> I received this conditioner for to review, and I was pleasantly surprised. I love hair product, and gravitate to higher end brands, so this was a stretch to try and I really liked it! The smell is fantastic, I have thick hair and only needed a minimal amount to work through my hair. The product left my hair soft, shiny and workable. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a drugstore brand that works well.</li>
            <li> makes my hair so soft...smells nice and WORKS!! Cant beat the price for a drugstore product with high end results</li>
            <li> This conditioner is one of the best ones I&#x27;ve found recently!  The smell is amazing!  It really works out any tangles in the shower and leaves my hair super soft and manageable after a shower. My hair is thin and color treated so this product works wonders to help trap in moisture and make my hair look fabulous!</li>
            <li> This one was a little hard to review. Overall I liked this conditioner. It did the job and added some nice moisture into my hair and my hair did feel great in the end and looked nice. The smell of it though put me off. It reminded me of a medical lab or doctors office. It didn&#x27;t smell at all like the shampoo that goes with it which really did smell nice. Overall it did work great though but delivery could have been better with a pleasant smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this as part of Influenster&#x27;s VoxBox program.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry hair and I am always looking for something to keep in the moisture. My curls are always frizzy and I am always concerned that certain conditioners will be extremely heavy on my curls. When I received this not only did it smell amazing, it made my curls look defined and moisturized. I really loved it. It kept my curls soft and bouncy. GREAT JOB Vidal Sassoon!! Thank you. You have a fan now!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this conditioner. I have extremely thick, course hair, and am constantly looking for something that will actually make brushing my hair out less of a task! This does the job-- it makes my hair really manageable, easy to brush, and smells great!</li>
            <li> Was a great product left hair feeling clean and soft. Would definately purchase.</li>
            <li> Received this conditioner through Influenster and I was surprisingly happy with the smell. Often I buy shampoo/conditioner combos and the conditioner smell is overpowering. You won&#x27;t get that with this conditioner. It has a lighter fragrance than the shampoo and compliments it nicely. The feeling it left my hair with was clean and tangle free. I have thick, most of the time unruly hair and with the humidity in south TX it can be almost impossible to have a good hair day! Love it, and will be buying in the future!</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner. It&#x27;s great quality for the price. I have really thick hair that can get dry on the ends, and this gets the job done. It makes my hair feel very soft and moisturized. I don&#x27;t feel like I need to use a lot of leave-in conditioner when I use this. This was sent to me from Influenster. Regardless, all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Great news for people with fine, color treated hair. Vidal Sassoon has the answer to flat hair caused by super moisturizing conditioners! This conditioner rinses clean but makes my hair feel soft and shiny. This is a great daily use moisturizer, although I might still recommend a deep weekly treatment. The conditioner smells great, and performs like a salon quality product at drugstore prices. I only recently tried the VS line of products through Influenster, and I am glad I did. The products are in line with the long time salon quality reputation of the brand. Will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I have very short hair. The problem I often run into is that conditioners weigh down the little bit of hair I have. The lift I love so much is gone. That is NOT the case with this conditioner. The first time I used it, I had to rinse for a few extra minutes. My hair was so soft that it felt like it still had conditioner in it! After drying, I found that my hair still has the lift I enjoy so much and feels really great. I love this conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive a free sample of this product, but all opinions are my own. I will be buying some for sure because I really do like it that much.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy hair. I use a hot flat iron on my hair daily, and it gets damaged easily. That&#x27;s why I am always searching for conditioners that add moisture to my otherwise dry damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this conditioner repeatedly with the same results! It always leaves my hair smooth, shiny, soft, and moisturized. After using this conditioner I can immediately tell a difference.&lt;br /&gt;I love the way my hair looks and feels after using both the shampoo and conditioner together, so I will be keeping these products in my shower.&lt;br /&gt;Iâ€™m one happy costumer, will killer hair!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for extra soft, tangle free conditioner, then this Sassoon Conditioner is perfect for you. If you remember cream-rinses or when we use to call certain conditioners cream-rinses, this is exactly what this is. My long hair is extremely soft after use and is easy comb through after my shower and at the end of the day. Though I would not recommend this to anyone with curly or flat hair as it will weigh you down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> This is conditioner took my post-shower hair comb from 20 long minutes to just 7 or 8 for which I&#x27;m thrilled. I have long, fine hair and finding a conditioner that eliminates knots but doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair is always a challenge. I received a sample of this conditioner to sample for no charge, but will definitely be buying a full-size bottle as it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells great and leaves my bi-racial daughter&#x27;s hair so soft.  We have struggled to find a good smelling, thick, and frizz reducing conditioner--but this product is all 3.</li>
            <li> Awesome conditioner. I switched out my normal conditioner for Vidal Sassoon and  I love how it made my hair soft and smooth for days. Also was less tangles.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.  My color treated hair feels soft and manageable, and smells lovely.  A great bargain for such a luscious product.  Paired with the shampoo it is the perfect treat for winter dry hair.  Static and flyway&#x27;s will be a thing of the past.  I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> This conditioner does what it says.  It definitely moisturizes my hair.  But it smells amazing!  My HUSBAND even said, &amp;#34;What&#x27;s that smell?  It smells really good!&amp;#34;  I told him it was my hair.  Now he says my hair smells good. :)  I will keep buying this conditioner for sure!  I tested this product at no cost, but my opinions (and my husband&#x27;s opinion) are definitely my own.</li>
            <li> So, I have tried the Vidal Sassoon Pro Series Moisture Lock Conditioner for one week now (i also have the matching shampoo) and i have to say that i have seen a difference in my usually frizzy and dull hair. first off the smell is great, it doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling like a teenager but more like a put together 20-40  year old, meaning not really sweet and fruity. Second, it is really thick and feels like you are locking in whatever moisture you already have. I have no complaints about this product it does what it says and its super affordable.</li>
            <li> I began using this last week.  Both the shampoo and conditioner smell very nice. The price point is a good buy. It works well, however using too much can make your hair almost too moisturized, and that can lead to puffy hair. Keep it a quarter size amount and youll find it works nicely.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this conditioner from Influenster, for the purpose of reviewing.&lt;br /&gt; I have to admit that I was impressed! It left my hair shiny and soft... not heavy, or &amp;#34;greasy-looking...&amp;#34; and smelled fantastic (it reminds me of honeysuckles).&lt;br /&gt;  I have extremely long hair, and it tends to get frizzy and unruly. This conditioner made the combing process MUCH quicker and less painful, and my hair kept its bounce because it wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;weighed down&amp;#34; under the weight of my conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;  Especially when combined with the matching shampoo and heat spray, this product is a winner!</li>
            <li> I have really curly, long, full hair and have to use a ton of conditioner every time I wash my hair.  Not with this product!  I use about half of what I normally would use with my regular conditioner.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and it makes it very manageable and soft.  I really love how it smells and it holds the smell all day long in your hair.  I use this product along with the Moisture Lock Shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is a great conditioner! I have really long and thick hair that can be unruly at times. This conditioner helped detangle and smooth it out beautifully. I am very pleasantly surprised by this product. I received it complimentary of influenster for testing purposes and im very happy that I did!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Moisture Lock shampoo and conditioner for a week now. My hair was getting very dry and brittle since I swim two-thxree times a week. Using the shampoo and conditioner tighter, my hair is so much more healthy and alive. People at work asked if I got highlights done. I haven&#x27;t in over a year. It brings such lightness to my hair. Love it</li>
            <li> This was effectively conditioning and left my hair smoother  and with no fly aways and seemed to make my split ends less obvious. Also, I liked that even though I have baby fine hair, it wasn&#x27;t overly heavy, so it didn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> After shampoo my color treated and heat damaged hair really needs pampering so I deep condition.  This conditioner is so good, my hair absorbs it and loves it.  I finger detangle knots, my fingers glide right through, that&#x27;s a plus for me if a conditioner does that.  I rinse with cold water to lock in shine and moisture.  This conditioner helps that crucial step in my hair care.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands and this one doesn&#x27;t leave a slimy film on my hair, my shower etc, not this one, it rinses clean.  It smells so good too!! Definitely purchasing a big bottle of this!&lt;br /&gt;  I tested this product for free, and all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> The smell was a major turn off for me. It smelled very mechanical. I&#x27;m not sure how else to describe it. It didn&#x27;t have as much slip as I would have preferred with my conditioners. However, it got the job done on my AA naturally curly hair. I would only purchase again if in a major pinch. I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I was used to taming my hair in the crazy humidity of south Florida and when we moved it completely screwed me up.  I&#x27;ve tried a few different new shampoos and conditioners in order to adjust to the new weather and it&#x27;s been a challenge but this worked!  It is really creamy and it washes out fully leaving my hair feeling clean and shiny without any build-up or waxy feeling.  It also keeps my frizzy flyaways at bay even after I&#x27;ve worn a hat. I&#x27;m a big fan of this now that I&#x27;ve tried it.  Loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I tested this product as part of a campaign by Vidal Sassoon but all opinions expressed are my own*</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and flyaway and this conditioner made my hair very soft without weighing it down. It also smells nice. I would highly recommend it. I recieved this for free to try but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I recently was given this product to review. I have very very dry hair because of the extensive bleaching and dyeing of my hair and then I continue to color it myself once the bright funky colors fade. I washed my hair last night with the shampoo first and then used the conditioner first it smelled really good and second it made my hair feel so soft! I will be buying this product soon</li>
            <li> I recive this product for testing and review complimentary with my personal thoughts, I used this on my hair and wad happy with the outcome, I did mmmmm otice the difference in the  smooth texture and the touch of the moisture it add, I did have to use a lot because of the thickness and lengh of my hair, I like it and do  .  Plan on useing it.</li>
            <li> This item clearly performs at expected level.  It made my hair feel soft and not dry! I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I looooove this conditioner! However I don&#x27;t like the taste. haha When I opened the cap to my trial size to smell to decipher the scent it squirted out onto my upper lip, then fell onto my chin and onto my chest. Conditioning, you&#x27;re doing it wrong. Aaanyways! The smell is great, it smells very similar to the shampoo, fresh and ozone-y, but it also has a hint of sweetness. It just smells lovely and trust me, I can still smell it well! I actually don&#x27;t use the conditioner and shampoo in a traditional way, although it works well using it traditionally, my hair much prefers reverse washing! That is instead of shampooing my hair first I use conditioner. I apply it and let it sit as usual, but instead of rinsing it out I apply my shampoo and shampoo it out then rinse. My hair loves this combo and this conditioner leaves my hair soft and silky and much more manageable. My hair is very dry, thin and frizzy, it&#x27;s very damaged from all of the bleaching it&#x27;s gone through and continues to go through. Normally it&#x27;s a tangled frizzy mess. Since I started using this conditioner(and the shampoo!) my hair has just been so much nicer. It&#x27;s not perfect, I mean come on it gets bleached regularly, ain&#x27;t gonna happen, but it&#x27;s so nice! I really recommend this conditioner! I will be picking up a bottle when I run out of my trial size. I went to a few stores today and priced this and the shampoo and was really happy to see that they&#x27;re both under $4! At one store it was around $3.60 something. That&#x27;s really great for my wallet! I am incredibly pleased to have found something that makes my hair nice and isn&#x27;t expensive, plus it&#x27;s easy to find!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a trial size bottle of this from Influenster to try, but not to worry all opinions are my own. I really do love it, it&#x27;s an awesome product! (The before and after photo is after using this conditioner and it&#x27;s partner shampoo along with the heat protector spray)</li>
            <li> I have very thick, natural, curly hair. I am extremely picky about what I use on my hair. My curls are really tight and can be dry at times. I used the Vidal Sassoon Moisture Lock conditioner and it was absolutely amazing! I used the Moisture Lock shampoo then the conditioner. I immediately saw a difference in my hair after washing out the conditioner. My curls were super soft, bouncy and the comb ran through my hair with no problem. Usually it takes me a long time to comb out my hair. I honestly was surprised this product worked so well and saved me time. I tested this product at no cost but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that is somewhat oily if I don&#x27;t wash it everyday or if I use the wrong product - I will admit that I was concerned that this moisture condidtioner was going to leave my hair weighed down and oily looking. Nope - this one does the job and I don&#x27;t feel oily at all!  And another added plus is that this conditioner smells so yummy - fresh &amp; clean.  I love how soft and silky my hair feels.  I used this product everyday for two weeks prior to writing this review - this is my new go-to conditioner!    A true testament about this conditioner, is that I needed a haircut so bad before testing this item - and now after a couple weeks of using it, no one could ever tell!!!  Also, I liked it so much, I went out and bought more already!    As a member of Influenster, I received this product free to test and review. Even though I was part of a program that provided me the samples of this product for free - the above review is comprised solely of my opinions of the product.</li>
            <li> I used this product several times but I noticed immediately how much softer it made my hair. I have such dry, coarse hair so I definitely didn&#x27;t expect a drugstore brand to make that much of a difference. I was pleasantly surprised by this conditioner and I would definitely consider repurchasing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> As a member of Influenster, I received the Pro Series Moisture Lock Conditioner as a free sample to test and review. I really enjoyed using this product. I have long and naturally wavy hair, so I style it by blowdrying and using a flat iron. This moisture lock conditioner worked well in protecting and moisturizing my hair. I love the smell of this conditioner and it was thick and creamy without weighing down my hair. I did leave the conditioner in my hair for a couple of minutes to really allow the product to saturate and condition my hair. If you are looking for a great &amp;#34;drug store&amp;#34; hair product, look no further!</li>
            <li> One thing my hair desperately needs is moisture. After years of color treating (and perms in my younger days) my hair it is seriously dry and frizzy. The Vidal Sassoon Pro Series Moisture Lock Conditioner is giving my hair what it craves... moisture. My hair is manageable and frizz-free. I am very happy with the results I&#x27;m getting from the conditioner! I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I was only able to use this conditioner twice, since I used a trial size bottle.  I have thick, medium length hair, so I need quite a bit of conditioner.  I loved how soft and healthy my hair felt after I used it!  After using the trial size, I bought a full size bottle to use.  :)  Highly recommended for thick, dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested this product at no cost to me, but the opinions expressed here are solely my own.</li>
            <li> I tested this product for free, but all opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner is good. It made my hair softer, but didn&#x27;t give me the moisture I had expected. The smell was nice. I only used the conditioner mid-hair to the ends because that is where I needed it most. Overall, it is a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> no significant effect</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think that this did anything for my hair that most other conditioners don&#x27;t. My hair was soft and fairly shiny, but nothing about it made it stand out. I did like that it took very little conditioner to get all of my hair saturated with product.</li>
            <li> This product had a great smell and it left my hair soft enough to blow out without leaving it frizzy.  It really helped my damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;I tested this product at no cost and all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. This smells good like the shampoo, but I am a little disappointed in this being that is doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;condition&amp;#34; my hair and leave it feeling smooth after use, as others. Could be my hair is really dry, but I felt more of a difference with the shampoo and heat protector than I did with this.</li>
            <li> I was so happy when I got chosen to get this product to test for free from Influenster.  I have been faithful to my normal brand for years and was nervous to try something new but I am pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone.  It left my hair feeling smooth and silky soft along with having a great fragrance.  I also like the act that it was easily rinsed out some products can take forever this one does not.</li>
            <li> I used this product after shampooing with the VS Moisture Shampoo and I instantly felt like a moisture shield around each strand. I have thin curly hair, so I need lots of moisture to add weight to my curls. Otherwise my hair looks like a cotton puff as it is so light and frizzy. Recommend this product for all the curly hair girls out there.</li>
            <li> I received s sample set of the shampoo and conditioner from Influenster Vox Box and I have been amazed at how well the set works! The shampoo leaves your hair squeaky clean and soft. So much you almost feel like you don&#x27;t need the conditioner! But when you add the conditioner, you get hair that is tamed. Mine can get frizzy when it air dries and I have NOT had that problem with this set.Add the heat control spray and you have a trio that really works to keep the frizzies at bay!</li>
            <li> I love this product, I washed and conditioned my hair first with the Moisture Lock products. Then I use the Heat &amp; Protect Spray Then I flat iron my hair just about everyday and it is thick and fizzy, but I used this and it leaves my hair shining and looking so healthy, and there is no heavy residue left on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I Love theses products!!!</li>
            <li> I would love to give this product 5 stars because I love the way it makes my hair feel. I like to wash my hair first and leave the conditioner in while I wash the rest of my body. It gives the conditioner time to soak into the hair and make it silky smooth. My only complaint with this product is the smell. It has such a strong chemical smell. To be honest it is rather nauseating. If you were able to fix the smell it would be a 5 star product</li>
            <li> My hair looked and felt amazing.  I love the value.  The smell was amazing.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is absolutely the best scented conditioner that i&#x27;ve used in a while!!  Normally I use a huge palm-full sized amount of other conditioners however this product i only really need a small walnut sized amount...my hair is very frizzy normally and the ends feel like straw most of the time...this is has really changed how my hair feels..it&#x27;s so shiny, not frizzy, the ends are soft, plus the scent is just fresh and wonderful.  I was sent this conditioner for testing purposes at no cost to me.BUT all opinions are MY own.</li>
            <li> Used this along with the Moisture Lock shampoo and the Heat &amp; Protect Shine spray and was very happy with the results.  My hair was super soft, smooth, healthy- looking and smelled good.  Formula is a little heavy for everyday use on my fine hair as it weighs it down a little, but I would definitely purchase to use as a once a week treatment or for using when I wanted an ultra smooth look.</li>
            <li> I really love using this conditioner. The formula is thick which I think helps it from running off your hair when applying. I rinsed using both cold and hot water and had the same results, soft and silky!</li>
            <li> I used this conditioner for the 1st time yesterday . I used it after Vidal Sassoon shampoo and I loved it. It smelled great , rinsed away easily and no heavy residue feeling . My hair was extremely soft . It still smells good today too !</li>
            <li> I received my Vidal Sassoon VoxBox with generous sized free samples!  This conditioner made my hair feel and look great without a greasy feeling.  I use to use an additional leave in conditioner for my long hair but don&#x27;t need it with the Vidal Sassoon Pro Series Moisture conditioner!  I&#x27;m getting some for my daughter and her long hair too!</li>
            <li> My hair is no longer dull or dry and I have to thank this conditioner for it. As soon as I applied it, I liked how it made my hair feel smooth and silky. I was happily surprised when the feeling stayed even after I rinsed the hair. This product really locks moisture and makes your hair feel hydrated. I first tested this product at no cost, but I liked it so much that I went to buy a big bottle. This is how much I liked it. *These opinions are my own**</li>
            <li> What a great product! I absolutely love the smell, and how it leaves my hair feeling very soft afterwards! I have hair down to my waist and it is hard to manage at times but this left it manageable. I tested this product at no cost  but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> great smell..&lt;br /&gt;i washed my hair with jus this conditioner alone and it left my hair very soft and manageable. also was a great detangler for my hair while wet</li>
            <li> Love the smell and it really helps my hair be soft (and clean!)  Perfect for me!</li>
            <li> The moisture lock products broke my scalp out. The scents is wonderful, and left my hair feeling fantastic. Unfortunately I can not use it.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner I used this and the shampoo. I received it for free to try out and was a little leary at first to be trying a new shampoo and conditioner... But they work great for my thick hair. My hair tends to be dry and nothing ever seems to work. With this product it leaves my hair feeling moistured and not the weighed down oily feeling that some moisture shampoos and conditioners can cause. On top of that it smells amazing... If you have thick dry hair you need to try this product because it worked for me...</li>
            <li> I have a short hairstyle and my hair often feels dry during the day and oily at night. I&#x27;ve been using the Moisture Lock Conditioner for two weeks now and I love it! My hair is smooth and silky without being oily. It lathers well and the smell is neutral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful for dry and damaged hair! It locks in that lost moisture and makes your hair more manageable!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner!! I typically use morrocan oil type products, but I got the Vidal Sassoon shampoo and conditioner is a recent VoxBox, and was pleasantly surprised! My normally dry, frizzy hair is now soft and silky!! I&#x27;m totally switching over!&lt;br /&gt;I did receive these products for free, but the opinions are my own. :-)</li>
            <li> Vidal Sassoon locks moisture on my hair so good to fully control my frizzy hair. The moisture, smooth and silk feel without the heavy excess of greasy hair. I apply the conditioner right after I shampoo my hair, then rinse and  let air dry. This conditioner has formulated products perfectly combined for my hair to stay manageable and strong.</li>
            <li> What a great product! I absolutely love the smell, and how it leaves my hair feeling very soft afterwards! I have super thick, curly, frizzy hair.. and this product really helps to smooth it out. Definitely my go-to hair conditioner from now on. I tested this product at no cost (complimentary of Influenster) but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Great!! I have long, frizzy/curly hair and this conditioner left my hair soft and managable. Smells great too!!</li>
            <li> For awhile I need to dry, straight or curl my hair, Now on  my new &amp;#34;rock my natural hair&amp;#34; and loving it. It give shine, control on my wild hair. Totally buy more.</li>
            <li> I actually loved this product very much. I recieved it as a trial along with the shampoo and will be buying it on my next run to the store. It made my hair feel very nice. In love :)</li>
            <li> Lightweight  moisture smooths and softens with weighing hair down or effecting texture negatively.  Smells delicious!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I color my hair and I heat style it everyday. My hair had been losing its luster and shine. It also had become very dry, brittle and frizzy. Vidal Sassoons Pro Series Moisture Lock Conditioner has helped my hair become healthy looking. It is no longer dry and brittle and I do not have to deal with the frizz any longer. This happened after a short time of using this product. I also would suggest using the Vidal Sassoon Pro Series Moisture Lock Shampoo. It is my experience that using both products together you will get the maximum benefit from the product. Along with all of the other benefits that I have mentioned...THIS PRODUCT SMELLS FANTASTIC!!! And not only does the moisturizing lock into your hair but the smell does as well! Such a PLUS!&lt;br /&gt;I received this product to test out at no cost to myself. My opinions are solely based on my own personal experience while using this product and are true and honest.</li>
            <li> Loved this product!! It made my hair easy to run my fingers through when I was done. No knotting or greasy feeling. It works well with the shampoo. I will be using this product from now on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner a couple of times now and I must say, I am liking it!! I&#x27;ve been using it after shampooing and it definitely get the job done! Helps detangle my knotty hair and leaves it feeling soft. I do find, however, that leaves white residue when hair dries, I am not sure if it&#x27;s film or dandruff, though I rinse it out thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I like trying rinse out conditioners for conditioner wash - rinsing the hair with a rinse out conditioner instead of using a harsh, sulfate shampoo. This conditioner worked well. My hair felt hydrated and there was no product buildup. I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are that of my own.</li>
            <li> As I have gotten older and years of coloring my hair, the moisture in my hair is non-existant. I have used this moisturizer now 4 times and love how it makes my hair look and feel.  Even though I have somewhat oily hair, the ends are just dry and lifeless, but not anymore after using this conditioner. It brings back the moisture without adding to the oiliness of my roots. It smells amazing as well.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome Conditioner! It leaves the hair soft and well moisturized and has a great creamy consistency, It smells awesome with a soothing floral undertone. I have natural 3C hair and this conditional definitely makes a easier to de-tangle in the shower (A must for most naturals!) I will definitely keep this conditioner in my Hair Care arsenal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://youtu.be/1UrqOE94V_M</li>
            <li> I used it in place of my normal conditioner.  It made my hair very soft and manageable.  It has a nice soft scent so you don&#x27;t have to worry if you don&#x27;t liked scented conditioners.  I received this as a Sample from Influenster and I love it.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing conditioner. I didn&#x27;t even realize that my hair could be fixed. It was so fuzzy and fly-away. After using this conditioner, my hair was smooth and conditioned and it smells great. My son couldn&#x27;t stop smelling it. I would totally recommend this to everyone. I got this as a product test from Influenster. Thanks</li>
            <li> Now, I am very picky about conditioners.  I have oily hair near my scalp and dry ends.  So I look for conditioners that aren&#x27;t heavy and leave oily residue, but are good enough to leave my ends silky and soft.  This conditioner does that!  My ends are super dry and get tangled really easily now that I am growing my hair out.  Due to my  oily scalp, I do wash my hair every  morning.  This conditioner seem to help my ends stay healthy.  If you like the &#x27;clean&#x27; smell you will like this product.  It&#x27;s not fruity or flowery.  It is just a nice light smell. I did receive this product to review at no cost to me.  This review is my own honest opinion of the product.</li>
            <li> I received this product from Influenster to test.  This product did not add or keep any moisture for me. I color my hair religiously every 8 weeks and my hair tends to be on the dryer side.  The claim is that it \\&quot;cleanses and quenches hair&#x27;s thirst, helping to seal in moisture and leaving hair soft and silky\\&quot; and \\&quot;to help prevent dry or damaged-looking hair\\&quot;.  I used the conditioner along with the shampoo for over a week and for me it just didn&#x27;t work.  It smells great but for me it didn&#x27;t perform.  I received this product from Influenster to test.</li>
            <li> I received this as a free sample for review from Infuenster VoxBox and it was awesome!  It has such a nice scent to it and didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling heavy and oily.  The conditioner rinses clean and when my hair dried, it was so much softer!!!! A must have!</li>
            <li> I have very dry and natural curly hair. I used the Moisture Lock series and WOW, my hair looks and feels great! The shampoo had a faint smell that was nice. The conditioner though, the scent was much stronger and smelled amazing! I could feel the moisture locking in on the very first use! Most definitely recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> I received a sample size of this complimentary from a Influenster Voxbox to try...&lt;br /&gt;I really loved this conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very long, thick, &amp; wavy..it left my hair smooth, soft, &amp; silky....&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend you try this conditioner!!!!</li>
            <li> I must say that this product works as advertised. It really does lock in moisture and leaves my hair feeling super soft. The smell is also great. I love the new line of products that they have made for all hair types, plus this is a company that has a long history of selling quality products for affordable prices. Overall, I really like using the whole set together to get the full effect. Thanks! :)</li>
            <li> I love the way this conditioner made my hair feel. It was really soft and also felt healthier. I used this together with the shampoo and the heat &amp; protect spray. Love all the products together!</li>
            <li> Im always in the market for a good conditioner because I have SUPER dry hair.. This stuff i received free from influenster for testing purposes is AMAZING.. It made my hair feel super soft and manageable :)</li>
            <li> I love any thing that takes knots out or smooths my hair makes it shiny or soft and silky I love conditioner its the best stuff ever made for people who have sensitive hair scalp my hair use to be long so my head was very sensitive to combing or brushing it and I use to scream and yell but when my mom started using conditioner on my hair I feel in love so one day she took me to the store and told me to pick out some hair products when I was like 16 years old I picked Vidal sasson and now I am 39 and still loving it cause i know it works Great!</li>
            <li> great conditioner I have damage hair since I use the straightener a lot so my hair got damage but with this conditioner my hair is going back to life, is looking and feeling great again like I have a treatment is really a good product, after a few days of using the product I can see the difference on my hair and the product in combination with Vidal Sassoon shampoo works even better, it moisture my hair so doesn&#x27;t look dry and dull anymore, now looks like I have a salon treatment without spending all the money. I got the product for free to tested in exchange of my honest opinion and I recommend the product 100%</li>
            <li> Really good conditioner. This is a thick conditioner that you can still use daily. It&#x27;s super moisturizing &amp; smells great too. I used with the moisture lock shampoo &amp; loved my hair after this! Soft, shiny &amp; smelled clean.</li>
            <li> I have been using this conditioner along with the shampoo for a about a week. I really like it- so far I haven&#x27;t felt like it weighs down my hair- but at the same time, my hair feels really moisturized and soft. Not only does this product work well- it smells fantastic! Scent is always a huge factor for me- I like the fresh scent, and its not overwhelming! I did test this product at no cost, but the opinions i have shared are my own</li>
            <li> smelled great and definitely added a lot of moisture to my natural curls... i am going to use once a month or so as the moisture lasted for a while. i don&#x27;t like using bath products with sodium laurel sulfate and other chemicals due to skin cancer in my family, so I won&#x27;t use this regularly. if it didn&#x27;t have SLS, i would!</li>
            <li> The conditioner worked pretty good. I used it after the Moisture Lock Shampoo by Vidal Sassoon. My hair feels mousterized and tame, but I can not get over the generic smell. For a Pro Series it think it should have a powerful punch of something splendidly pleasing to the nose.    I did receive this product in an Influenster voxbox for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner because it leaves my hair silky and soft, without weighing it down.  It smells really great, and best of all it is totally affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a test bottle at no cost for the purposes of reviewing, and all opinions my own.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;This stuff makes my hair so soft and it just flows very nicely onto my shoulders. For the past 20 years I have had frizzy hair that I had to straighten because my waves were so frizzy. Someone told me today that I looked glamorous. That has never been said to me before!</li>
            <li> I can remember using Vidal Sassoon shampoo and conditioner way back when, when it came in a large dark brown bottle.  This new pro series moisture lock conditioner and shampoo is a brand new way to treat your hair! I have color-treated, thick, short hair, so certain brands tend to reak havoc on my hair, causing it to become dry and brittle, not Vidal Sassoon&#x27;s Pro Series Moisture Lock Shampoo &amp; Conditioner.  I noticed a difference within just a few days of using the products, with how my hair felt and looked.  The texture of my hair is softer and silkier than previous, and it just feels so nice when I run my hand through it.  I would definitely recommend trying Vidal Sassoon&#x27;s Pro Series Moisture Lock Shampoo and Conditioner, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had the opportunity to try these products at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this as my everyday conditioner. I use it with the shampoo and it is the great combination. My hair does not feel frizzy, heavy, or anything now. I love that this is a great price and I can get my hair the same as it was using a more expensive brand. Definitely will be buying it again!</li>
            <li> I only put conditioner on my ends due to an oily scalp, and so for me, a conditioner has to protect without getting me greasy. This did a great job on that, without weighing down my REALLY fine hair. You do have to rinse is very thoroughly, though...it&#x27;s a bit clingy, which I actually consider a good thing. I paired it with the accompanying shampoo, and that really does maximize the effect...trying it again with a different product yielded less fabulous results. The best thing, though, other than the wonderful scent, was that my hair stayed clean-feeling into the next day. This is a major plus to me, as I prefer not to wash my hair every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given products by Influenster for testing and review purposes. My opinions and day-old hair are my own.</li>
            <li> I am big on trying hair products out. I value my hair and want to keep it at perfect shape. When trying VS Pro Series Conditioner, the results have been wonderful! I really think for my my haircare needs (very dry). I also have oily roots at the same time. I used it on my ends. If your hair is dry through and through, you might have to use it all over for different results. I really like how the VS Products are very hydrating for hair. I&#x27;m always looking for conditioners that do a great job at detangling but not leave a heavy feeling. This conditioner does not leave a heavy feeling. This conditioner fully exceeded my expectations as a conditioner. It is not a super thick formula so it makes it easy to distribute through hair where you need it. It rinses easily as well, after I&#x27;ve rinsed it from my hair leaving it feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I am not a big conditioner type of person. It always seems to add to the already tangles in my hair, but once I tried Vidal Moisture Lock conditioner, I felt a huge difference. I used it twice and I noticed the change in my hair and the time it took to style it. I am in love.</li>
            <li> Received this in my Influenster Vox Box and am grateful I did. The thing I loved the most about it was you did not need loads of it to get the job done. It also smells amazing and I can tell it has began to help repair my hair. I will be buying this in the future.</li>
            <li> The Moisture Lock line is the best. This conditioner is thick and coats all of my hair. It smells good and works great. I am a new fan of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I got to try this free but I will be buying more I have been telling my friends of the visible difference . My hair looks moisturized. It is bouncy and soft and has life again</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this conditioner - along with the shampoo - as an incentive for a review. I will Definitely be buying this in the larger size. My hair is just passed my shoulders, thick, takes forever to blow dry and often ends up feeling dried out from coloring and too much heat.  This conditioner turned my dry, split ends, fly away hair into smooth silk. My hair is soft, smooth, and less frizz. The smell is nice too. I will be using the whole regimen of shampoo, conditioner, heat protect spray.  It really is salon quality.</li>
            <li> Was really happy with this conditioner. My hair felt sqeaky clean and for it not being from the salon im very pleased with it!</li>
            <li> i loved this conditioner. i used it right after shampooing my hair with moisture lock shampoo and it had a lot of slip. I was able to detangle my hair with it with no problem and after i rinsed it, my hair my hair still felt soft. the only problem i had was 50 ml bottle and it was only enough to do 1 section of my hair because i have very thick hair. I received the product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I love when a new product comes out and does exactly what it says it will do! My hair has never been extremely dry or frizzy but it definitely is always in need of additional moisture. Conditioners I have tried in the past always left my hair feeling weighed down, really heavy. Vidal Sassoon&#x27;s Moisture Lock Conditioner is the complete opposite! It allows my hair to get the deep conditioning it is yearning for while at the same time keeping my strands light and airy. I love the smell of the product and its texture, not too thick not too thin. While using it you can definitely tell the conditioner is coating each and every strand. Will recommend this product to my friends and family for sure. I do want to mention that I tested this product at no cost, but all opinions are my own. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> this stuff works really well if you need added moisture.</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells nice and left my hair feeling smooth and moisturized.. This is a great product and it left my hair feeling very nice. My hair tends to be weighed down by heavy conditioners and I didnâ€™t have that problem with this product.  The price point for this conditioner is great, so I would definitely consider purchasing it in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I love This product. My hair is damaged from drying and dying and is often very dry. Vidal Sassoon Pro Series Moisture Lock Conditioner has been very nice for my hair. It gives my hair the appearance of being healthier and shiny. I will be using this a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> the shampoo and conditioner are just amazing, I am so loving how my hair feels and looks since I started using these products. I never thought I would be able to control the frizz and dryness and now I can, my hair is so shiny and manageable now thanks to VS.</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my hair feel and smell. My hair was starting to dry out from my old product but this has renewed the moisture in my hair and now it is soft and silky smooth, not to mention it smells amazing. My old conditioner is in the trash and this has replaced it. I don&#x27;t have to worry if my hair will look and feel clean because it always is thanks to this conditioner. This is the only conditoner I will use now because I always know my hair will look, feel and smell it&#x27;s best.&lt;br /&gt;I received the product above for free to review. All opinions are honest and my own.</li>
            <li> I love this Conditioner! I used this conditioner for a week and I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. I have combination hair (oily scalp and dry ends) and I never know what to expect from moisturizing conditioner. I only put conditioner on the ends of my hair and sometimes my hair continues to feel dry and brittle on the ends. Not this one. My hair feels fantastic. I would recommend this to anyone. I tried this product out at no cost to me and the opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells nice and left my hair feeling smooth and moisturized..  My hair tends to be weighed down by heavy conditioners and I didnâ€™t have that problem with this product. The price point for this conditioner is great, so I would definitely consider purchasing it in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I have  fine, brittle , dry hair. This conditioner didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, it left no residue and I noticed it on my first try. I love it and recommend it. I also want to say , used with the shampoo and the styling spray, its amazing</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner!! Doesn&#x27;t even have to use a lot. I received a sample size to try and I didn&#x27;t think it would be enough for my thick hair! This conditioner instantly softened my hair! I love it. I think this will become my new staple must have conditioner! Hopefully it works just as good on my kids hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these products for a week now &amp; was pleasantly surprised at how well they worked. My hair is colored treated and dry by nature so I was really surprised at how well they worked for my hair, I would normally go for a more expensive brand but im happy to say I will be switching to Vidal Sassoon pro</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner! It leaves my hair feeling soft and smooth. I love the smell as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this conditioner two days in a row on my curly tangled hair. It smells wonderful and the texture is creamy. The first day I used it, my hair felt softer and was easier to comb. The second day I used it, my hair was silky. Combing took zero effort. I think after continued use, my hair will get softer. I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> The Vidal Sassoon Moisture Lock Conditioner smells really good, but it just doesn&#x27;t moisturize my hair like it needs moisturized.  I have long, thin, fine textured, loosely curled hair that needs extra special moisturizing.  I received a sample to try for free and it was really nice to try before buying.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve always had really dry and damaged hair due to coloring, overuse of heat, etc. It&#x27;s finally nice to find a product that rejuvenates my hair and really puts moisture back in it! Thanks Vidal Sassoon! And it smells good too!</li>
            <li> I am a person who needs a conditioner to pull double duty and detangle my hair as well as condition it. I need to be able to comb it in the shower. This did that and more! My air ended up soft and smooth. Thanks to VS for sending me a sample to try!</li>
            <li> I have recently used this product along with the Vidal Sassoon Moisture Lock Shampoo and I have had amazing results. I am so happy with this product and would highly recommend this to friends and family. This product left my hair feeling soft and manageable. I ran out of Shampoo and used the Conditioner with another brand and it still worked great! I ran out and bought this product along with the Shampoo. They have a lot of coupons and great prices.</li>
            <li> Overall I like the product and the way it makes my hair feel. The thickness of the conditioner is great, it&#x27;s not thin like some other brands. Honestly do not care for the smell very much, but other than that it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Interesting conditioner.  Not a bad smell at all but nothing that lingers.  I used this in place of my Moroccan Oil conditioner during my wash day routine and it performed well, not up to MO standards but decent.  I was expecting a little more from it in terms of moisturizing but I would like to use it again to be certain I wasn&#x27;t just making an unfair comparison to a different brand.  I did receive this product free to review to but the opinion is my own.</li>
            <li> Receiving this from Influenster was exciting a new line of Vidal Sassoon wow. I love this conditioner I wash my hair with the shampoo then I conditioned it left it about two minutes and my hair felt so smooth with it in my hair I finger detangle and it didn&#x27;t felt stripped. Then I washed it off and combed my hair let it air dry and went to bed. In the morning my hair still felt smooth, curls were intact and it smelled nice. I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> This is some of the best conditioner i have used in a while. I received this conditioner for free to try. I usually have to use much much more conditioner than i do shampoo. Not in this case. A little really did go a long way. That says a lot coming from me. I have thick, frizzy, coarse hair. This conditioner was good and thick, which is nice, however id did not weigh my hair down in anyway. I highly recommend this awesome conditioner, and i most def will be stocking up on this VS entire Moisture lock line.</li>
            <li> This Conditioner is perfect for anyone with curly or wavy Or frizzy hair, like me. I also am prone to an oily scalp even though I have very thick hair that looks dried out if I don&#x27;t use the right kinds of shampoos and conditioners and this conditioner was not to heavy in leaving my scalp greasy and heavy looking upon blow dry; but just enough silkiness to get the moisture lock I look for in conditioners.</li>
            <li> Vidal Sassoon Pro Series Moisture Lock Conditioner is fantastic. Not only does it make your hair smell great but it also makes it feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this conditioner! I tend to have a dry scalp from time to time and with winter fast approaching, I&#x27;m on the look out for products that will defend my scalp from the dry cold weather.&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner is rich, and creamy without weighing your hair down, which can be a big problem with other moisturizing conditioners. I have fine hair and a lot of it, and this conditioner left my hair feeling soft and healthy. My favorite thing is the scent. It is subtle and clean like a high end salon product and lasts for days, which is wonderful when you&#x27;re constantly on the go. I recommend this product to anyone who deals with dryness issues, whether it&#x27;s from chemical hair treatments, heat styling, or fighting against mother nature. Great for all hair types, Vidal Sassoon is definitely giving you a high quality product with an affordable price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**This product was sent to me for review at no cost. However, I will definitely be picking up some more because I truly love it :)</li>
            <li> I used this conditioner on two occasions, and it left my hair shiny and with a great silky feeling. I am growing my hair longer at the moment, and a good conditioner is important to me. It did a great job detangling my hair. I was very satisfied! I tested ths product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair and finding a conditioner that tames my locks and helps keep it looking manageable is hard to find. I tried the Vidal Sassoon Moisture Lock conditioner for a couple weeks, replacing my usual shampoos (Garnier, Dove, Aveda and Bumble &amp; Bumble).  The conditioner smells pleasant and rinsed easily from my hair leaving it feeling silky and manageable. I&#x27;m a fan! I tested this product at no cost and this review is 100% my opinion.</li>
            <li> This conditioner was amazing. It definitely locks in the moisture, keeping my unruly hair soft and smooth between washings. The subtle scent was not overpowering. It also worked well on my color treated hair, something I was nervous about. I would highly recommend pairing it with the Moisture lock shampoo, root lift spray and the repair heat protectant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided free of charge for testing purposes. Reviews are based completely on my opinions.</li>
            <li> It is not always easy to find a great moisturizing conditioner that has a formula that wont weigh it down or make it feel heavy. I love moisture yet volume. Shine yet manageability. That is why I love that I was able to find a product that gives me a natural healthy shine, that tames fly-a-ways, and wont weigh down my hair. I absolutely love this formula.</li>
            <li> Conditioners are a big deal in my haircare routine. I&#x27;m always on the lookout for rich, creamy conditioners that soften and moisturize my natural tresses that tend to be on the dry side. The VS Pro Series Moisture Lock Conditioner did a great job of softening and moisturizing my hair. It is thick without being goopy, absorbed well and provided good slip for easier detangling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I was provided a sample at no cost. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I received this conditioner from Influenster for review purposes.  I really like using this conditioner.  It&#x27;s very creamy and works great at moisturizing my thick hair.  After blowdrying, it was very soft and shiny.  I will definitely be buying some more.  It could have a more pleasing scent, but it works so well that scent is not an issue for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using Vidal Sassoon Pro Series Moisture Lock Conditioner for a few days now and can already tell a difference in my hair.  My hair was damaged from coloring and using a flat iron on it daily. After just a few days I can see my hair is softer with less split ends. Also, my hair is not as frizzy as it has been.  The damage from the flat iron is definitely clearing up.  I am very happy with this product and intend to keep using it.  I believe my damage will be gone after using this product for a few weeks.I tested this product for free, and all opinions are my own</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasently surprised by this product it smells ok, the conditioning process was very pleasing I have long hair and it did not weight it down it did moisturize and not make my hair feel dry. Good job Vidal Sassoon</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner! I have super dry hair and I am always using heat stylers. I am constantly looking for a hair product that will moisturize my hair. This conditioner makes my hair really soft throughout the entire day. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy at all. It&#x27;s lightweight. The conditioner is thick and creamy and smells good. I use this along with the shampoo and the Heat &amp; Protect spray. It&#x27;s a great combination for my hair.I would definitely recommend Vidal Sassoon Pro Series Moisture Lock Conditioner! I did receive this product in exchange for my hones opinion.</li>
            <li> I received the VIdal Sassoon Pro Series Moisture Lock Conditioner to try for free from Influenster. I really was hesitant to try this and not sure if this product would work for me because I have very fine, thin hair that is extremely dry. I was wrong! My hair ended up super soft and it did not make my hair greasy, which tends to happen with other conditioners It  also doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell and is very light, clean and refreshing. I think I have finally found a keeper!</li>
            <li> I used this conditioner as a part of a test group. This conditioner made my hair shiny, smooth, and soft. It was not dry and frizzy like when I used other, salon quality products. My hair stylist asked me what I had done differently to my hair. I told her I was using the Vidal Sassoon Moisture Lock shampoo and conditioner. She could not believe it. She said she would recommend this product to all of her clients. I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner it works better than the ones that cost much more money! It leaves your hair feeling soft and smelling great. &amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I will be buying this product on a regular basis!</li>
            <li> I have really long, not the good kind of wavy hair.  So I spend a lot of time blow drying and straightening my hair.  This conditioner made my hair super smooth and easier to brush while wet.  The scent wasn&#x27;t near as good as the accompanying shampoo, but that&#x27;s ok because the shampoo made up for it!  I could also tell a difference, in that my hair didn&#x27;t seem as frizzy as with other shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have used Vidal Sasson products in the past and hadn&#x27;t been too thrilled about the outcome. I was so excited to give this one a try! I have coarse dry hair and need all the moisture that I can get. The Moisture Lock Conditioner is great! It leaves my hair silky feeling and shiny! And it smells awesome as well! I believe that I am now a Vidal Sasson user!  I was able to try this product at no cost but the opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> This product works well on my color treated hair.  I find my hair to be dry after washing and this product helped keep it soft when used with the shampoo.  I was able to try this product free through Influester VoxBox and wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like it, but it works nicely.</li>
            <li> I think I am in love. My hair is more manageable and super soft with less flyaways. I love how I can get out of the shower towel dry my hair comb it with no problems and walk out the door. There is no need for additional products to add softness or body as this conditioner does it all.&lt;br /&gt;I was able to sample this product without cost but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product.  The conditioner added just the right about of moisture to my hair without making it feel greasy.  It smelled nice and overall an excellent product.  I did receive this product to test for free, all opinions expressed are my own.</li>
            <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I was skeptical that this conditioner would be right for my hair, since a lot of products that claim to moisturize weigh my hair down and make it look oily by the end of the day. However, this doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down; it keeps it soft and manageable all day long.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very long, and I was surprised that I didn&#x27;t have to use a lot of the product to properly coat my hair. It rinses clean fairly quickly, and my hair retains volume all day despite the fact that this is a moisturizing product; others would leave my hair looking limp after a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;I can definitely see myself buying more of this to use in the future! I am very pleased with my hair when using this product.</li>
            <li> I am a little torn on this product. I was given a chance to try this thanks to Infulenster! The conditioner is light weight and really makes my hair feel nice but I feel like I had to use more of this than my normal conditioner to get all the tangles out of my hair. I do have obnoxiously long and thick hair and usually use about a quarter size glob this took a little extra. BUT it works and it&#x27;s affordable so I might still use this product intermittently.</li>
            <li> Vidal Sassoon Moisture Lock Shampoo and Conditioner smells great and is a good value for the money.  You need very little to get a good lather on the shampoo and the conditioner works best if you use the smallest amount to coat the hair.  I have very thick straight hair and suffer from fly aways so  I need a shampoo that makes my hair feel soft and brushable not coarse and dry.  In the winter I suffer from staticky hair which drives me crazy when I take off my hat.  Using Vidal Sassoon Moisture Lock conditioner stopped the fly aways and the staticky hair.  It smells great and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  I would recommend it to anyone.  I was given the product to test and have decided that I like it and would purchase it and recommend it to my friends.  All these opinions are my one and truthful.  If the shampoo was complete crap I wouldn&#x27;t be caught dead telling people to buy it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this conditioner. First off, I won&#x27;t buy something for my hair that doesn&#x27;t have a great scent and this conditioner has a floral scent that lasts for days. Also, its nice and creamy so you don&#x27;t need much for it to go a long way. I have wavy to curly  hair that comes down to about the end of my shoulder blades and all I need is about a small palm size amount if that helps at all. I leave it on my hair for about 5 minutes before I rinse it off. My hairs ends up feeling soft and more manageable than it was before I washed it.  I do recommend using the shampoo which you can find here: http://www.amazon.com/Vidal-Sassoon-Moisture-Shampoo-Fluid/dp/B00B0RHJB0/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1412018093&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;vidal+sassoon+moisture+lock+shampoo&amp;utm_source&#x3D;influenster&amp;utm_source&#x3D;influenster&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product to test out at no cost to myself. My opinions are solely based on my own personal experience while using this product.</li>

            <li> I love the way this conditioner leaves my hair feeling. Soft and bouncy. Smells great too!</li>
            <li> I typically buy expensive Shampoo and Conditioner.  I tried Vidal Sassoon Shampoo and Conditioner and feel in love with this inexpensive product!  It smells great and the best part the conditioner left my hair soft yet not heavy like some other conditioners.  I would recommend this product to anyone that is looking for a great product at an inexpensive cost.  Goodbye expensive Shampoo and Conditioners and Hello Vidal Sassoon!!!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner!  My hair has been really flat and lifeless for months, then I tried this conditioner (and it&#x27;s coordinating shampoo),  My hair has been bouncy, shiny and fantastic ever since!  I have paid more than three times as much for conditioners that haven&#x27;t had results anywhere near what I have experienced from this one.  I have found my new favorite conditioner!</li>
            <li> This conditioner works really well on my curly hair to keep it moisturized and soft. I used the shampoo as well as the conditioner, and loved how I could tell a difference with my curls. The smell is great, too! I received the shampoo and conditioner for agreeing too share my opinion, however all views are my own.</li>
            <li> Not only do I color my hair, but I typically use a flat iron on it most days as well. So when I shop for conditioners, I&#x27;m looking for something that will really moisturizer my hair, and keep that moisture locked in for the whole day. This product did that for me. My hair was silky smooth when it dried, I could run my fingers through it and there were no kinks or rough patches, and the best part was that it stayed this way until the next time I washed it. The conditioner has a nice smell, which also stayed in my hair throughout the day. Sassoon offers a product comparable to salon quality ones for a fraction of the price, which is great for those of us on a budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I really liked this product and plan on continuing to use it.</li>
            <li> I was sent this product at no charge in return for a review and I&#x27;m so glad that I received it! I adore the smell of this conditioner and the way it makes my hair feel after use. I have coarse, dry hair due to lots of color treatment and it&#x27;s nice to find a conditioner that makes my hair soft once I&#x27;m out of the shower. I&#x27;m very happy with this product and recommend it to other, especially since it&#x27;s budget friendly!</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo.  I usually have to use a lot to make my hair feel silky and covered however, this one I felt like I only need to use a palm full to work it through my whole head.  Smells great also.</li>
            <li> My hair is coarse, color-treated and sometimes dry. When I received these products (the conditioner, shampoo, and heat &amp; protect spray) complementary from Influenster for testing purposes, I was excited. The brand name is great. The products live up to my expectations for the brand. My hair was left clean, soft and ready to go. Would definitely use again</li>
            <li> I recieved this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I don&#x27;t usually use conditioner but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. My hair feels soft and silky after using it, and it looks fantastic. Plus it doesn&#x27;t feel like it weighs my hair down like most conditioners. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this conditioner! It made my hair feel so smooth. I could tell the difference just after rinsing out my hair. I usually use Bio Silk afterwards but there was no need. That is how soft and smooth it made my hair feel. Influenster sent me this product to test and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have very thick, dry &amp; unruly hair. I used the shampoo in this line, so I wanted to try the conditioner too. It took very little of this product to condition my hair which is a huge surprise!! Usually I have to use a ton of conditioner, but this formula is so thick &amp; creamy I didn&#x27;t have to use a lot. After washing with the moisture lock shampoo, I worked the conditioner through my hair from roots to tips &amp; left it on for 5 minutes before rinsing it out. My hair was so soft &amp; silky &amp; had very few tangles. I am very pleased with how good this works. If you have dry hair you should give it a try!!</li>
            <li> Truly a great condition. I have naturally thick hair and it worked great. It left my hair feeling soft and silky.I applies it immediately after using the moisture lock shampoo. I used it to detangle my hair in the shower. It has a great thick consistency which i love and it smells awesome.Even after my hair was dried and styled I could still smell the conditioner. I would definitely recommend this product. Its my new favorite and i will definitely use this for now on.</li>
            <li> I was completely surprised on how much I love this! It smells so good, and it definitely moisturizers your hair. I bleached my hair about a month ago, and this has by far beat out my high end brand, saving me a lot of money! My hair continues to get back to healthy and shiny state that it normal is in, its easier to brush through the hair, and its super soft and shiny. I will continue to purchase this again and again</li>
            <li> Got this sample from Influenster to try and review. The shampoo and conditioner must be used together, the smell lasts most of the day, but wow is it too heavy for my fine hair. Leaves a waxy feeling . My hair is &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; near the scalp, but sun, sand and salt water from the beach this summer kind of fried the ends. I don&#x27;t really heat style. I have to wash my hair at least every day and found myself needing a clarifier after a few days of using both.  Disappointed! I don&#x27;t want to have to do that! I think this would be better for people with thicker hair than mine.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, fine hair and a LOT of it and I do highlight my hair so a good conditioner is a must. I LOVE the way this conditioner smells and I noticed that it seemed to make my hair feel pretty smooth after using it. While smell is important, it&#x27;s nice that this has a nice smell and actually makes a difference in the way my hair feels after I use it. I do have to use quite a bit since I have bra-strap length hair but overall I thought it was pretty great. I was able to test this product at no cost but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> i love the way this conditioner smells, and it makes my hair shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> I REALLY like this conditioner (as well as the shampoo!), but the scent leaves a little to be desired for me! To me it doesn&#x27;t match the scent of the shampoo. I don&#x27;t know if they were going for a more earthy scent, but I&#x27;m not a fan.    Other than that, it does a great job and left my hair feeling nice and clean!    I received a sample of this through Influenster, and these opinions are mine and mine alone.</li>
            <li> Would be perfect for shorter hair - my very long, very thick hair required a LOT of this product to cover. But it worked, and that&#x27;s what counts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given the product free to try.</li>
            <li> My color treated, long, thick, curly hair demands a great conditioner (especially since I live in a humid climate). While I normally use something that is specifically designed for color protection, if I stopped coloring my hair this would be a great option. I received this as a free sample to test (and these opinions are my own) and after two uses (which is all I could get from the sample bottles) I can say that it lives up to its name. My hair is soft, less frizzy than normal, and stays that way through rough days.</li>
            <li> This works perfectly with the Moisture Lock shampoo! It definitely moisturizes &amp; tames my hair. It has a great scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering.  Occasionally I will condition w/out shampoo but using it on its own it seemed to weigh down my hair a bit too much and like it left a film on my hair and scalp. Now if they could make this where it&#x27;s moisturizing PLUS damage control it would be prefect!</li>
            <li> I have super fine and curly hair, so my hair has a tendency to dry out and frizz if not cared for properly.  Treating it right means a great conditioner that leaves my hair moisturized.  Vidal Sassoon Moisture Lock Conditioner does exactly that!  It&#x27;s a great smooth texture, which I leave in my hair for a few minutes before rinsing out.  It rinses out easily leaving my hair soft and manageable.  It smells amazing too!  I love it&#x27;s a great product that works just as great as some of the more expensive salon brands without the high price tag.  I definitely recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a sample of this conditioner to review as an Influenster, but all opinions are my own.*</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this conditioner, and I liked it, but is not my favorite. It is creamy but it felt too heavy and it smells a lot like Silicone (but the label shows no sign of such ingredient on it), leaving my hair a little greasy. I guess either my hair is not as dry as I thought it was, or this was a bit much in addition to the Vidal Sassoon Moisture Lock shampoo (which was great), so I had to stop using it and went back to good old reliable Suave with keratin. I have my bottle still in my shower, and I will use it as a light deep moisturizer (yes, is kind of that thick) once or twice a week, but not with every hair wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liked it, but not necessarily loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I received the products for free, all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this conditioner. My hair is so dry and damaged that I need a good conditioner that will keep my hair smooth, shiny, and healthy looking. This conditioner makes my hair very manageable and it smells really good too. When I used it I paired it with Vidal Sassoon Moisture Lock Shampoo. I tested this conditioner at no charge, but these opinions are completely my own. I definitely recommend this product for anyone who needs a moisture rich conditioner.</li>
            <li> I received a complementary sample from influesnter to test out the product. The smell was great but my hair felt a little heavy after use</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product to test and review. It left my hair feeling slightly stronger and it didn&#x27;t feel brittle after shampoo and conditioning. This is a great product and it left my hair feeling great. My hair didn&#x27;t feel dry after styling. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Good conditioner. Doesn&#x27;t make a huge difference with many of those I&#x27;ve used before, but the price on Amazon was good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for over a week and it&#x27;s helped my dry hair come alive.  With fall and winter in the air the cold weather always flops my hair!  Thanks to Vidal Sassoon my hair looks awesome again!  Thank you Vidal Sassoon.    I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product. I received this free from influenster to try. I love the way it makes my hair feel touchable and manageable</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product to test and review. The conditioner had a good consistency and left my hair silky smooth. It was difficult to rinse out however, and left a residue on my hair that I would be concerned about building up over time.</li>
            <li> Love this Conditioner. I leave it on longer while in the shower for a more conditioned effect.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent of this. It reminds me of the salon smell. It worked just fine at conditioning my hair and keeping it from feeling or looking dry. I did notice my hair feeling soft after using this, but it wasn&#x27;t silky soft.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of Vidal Sassoon moisture lock conditioner. First of all, the scent is amazing!  Secondly, after rinsing the conditioner out I noticed my hair was soft. My hair tends to have a mind of it&#x27;s own. It dried to be very smooth and soft. I love the way my hair feels!!  (I revieved this sample complementary to review)</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner!  My hair feels soft and manageable after using this product.  It smells great the day after washing it too.</li>
            <li> I am of African-American descent and have natural, thick, kinky-curly hair. I tried Vidal Sasson&#x27;s Moisture Lock Conditioner which smells excellent! It felt very good on my hair while wet. I expected it to leave my hair moisturized afterwards and was pretty disappointed. It did not dry my hair out, but it did not add any extra moisture.</li>
            <li> I combined this Moisture Lock Conditioner with the Moisture Lock Conditioner and the results were very impressive. My hair felt hydrated, however, I was worried because instead of greasy, it felt sticky. Oh boy, oh boy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are your own.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive this is Vidal Sassoon Pro Series via infuser Vidal Sassoon VoxBox. this product has left my hair which is been colored bleached ride and tortured, to smooth beautiful shiny manageable hair I would definitely repurchase this and encourage anybody reading my review to encourage them to try it out this is a wonderful product expescially use out as a system using all the moisture lock series, this product is not that expensive can be purchased very easily via this Amazon your local convenience store ShopRite Walmart Target all those fun places Walgreens etc heat protection spray is also a super super plus, I will be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used VS since I was a teenager, and then I only tried their hot oil treatment. Now in my 30&#x27;s my hair has been heat damaged, colored, and styled until it can&#x27;t take anymore. VS moisture lock conditioner has brought my hair back from the point of no return. It&#x27;s soft and silky again. I can run my fingers through my hair without them getting stuck. I&#x27;m officially head over heels with this conditioner.</li>
            <li> This product is really great for the pricepoint. While my hair is a bit on the difficult side, it did leave it with more moisture than a lot of conditioners do. If you&#x27;re someone with only moderately dry/frizzy hair, this product is for you! It smooths the hair cuticle and Ieaves a nice scent, to boot. The moisture level is great...but not for someone who has extremely coarse/dry hair (which my curly hair is).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**please note that I was sent this product for consideration, but all views/opinions are my own!**</li>
            <li> I usually use Aussie or Khiels conditioners, and this one was just as good as Aussie! It made my hair feel soft and light. After rinsing I sprayed my hair with a leave in conditioner and my hair was easy to comb through, no tangles, and super soft when it dried. I didn&#x27;t have any fly aways which can be a problem with curly hair. I recommend that after washing you leave this in, comb it through and then pin it up, rinsing it out at the very end of your shower. It made my hair a lot more manageable.</li>
            <li> Lately I had started noticing my hair looking lackluster and frizzy in the back and on the ends. Every conditioner I tried seemed to make no difference or it would weigh my hair down and make it oily. Not the case with VS! My hair looks full and bouncy, but the shine is back and the frizzies practically disappeared. This happened after only a few uses also, I can&#x27;t wait until I&#x27;ve used it a bit longer! I received a free sample to test for which I am so grateful and which I assure you in no way influenced my opinion of the product or my review. I wholeheartedly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> this product was verry good! i love trying new products and this one by far met my needs! i have dry frizzy curly hair, and this left my hair manageable, soft, and definitely smelled wonderful! i will be purchasing this product :)&lt;br /&gt;i tested the product at no cost,all opinions are my own. #influenster</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t loved a conditioner this much in a LONG time. I have thick hair, but this made it even more so. It was soft, behaved well, and I couldn&#x27;t stop myself from running my own fingers through it. I received the product to test for free, but I will definitely be adding it to my routine.</li>
            <li> ! My hair is relaxed so it&#x27;s very important that I keep a nice balance of moisture retention in my strands of hair to keep them from becoming dry and brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner lives up to its name nicely! After conditioning, my hair felt so silky and smooth to touch. Even after blow drying, my hair still had the silky feeling and it appeared to be a bit filler as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely use this conditioner as part of co-wash regimen. This is definitely a great conditioner for the price!</li>
            <li> I tried the Vidal Sassoon Moisture Lock Conditioner, and I was not too impressed. The shampoo made my scalp greast, The condtioner left the ends of my long, fine, cury hair extremely dry. I wanted to like it, as I&#x27;ve grown up equating the Vidal Sassoon brand with quality. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a great product for some, but it just wasn&#x27;t right for my hair type.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised! I have long, highlighted hair that tends to be dry (I blow dry and flat iron on a daily basis). It makes my hair silky and manageable and I really like the scent! I still need to use my professional brand deep conditioner a few days a week, but its a good product that I will keep in my rotation!</li>
            <li> Used conditioner after the VS Moisture Lock shampoo and left on my hair for 3 minutes. When rinsing it out I could feel my hair was already silkier but I was not sure if it would stay that when when dried. I live in a area with high humidity and my hair sometimes resembles straw. Finding something that promises to lock in moisture is very appealing to me. After towel drying my hair and using the VS Heat and Protect Spray, my hair did seem smoother and not as frizzy due to the humidity. It only lasted a day and if I wanted to maintain this I would need to use it daily.</li>
            <li> Got this from Influenster to try and review. I would agree with others who have fine hair that say this leaves you with a heavy, waxy feeling. I have VERY long fine hair, and this conditioner is not easy to rinse out. It only smells &#x27;ok&#x27; and really has little detangling properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you have very long hair, a conditioner helping to detangle is a HUGE plus, and one of the first things you notice when its lacking. I&#x27;d say this conditioner and shampoo combo was only &#x27;ok&#x27;. Maybe for shorter hair, but for longer fine hair, its much too heavy, and isnt exceptional enough to really HIGHLY recommend. Its not bad, but its not exceptional.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair. I love this stuff, it smells great and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down but makes it suuuper soft. I just have to wait for it to go on sale again.</li>
