            <li>I&#x27;d just suggest buying your first palette from them in a brick-and-mortar shop, to be sure the colors are what you&#x27;re looking for- after that</li>

            <li>This stays put on my C brush and full lid brush</li>
            <li>a true labour of love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s a smoky palette, a \\&quot;shimmer\\&quot; effect palette, &amp; a bold nudes one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great for everyday.</li>
            <li>It stays on from morning till evening and looks freshly applied.</li>
            <li>Very nice set for blue eyes - nice everyday colors</li>
            <li>I do think they&#x27;d be really nice for someone with hazel or brown eyes though, since those eye colors are dark enough to hold their own with the eye-shadow&#x27;s colors.  </li>

            <li>I love the way the blue in my eyes just pop.</li>
            <li>I have bought many times and would repurchase in an instant</li>

            <li>I have blue eyes and should be wearing cool tones</li>
            <li>The bold-naturals palette has three shades: a high-shimmer,  pearl-white, a more matte, dark brown, and another high-shimmer, but copper in color.  </li>
            <li>I love the slight shimmer.</li>
            <li>This is a very soft, muted palette that can be made to look very light or dark with application.</li>
            <li>To be fair, I have very fair, freckled skin with pink undertones, so finding a foundation light enough to wear is always difficult, but it always struck me as odd that Almay, purveyors of natural beauty, were the ones who were so far off the mark.  </li>
            <li>It comes on so dark, which is nice to not have to apply several coats.</li>
            <li>The product itself is high quality (I&#x27;d say the eye shadow lasts about 4-6 hours), the pricing is relatively fair, and a little nit goes a long  way , so they&#x27;re going to last awhile</li>

            <li>The Almay brand was introduced sometime in the early 1930&#x27;s, when a professional chemist teamed up with a dermatologist, to create a line of hypoallergenic cosmetics for the chemist&#x27;s wife, whose skin was too sensitive for regular make</li>
            <li>(the shimmer effect in 2 out of 3 is almost a bit too much for me, but that&#x27;s also what makes a small amount so intense).  </li>

            <li>Even their \\&quot;smart shade\\&quot; foundation (designed to match your individual skin tone) left me looking like I&#x27;d been a bit overzealous with some bottle-bought tan (in other words, orange).  </li>

            <li> Beautiful color for blue eyes and inexpensive! Great for everyday.</li>
            <li> Very attractive and safe for people who have allergies.</li>
            <li> Almay is one of my favorite cosmetic brands. The bummer of my most recent order is that, 5 minutes after opening this package, I dropped this eyeshadow compact on the floor and it shattered the item. So, I will have to order this again. Boo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally speaking, I have never had any issues with Almay. My skin is quite sensitive and other cosmetic brands have dried out my eyelids. Or their colors are garish--not in this case. These eyeshadows do tend to last only about half of the workday, though. If this is an issue for you, you may want to carry in your bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have brown eyes, but find that these colors compliment my eyes as well. :)</li>
            <li> I use this combination for eyebrows and eyelids.  Good color, and much cheaper than purchasing designer colors in singles.</li>

            <li> Love it!! when applied correctly it really makes my blue eyes pop!! The trick is the proper makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> This is a very soft, muted palette that can be made to look very light or dark with application. I love the way the blue in my eyes just pop. I moisturize well so I do use a primer to keep it from creasing and it never does. It stays on from morning till evening and looks freshly applied. Probably the most appreciated application of this eye shadow it does not tend to drop flakes around my eye which I find is a problem with most eye shadows. This stays put on my C brush and full lid brush and I never have specks to wipe off that falls where it shouldn&#x27;t. It blends very nicely, I have no complaints, it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ll be using as far as I can see.</li>

            <li> Really made my blue eyes pop</li>
            <li> Can be as subtle or as bold as you want it to be. I use this for my every day &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; look. Doesn&#x27;t clump in my eyelid crease. Have bought this several time, will continue to purchase as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>

The Almay brand was introduced sometime in the early 1930&#x27;s, when a professional chemist teamed up with a dermatologist, to create a line of hypoallergenic cosmetics for the chemist&#x27;s wife, whose skin was too sensitive for regular make up- that&#x27;s some pretty good stuff right there; a true labour of love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, as much as I dig their premise &amp; practices, their  products have always been way too dark for me. Even their \\&quot;smart shade\\&quot; foundation (designed to match your individual skin tone) left me looking like I&#x27;d been a bit overzealous with some bottle-bought tan (in other words, orange).  To be fair, I have very fair, freckled skin with pink undertones, so finding a foundation light enough to wear is always difficult, but it always struck me as odd that Almay, purveyors of natural beauty, were the ones who were so far off the mark.  As it turns out, their other products have similar issues with respect to hue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those not familiar, Almay has a line of eyeshadow palettes that are designed to compliment and brighten your individual eye color. Originally, there was one palette for each eye color, but since then they&#x27;ve rolled out additional ones- there&#x27;s a smoky palette, a \\&quot;shimmer\\&quot; effect palette, &amp; a bold nudes one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked up their \\&quot;bold nudes\\&quot; for blue eyes (although mine are closer to grey).  The bold-naturals palette has three shades: a high-shimmer,  pearl-white, a more matte, dark brown, and another high-shimmer, but copper in color.  The colors are very striking- but they are in no way even remotely close to being \\&quot;nudes\\&quot;.  They&#x27;re more like bold jewel tones.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong- they are nice shades- and I was particularly impressed with the white one, bc generally, white eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t show up on my pale skin, and this one did, thanks to the shimmer- but at the end of the day,. I wanted nudes- bought nudes- yet ended up with something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than anything else, this is really just a labeling issue.  The product itself is high quality (I&#x27;d say the eye shadow lasts about 4-6 hours), the pricing is relatively fair, and a little nit goes a long  way , so they&#x27;re going to last awhile (the shimmer effect in 2 out of 3 is almost a bit too much for me, but that&#x27;s also what makes a small amount so intense).  I have worn the three shades (both as a trio, duo, and in conjunction with other shades), but I never thought they made my blue eyes \\&quot;pop\\&quot;. In fact, I thought they did the opposite- the coppery shade was so bright and loud that it took attention away from my eye color.  I do think they&#x27;d be really nice for someone with hazel or brown eyes though, since those eye colors are dark enough to hold their own with the eye-shadow&#x27;s colors.  Since buying this, I&#x27;ve seen the other palettes, and I do thin those are better presented and would probably buy them.  I&#x27;d just suggest buying your first palette from them in a brick-and-mortar shop, to be sure the colors are what you&#x27;re looking for- after that, you can look for good deals online and buy them without worrying they&#x27;ll be off in the shade department.pearl-white, a more matte, dark brown, and another high-shimmer, but copper in color.
