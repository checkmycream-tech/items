            <li>It&#x27;s a very beautiful piece!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not the best with estimating size</li>
            <li>Beautiful cloth, perfect size.</li>
            <li>Smelled good too!</li>
            <li>Beautiful print.</li>
            <li>Beautiful color and quality.</li>
            <li>the pattern, perfect to wrap my favorite tarot deck in as well as to use for spreads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>It also smelled really good (like pines) when I pulled it out of the packaging.</li>
            <li>When it was recieved it smelled sooooo good.  </li>
            <li>Very lovely cloth.</li>
            <li>Just the right size, beautiful!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I use it to keep the deck tidy inside of a velvet pouch.</li>
            <li>Looks nice though.</li>
            <li>card with best wishes, which I thought was very touching and made for a personal transaction.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>This is nice, but the cloth s cheap.</li>
            <li>For me I found I love it all in all.</li>
            <li>Love the organic designs on this.</li>
            <li>I love this, it&#x27;s so pretty</li>
            <li>Like a room full of incents and sage.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Nice design, but it wold be far better if it was a bit bigger.</li>
            <li>I suspect that it will not survive long as it frays more and more every time I so much as touch it.</li>
            <li>top it all off, there is nothing to prevent the frayed edges from shedding and fraying further into the square pattern around the edges.</li>
            <li>you just want something pretty to wrap your tarot cards in, this is alright.</li>
            <li>I love the moon phases around the middle.  </li>
            <li>I will be back to buy more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thin but it looks beautiful on my altar.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>Gorgeous, delicate altar cloth.</li>
            <li>A little smaller than I expected, but very beautiful.</li>
            <li>Took the star off because the fabric is SUPER thin and gets pulled very easily.</li>
            <li>The fabric is very soft!</li>
            <li>It looks like someone bought a bolt of cheap, patterned material and chopped it into small squares to make a quick buck.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>was smaller than I expected and very flimsy - maybe 5 dollars better price</li>
            <li>The green is darker than the sage green in the picture, but it is beautiful.</li>
            <li>Worth it for the price - a little smaller than I thought it would be, but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft - 100% rayon - and the fraying around the edges is neat and even.</li>
            <li>The cloth came on time and its a little darker than expected, but I like it better that way.</li>
            <li>I bought this to use for my personal tarot readings, but it is to small for even a simple celtic cross spread to fit on the cloth.</li>

            <li> Worse yet, they couldn&#x27;t even be bothered to cut straight edges.</li>

            <li> Smelled vaguely of hemp when I received it, which was something I like very much</li>
            <li> Small enough to wrap up my tarot cards in.</li>
            <li> It is very thin, so thin you can see through it if you put it up towards a light source.</li>
            <li> The only thing is it&#x27;s thin, but works for my tarot card use.  </li>
            <li> Very small and far too thin...</li>
            <li> Not sure what to do with it</li>
            <li> Very thin..... not fit for my altar.</li>

            <li> Very small and far too thin... I bought this to use for my personal tarot readings, but it is to small for even a simple celtic cross spread to fit on the cloth. Not only that, but the thin, light material moves every time I pick up a card or move my deck. It is far too distracting to actually use during a tarot reading, much less as an altar cloth.&lt;br /&gt;Too top it all off, there is nothing to prevent the frayed edges from shedding and fraying further into the square pattern around the edges. Handle with care or it will literally fall apart. Worse yet, they couldn&#x27;t even be bothered to cut straight edges. It looks like someone bought a bolt of cheap, patterned material and chopped it into small squares to make a quick buck.&lt;br /&gt;If you just want something pretty to wrap your tarot cards in, this is alright. But, don&#x27;t expect to actually hold up and protect your cards. I use it to keep the deck tidy inside of a velvet pouch. I suspect that it will not survive long as it frays more and more every time I so much as touch it.</li>
            <li> Just the right size, beautiful!</li>
            <li> Gorgeous, delicate altar cloth. Smelled good too! :) Hehe. Came with a personalized thank-you note with wishes for positivity in my home! Bless.</li>
            <li> Very lovely cloth. Small enough to wrap up my tarot cards in. Beautiful print. Good price.</li>
            <li> Worth it for the price - a little smaller than I thought it would be, but that&#x27;s fine. Took the star off because the fabric is SUPER thin and gets pulled very easily.</li>
            <li> Very thin..... not fit for my altar. Not sure what to do with it</li>
            <li> The cloth came in before the estimated delivery time which was awesome. It is very thin, so thin you can see through it if you put it up towards a light source. I&#x27;ve tossed it around and it hasn&#x27;t shown any sign of wear and tear yet. I washed it and the color has not faded yet for me. It also smelled really good (like pines) when I pulled it out of the packaging.</li>
            <li> This is nice, but the cloth s cheap. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this, it&#x27;s so pretty and I&#x27;m so a moon person.  I love the moon phases around the middle.  The only thing is it&#x27;s thin, but works for my tarot card use.  For me I found I love it all in all.</li>
            <li> was smaller than I expected and very flimsy - maybe 5 dollars better price</li>
            <li> A little smaller than I expected, but very beautiful. Also came with a hand written thank you card with best wishes, which I thought was very touching and made for a personal transaction.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color and quality. Really happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> The fabric is very soft! I don&#x27;t think I can be rough with it haha, I&#x27;m a klutz. It&#x27;s a very beautiful piece! I will be back to buy more.</li>
            <li> Beautiful cloth, perfect size. Smelled vaguely of hemp when I received it, which was something I like very much but others may not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the pattern, perfect to wrap my favorite tarot deck in as well as to use for spreads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived just as speedy as promised!</li>
            <li> Quick shipping. When it was recieved it smelled sooooo good.  Like a room full of incents and sage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not the best with estimating size so I expected a larger piece. Looks nice though.</li>
