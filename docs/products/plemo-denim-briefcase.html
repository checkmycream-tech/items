            <li>Love it!</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a nice case.  </li>
            <li>I feel that it&#x27;s a nice bag for the price.  </li>
            <li>This laptop pouch/bag has the best of both worlds - it&#x27;s very functional and</li>
            <li>Great bag, fast delivery - happy customer.</li>
            <li>own a HP ENVY</li>
            <li>(Sidenote: If you do not have accident insurance, and you own a HP, you should acquire it because I literally pay $0.00 for accident repairs.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really liked it.</li>
            <li>handles are very nice and makes it really easy to carry around. :)</li>
            <li>Lol thanks Guys!!</li>
            <li>it is very good, shipping is so fast.</li>
            <li>more variant color themes or patterns would be nice also.</li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s been a great buy!</li>
            <li>The design is great, very plush on the inside, but very light.</li>
            <li>love the handles fit nicely inside the case.  </li>
            <li>love the zip compartment to put files.</li>
            <li>But overall, very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Perhaps a gusset or some elastic to allow for more pocket space would be a better option.</li>
            <li>Cute, sturdy, fashionable.</li>
            <li>Love this laptop bag--very versatile.  </li>
            <li>So glad I chose this one</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Product is okay</li>
            <li>Overall great case!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lovely.</li>
            <li>I love that you can tuck the handles in the case</li>
            <li>I travel a lot and use this case to safely get my laptop through checked luggage, security scans, and in overhead compartments.  </li>
            <li>Overall, a great buy!</li>
            <li>Well worth the money, this computer bag is a good value.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more a snug computer case, which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li>go for functionality over style, but when you have really well made case like this that also looks great</li>
            <li>Also love that I can tuck the handles away.</li>
            <li>Love, love this laptop case.</li>
            <li>I have to say that I am MORE than pleased with your product.</li>
            <li>and I just LOVE the inside of the PLEMO case</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the fabric and the texture.</li>
            <li>Perfect fit, easy to carry, fabulously soft interior to keep my laptop safe.  </li>
            <li>It came exactly how it says and it seems like good quality and is cute as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Really happy with my purchase, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Zippers are pretty good too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But beside that, i&#x27;m very happy with the product and the quality of it seem a lot better than many other laptop sleeves and bags.</li>
            <li>came in a nice ziplock bag and has good handles + a plush SOFT inside.</li>
            <li>Nice bag worth the money</li>
            <li>The handles make it easy to carry, and they&#x27;re easy to hide when not in use.</li>
            <li>an easily pull them out if you like.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to travel with, lightweight and has held up well.</li>
            <li>Very cute and stylish case for my new laptop.  </li>
            <li>But most interesting part is about inside material, it&#x27;s like fur, so laptop is cushioned and sits nicely and softly.</li>
            <li>It fits beautifully and there is room for that giant charging apparatus (just what was apple thinking).  </li>
            <li>The laptop doesn&#x27;t fit snug, but it&#x27;s not swimming either.</li>
            <li>but I was hoping that both my laptop and drawing tablet could fit in it</li>
            <li>but my laptop fits securely and closes without an issue.</li>
            <li>and they fit, a bit snug but still fit.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Very useful.</li>
            <li>Fits well, it is light and clean.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been pretty great so far.</li>
            <li>It looks exactly as it is in pictures and feels better than you can imagine.</li>
            <li>This is such a nice laptop sleeve!</li>
            <li>Not only does it go with everything that I own in my closet!</li>
            <li>My new Mac book Pro fits nicely in the side pocket</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve taken to packing my computer in my carry-on bag when I travel, but my normal computer bag is too large to go in (because I stuff the suitcase, to be fair).  </li>
            <li>Just so you know I did pay full price for this.</li>
            <li>The material on the inside is nice and soft.</li>
            <li>So I got this one because it&#x27;s significantly smaller and still provides good protection to my computer.  </li>
            <li>I have a 15.6 laptop and the bag was true to size.</li>
            <li>screen, 1&amp;#34; thick and it fits perfectly.  </li>
            <li>but I like this carrying case so much that I will be sure to start my searches for electronic carrying cases with this brand from now on.  </li>
            <li>I bought it based upon the other reviews and am happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>I went on amazon, looked for a stylish bag that would absorb the shock and bumbs that I cause, found this item, ordered it, and weeks later I am still in love with the bag.</li>
            <li>Seller shipped quick and merchandise came as promised.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it is a very nice case.</li>
            <li>The inside is VERY soft and I love the look of the bag.</li>
            <li>The inside lining is very soft, which I love because it will not scratch my laptop.</li>
            <li>Exactly what i wanted!</li>
            <li>Love the soft plush interior!</li>
            <li>Overall, I love the bag!</li>
            <li>I love the fabric and the interior is super soft.</li>
            <li>Looks professional, but not boring.</li>
            <li>Super comfy, thanks!</li>
            <li>Arrived right on time.</li>
            <li>I have a 15.6\\&quot; laptop and it slides right into the case and</li>
            <li>right out too.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had a chance to really use this yet, but its super cute and the inside is really soft.</li>
            <li>Fit my mid 2014 rMBP 15 with hard case on perfect.</li>
            <li>The fabric is strong and durable and the lining soft and cushiony.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable case to carry around, soft in the inside for my laptop and durable through any weather!</li>
            <li>may be a bit too big for my laptop but love the sleek design and look.</li>
            <li>This laptop case is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>It is thick and has great padding so computer is protected.</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>This came promptly and exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>And, it pretty much matches anything I would wear!</li>
            <li>The outside material is like nice jeans material, really sleek and modern looking.</li>
            <li>Soft inside and nice outside!</li>
            <li>Well-made soft interior for cushioning your laptop and a nice textured fabric on the outside.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if this bag were just a smidgen large, so that the charging cable for my Mac didn&#x27;t present such a large bulge in the pockets.</li>
            <li>Nice computer bag, looks sharp!!</li>
            <li>Fits very well.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Fits more stuff in the side pockets than I expected.</li>
            <li>I really like this laptop bag.  </li>
            <li>Very durable fabric.</li>
            <li>It could fit a slightly bigger laptop, or some folders, pens, magazines...</li>
            <li>I really like this sleeve case.</li>
            <li>very sleek looking</li>
            <li>The construction is very durable.  </li>
            <li>I really like the product</li>
            <li>it very well</li>
            <li>I have used this on recent trips and light that I can also include my nook and the chargers for all plus my phone.</li>
            <li>Very durable.</li>
            <li>so really you&#x27;re getting three pockets.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I can also fit the power cord and a wireless mouse on the outside!</li>
            <li>There is attention to detail and very sleek looking.</li>
            <li>glad to have a bag that does not invite accumulation of other items.</li>
            <li>I love how the handles can be hidden, because sometimes I put the whole thing (with laptop inside) in my backpack</li>
            <li>The inner lining is soft and furry so computer easily slides in and comes out.  </li>
            <li>However, since my this particular laptop is new to the market, the only protective accessory available was the keyboard cover leaving me to resort to a laptop bag.</li>
            <li>It is very simple yet interesting at the same time.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>The inside lining is so soft!!  </li>
            <li>Love the handles and the little pockets.</li>
            <li>The pocket and zippers are all really well built and are big enough to fit my laptop charger.  </li>
            <li>The stitching for the handle attachments looks very robust &amp; the inside is extremely soft.</li>
            <li>and it really isn&#x27;t too masculine.</li>
            <li>Look very chic and classy for work or just hanging around.</li>
            <li>The denim fabric feels high quality and the inside is very soft for the laptop.</li>
            <li>Inside is very soft and plushy, so your laptop is covered on all sides.</li>
            <li>Very soft insides and</li>
            <li>The inside is very soft and the handles are sturdy.</li>
            <li>Very Soft inside.</li>
            <li>I like the carrying straps since my comp is pretty big.</li>
            <li>Extremely soft on the inside !</li>
            <li>but I am glad for that because it does not look dirty as it may after traveling with it all over the place if it were as light a gray in the photo.</li>
            <li>The interior is extremely soft and prevents scratching.  </li>
            <li>Narrow fit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m satisfied but not thrilled.</li>
            <li>Also, if you&#x27;re concerned at all about the comfort of your computer, the inside of this case is suuuuuper soft.</li>
            <li>and the inside is lined with a soft fabric.</li>
            <li>It seems sturdy - I haven&#x27;t had any issues so far.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so soft</li>
            <li>The interior, as has been mentioned, is super soft and protective, but I&#x27;m not sure how much this would do if you literally dropped the computer on the floor.</li>
            <li>It is small enough to be able to throw the laptop and case in my backpack, but still feels padded enough to protect the laptop.</li>
            <li>but only if possible without losing isolation and protection wich are the main reasons i got this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>The one zippered pocket is easy to get into, although the other two pockets (one on front, one on back) are less so.</li>
            <li>As hard as I am on my laptop, it has literally absorbed the hardest of drops and bumps</li>

            <li> Stylish and lightweight with the added benefit of not harming an animal!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> It is cushy on the inside, the lining is like the cover of your really soft but supportive pillows, that&#x27;s the best way I can describe it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure my MacBook Pro would say it feels like Heaven if it could talk!</li>
            <li> Love this case!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nicely padded, the zippers seem quite strong, and the outer fabric is attractive.  </li>

            <li> Really nice</li>
            <li> Well made and padded nicely.</li>
            <li> I knew this was a winner when I opened the box to find the case inside a really nice plastic cover with a zip closure.  </li>
            <li> Stylish and good quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice case.  </li>
            <li> I feel that it&#x27;s a nice bag for the price.  </li>
            <li> This laptop pouch/bag has the best of both worlds - it&#x27;s very functional and</li>
            <li> Great bag, fast delivery - happy customer.</li>
            <li> own a HP ENVY</li>
            <li> (Sidenote: If you do not have accident insurance, and you own a HP, you should acquire it because I literally pay $0.00 for accident repairs.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really liked it.</li>
            <li> handles are very nice and makes it really easy to carry around. :)</li>
            <li> Lol thanks Guys!!</li>
            <li> it is very good, shipping is so fast.</li>
            <li> more variant color themes or patterns would be nice also.</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s been a great buy!</li>
            <li> The design is great, very plush on the inside, but very light.</li>
            <li> love the handles fit nicely inside the case.  </li>
            <li> love the zip compartment to put files.</li>
            <li> But overall, very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Perhaps a gusset or some elastic to allow for more pocket space would be a better option.</li>
            <li> Cute, sturdy, fashionable.</li>
            <li> Love this laptop bag--very versatile.  </li>
            <li> So glad I chose this one</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Product is okay</li>
            <li> Overall great case!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lovely.</li>
            <li> I love that you can tuck the handles in the case</li>
            <li> I travel a lot and use this case to safely get my laptop through checked luggage, security scans, and in overhead compartments.  </li>
            <li> Overall, a great buy!</li>
            <li> Well worth the money, this computer bag is a good value.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more a snug computer case, which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li> go for functionality over style, but when you have really well made case like this that also looks great</li>
            <li> Also love that I can tuck the handles away.</li>
            <li> Love, love this laptop case.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I am MORE than pleased with your product.</li>
            <li> and I just LOVE the inside of the PLEMO case</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the fabric and the texture.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit, easy to carry, fabulously soft interior to keep my laptop safe.  </li>
            <li> It came exactly how it says and it seems like good quality and is cute as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really happy with my purchase, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Zippers are pretty good too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But beside that, i&#x27;m very happy with the product and the quality of it seem a lot better than many other laptop sleeves and bags.</li>
            <li> came in a nice ziplock bag and has good handles + a plush SOFT inside.</li>
            <li> Nice bag worth the money</li>
            <li> The handles make it easy to carry, and they&#x27;re easy to hide when not in use.</li>
            <li> an easily pull them out if you like.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to travel with, lightweight and has held up well.</li>
            <li> Very cute and stylish case for my new laptop.  </li>
            <li> But most interesting part is about inside material, it&#x27;s like fur, so laptop is cushioned and sits nicely and softly.</li>
            <li> It fits beautifully and there is room for that giant charging apparatus (just what was apple thinking).  </li>
            <li> The laptop doesn&#x27;t fit snug, but it&#x27;s not swimming either.</li>
            <li> but I was hoping that both my laptop and drawing tablet could fit in it</li>
            <li> but my laptop fits securely and closes without an issue.</li>
            <li> and they fit, a bit snug but still fit.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Very useful.</li>
            <li> Fits well, it is light and clean.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been pretty great so far.</li>
            <li> It looks exactly as it is in pictures and feels better than you can imagine.</li>
            <li> This is such a nice laptop sleeve!</li>
            <li> Not only does it go with everything that I own in my closet!</li>
            <li> My new Mac book Pro fits nicely in the side pocket</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken to packing my computer in my carry-on bag when I travel, but my normal computer bag is too large to go in (because I stuff the suitcase, to be fair).  </li>
            <li> Just so you know I did pay full price for this.</li>
            <li> The material on the inside is nice and soft.</li>
            <li> So I got this one because it&#x27;s significantly smaller and still provides good protection to my computer.  </li>
            <li> I have a 15.6 laptop and the bag was true to size.</li>
            <li> screen, 1&amp;#34; thick and it fits perfectly.  </li>
            <li> but I like this carrying case so much that I will be sure to start my searches for electronic carrying cases with this brand from now on.  </li>
            <li> I bought it based upon the other reviews and am happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I went on amazon, looked for a stylish bag that would absorb the shock and bumbs that I cause, found this item, ordered it, and weeks later I am still in love with the bag.</li>
            <li> Seller shipped quick and merchandise came as promised.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it is a very nice case.</li>
            <li> The inside is VERY soft and I love the look of the bag.</li>
            <li> The inside lining is very soft, which I love because it will not scratch my laptop.</li>
            <li> Exactly what i wanted!</li>
            <li> Love the soft plush interior!</li>
            <li> Overall, I love the bag!</li>
            <li> I love the fabric and the interior is super soft.</li>
            <li> Looks professional, but not boring.</li>
            <li> Super comfy, thanks!</li>
            <li> Arrived right on time.</li>
            <li> I have a 15.6\\&quot; laptop and it slides right into the case and</li>
            <li> right out too.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had a chance to really use this yet, but its super cute and the inside is really soft.</li>
            <li> Fit my mid 2014 rMBP 15 with hard case on perfect.</li>
            <li> The fabric is strong and durable and the lining soft and cushiony.  </li>
            <li> Comfortable case to carry around, soft in the inside for my laptop and durable through any weather!</li>
            <li> may be a bit too big for my laptop but love the sleek design and look.</li>
            <li> This laptop case is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> It is thick and has great padding so computer is protected.</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> This came promptly and exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> And, it pretty much matches anything I would wear!</li>
            <li> The outside material is like nice jeans material, really sleek and modern looking.</li>
            <li> Soft inside and nice outside!</li>
            <li> Well-made soft interior for cushioning your laptop and a nice textured fabric on the outside.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if this bag were just a smidgen large, so that the charging cable for my Mac didn&#x27;t present such a large bulge in the pockets.</li>
            <li> Nice computer bag, looks sharp!!</li>
            <li> Fits very well.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Fits more stuff in the side pockets than I expected.</li>
            <li> I really like this laptop bag.  </li>
            <li> Very durable fabric.</li>
            <li> It could fit a slightly bigger laptop, or some folders, pens, magazines...</li>
            <li> I really like this sleeve case.</li>
            <li> very sleek looking</li>
            <li> The construction is very durable.  </li>
            <li> I really like the product</li>
            <li> it very well</li>
            <li> I have used this on recent trips and light that I can also include my nook and the chargers for all plus my phone.</li>
            <li> Very durable.</li>
            <li> so really you&#x27;re getting three pockets.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I can also fit the power cord and a wireless mouse on the outside!</li>
            <li> There is attention to detail and very sleek looking.</li>
            <li> glad to have a bag that does not invite accumulation of other items.</li>
            <li> I love how the handles can be hidden, because sometimes I put the whole thing (with laptop inside) in my backpack</li>
            <li> The inner lining is soft and furry so computer easily slides in and comes out.  </li>
            <li> However, since my this particular laptop is new to the market, the only protective accessory available was the keyboard cover leaving me to resort to a laptop bag.</li>
            <li> It is very simple yet interesting at the same time.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> The inside lining is so soft!!  </li>
            <li> Love the handles and the little pockets.</li>
            <li> The pocket and zippers are all really well built and are big enough to fit my laptop charger.  </li>
            <li> The stitching for the handle attachments looks very robust &amp; the inside is extremely soft.</li>
            <li> and it really isn&#x27;t too masculine.</li>
            <li> Look very chic and classy for work or just hanging around.</li>
            <li> The denim fabric feels high quality and the inside is very soft for the laptop.</li>
            <li> Inside is very soft and plushy, so your laptop is covered on all sides.</li>
            <li> Very soft insides and</li>
            <li> The inside is very soft and the handles are sturdy.</li>
            <li> Very Soft inside.</li>
            <li> I like the carrying straps since my comp is pretty big.</li>
            <li> Extremely soft on the inside !</li>
            <li> but I am glad for that because it does not look dirty as it may after traveling with it all over the place if it were as light a gray in the photo.</li>
            <li> The interior is extremely soft and prevents scratching.  </li>
            <li> Narrow fit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m satisfied but not thrilled.</li>
            <li> Also, if you&#x27;re concerned at all about the comfort of your computer, the inside of this case is suuuuuper soft.</li>
            <li> and the inside is lined with a soft fabric.</li>
            <li> It seems sturdy - I haven&#x27;t had any issues so far.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so soft</li>
            <li> The interior, as has been mentioned, is super soft and protective, but I&#x27;m not sure how much this would do if you literally dropped the computer on the floor.</li>
            <li> It is small enough to be able to throw the laptop and case in my backpack, but still feels padded enough to protect the laptop.</li>
            <li> but only if possible without losing isolation and protection wich are the main reasons i got this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> The one zippered pocket is easy to get into, although the other two pockets (one on front, one on back) are less so.</li>
            <li> As hard as I am on my laptop, it has literally absorbed the hardest of drops and bumps</li>
            <li> The outside pockets on both sides are budded yet very helpful to throw a pen or small pad of paper in.</li>
            <li> Only wish I had gotten one with a long strap option too.</li>
            <li> So far it works well and small enough to use inside my bag aswel.</li>
            <li> Maybe should have a long strap as an accessory.</li>
            <li> I only found from other brands</li>
            <li> but after cracking the screen a couple of times due to my rough,clumsy nature I decided it was time to physically carry my laptop.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want the average black laptop case but also needed something that still looked professional.  </li>
            <li> Also, the pockets are not good for the battery charger -- the whole thing gets bulks and unwieldy when I put the charger in the side.</li>
            <li> The pockets to put the handles it extends all the way down the entire sleeves</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a big deal, it just makes me hurt a little to see my Macbook with even the slightest scratch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have to be careful when I remove it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had the case a few weeks, so no comments on its longevity.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Initially, I wanted a hardcover case and keyboard cover combo packet to protect my laptop from the everyday wear-and-tear of commuting my laptop to law school, to class, and then back home.  </li>
            <li> The side pockets may look small, but there was enough room inside to put both parts of my charger, my mouse, and keep my tablet in the zippered compartment.  </li>
            <li> Fits my laptop well, with a small amount of room left and cushions</li>
            <li> only complaint is that the zipper will create some dents on the Macbook if you drop it on the ground.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also gotten a few compliments about it while walking to classes.</li>
            <li> Takes the heavy feeling out of carry my laptop.</li>
            <li> but my 15.6&amp;#34; laptop fits in it very tightly</li>
            <li> Very, very tight on my 15.6&amp;#34; HP laptop.</li>
            <li> who needs an excessively heavy computer bag?!</li>
            <li> The side zipper compartment will hold the usual accessories.</li>
            <li> From the zippers to the hide away handles and the very soft inside you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The handles are a little pathetic looking when first pulled from their hidey-holes in the sides, but they do straighten out.</li>
            <li> No shoulder strap makes it a bit difficult to carry around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I made a mistake and ordered nthe wrong size.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love this laptop case!  It fits my laptop perfectly and is well-made.  The interior is extremely soft and prevents scratching.

            <li> Really nice case. Love the soft plush interior!</li>
            <li> Excellent product which arrived just as advertised in great packaging. My new Mac book Pro fits nicely in the side pocket is great for the charger and extension cord.  I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Padding is great, slim design with hide-away handles is visually appealing. My only issue is that the side pocket is almost too snug to accommodate my charger. Perhaps a gusset or some elastic to allow for more pocket space would be a better option.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for and great quality!</li>
            <li> Excellent product,just as shown.</li>

I only found from other brands</li>

            <li> Fast shipping. Quality product. I ordered the gray one. It is a very very nice laptop case. Soft inside and nice outside!</li>
            <li> Love this laptop bag--very versatile.  You can carry it with or without the handles which retract; there is a zipper pocket for papers or accessories.  The fabric is strong and durable and the lining soft and cushiony.  So glad I chose this one</li>
            <li> Well made and padded nicely. Narrow fit. Love it</li>
            <li> Prompt shipping and delivery. Product is okay but my 15.6&amp;#34; laptop fits in it very tightly and I have to be careful when I remove it. Also, the pockets are not good for the battery charger -- the whole thing gets bulks and unwieldy when I put the charger in the side. No shoulder strap makes it a bit difficult to carry around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m satisfied but not thrilled.</li>
            <li> Fits laptop perfect! Well insulated!</li>
            <li> Bought it to hold my 15&amp;#34; MacBook Pro.  Been using it for 2 months and have no complaints!  Love the pocket on one side to hold folders/ papers!</li>
            <li> I knew this was a winner when I opened the box to find the case inside a really nice plastic cover with a zip closure.  Everything about this says quality. From the zippers to the hide away handles and the very soft inside you will not be disappointed. I purchased this for my wife&#x27;s 15&amp;#34; Mac laptop.  It fits beautifully and there is room for that giant charging apparatus (just what was apple thinking).  There is also room for things like a notebook etc.  Just so you know I did pay full price for this.</li>
            <li> works great. looks as described. protects my computer. great price and value. glad to have a bag that does not invite accumulation of other items. who needs an excessively heavy computer bag?!</li>
            <li> I love this bag!  The look is sleek and I can make it a laptop sleeve whenever I want.  The pockets are the perfect size.</li>
            <li> So far so good. The material on the inside is nice and soft. Fits more stuff in the side pockets than I expected. I like the carrying straps since my comp is pretty big.</li>
            <li> I really like this laptop bag.  I&#x27;ve taken to packing my computer in my carry-on bag when I travel, but my normal computer bag is too large to go in (because I stuff the suitcase, to be fair).  This means that when I get to my destination, I do not have a bag to carry my laptop around in.  So I got this one because it&#x27;s significantly smaller and still provides good protection to my computer.  It&#x27;s nicely padded, the zippers seem quite strong, and the outer fabric is attractive.  The one zippered pocket is easy to get into, although the other two pockets (one on front, one on back) are less so. It would be nice if this bag were just a smidgen large, so that the charging cable for my Mac didn&#x27;t present such a large bulge in the pockets. But the fact that it fits a 15&amp;#34; is great!!</li>
            <li> Fits ideally Macbook pro 15 in. Very durable fabric. But most interesting part is about inside material, it&#x27;s like fur, so laptop is cushioned and sits nicely and softly. Zippers are pretty good too. Overall great case!</li>
            <li> came in a nice ziplock bag and has good handles + a plush SOFT inside.</li>
            <li> Very nice case.  Inside is very soft and plushy, so your laptop is covered on all sides. The side pockets may look small, but there was enough room inside to put both parts of my charger, my mouse, and keep my tablet in the zippered compartment.  All of this, without putting any extensive pressure on the laptop. Considering I care for my laptop maticulously, I was concerned about the quality of a product that was rather inexpensive such as this one. I was please null suprised, and will always recommend this product. This laptop fits my 15.6 inch Asus laptop with no problems, so if that is a concern you may be facing while considering this case, take my word that it will ft perfectly. I have nothing but good things to say about this product.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this gives you any information you were concerned about, weary amazon consumer.&lt;br /&gt;Best of luck.</li>
            <li> This laptop case is exactly what I was looking for. The handles make it easy to carry, and they&#x27;re easy to hide when not in use. I definitely recommend this for anyone who has ever dropped their laptop in the driveway. I just wrap the handles around my wrist when I&#x27;m carrying in groceries, etc. It keeps both my hands free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a 15-inch Macbook Pro - The laptop doesn&#x27;t fit snug, but it&#x27;s not swimming either. It could fit a slightly bigger laptop, or some folders, pens, magazines... Also, if you&#x27;re concerned at all about the comfort of your computer, the inside of this case is suuuuuper soft. If you get a different laptop you could turn this inside out and use it as a pillow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had the case a few weeks, so no comments on its longevity. So far, it&#x27;s been a great buy!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Great quality, and an even better price. Arrived right on time.</li>
            <li> Not as sturdy as it should be.</li>
            <li> I really like this sleeve case. Fit my mid 2014 rMBP 15 with hard case on perfect. Stylish and good quality.</li>
            <li> Nice bag worth the money Ty</li>
            <li> I made a mistake and ordered nthe wrong size.</li>
            <li> Simply put....It&#x27;s lovely. It looks exactly as it is in pictures and feels better than you can imagine. Great investment</li>
            <li> Very, very tight on my 15.6&amp;#34; HP laptop. Hopefully it will stretch out. Other than that, it is a very nice case.</li>
            <li> Perfect and as described!</li>
            <li> Very soft insides and very sleek looking outside.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the zipper will create some dents on the Macbook if you drop it on the ground. It&#x27;s not a big deal, it just makes me hurt a little to see my Macbook with even the slightest scratch.&lt;br /&gt;The handles are very nice and makes it really easy to carry around. :)</li>
            <li> Perfect for carrying around or for quick slip into my backpack!</li>
            <li> I love this case! It fits my 2011 15&amp;#34; MacBook Pro perfectly, including an extra-long charger cord, wireless mouse, notebook and papers. The inside is very soft and the handles are sturdy. So glad I chose this one!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> Very nice. A perfect case for the 15&amp;#34; MacBook Pro.</li>
            <li> Received the case within the specified timeframe.  It&#x27;s a nice case.  It is thick and has great padding so computer is protected. The inner lining is soft and furry so computer easily slides in and comes out.  I feel that it&#x27;s a nice bag for the price.  I love that you can tuck the handles in the case an easily pull them out if you like.  The zippered pockets give you enough room for your accessories.  I have a 15.6 laptop and the bag was true to size.</li>
            <li> Extremely soft on the inside ! Feels like cashmere to me. Very nice looking</li>
            <li> Excellant Case .  Very Soft inside.</li>
            <li> Very nice.  Slim enough to slip inside my backpack, but still has handles so I can carry it by itself when I want to.  My laptop is an HP 15.6&amp;#34; screen, 1&amp;#34; thick and it fits perfectly.  Great quality, LOVE the faux fur inside.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit, easy to carry, fabulously soft interior to keep my laptop safe.  I really like it!</li>
            <li> This came promptly and exactly as described.  Great quality item and fits my MacBook Pro 15&amp;#34; perfectly.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had a chance to really use this yet, but its super cute and the inside is really soft.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t heard of this brand before purchasing it but I like this carrying case so much that I will be sure to start my searches for electronic carrying cases with this brand from now on.  The construction is very durable.  I travel a lot and use this case to safely get my laptop through checked luggage, security scans, and in overhead compartments.  The inside lining is so soft!!  I purchased the gray carrying case and it is darker than the gray in the photo but I am glad for that because it does not look dirty as it may after traveling with it all over the place if it were as light a gray in the photo.</li>
            <li> Very cute and stylish case for my new laptop.  It is small enough to be able to throw the laptop and case in my backpack, but still feels padded enough to protect the laptop.</li>
            <li> I really like the product but I was hoping that both my laptop and drawing tablet could fit in it but i can&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But beside that, i&#x27;m very happy with the product and the quality of it seem a lot better than many other laptop sleeves and bags.</li>
            <li> Comfortable case to carry around, soft in the inside for my laptop and durable through any weather!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks for my HP Envy 15 and it&#x27;s been pretty great so far. Fits my laptop well, with a small amount of room left and cushions it very well and the inside is lined with a soft fabric. I love how the handles can be hidden, because sometimes I put the whole thing (with laptop inside) in my backpack and I want the handles out of the way. I&#x27;ve also gotten a few compliments about it while walking to classes. Overall, a great buy!</li>
            <li> Stylish and lightweight with the added benefit of not harming an animal!  The handles are a little pathetic looking when first pulled from their hidey-holes in the sides, but they do straighten out. I have used this on recent trips and light that I can also include my nook and the chargers for all plus my phone. The interior, as has been mentioned, is super soft and protective, but I&#x27;m not sure how much this would do if you literally dropped the computer on the floor. Well worth the money, this computer bag is a good value. I bought it based upon the other reviews and am happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Sturdy product. Love the handles and the little pockets. You can fit some papers but not a great deal. It&#x27;s more a snug computer case, which is what I wanted. Love it!</li>
            <li> This laptop pouch/bag has the best of both worlds - it&#x27;s very functional and stylish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I go for functionality over style, but when you have really well made case like this that also looks great, it&#x27;s a home run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handles can be stuffed inside their designated mini pockets to get them out of the way. Since I carry my laptop in a backpack, I always have them stowed almost all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really happy with my purchase, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great quality and beautiful design.  Very useful.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for what I needed, something to carry my work laptop - 15 in, MacBook Pro + I use the side zipper pocket for my notebook/planner. It seems sturdy - I haven&#x27;t had any issues so far. The design is great, very plush on the inside, but very light. And, it pretty much matches anything I would wear!</li>
            <li> It is perfect. Very durable.</li>
            <li> Great case! Exceeded expectations. The outside pockets on both sides are budded yet very helpful to throw a pen or small pad of paper in. Also love that I can tuck the handles away. Looks professional, but not boring.</li>
            <li> This is such a nice laptop sleeve! It is cushy on the inside, the lining is like the cover of your really soft but supportive pillows, that&#x27;s the best way I can describe it. The pocket and zippers are all really well built and are big enough to fit my laptop charger.  The pockets to put the handles it extends all the way down the entire sleeves so really you&#x27;re getting three pockets. The outside material is like nice jeans material, really sleek and modern looking.</li>
            <li> Love, love this laptop case. Takes the heavy feeling out of carry my laptop. I have a Lenovo G500 series which is not the slimmest of laptops but my laptop fits securely and closes without an issue.</li>
            <li> Great bag, fast delivery - happy customer. Would prefer it to be a bit smaller but wider.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I am MORE than pleased with your product. I needed something for my MacBook Prob and I just LOVE the inside of the PLEMO case it&#x27;s so soft and I&#x27;m sure my MacBook Pro would say it feels like Heaven if it could talk! Lol thanks Guys!!</li>
            <li> This fits my Toshiba satellite laptop nicely! It is easy to travel with, lightweight and has held up well. The inside is VERY soft and I love the look of the bag. I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This bag is nice and minimalist and is a great value.</li>
            <li> Good quality bag! Fits my mouse, charger and a notebook!</li>
            <li> just received this today(sunday delivery with prime) and its just what I was looking for. My Acer R-7(15.6 convertible) fits perfectly without having to shimmy it side to side . I love it. The stitching for the handle attachments looks very robust &amp; the inside is extremely soft. The side zipper compartment will hold the usual accessories. If your looking for a sleeve type bag for a 15-15.6 device look no further.</li>
            <li> Not only does it go with everything that I own in my closet! As hard as I am on my laptop, it has literally absorbed the hardest of drops and bumps which I love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own a HP ENVY 15t Quad TouchSmart laptop (fully loaded with all specs) with a 15.6 display screen. My backpack has a laptop compartmen,t but after cracking the screen a couple of times due to my rough,clumsy nature I decided it was time to physically carry my laptop. (Sidenote: If you do not have accident insurance, and you own a HP, you should acquire it because I literally pay $0.00 for accident repairs.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially, I wanted a hardcover case and keyboard cover combo packet to protect my laptop from the everyday wear-and-tear of commuting my laptop to law school, to class, and then back home.  However, since my this particular laptop is new to the market, the only protective accessory available was the keyboard cover leaving me to resort to a laptop bag. I went on amazon, looked for a stylish bag that would absorb the shock and bumbs that I cause, found this item, ordered it, and weeks later I am still in love with the bag.</li>
            <li> Beautiful case. Great quality.  Very pleased!</li>
            <li> My lenovo G50 fits perfectly in it. I can also fit the power cord and a wireless mouse on the outside!</li>
            <li> Love this case! I love the fabric and the texture. The simple design is perfect and it fits my MacBook Pro 15 perfectly. I absolutely love the handle and the inside is very cushy and protective. Would buy again and again.</li>
            <li> This case is great! It is very simple yet interesting at the same time. I am a female and I ordered the gray one and it really isn&#x27;t too masculine. The inside lining is very soft, which I love because it will not scratch my laptop. I have a 15.6\\&quot; laptop and it slides right into the case and right out too. I have the charging chord and a wireless mouse and they fit, a bit snug but still fit. Overall, I love the bag!</li>
            <li> Really liked it. Works great with my laptop. Seller shipped quick and merchandise came as promised. Would recommend for anyone looking for a laptop bag/holder.</li>
            <li> great for those who don&#x27;t to carry more than a notepad along with your laptop. I love the fabric and the interior is super soft.</li>
            <li> This computer case fits my 15.6&#x27; notebook perfectly! It came exactly how it says and it seems like good quality and is cute as well. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> This case is perfect. Well-made soft interior for cushioning your laptop and a nice textured fabric on the outside. Look very chic and classy for work or just hanging around.</li>
            <li> Quality is awesome. The denim fabric feels high quality and the inside is very soft for the laptop. There is attention to detail and very sleek looking. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Nice computer bag, looks sharp!!</li>
            <li> Very stylish.  Plush interior protects from knocks.  Place to store cord.</li>
