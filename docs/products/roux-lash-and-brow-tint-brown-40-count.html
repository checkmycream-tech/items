            <li>It is great for those who need mascara and a pencil to darken lashes and brows.</li>

            <li>Totally Satisfied!!</li>
            <li>You need to make sure to NOT get step 1 on the skin!!</li>
            <li>They will never be perfect, I still have to fill in some sparse areas with pencil, but its A LOT better</li>
            <li>Nice!  </li>
            <li>My lashes, like others, took a couple of applications to darken and are a perfect color and the remover worked great to clean up my wee booboo&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>This dye is very easy to use and gave me a beautiful brown lash line.</li>
            <li>It is really good in the summer...</li>
            <li>, I LOVED how my eyelashes looked.  </li>
            <li>Vaseline is a good preventive measure.</li>
            <li>I tried the medium brown Roux color and it worked surprisingly well.</li>
            <li>I was happy to find out there are products on the market that I can use to dye my own eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I also used Q Tips to apply and clean up with excellent results.</li>
            <li>In the end I am very pleased to have this product.</li>
            <li>but this stuff is 10x better!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s definitely better!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>It was sent quickly and arrived in very good condition.</li>
            <li>Roux Lash and Brow Tint is easy to use, looks great and the color lasts for 3-4 weeks.</li>
            <li>I also really liked how you add #2</li>
            <li>and I can own up to that.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t dye my own eyelashes</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re a nice medium brown.  </li>
            <li>huge thank-you to the tipsters who made the process easier and very very effective.</li>
            <li>First, it&#x27;s very good.  </li>
            <li>It does a good job of dying brows and lashes and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, good instructions.</li>
            <li>Like any hair coloring, it fades with time, but it&#x27;s very easy to re-apply as needed.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>As a last stitch effort, I decided to combine the best growth product I had with a tint.</li>
            <li>I came across a review on the Godefry kit saying that the Roux kit was actually better - in the 40 count</li>
            <li>I probably could have removed more</li>
            <li>They love the results.</li>
            <li>Wish I&#x27;d tried it many years and tubes of mascara ago.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I will be glad to provide an update about 1000Hour lash tint once it comes in from eBay</li>
            <li>I will be glad to provide an update about 1000Hour lash tint once it comes in from eBay</li>
            <li>i love this product.  </li>
            <li>I do like the product better than paying the salon and even having to throw it out twice a year still makes it cheaper than going to the salon.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years off and on.</li>
            <li>Applying the stain remover changed it to a lovely shade of brown/orange.  </li>
            <li>I wanted darker lashes, I look better that way.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Make sure you don&#x27;t mix up applicator sticks; throw the #1 tools out after you&#x27;ve used them.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say you can get more than the prescribed 30 usages from it.</li>
            <li>To play it safe, do this when you don&#x27;t have any plans to go out.</li>
            <li>Stains the skin more than the hair.</li>
            <li>me&amp;#34; people that wear mascara to the gym so that their trainer won&#x27;t ask the if they are hungover just because they&#x27;re not wearing makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it five stars for my top lashes, but it did not bind to my bottom lashes at all.  </li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many, many years and hope to always be able to get it.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product to dye my blond eyebrows for about 15 years, maybe more.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad this happened at a time I was on vacation</li>
            <li>Just be sure to watch your time and remove with soap and water after time is allotted.  </li>
            <li>great product, thanks</li>
            <li>I love all of the comments here, read them all before I ordered, and, followed some of the advice.  </li>
            <li>Very good product and was shipped quickly and packaged very well.  </li>
            <li>A good way to get both sides of the brows is to brush them up with an eyebrow brush to get the backside, then you really dont worry about smudges.</li>
            <li>Sweet!</li>
            <li>All the ingredients come in blister-pack plastic trays with foil over, and the foil does not come off easily.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to do</li>
            <li>I find this easy to apply with a mascara brush.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, even though it is a two step process.</li>
            <li>This product sounds so easy to use.</li>
            <li>So easy to use if you apply with a Q-tip.</li>
            <li>So easy to use</li>
            <li>so easy to apply.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have found - I think Roux is the exact kind of lash tint</li>
            <li>my brows fine.</li>
            <li>Works great on the brows, but I do not great great color on the lashes.</li>
            <li>As someone with light lashes (lighter than my hair color even) who does not wear a ton of makeup, I&#x27;ve been wrestling with mascara issues for years.</li>
            <li>Apply however you&#x27;re comfortable.</li>
            <li>I hope you will be as amazed as I was, because they came out fantastic.  </li>
            <li>and this makes them a light brown.</li>
            <li>I have light blond lashes.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>It works perfectly on eyelashes that are sun bleached, but not those that are grey which is really what I bought it for.</li>
            <li>I was excited when they introduced the blister pack packaging.</li>
            <li>I read other reviews, thank you so much they were helpful with the tips, decided to try this product and was thoroughly impressed with it.</li>
            <li>the price was right!  </li>
            <li>Overall, I think this product is very easy to use and a worthwhile expenditure.</li>
            <li>I actually like using the provided applicators with cotton as I can create a more precise tip than a Q-tip for better application.  </li>
            <li>This product works really well, love the color and the way it makes my brown look thicker than they are, plus you can use it often.  </li>
            <li>I lightly brush the #2 (color) on and rarely smudge,</li>
            <li>If you have thick brows this is perfect.</li>
            <li>I found that letting both steps dry completely, maybe 5 minutes, worked the best.</li>
            <li>It is pretty easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Since the color changes immediately upon applying solution #2, I was able to remove some staining with the stain remover, but I wanted to get as many of the outer hairs as possible to thicken up my brows, so some staining was unavoidable.</li>
            <li>I use it on my brows only with good success.</li>
            <li>Just wish it didn&#x27;t fade so quickly.</li>
            <li>if I need to clean up any little mark, the remover works great.</li>
            <li>It lasts about 3 weeks on me (I am a med blond) and by the end of that time it is pretty light.</li>
            <li>So... I felt pretty comfortable attempting this myself.  </li>
            <li>I have found that with a large magnifying mirror and a lot of q-tips I can easily apply to both my brows and lashes.</li>
            <li>Love it - can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>Fast and easy.</li>
            <li>This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this product, love it!</li>
            <li>and I am not afraid to go swimming or remove a motor cycle helmet, anything that would take the make up off before to reveal my embarassing brows, or lack there of.</li>
            <li>Worth the investment.</li>
            <li>Summary of Roux Lash Tint: much better than mascara or paying too much at a salon, works well enough, but if there is a better alternative I will go with that.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now I look like some kind of medieval scholar.  </li>
            <li>Its so much more natural looking than eye brow pencil.     </li>
            <li>Then instead of the toothpicks, I used a disposable eyelash wand and lightly wrapped it with a tiny bit of cotton to absorb more liquid.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s turned out to be just right for making my lashes look visible without looking like I&#x27;m veering towards Tammy Fae.</li>
            <li>so i fervently used the stain remover until the dye came off my skin and the shade was right.  </li>
            <li>Do it right away.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t looking for wows, I was just looking for a product that would leave me able to go confidently in public in the morning without a full face-on and lots/lots/</li>
            <li>My experience may not be relevant because of my particular condition, but I&#x27;m posting because others with vitiligo may be looking for something like this.</li>
            <li>I then swept swab over top of brow hair, CAREFULLY, as to not touch skin or it will STAIN  5th--</li>
            <li>have dishwater blonde hair and very light brows.  </li>
            <li>It does work very fast though.</li>
            <li>I decided to purchase it on Amazon, in the 40 count, it was still not terribly expensive and cheaper than Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found that the first dye stung my eyes (again)</li>
            <li>This product would be better served by simply including q-tips instead since they are practically a necessity in applying it.  </li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m still pleased with the overall efficacy of this product, I do wish that the coloring lasted a bit longer than it does.</li>
            <li>Finding the exact brand and kit, I replaced it.  </li>
            <li>I would like more alternatives and also IWISH they still sold the blue color.</li>
            <li>This is first Amazon review in probably a year.  </li>
            <li>When the first application did not leave any color on my brows or lashes</li>
            <li>If you are touchy about your eye area, practice first.  </li>
            <li>Take a cotton pad and put some of the color remover on it and give a good firm rub to each brow.</li>
            <li>The Godefry kit did what it claimed, but the staining of the skin was horrid and hard to get off, this kit includes a nice stain remover and even without it, the staining wipes off pretty easily.</li>
            <li>It does take a steady hand and patience, but is worth it al.</li>
            <li>I guess I should have looked at the expiration date on my old package (years past), because my new one works amazingly!!  </li>
            <li>the first time i used it straight</li>
            <li>It is cheap enough for me to keep using it as my natural lashes are so light.</li>
            <li>However, it would still be nice if I didn&#x27;t have to re-color every week to maintain a dark brown.</li>
            <li>I have tried a couple of other products and they are not half as good and do not provide a stain remover</li>
            <li>My brows were turning green with the dark brown Godefry kit, but this one they look wonderful.</li>
            <li>This was so easy to buy and cost the same as I paid at beauty supply houses.  </li>
            <li>Tried a few more times on my own with even longer times and had even less success.  </li>
            <li>Nice little mark-up for the salon, even accounting for labor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product works very well.</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>Really.</li>
            <li>My lower lashes aren&#x27;t really dyed at all.  </li>
            <li>(btw, that one is about $1 per application, but you have to buy a whole box).  </li>
            <li>shut the whole time</li>
            <li>My lower lashes aren&#x27;t really dyed at all.  </li>
            <li>(btw, that one is about $1 per application, but you have to buy a whole box).  </li>
            <li>shut the whole time</li>
            <li>but this Roux product is VERY different!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very sparse brows</li>
            <li>You really have to try n get the dye on your brow hair and not your skin, but if you get it on your skin, it goes away after about 3 days or so.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and</li>
            <li>As with most things, there was a wide field of user ratings, experience stories, tips on use, complaints and praises.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Does very well.</li>
            <li>Also I could not get much color at all to take on my bottom lashes.</li>
            <li>You have to use it daily, but it works well and looks more natural than pencils or powder.</li>
            <li>I have hearty protein rich welshness in me hair, but I give my strongest recommendation for this roux stuff [especially when combined with a shu uemura eyelash curler.]  </li>
            <li>The color is much more natural looking than the Godefry, and it doesn&#x27;t take as long.</li>
            <li>You will see the color appear quite quickly, and any mistakes you make by getting it on your skin will show up dramatically, so have the stain remover open and a swab ready and daub those errors IMMEDIATELY.  </li>
            <li>On top of that I still had the dark brown staining.</li>
            <li>I would have loved it to, but it is probably why perms never took to my hair when I was little, and manic panic punks colours washed out instantly in my teens.  </li>
            <li>Brown much better than black.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m older, in my 50&#x27;s, and dislike using mascara except to go out.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for anything more than a tiny white root</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>(I highly recommend buying a brush or mascara wand instead of using cotton tipped applicators.)</li>
            <li>The multiple steps necessary would be worth it only if it worked better.</li>
            <li>I tried the Roux Lash and Brow Tint on my eyelashes with high hopes of looking &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; without having to wear mascara.  </li>
            <li>With a steady hand and a large magnifying mirror, I didn&#x27;t find it necessary to use vaseline as a resist after the first use.</li>
            <li>wish it were a little easier to use :)</li>
            <li>The dye (which is really liquid silver - it&#x27;s clear when it is in the bottle) adheres to the hair on contact.</li>
            <li>Really you can nearly scratch off the color if you catch it immediately.     </li>
            <li>As for application, I dispense with pretty much everything but a bit of vasoline applied with an eyeshadow brush to the upper and lower lid and some caution with application.</li>
            <li>If you want them darker, go back and repeat the process the instructions say, and you can do it right away.      </li>
            <li>You can easily do both your brows in 10 minutes or less and the \\&quot;stain</li>
            <li>I ordered brown, and it comes out dark brown, which works fine for me.</li>
            <li>After running out of the Godefry kit, I decided to look around at other kits that may be better, last longer etc.</li>
            <li>I finally did some research about brow dye and it was my first time doing it since receiving this product,</li>
            <li>My first time, in all, took about 15 minutes total.  </li>
            <li>I ended up with a significant chemical burn on one brow and blisters and removed skin on the other.</li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t get it near your eyes!  </li>
            <li>I try to avoid using that and just live with the smudges for about a day after which they naturally wear off.     </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, covers well, and takes just a few minutes to do.</li>
            <li>Because my brows are sparse nowadays, I need to re-tint them every 2-3 weeks, but as the Roux does the job quickly and with minimal fuss, this is not a problem.</li>
            <li>It is worth it when it really gets down to it.  </li>
            <li>The eye I did first is not nearly as black or luscious as the one I did second.  </li>
            <li>The eye I did first is not nearly as black or luscious as the one I did second.  </li>
            <li>recently found out that you can buy lash tints online (and while FDA has a warning against home lash tinting with certain ingredients, neither Roux nor 1000 Hours have those ingredients, from my research)</li>
            <li>They give you a huge amount of product that is basically wasted or spilled.</li>
            <li>It should be completely clear at all times before you apply it.</li>
            <li>It works really well, but I only use it for eyebrows and haven&#x27;t tried it on lashes.</li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t sting the same, and the application wand is much easier (like a mascara wand).  </li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t sting the same, and the application wand is much easier (like a mascara wand).  </li>
            <li>Never had my lashes tinted professionally and see no need to with this product.</li>
            <li>With this product you can really dye your entire eyebrows which is what I want</li>
            <li>She used professional hair coloring.  </li>
            <li>My eyes were nearly swelled shut.</li>
            <li>Natural look.</li>
            <li>Some of it came back, but I no longer have the thick mane on my head, nor my nice eyelashes and eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I use this product only on my brows, as my lashes are black, so I cannot vouch for its success with eyelashes, but for brows it works very well!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my kit over a year and the bottles are still over half full and I just used it....</li>
            <li>For blonds, get the brown to start, it looks super natural, and then diorshow or clinique for a blackest black mascara for events.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t try to wrap too much cotton on the stick, it is much easier to work with the less you use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a contact wearer and not too fussy about touching my eyes, but I did a few dry runs, just to become accustomed to the procedure.  </li>
            <li>It lasts long too so thank you so much.</li>
            <li>I also find that a wet q-tip will remove excess pretty well too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been nearly a week and the color is as dark as when I first applied it.  </li>
            <li>The foil is too thick to easily remove and if the two chemicals mix basically the kit is destroyed.</li>
            <li>There is really no other product out there that is specifically for eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>My eyebrows are naturally very light, thin, and unnoticeable.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, the sticks are simply a waste and this company would be better off ceasing to include them or providing q-tips, brushes or some other type of functional applicator in the package.   </li>
            <li>Like mascara, but natural (ok, maybe the wrong word, but they looked natural!)</li>
            <li>This is long lasting, and I&#x27;m very satisified with the quality.  </li>
            <li>The lashes on one eye and sections of my brows are white to the point of looking clear.  </li>
            <li>so any stain that is left on your skin wears off naturally.</li>
            <li>After trying a professional, I gave up as it only lasted week.</li>
            <li>While I FINALLY do have eyebrows and it is WONDERFUL (instead of white hair that no one cold see), it was not worth the pain to achieve them.</li>
            <li>I finally bought a new brow kit after years of using the same one.  </li>
            <li>I mean when I put a clean q-tip it comes out with \\&quot;tint\\&quot; on it.</li>
            <li>I prefer it for lashes mainly because as a blonde, it&#x27;s desirable to have dark lashes, but that same intensity can look harsh on brows.&lt;br /&gt;One must be careful and adept in application due to the watery nature of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>The second dye (I guess the first dye preps the hair, the second turns it coal black)</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid $60 at a boutique salon to have my lashes tinted, and while I didn&#x27;t much care for the experience (even though I kept my eyes closed, apparently they fluttered as they stayed closed, and some of the dye ran into my eyes and made me tear up excessively, so some of the dye ran down a bit with the tears - cleaned up ok, but the dye stung my eyes a bit)</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product, and I hope other gal&#x27;s out there with overplucked brow problems find this post, I had been looking for a solution for years!</li>

            <li> They will never be perfect, I still have to fill in some sparse areas with pencil, but its A LOT better</li>
            <li> Nice!  </li>
            <li> My lashes, like others, took a couple of applications to darken and are a perfect color and the remover worked great to clean up my wee booboo&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This dye is very easy to use and gave me a beautiful brown lash line.</li>
            <li> It is really good in the summer...</li>
            <li> , I LOVED how my eyelashes looked.  </li>
            <li> Vaseline is a good preventive measure.</li>
            <li> I tried the medium brown Roux color and it worked surprisingly well.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find out there are products on the market that I can use to dye my own eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I also used Q Tips to apply and clean up with excellent results.</li>
            <li> In the end I am very pleased to have this product.</li>

            <li> It was sent quickly and arrived in very good condition.</li>
            <li> Roux Lash and Brow Tint is easy to use, looks great and the color lasts for 3-4 weeks.</li>
            <li> I also really liked how you add #2</li>
            <li> and I can own up to that.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t dye my own eyelashes</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re a nice medium brown.  </li>
            <li> huge thank-you to the tipsters who made the process easier and very very effective.</li>
            <li> First, it&#x27;s very good.  </li>
            <li> It does a good job of dying brows and lashes and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, good instructions.</li>
            <li> Like any hair coloring, it fades with time, but it&#x27;s very easy to re-apply as needed.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> As a last stitch effort, I decided to combine the best growth product I had with a tint.</li>
            <li> I came across a review on the Godefry kit saying that the Roux kit was actually better - in the 40 count</li>
            <li> I probably could have removed more</li>
            <li> They love the results.</li>
            <li> Wish I&#x27;d tried it many years and tubes of mascara ago.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I will be glad to provide an update about 1000Hour lash tint once it comes in from eBay</li>
            <li> I will be glad to provide an update about 1000Hour lash tint once it comes in from eBay</li>
            <li> i love this product.  </li>
            <li> I do like the product better than paying the salon and even having to throw it out twice a year still makes it cheaper than going to the salon.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years off and on.</li>
            <li> Applying the stain remover changed it to a lovely shade of brown/orange.  </li>
            <li> I wanted darker lashes, I look better that way.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> Make sure you don&#x27;t mix up applicator sticks; throw the #1 tools out after you&#x27;ve used them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say you can get more than the prescribed 30 usages from it.</li>
            <li> To play it safe, do this when you don&#x27;t have any plans to go out.</li>
            <li> Stains the skin more than the hair.</li>
            <li> me&amp;#34; people that wear mascara to the gym so that their trainer won&#x27;t ask the if they are hungover just because they&#x27;re not wearing makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it five stars for my top lashes, but it did not bind to my bottom lashes at all.  </li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many, many years and hope to always be able to get it.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product to dye my blond eyebrows for about 15 years, maybe more.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad this happened at a time I was on vacation</li>
            <li> Just be sure to watch your time and remove with soap and water after time is allotted.  </li>
            <li> great product, thanks</li>
            <li> I love all of the comments here, read them all before I ordered, and, followed some of the advice.  </li>
            <li> Very good product and was shipped quickly and packaged very well.  </li>
            <li> A good way to get both sides of the brows is to brush them up with an eyebrow brush to get the backside, then you really dont worry about smudges.</li>
            <li> Sweet!</li>
            <li> All the ingredients come in blister-pack plastic trays with foil over, and the foil does not come off easily.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to do</li>
            <li> I find this easy to apply with a mascara brush.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, even though it is a two step process.</li>
            <li> This product sounds so easy to use.</li>
            <li> So easy to use if you apply with a Q-tip.</li>
            <li> So easy to use</li>
            <li> so easy to apply.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have found - I think Roux is the exact kind of lash tint</li>
            <li> my brows fine.</li>
            <li> Works great on the brows, but I do not great great color on the lashes.</li>
            <li> As someone with light lashes (lighter than my hair color even) who does not wear a ton of makeup, I&#x27;ve been wrestling with mascara issues for years.</li>
            <li> Apply however you&#x27;re comfortable.</li>
            <li> I hope you will be as amazed as I was, because they came out fantastic.  </li>
            <li> and this makes them a light brown.</li>
            <li> I have light blond lashes.</li>
            <li> Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> It works perfectly on eyelashes that are sun bleached, but not those that are grey which is really what I bought it for.</li>
            <li> I was excited when they introduced the blister pack packaging.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews, thank you so much they were helpful with the tips, decided to try this product and was thoroughly impressed with it.</li>
            <li> the price was right!  </li>
            <li> Overall, I think this product is very easy to use and a worthwhile expenditure.</li>
            <li> I actually like using the provided applicators with cotton as I can create a more precise tip than a Q-tip for better application.  </li>
            <li> This product works really well, love the color and the way it makes my brown look thicker than they are, plus you can use it often.  </li>
            <li> I lightly brush the #2 (color) on and rarely smudge,</li>
            <li> If you have thick brows this is perfect.</li>
            <li> I found that letting both steps dry completely, maybe 5 minutes, worked the best.</li>
            <li> It is pretty easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Since the color changes immediately upon applying solution #2, I was able to remove some staining with the stain remover, but I wanted to get as many of the outer hairs as possible to thicken up my brows, so some staining was unavoidable.</li>
            <li> I use it on my brows only with good success.</li>
            <li> Just wish it didn&#x27;t fade so quickly.</li>
            <li> if I need to clean up any little mark, the remover works great.</li>
            <li> It lasts about 3 weeks on me (I am a med blond) and by the end of that time it is pretty light.</li>
            <li> So... I felt pretty comfortable attempting this myself.  </li>
            <li> I have found that with a large magnifying mirror and a lot of q-tips I can easily apply to both my brows and lashes.</li>
            <li> Love it - can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Fast and easy.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this product, love it!</li>
            <li> and I am not afraid to go swimming or remove a motor cycle helmet, anything that would take the make up off before to reveal my embarassing brows, or lack there of.</li>
            <li> Worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Summary of Roux Lash Tint: much better than mascara or paying too much at a salon, works well enough, but if there is a better alternative I will go with that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now I look like some kind of medieval scholar.  </li>
            <li> Its so much more natural looking than eye brow pencil.     </li>
            <li> Then instead of the toothpicks, I used a disposable eyelash wand and lightly wrapped it with a tiny bit of cotton to absorb more liquid.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s turned out to be just right for making my lashes look visible without looking like I&#x27;m veering towards Tammy Fae.</li>
            <li> so i fervently used the stain remover until the dye came off my skin and the shade was right.  </li>
            <li> Do it right away.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t looking for wows, I was just looking for a product that would leave me able to go confidently in public in the morning without a full face-on and lots/lots/</li>
            <li> My experience may not be relevant because of my particular condition, but I&#x27;m posting because others with vitiligo may be looking for something like this.</li>
            <li> I then swept swab over top of brow hair, CAREFULLY, as to not touch skin or it will STAIN  5th--</li>
            <li> have dishwater blonde hair and very light brows.  </li>
            <li> It does work very fast though.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase it on Amazon, in the 40 count, it was still not terribly expensive and cheaper than Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found that the first dye stung my eyes (again)</li>
            <li> This product would be better served by simply including q-tips instead since they are practically a necessity in applying it.  </li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m still pleased with the overall efficacy of this product, I do wish that the coloring lasted a bit longer than it does.</li>
            <li> Finding the exact brand and kit, I replaced it.  </li>
            <li> I would like more alternatives and also IWISH they still sold the blue color.</li>
            <li> This is first Amazon review in probably a year.  </li>
            <li> When the first application did not leave any color on my brows or lashes</li>
            <li> If you are touchy about your eye area, practice first.  </li>
            <li> Take a cotton pad and put some of the color remover on it and give a good firm rub to each brow.</li>
            <li> The Godefry kit did what it claimed, but the staining of the skin was horrid and hard to get off, this kit includes a nice stain remover and even without it, the staining wipes off pretty easily.</li>
            <li> It does take a steady hand and patience, but is worth it al.</li>
            <li> I guess I should have looked at the expiration date on my old package (years past), because my new one works amazingly!!  </li>
            <li> the first time i used it straight</li>
            <li> It is cheap enough for me to keep using it as my natural lashes are so light.</li>
            <li> However, it would still be nice if I didn&#x27;t have to re-color every week to maintain a dark brown.</li>
            <li> I have tried a couple of other products and they are not half as good and do not provide a stain remover</li>
            <li> My brows were turning green with the dark brown Godefry kit, but this one they look wonderful.</li>
            <li> This was so easy to buy and cost the same as I paid at beauty supply houses.  </li>
            <li> Tried a few more times on my own with even longer times and had even less success.  </li>
            <li> Nice little mark-up for the salon, even accounting for labor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product works very well.</li>
            <li> Haha.</li>
            <li> Really.</li>
            <li> My lower lashes aren&#x27;t really dyed at all.  </li>
            <li> (btw, that one is about $1 per application, but you have to buy a whole box).  </li>
            <li> shut the whole time</li>
            <li> My lower lashes aren&#x27;t really dyed at all.  </li>
            <li> (btw, that one is about $1 per application, but you have to buy a whole box).  </li>
            <li> shut the whole time</li>
            <li> but this Roux product is VERY different!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very sparse brows</li>
            <li> You really have to try n get the dye on your brow hair and not your skin, but if you get it on your skin, it goes away after about 3 days or so.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and</li>
            <li> As with most things, there was a wide field of user ratings, experience stories, tips on use, complaints and praises.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Does very well.</li>
            <li> Also I could not get much color at all to take on my bottom lashes.</li>
            <li> You have to use it daily, but it works well and looks more natural than pencils or powder.</li>
            <li> I have hearty protein rich welshness in me hair, but I give my strongest recommendation for this roux stuff [especially when combined with a shu uemura eyelash curler.]  </li>
            <li> The color is much more natural looking than the Godefry, and it doesn&#x27;t take as long.</li>
            <li> You will see the color appear quite quickly, and any mistakes you make by getting it on your skin will show up dramatically, so have the stain remover open and a swab ready and daub those errors IMMEDIATELY.  </li>
            <li> On top of that I still had the dark brown staining.</li>
            <li> I would have loved it to, but it is probably why perms never took to my hair when I was little, and manic panic punks colours washed out instantly in my teens.  </li>
            <li> Brown much better than black.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m older, in my 50&#x27;s, and dislike using mascara except to go out.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for anything more than a tiny white root</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> (I highly recommend buying a brush or mascara wand instead of using cotton tipped applicators.)</li>
            <li> The multiple steps necessary would be worth it only if it worked better.</li>
            <li> I tried the Roux Lash and Brow Tint on my eyelashes with high hopes of looking &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; without having to wear mascara.  </li>
            <li> With a steady hand and a large magnifying mirror, I didn&#x27;t find it necessary to use vaseline as a resist after the first use.</li>
            <li> wish it were a little easier to use :)</li>
            <li> The dye (which is really liquid silver - it&#x27;s clear when it is in the bottle) adheres to the hair on contact.</li>
            <li> Really you can nearly scratch off the color if you catch it immediately.     </li>
            <li> As for application, I dispense with pretty much everything but a bit of vasoline applied with an eyeshadow brush to the upper and lower lid and some caution with application.</li>
            <li> If you want them darker, go back and repeat the process the instructions say, and you can do it right away.      </li>
            <li> You can easily do both your brows in 10 minutes or less and the \\&quot;stain</li>
            <li> I ordered brown, and it comes out dark brown, which works fine for me.</li>
            <li> After running out of the Godefry kit, I decided to look around at other kits that may be better, last longer etc.</li>
            <li> I finally did some research about brow dye and it was my first time doing it since receiving this product,</li>
            <li> My first time, in all, took about 15 minutes total.  </li>
            <li> I ended up with a significant chemical burn on one brow and blisters and removed skin on the other.</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t get it near your eyes!  </li>
            <li> I try to avoid using that and just live with the smudges for about a day after which they naturally wear off.     </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, covers well, and takes just a few minutes to do.</li>
            <li> Because my brows are sparse nowadays, I need to re-tint them every 2-3 weeks, but as the Roux does the job quickly and with minimal fuss, this is not a problem.</li>
            <li> It is worth it when it really gets down to it.  </li>
            <li> The eye I did first is not nearly as black or luscious as the one I did second.  </li>
            <li> The eye I did first is not nearly as black or luscious as the one I did second.  </li>
            <li> recently found out that you can buy lash tints online (and while FDA has a warning against home lash tinting with certain ingredients, neither Roux nor 1000 Hours have those ingredients, from my research)</li>
            <li> They give you a huge amount of product that is basically wasted or spilled.</li>
            <li> It should be completely clear at all times before you apply it.</li>
            <li> It works really well, but I only use it for eyebrows and haven&#x27;t tried it on lashes.</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t sting the same, and the application wand is much easier (like a mascara wand).  </li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t sting the same, and the application wand is much easier (like a mascara wand).  </li>
            <li> Never had my lashes tinted professionally and see no need to with this product.</li>
            <li> With this product you can really dye your entire eyebrows which is what I want</li>
            <li> She used professional hair coloring.  </li>
            <li> My eyes were nearly swelled shut.</li>
            <li> Natural look.</li>
            <li> Some of it came back, but I no longer have the thick mane on my head, nor my nice eyelashes and eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I use this product only on my brows, as my lashes are black, so I cannot vouch for its success with eyelashes, but for brows it works very well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my kit over a year and the bottles are still over half full and I just used it....</li>
            <li> For blonds, get the brown to start, it looks super natural, and then diorshow or clinique for a blackest black mascara for events.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t try to wrap too much cotton on the stick, it is much easier to work with the less you use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a contact wearer and not too fussy about touching my eyes, but I did a few dry runs, just to become accustomed to the procedure.  </li>
            <li> It lasts long too so thank you so much.</li>
            <li> I also find that a wet q-tip will remove excess pretty well too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been nearly a week and the color is as dark as when I first applied it.  </li>
            <li> The foil is too thick to easily remove and if the two chemicals mix basically the kit is destroyed.</li>
            <li> There is really no other product out there that is specifically for eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> My eyebrows are naturally very light, thin, and unnoticeable.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, the sticks are simply a waste and this company would be better off ceasing to include them or providing q-tips, brushes or some other type of functional applicator in the package.   </li>
            <li> Like mascara, but natural (ok, maybe the wrong word, but they looked natural!)</li>
            <li> This is long lasting, and I&#x27;m very satisified with the quality.  </li>
            <li> The lashes on one eye and sections of my brows are white to the point of looking clear.  </li>
            <li> so any stain that is left on your skin wears off naturally.</li>
            <li> After trying a professional, I gave up as it only lasted week.</li>
            <li> While I FINALLY do have eyebrows and it is WONDERFUL (instead of white hair that no one cold see), it was not worth the pain to achieve them.</li>
            <li> I finally bought a new brow kit after years of using the same one.  </li>
            <li> I mean when I put a clean q-tip it comes out with \\&quot;tint\\&quot; on it.</li>
            <li> I prefer it for lashes mainly because as a blonde, it&#x27;s desirable to have dark lashes, but that same intensity can look harsh on brows.&lt;br /&gt;One must be careful and adept in application due to the watery nature of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> The second dye (I guess the first dye preps the hair, the second turns it coal black)</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid $60 at a boutique salon to have my lashes tinted, and while I didn&#x27;t much care for the experience (even though I kept my eyes closed, apparently they fluttered as they stayed closed, and some of the dye ran into my eyes and made me tear up excessively, so some of the dye ran down a bit with the tears - cleaned up ok, but the dye stung my eyes a bit)</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product, and I hope other gal&#x27;s out there with overplucked brow problems find this post, I had been looking for a solution for years!</li>
            <li> Love not having the mess, especially in the hot muggy summer months.</li>
            <li> Despite attempting to be very very careful to not cross contaminate the chemicals between number 1 and number 2 (using q-tip only once and throwing it away, making sure the cap on 1 stays on 1 and is never put on 2) I find that in about 6 months or less (with 75% of the bottle still unused) usually I start to see contamination.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, be very careful to only get the product on your hair and try to completely avoid your skin.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this, I followed the directions, and got a little color on my lashes and eyebrows, but not much.  </li>
            <li> This coloring does not last as long as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give 5 stars is they don&#x27;t tell you how long to leave on liquid #2.</li>
            <li> I;ve used this product for years, buut some purveyor&#x27;s color doesn&#x27;t last as long as others.  </li>
            <li> The stylist used a dye product that was supposed to penetrate the hair but white was more difficult than gray to take the dye, apparently, so it got harder and harder to hide them over time.  </li>
            <li> An unforeseen benefit is that now I can also use a little bit of mascara on say the tips or outer lashes for more dramatic effect without it looking obviously half-done.   </li>
            <li> remover\\&quot; works wonders at removing stains from the skin so no major coloring \\&quot;accidents\\&quot; occur.  </li>
            <li> The product in the salons do not last very long (I use a Clarisonic</li>
            <li> but I just kept a folded-up piece of toilet paper below my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> but I just kept a folded-up piece of toilet paper below my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> Then simply swab on solution #2 the same way, painting each hair carefully.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t put on just a little mascara without it looking like I ran out of the apartment in the middle of a fire alarm, but when I put on enough for uniform coverage I suddenly feel like I have spider eyes (and inevitably, the mascara will have migrated downwards by the end of the day, leaving me with sleep-deprived looking spider eyes.)</li>
            <li> My only other option was to stroke on brown mascara on the brows daily, which worked</li>
            <li> I had a very small fan pointed at my face on low, creating a gentle breeze which prevented my eyes from stinging.  </li>
            <li> The color depending on how fast your hair grows and how hard you wash your brows will determine the length of time the dye will remain on your hair.  </li>
            <li> have dirty blonde/brown hair and pretty much blond lashes and eye brows.  </li>
            <li> Prepare your sticks, at least a couple for each of the two solutions, and have swabs ready in case you need the stain cleaner.  </li>
            <li> Work with solution #1 and carefully brush onto each hair, front and back, working from closer to the skin outward, being as careful as possible to not touch the skin underneath.  </li>
            <li> I have dark auburn hair, and although the natural color of my brows is black (with some gray mixed in now)</li>
            <li> I live in a small town where no professional does brows</li>
            <li> Although the bottles are small, each application uses only a tiny amount, so my order should last a long time.</li>
            <li> I tried it on a little white root area next to my ears (the rest of my hair was doing well for tint) and low and behold it darkened my little white spots</li>
            <li> prep brows as indicated in directions, let dry.  </li>
            <li> results have been so dramatic that I&#x27;m now rarely wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> Wash the brows as directed and dry thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> Let dry about three to five minutes before proceeding.  </li>
            <li> After waiting the amount of time recommended in the instructions, wash the brows again and pat dry.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t close my eyes until both sets of lashes were well coated, then I relaxed for five minutes or so to let it all dry.  </li>
            <li> Not worth my time in my opinion, also not worth the chemical fumes being near my eye.</li>
            <li> It cost me about $5 (including shipping) on eBay for a single application (I recommend trying it that way).  </li>
            <li> If your eyelashes aren&#x27;t as dark enough you can always do the application again.</li>
            <li> The color tuned dark instantly!!  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t seem to loose</li>
            <li> I could probably get it down to ten now.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase this kit for as long as they make it!!</li>
            <li> I like blue black on my lashes</li>
            <li> but they only seem to have brown and black now.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last long - I have to apply it every few days to keep my lashes black (as opposed to blonde).  </li>
            <li> However, the product being the size it is, I do feel it could have been packaged in a smaller box for less cost in shipping.  </li>
            <li> What little color I got didn&#x27;t last very long at all.  </li>
            <li> I usually apply the tint a little thinner than I would an eyebrow pencil or powder and then end up filling in with a pencil for an overall natural effect.  </li>
            <li> and I would have to agree that the remover is very pungent and unpleasant (even though I only use far away from the eye itself).</li>
            <li> (also be careful around your eyes, I did read in a medical journal that the active chemical can cause permanent damage if it makes eye- contact!)</li>
            <li> I began to use men&#x27;s hair color at home about three years ago and would very carefully daub my brows with that product (against manufacturers&#x27; CYA instructions) but the results never lasted long.  </li>
            <li> This product is very easy to use and, frankly, I&#x27;m disappointed that I did not discover it sooner.  </li>
            <li> even the little blonde tips.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use women&#x27;s rogaine (the generic brand one) to grow out new hairs in my brows, which are very thin and usually blonde like a baby hair</li>
            <li> I now have a scar on the badly burned side and while I am sure it will heal eventually, it will take time.</li>
            <li> I did something stupid on my own</li>
            <li> &#x27;s: Not really a con, but</li>
            <li> It can stain the skin thats why you have to be careful and use lots of vaseline where you don&#x27;t want the product.</li>
            <li> It is harder to do yourself and recommend having a friend help you out.</li>
            <li> I combed my brows in the opposite direction to make them messy and stand up.  </li>
            <li> Treat the tints carefully and there shouldn&#x27;t be any sloshing and smudging.</li>
            <li> I had to pierce some of the chemicals with a safety pin to open it, and even then had trouble dipping the wands into the chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li> The few eyebrows that did return are so white that they don&#x27;t show up at all.</li>
            <li> After scrubbing for about an hour, with a combination of elbow grease, water, and the stain remover... my eyebrows are save-able only covering them with a heavy coat of foundation.  </li>
            <li> Be careful if you use it on your eyes.</li>
            <li> Instead of using the prescribed petroleum jelly to cover things I dont want dyed, I&#x27;m just careful.</li>
            <li> Yes, you do have to be careful.</li>
            <li> In the end this only lasted a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have pale yellow eyebrows</li>
            <li> and my brows were a little too dark, the second time i diluted it</li>
            <li> but it still took half as long as the other kit did.</li>
            <li> I think I left it on for 30 seconds before I freaked out as it was turning too dark (black, not brown!)  </li>
            <li> My daughter helped me with the process, and we repeated it several times, using longer times each session, and some, but very little, color was deposited on my lashes.  </li>
            <li> but was messy, wore off quickly, and was tedious.  </li>
            <li> Just BE CAREFUL &amp; take your time!</li>
            <li> I have heard from other feedback that with 1000Hour you don&#x27;t need to keep your eyes</li>
            <li> I have heard from other feedback that with 1000Hour you don&#x27;t need to keep your eyes</li>
            <li> and I lost all the hair on my body due to the chemotherapy.</li>
            <li> I recognize that because I swim in a chlorinated pool 5-6 days a week I probably experience faster color-fading than other customers.</li>
            <li> Like other reviews had mentioned</li>
            <li> Needs getting used to before doing on other people.</li>
            <li> For the next few days I treated every few hours with burn cream.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to leave a positive review that results in someone carelessly injuring themselves.   </li>
            <li> /&gt;Contrary to some others&#x27; advise, use the little sticks with minimal cotton wrap.  </li>
            <li> (I have dark brown hair).</li>
            <li> The brown tint goes on extremely dark</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t dilute it for a lighter shade of brown because I like the dark brown color that it provides.</li>
            <li> I have blond eyebrows but dark hair.</li>
            <li> The colors run dark, though, so keep this in mind when you order.</li>
            <li> I am a blond with naturally dark lashes and find the brown softer than the black.</li>
            <li> I think of it as less a substitute for mascara than an alternative (and supplement) to it.</li>
            <li> turned my fingertips black.</li>
            <li> I buy the bottles (both brown for brow and black for lashes).</li>
            <li> The bar code says it is &amp;#34;brown&amp;#34; when the box and product are actually black.  </li>
            <li> The reason being is I had to repeat the process 4x over to get my lashes black.</li>
            <li> Generally, if I don&#x27;t do that, people ask me if I&#x27;m tired [blond lashes].</li>
            <li> And if you mess up you can just wipe it off.</li>
            <li> I was apprehensive at first, afraid that the process would make me look like I was wearing heavy makeup all the time</li>
            <li> I felt I would have less waste.</li>
            <li> and you will waste less solution this way in case you thought about using cotton swabs.  </li>
            <li> , the black tint looks too harsh.</li>
            <li> and it did make them a little darker, but I still needed to fill them in every day.</li>
            <li> While not holding the product accountable for my stupid actions, I used this on my eyebrows just fine.</li>
            <li> Suddenly my brows were burning and it quickly became very painful.</li>
            <li> As with anything involving chemicals and eyes, be careful!!!</li>
            <li> however you definitely know that there are bad chemicals near your eyes.</li>
            <li> Carefully coat around the brows with a thin coat of petroleum jelly being careful to NOT touch any of the hair.  </li>
            <li> It will dye your skin but that doesn&#x27;t bother me because it washes off within a few days.  </li>
            <li> it def takes some practice, but now I no longer use a pencil everyday.</li>
            <li> It is extremely messy and wasteful.</li>
            <li> Waste is also an issue with the bottles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for a few years, seems my lashes have improved.</li>
            <li> Runs everywhere, leaves uneven darkening marks.</li>
            <li> I looked as if I had been crying for days.</li>
            <li> It works, but still messy to apply - seems like a gel would be easier.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> A few months ago, I tried a women&#x27;s hair coloring product and did the same thing with the brows, but again, poor results there.  </li>
            <li> Basically, he has very little opinion on the subject &amp; thinks I&#x27;m thoroughly crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The instructions said to use petroleum jelly (Vaseline) anywhere you don&#x27;t want turning black, and I faithfully ringed my eyes below and to the eyebrow, but never thought of putting it on my fingertips!  </li>
            <li> Looks like I was born with naturally thick, dark brows!</li>
            <li> but I know it will come off in the shower eventually, and it was not enough for a stranger to comment or give me a weird look over.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually discard the bottles at that time and replace.      </li>
            <li> Usually the fumes drift into your eyes and burn.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product two different times, and both times I was sent the wrong color.  </li>
            <li> I tried salon tints which use the same Roux products and they were expensive, $100.</li>
            <li> : I have very thin brows and for trying to dye whispy extra hairs to thicken them, I applied solution #1 generously to the outer edges of my brows to thicken them up.</li>
            <li> This product dyed all of the skin behind my eyebrows a dark brown color.  </li>
            <li> The brush I was applying it with hardly even turned color after step two.  </li>
            <li> Hard washing is about every 2 weeks to reapply.</li>
            <li> I have tried to let them grow and purchased expensive &amp;#34;eyebrow growth serums&amp;#34; with minimal results.</li>
            <li> however, for me at least, the dye did not come off with soap and water</li>
            <li> It loses a star for that.  </li>
            <li> No more mascara!  </li>
            <li> Was sent wrong product, black instead of brown.</li>
            <li> which is really hard if you have thin brows.</li>
            <li> They burnt my eyes and that does not have to happen if you use small pieces of cotton twisted around the toothpicks.  </li>
            <li> I have had thin, overplucked eyebrows for about 10 years</li>
            <li> so the thin eyebrow thing is just not gonna cut it.</li>
            <li> The other was in terrible condition with the blisters and missing skin.</li>
            <li> The mascara never gets all the way down to the base of my lashes anyway.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect</li>
            <li> As a person who may or may not be completely OBSESSED with eyebrows....  </li>
            <li> I will save this product and give to my salon staff to use on me as it is too difficult to use myself.</li>
            <li> use the silly accessories; they&#x27;re useless and cause staining.  </li>
            <li> This product was somewhat difficult to apply and probably took around an hour for my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Disappointing, considering the price.</li>
            <li> I rushed to the sink and splashed lots of cold water on the area.</li>
            <li> Did read all the warnings on directions, and it sounds dangerous to use.</li>
            <li> One brow looked like a very bad sunburn.</li>
            <li> I applied burn cream repeatedly to each brow and they were very painful.</li>
            <li> I used Roux but was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I think the stuff is awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Before describing my situation, I want to mention that I had used the godefry eyebrow tint before, and it worked okay but this stuff is 10x better! The Godefry kit did what it claimed, but the staining of the skin was horrid and hard to get off, this kit includes a nice stain remover and even without it, the staining wipes off pretty easily. Also, the Godefry kit would burn and turn any cuts white. This kit does not do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My situation: I have had thin, overplucked eyebrows for about 10 years, I am 25 now so the thin eyebrow thing is just not gonna cut it. I have tried to let them grow and purchased expensive &amp;#34;eyebrow growth serums&amp;#34; with minimal results. I have even considered tattoo or surgery to modify my brows, I am so embarassed of them. As a last stitch effort, I decided to combine the best growth product I had with a tint. I use women&#x27;s rogaine (the generic brand one) to grow out new hairs in my brows, which are very thin and usually blonde like a baby hair (I have dark brown hair). This *appeared* to do nothing before, but after tinting these whispy hairs BOOM! I had brows!! They will never be perfect, I still have to fill in some sparse areas with pencil, but its A LOT better and I am not afraid to go swimming or remove a motor cycle helmet, anything that would take the make up off before to reveal my embarassing brows, or lack there of. After running out of the Godefry kit, I decided to look around at other kits that may be better, last longer etc. I came across a review on the Godefry kit saying that the Roux kit was actually better - in the 40 count only (thank you stranger for posting that!). I decided to purchase it on Amazon, in the 40 count, it was still not terribly expensive and cheaper than Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s: The color is much more natural looking than the Godefry, and it doesn&#x27;t take as long. My brows were turning green with the dark brown Godefry kit, but this one they look wonderful. I did apply it twice but it still took half as long as the other kit did. I also really liked how you add #2 and everything changes color, like MAGIC!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s: Not really a con, but I don&#x27;t like the applicator sticks they give. I just used Q-Tips instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I have very thin brows and for trying to dye whispy extra hairs to thicken them, I applied solution #1 generously to the outer edges of my brows to thicken them up. It does not stain areas that do not have #1 when you apply #2. I also did not use petroleum jelly. Since the color changes immediately upon applying solution #2, I was able to remove some staining with the stain remover, but I wanted to get as many of the outer hairs as possible to thicken up my brows, so some staining was unavoidable. However, this tint was a dream to remove. I probably could have removed more but I know it will come off in the shower eventually, and it was not enough for a stranger to comment or give me a weird look over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product, and I hope other gal&#x27;s out there with overplucked brow problems find this post, I had been looking for a solution for years! It&#x27;s not perfect but it&#x27;s definitely better!</li>
            <li> This product works very well. It does a good job of dying brows and lashes and is easy to apply. There is a stain remover included that takes off the excess. It is great for those who need mascara and a pencil to darken lashes and brows. It is really good in the summer...it doesn&#x27;t wash off in the pool or from sweating. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am an esthetician and use this on my clients. They love the results. It can stain the skin thats why you have to be careful and use lots of vaseline where you don&#x27;t want the product. It is harder to do yourself and recommend having a friend help you out. If your eyelashes aren&#x27;t as dark enough you can always do the application again. It beats having to apply massacara if you just want some color. If you are looking for lenghting and volume than you will still have to use mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve permed my lashes before so I thought I could tint my lashes by myself. Haha. No. I did something stupid on my own and I can own up to that. While not holding the product accountable for my stupid actions, I used this on my eyebrows just fine. My eyelashes and brows are blonde. It didn&#x27;t color all of my brows all the way, but that&#x27;s nothing my Rimmel pencil can&#x27;t fix. Worth the investment.</li>
            <li> It works really well, but I only use it for eyebrows and haven&#x27;t tried it on lashes.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are naturally very light, thin, and unnoticeable. I used this 2 days ago and am EXTREMELY happy with the results!  Looks like I was born with naturally thick, dark brows! I do not have to use anything to fill them in/make darker!  I applied 3 times in a  row to achieve the darker brown i desired. Here is how i applied the solution, below:    1st--prep brows as indicated in directions, let dry.  2nd--I combed my brows in the opposite direction to make them messy and stand up.  3rd--Dab a cotton swab in solution 2 and sweep swab in opposite direction on brow hair (YOU ONLY WANT TO MAKE CONTACT WITH BROW HAIR)- under and on the tips of brows.  4th--I then swept swab over top of brow hair, CAREFULLY, as to not touch skin or it will STAIN  5th--let it sit for about 2 to 3 min, then pat wash off w/soap and water.  I did this 3 times. Once may be enough for you?</li>
            <li> As a person who may or may not be completely OBSESSED with eyebrows....  Okay, I&#x27;m obsessed with eyebrows. I admit it and declare myself an eyebrow \\&quot;expert\\&quot; having read every article ever written on eyebrows.  I annoy my husband often by asking his \\&quot;honest\\&quot; opinion about the state of my eyebrows.  Basically, he has very little opinion on the subject &amp; thinks I&#x27;m thoroughly crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dishwater blonde hair and very light brows.  The brown tint goes on extremely dark so be prepared! It will dye your skin but that doesn&#x27;t bother me because it washes off within a few days.  I usually apply the tint a little thinner than I would an eyebrow pencil or powder and then end up filling in with a pencil for an overall natural effect.  I actually like using the provided applicators with cotton as I can create a more precise tip than a Q-tip for better application.  I&#x27;ve never had a problem with staining &amp; I&#x27;ve never even bothered to use the petroleum jelly.  Just BE CAREFUL &amp; take your time! (also be careful around your eyes, I did read in a medical journal that the active chemical can cause permanent damage if it makes eye- contact!) I&#x27;ve had my kit over a year and the bottles are still over half full and I just used it.... it doesn&#x27;t seem to loose it&#x27;s potency.</li>
            <li> As someone with light lashes (lighter than my hair color even) who does not wear a ton of makeup, I&#x27;ve been wrestling with mascara issues for years. I can&#x27;t put on just a little mascara without it looking like I ran out of the apartment in the middle of a fire alarm, but when I put on enough for uniform coverage I suddenly feel like I have spider eyes (and inevitably, the mascara will have migrated downwards by the end of the day, leaving me with sleep-deprived looking spider eyes.) Enter lash tinting. I was apprehensive at first, afraid that the process would make me look like I was wearing heavy makeup all the time but it&#x27;s turned out to be just right for making my lashes look visible without looking like I&#x27;m veering towards Tammy Fae. The lack of downward migration when I yawn and thoughtlessly rub my eyes is also great. An unforeseen benefit is that now I can also use a little bit of mascara on say the tips or outer lashes for more dramatic effect without it looking obviously half-done.   As for application, I dispense with pretty much everything but a bit of vasoline applied with an eyeshadow brush to the upper and lower lid and some caution with application. Treat the tints carefully and there shouldn&#x27;t be any sloshing and smudging. (I highly recommend buying a brush or mascara wand instead of using cotton tipped applicators.) As with anything involving chemicals and eyes, be careful!!! Really. I don&#x27;t want to leave a positive review that results in someone carelessly injuring themselves.   Someone with darker hair might not get a lot out of this. I think of it as less a substitute for mascara than an alternative (and supplement) to it. Wish I&#x27;d tried it many years and tubes of mascara ago.</li>
            <li> Summary of Roux Lash Tint: much better than mascara or paying too much at a salon, works well enough, but if there is a better alternative I will go with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid $60 at a boutique salon to have my lashes tinted, and while I didn&#x27;t much care for the experience (even though I kept my eyes closed, apparently they fluttered as they stayed closed, and some of the dye ran into my eyes and made me tear up excessively, so some of the dye ran down a bit with the tears - cleaned up ok, but the dye stung my eyes a bit), I LOVED how my eyelashes looked.  Like mascara, but natural (ok, maybe the wrong word, but they looked natural!) even the little blonde tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently found out that you can buy lash tints online (and while FDA has a warning against home lash tinting with certain ingredients, neither Roux nor 1000 Hours have those ingredients, from my research), so I&#x27;m doing an experiment, side by side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I have found - I think Roux is the exact kind of lash tint the salon used.  It cost me about $5 (including shipping) on eBay for a single application (I recommend trying it that way).  Nice little mark-up for the salon, even accounting for labor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The draw-backs of the Roux lash tint experiment:&lt;br /&gt;1)  All the ingredients come in blister-pack plastic trays with foil over, and the foil does not come off easily.  I had to pierce some of the chemicals with a safety pin to open it, and even then had trouble dipping the wands into the chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;2) The second dye (I guess the first dye preps the hair, the second turns it coal black) turned my fingertips black. The instructions said to use petroleum jelly (Vaseline) anywhere you don&#x27;t want turning black, and I faithfully ringed my eyes below and to the eyebrow, but never thought of putting it on my fingertips!  :)  Now I look like some kind of medieval scholar.  Oh well, it&#x27;ll fade.&lt;br /&gt;3) Because I was doing a self-tint, I had to do one eye at a time.  I found that the first dye stung my eyes (again) but I just kept a folded-up piece of toilet paper below my eyelashes.  The eye I did first is not nearly as black or luscious as the one I did second.  That tells me there&#x27;s a bit of a learning curve.&lt;br /&gt;4) My lower lashes aren&#x27;t really dyed at all.  I went back over them at the end, but they just didn&#x27;t dye.  I think maybe there was petroleum jelly on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... that is my review of Roux.  I will be glad to provide an update about 1000Hour lash tint once it comes in from eBay (btw, that one is about $1 per application, but you have to buy a whole box).  I have heard from other feedback that with 1000Hour you don&#x27;t need to keep your eyes shut the whole time, it doesn&#x27;t sting the same, and the application wand is much easier (like a mascara wand).  But I will have to see for myself.rst dye stung my eyes (again) but I just kept a folded-up piece of toilet paper below my eyelashes.

            <li> I have very blonde hair and consider my eyebrows/lashes \\&quot;transparent\\&quot; so I have been getting them dyed @ my hair salon for years. The product in the salons do not last very long (I use a Clarisonic and this seems to speed up the fading) but this Roux product is VERY different!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, be very careful to only get the product on your hair and try to completely avoid your skin. Vaseline is a good preventive measure. If you do get it on your skin, the only thing that will take it off is the \\&quot;remover\\&quot; that comes with the kit...or time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the results are incredible! The dye (which is really liquid silver - it&#x27;s clear when it is in the bottle) adheres to the hair on contact. So if you are very blonde, you&#x27;ll want to get it off your lashes/eyebrows almost as soon as you apply it. It lasts for ages - I only have to re-do it when the brows grow out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results have been so dramatic that I&#x27;m now rarely wearing makeup. Any blondes out there that have felt like your face \\&quot;disappears\\&quot; without eyebrows &amp; lashes? Here is the solution to your dilemma!</li>
            <li> Ten years ago, I had breast cancer and I lost all the hair on my body due to the chemotherapy. Some of it came back, but I no longer have the thick mane on my head, nor my nice eyelashes and eyebrows. The few eyebrows that did return are so white that they don&#x27;t show up at all. I tried the medium brown Roux color and it worked surprisingly well. Like any hair coloring, it fades with time, but it&#x27;s very easy to re-apply as needed. With a steady hand and a large magnifying mirror, I didn&#x27;t find it necessary to use vaseline as a resist after the first use. Although the bottles are small, each application uses only a tiny amount, so my order should last a long time.</li>
            <li> The multiple steps necessary would be worth it only if it worked better. I have very sparse brows and it did make them a little darker, but I still needed to fill them in every day. The dye only seemed to last about a week, tops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for something to darken and fill out your brows I recommend Gimme some Brow by Benefit. You have to use it daily, but it works well and looks more natural than pencils or powder.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this product, love it! Never had my lashes tinted professionally and see no need to with this product. I&#x27;ve gotten so I can tint them in the time it takes me to apply mascara and it lasts for weeks. Love not having the mess, especially in the hot muggy summer months.</li>
            <li> This product is very easy to use and, frankly, I&#x27;m disappointed that I did not discover it sooner.  I&#x27;m definitely going to be saving lots on brow filler pencil in the future by using this product instead ! You can easily do both your brows in 10 minutes or less and the \\&quot;stain remover\\&quot; works wonders at removing stains from the skin so no major coloring \\&quot;accidents\\&quot; occur.  Overall, I think this product is very easy to use and a worthwhile expenditure. However, I&#x27;m giving it 4 instead of 5 stars for two reasons   1) Why the sticks? Whose going to spend 15 minutes trying to wind cotton around tiny sticks to make what you can buy for a couple dollars ( i.e. q-tips) ? This product would be better served by simply including q-tips instead since they are practically a necessity in applying it.  In my opinion, the sticks are simply a waste and this company would be better off ceasing to include them or providing q-tips, brushes or some other type of functional applicator in the package.   2) This coloring does not last as long as I had hoped. While I&#x27;m still pleased with the overall efficacy of this product, I do wish that the coloring lasted a bit longer than it does. I recognize that because I swim in a chlorinated pool 5-6 days a week I probably experience faster color-fading than other customers. However, it would still be nice if I didn&#x27;t have to re-color every week to maintain a dark brown.</li>
            <li> I have been penciling in my eyebrows for years. My eyebrows have always been two-toned with brown and blonde hairs, and the blonde hairs always threw my eyebrow shape off.  I finally did some research about brow dye and it was my first time doing it since receiving this product, it def takes some practice, but now I no longer use a pencil everyday. You really have to try n get the dye on your brow hair and not your skin, but if you get it on your skin, it goes away after about 3 days or so. In the end I am very pleased to have this product.</li>
            <li> i love this product.  i dye my eyelashes and don&#x27;t have to wear make up on my eyes!  i just wear some basic eyeshadow and my co-workers think i&#x27;ve done &amp;#34;smokey eyes&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I finally bought a new brow kit after years of using the same one.  Finding the exact brand and kit, I replaced it.  I guess I should have looked at the expiration date on my old package (years past), because my new one works amazingly!!  I will continue to purchase this kit for as long as they make it!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 6 years now.  I have found that with a large magnifying mirror and a lot of q-tips I can easily apply to both my brows and lashes. It lasts about 3 weeks on me (I am a med blond) and by the end of that time it is pretty light. I buy the bottles (both brown for brow and black for lashes). I was excited when they introduced the blister pack packaging. I felt I would have less waste. WHAT A HORROR.  It is extremely messy and wasteful. They give you a huge amount of product that is basically wasted or spilled. It also messes up your trash can by leaking everywhere. Don&#x27;t like the blister packs. If you get this stuff on anything write it off. Your bathroom counters etc. The foil is too thick to easily remove and if the two chemicals mix basically the kit is destroyed. Waste is also an issue with the bottles. Despite attempting to be very very careful to not cross contaminate the chemicals between number 1 and number 2 (using q-tip only once and throwing it away, making sure the cap on 1 stays on 1 and is never put on 2) I find that in about 6 months or less (with 75% of the bottle still unused) usually I start to see contamination. By this I mean when I put a clean q-tip it comes out with \\&quot;tint\\&quot; on it. It should be completely clear at all times before you apply it. To me that tint indicates something has gone \\&quot;off\\&quot;. Because I want to maintain my eye health I usually discard the bottles at that time and replace.      The chemical will burn if it gets in your eye and I would have to agree that the remover is very pungent and unpleasant (even though I only use far away from the eye itself). Usually the fumes drift into your eyes and burn. I try to avoid using that and just live with the smudges for about a day after which they naturally wear off.     I do like the product better than paying the salon and even having to throw it out twice a year still makes it cheaper than going to the salon.  I would like more alternatives and also IWISH they still sold the blue color. I like blue black on my lashes but they only seem to have brown and black now.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years off and on. I can&#x27;t dye my own eyelashes but I can dye my eyebrows and that is why I buy this product. This is the only product like this that has a stain remover which is essential. I have tried a couple of other products and they are not half as good and do not provide a stain remover so any stain that is left on your skin wears off naturally. However if you find yourself in that position go buy some baby wipes because they will help with removing the stain. With this product you can really dye your entire eyebrows which is what I want and it lasts about a month. I don&#x27;t dilute it for a lighter shade of brown because I like the dark brown color that it provides. I am just so happy that I can buy it on line.</li>
            <li> my brows turned out great with this kit.  the first time i used it straight and my brows were a little too dark, the second time i diluted it and they&#x27;re a nice medium brown.  however, for me at least, the dye did not come off with soap and water so i fervently used the stain remover until the dye came off my skin and the shade was right.  also i immediately removed the dye after i&#x27;ve applied it and the color is still quite saturated (especially without dilution).  wish it were a little easier to use :)</li>
            <li> I will save this product and give to my salon staff to use on me as it is too difficult to use myself. It works but is too finicky.</li>
            <li> I like this product when I can use it.  I ordered this product two different times, and both times I was sent the wrong color.  The bar code that was placed on the box does not match the product.  The bar code says it is &amp;#34;brown&amp;#34; when the box and product are actually black.  I would like to order this product again, but I will wait a bit before I do so that you can rectify this issue.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and the price was right!  This product works really well, love the color and the way it makes my brown look thicker than they are, plus you can use it often.  Second time I have bought this product.</li>
            <li> I learned through the customer reviews how to use this product.  First, it&#x27;s very good.  It doesn&#x27;t last long - I have to apply it every few days to keep my lashes black (as opposed to blonde).  It loses a star for that.  I apply it with cotton swabs.  Dip, let set in the liquid for a minute, tap the Q-tip on the sides of the bottle to release the excess, and apply it like a mascara brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t use the silly accessories; they&#x27;re useless and cause staining.  Apply however you&#x27;re comfortable.</li>
            <li> This is first Amazon review in probably a year.  I don&#x27;t like to post.  But boy, I had too on this one.......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dirty blonde/brown hair and pretty much blond lashes and eye brows.  I wanted to use this to avoid wearing mascara. I do everything myself (home hair dyes, dyed eye brows, gels nails, etc etc.) So... I felt pretty comfortable attempting this myself.  The first time I used this, I followed the directions, and got a little color on my lashes and eyebrows, but not much.  Like other reviews had mentioned, I figured I would do another application to make it darker.  On the second application, about an hour later, I got nothing.  The brush I was applying it with hardly even turned color after step two.  Not to be defeated, the next day, I went for application number 3.  Big mistake!  The color tuned dark instantly!!  I think I left it on for 30 seconds before I freaked out as it was turning too dark (black, not brown!)  My lashes looked great, but my poor, poor brows.....  This product dyed all of the skin behind my eyebrows a dark brown color.  Applying the stain remover changed it to a lovely shade of brown/orange.  I had to hide in the bathroom and scrub and scrub and scrub while trying not to be &amp;#34;caught&amp;#34; by my boyfriend.  After scrubbing for about an hour, with a combination of elbow grease, water, and the stain remover... my eyebrows are save-able only covering them with a heavy coat of foundation.  I will never, NEVER, put this on my brows again.  I will stick to hair dye, or try the &amp;#34;just for men.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT PUT THIS ON YOUR BROWS!!  (Unless you want them to look funky brown and painted on, until the dye wears off!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am somewhat happy with my lashes.  They are darker, but probably not noticeable by anyone but me.  I might try it on the lashes again, once I get my courage back up.  This product get one star for ever suggesting this product should be used on eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I am a redhead and my eyelashes are white. This dye is very easy to use and gave me a beautiful brown lash line. I love it! Now I can go to the beach without having to worry about mascara running into my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m older, in my 50&#x27;s, and dislike using mascara except to go out. I read other reviews, thank you so much they were helpful with the tips, decided to try this product and was thoroughly impressed with it. My lashes, like others, took a couple of applications to darken and are a perfect color and the remover worked great to clean up my wee booboo&#x27;s. I also used Q Tips to apply and clean up with excellent results. I&#x27;m finding I need to retint my lashes as often as I tint my hair...for a lark I tried it on a little white root area next to my ears (the rest of my hair was doing well for tint) and low and behold it darkened my little white spots so now I don&#x27;t need to redye for a while longer! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for anything more than a tiny white root but I will definitely keep this product on my reorder list for when I run out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A huge thank-you to the tipsters who made the process easier and very very effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man with blond lashes. I wanted darker lashes, I look better that way. This product works, and my lashes seem fuller now without looking like a woman&#x27;s. I get compliments on my eyes now. I&#x27;ve been using the product for a few years, seems my lashes have improved.</li>
            <li> I use this for my lashes and eyebrows.  It saves me a lot of $$$ now that I can do it myself.  It is pretty easy to use.  Be careful if you use it on your eyes. I use a Q-tip as a brush when I do my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> My brows started going white about a dozen or so years ago.  I used to get them dyed at my salon for about $10 a pop when I got my hair cut and colored (I&#x27;m male and vain).  The stylist used a dye product that was supposed to penetrate the hair but white was more difficult than gray to take the dye, apparently, so it got harder and harder to hide them over time.  I don&#x27;t know why she didn&#x27;t use this product that has been around forever it seems.  I began to use men&#x27;s hair color at home about three years ago and would very carefully daub my brows with that product (against manufacturers&#x27; CYA instructions) but the results never lasted long.  A few months ago, I tried a women&#x27;s hair coloring product and did the same thing with the brows, but again, poor results there.  My only other option was to stroke on brown mascara on the brows daily, which worked okay but was messy, wore off quickly, and was tedious.  Then I started researching this product and read what seemed about a hundred reviews.  As with most things, there was a wide field of user ratings, experience stories, tips on use, complaints and praises.  After all that, I ordered it in brown and worked up the courage this week to try it.  Here is MY story:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contrary to some others&#x27; advise, use the little sticks with minimal cotton wrap.  It&#x27;s so easy to do and you will waste less solution this way in case you thought about using cotton swabs.  Don&#x27;t try to wrap too much cotton on the stick, it is much easier to work with the less you use.  Wash the brows as directed and dry thoroughly.  Carefully coat around the brows with a thin coat of petroleum jelly being careful to NOT touch any of the hair.  Prepare your sticks, at least a couple for each of the two solutions, and have swabs ready in case you need the stain cleaner.  Work with solution #1 and carefully brush onto each hair, front and back, working from closer to the skin outward, being as careful as possible to not touch the skin underneath.  Let dry about three to five minutes before proceeding.  The instructions describe how to do the brows and lashes all at once, but I decided to wait to do the lashes by themselves (I have yet to try this but have no trepidation about it).  Make sure you don&#x27;t mix up applicator sticks; throw the #1 tools out after you&#x27;ve used them.  Then simply swab on solution #2 the same way, painting each hair carefully.  You will see the color appear quite quickly, and any mistakes you make by getting it on your skin will show up dramatically, so have the stain remover open and a swab ready and daub those errors IMMEDIATELY.  If you wait the slightest amount of time, it will be more difficult to remove.  Do it right away.  After waiting the amount of time recommended in the instructions, wash the brows again and pat dry.  I hope you will be as amazed as I was, because they came out fantastic.  My first time, in all, took about 15 minutes total.  I could probably get it down to ten now.  It&#x27;s been nearly a week and the color is as dark as when I first applied it.  No more mascara!  Next stop:  lashes!  Good luck!</li>
            <li> I have blond eyebrows but dark hair. I wish I had discovered this years ago. Its so much more natural looking than eye brow pencil.     Its a simple process of applying solution #1 for 3 minutes, solution #2 for 1 minute, then rinse. Instead of using the prescribed petroleum jelly to cover things I dont want dyed, I&#x27;m just careful. I lightly brush the #2 (color) on and rarely smudge, tho if I need to clean up any little mark, the remover works great. Really you can nearly scratch off the color if you catch it immediately.     A good way to get both sides of the brows is to brush them up with an eyebrow brush to get the backside, then you really dont worry about smudges. If you want them darker, go back and repeat the process the instructions say, and you can do it right away.      I&#x27;d say you can get more than the prescribed 30 usages from it. No need to make an appointment and you can do it as often as you like.     Sweet!</li>
            <li> I find this easy to apply with a mascara brush. I bought a bundle of the throw away types and use them to apply the liquid. It stays on well for a couple of weeks. Brown much better than black. I am a blond with naturally dark lashes and find the brown softer than the black.</li>
            <li> I use this product only on my brows, as my lashes are black, so I cannot vouch for its success with eyelashes, but for brows it works very well! It&#x27;s easy to use, covers well, and takes just a few minutes to do. The colors run dark, though, so keep this in mind when you order. I have dark auburn hair, and although the natural color of my brows is black (with some gray mixed in now), the black tint looks too harsh. I ordered brown, and it comes out dark brown, which works fine for me. Because my brows are sparse nowadays, I need to re-tint them every 2-3 weeks, but as the Roux does the job quickly and with minimal fuss, this is not a problem.</li>
            <li> My brows get lighter from the arch outwards. I wanted to deepen the color of those hairs. This product worked great! 1st apply the liquid #1 and wait 3 min. Then apply liquid #2. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is they don&#x27;t tell you how long to leave on liquid #2. After 10 seconds or so, I washed it off. The color took well but I decided to do a 2nd application. If your skin takes the dye don&#x27;t panic. Take a cotton pad and put some of the color remover on it and give a good firm rub to each brow. The color came off my skin and stayed on the hairs. To play it safe, do this when you don&#x27;t have any plans to go out. Just in case you wind up with some on your skin. It will come off in a day or 2. Just like hair dye does.</li>
            <li> Wife uses product for years. Loves it! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I think the stuff is awful. Stains the skin more than the hair. Runs everywhere, leaves uneven darkening marks. I used Roux but was very disappointed.  Returned and tried berrywell and was impressed~ finally perfect color.</li>
            <li> Firstly...I am a UK blonde with translucent/blond lashes.  I wasn&#x27;t looking for wows, I was just looking for a product that would leave me able to go confidently in public in the morning without a full face-on and lots/lots/all of the mascaras.  Generally, if I don&#x27;t do that, people ask me if I&#x27;m tired [blond lashes]. Annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is AMAZE for people like me.  Yes I will still need mascara for events and full-face moments.  It is not a replacement for makeup, but it is a replacement for the &amp;#34;like me&amp;#34; people that wear mascara to the gym so that their trainer won&#x27;t ask the if they are hungover just because they&#x27;re not wearing makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it five stars for my top lashes, but it did not bind to my bottom lashes at all.  I would have loved it to, but it is probably why perms never took to my hair when I was little, and manic panic punks colours washed out instantly in my teens.  I have hearty protein rich welshness in me hair, but I give my strongest recommendation for this roux stuff [especially when combined with a shu uemura eyelash curler.]  For blonds, get the brown to start, it looks super natural, and then diorshow or clinique for a blackest black mascara for events.</li>
            <li> Very good product and was shipped quickly and packaged very well.  However, the product being the size it is, I do feel it could have been packaged in a smaller box for less cost in shipping.  It is worth it when it really gets down to it.  Thank you for the product and I will continue to place orders in the future.</li>
            <li> Dyes my brows fine. Dyes my upper lashes okay. Doesn&#x27;t dye my lower lashes at all. Disappointing, considering the price.</li>
            <li> Ease of use is great. Yes, you do have to be careful. This is dye! It works perfectly on eyelashes that are sun bleached, but not those that are grey which is really what I bought it for.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many, many years and hope to always be able to get it.  It does take a steady hand and patience, but is worth it al.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for about 30 years.  Does very well. Fast and easy. I have  white eyebrows so it&#x27;s a must. Thank   Heaven it&#x27;s here!!</li>
            <li> Totally Satisfied!! Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product to dye my blond eyebrows for about 15 years, maybe more.  There is really no other product out there that is specifically for eyebrows.  A box of the ingredients lasts me about 6 months and I dye my brows every 2 weeks or so.  It is also meant for lashes but I wouldn&#x27;t advise using it for that unless you have a friend apply it for you.</li>
            <li> After trying a professional, I gave up as it only lasted week. She used professional hair coloring.  The Roux Lash product lasts one week too, but is practical to DYI.  It is easy to use, even though it is a two step process. I found that letting both steps dry completely, maybe 5 minutes, worked the best.</li>
            <li> This product sounds so easy to use. I read all the reviews and instructions multiple times. I followed all of the instructions to the letter. When the first application did not leave any color on my brows or lashes I repeated the process as indicated. The 2nd application left a tiny bit of color on my brows but nothing on my lashes. I felt no discomfort or redness at this point. It just wasn&#x27;t working. I tried a 3rd application and when I wiped the color off of my brows there was deep staining. I used the stain remover and rubbed as indicated. Suddenly my brows were burning and it quickly became very painful. I rushed to the sink and splashed lots of cold water on the area. I ended up with a significant chemical burn on one brow and blisters and removed skin on the other. On top of that I still had the dark brown staining. I applied burn cream repeatedly to each brow and they were very painful. The next morning I awoke with my entire face swelled from the nose up. I looked as if I had been crying for days. My eyes were nearly swelled shut. One brow looked like a very bad sunburn. The other was in terrible condition with the blisters and missing skin. For the next few days I treated every few hours with burn cream. I went through peeling browns, peeling eye lids and a 2nd peeling of the brow area. I now have a scar on the badly burned side and while I am sure it will heal eventually, it will take time. I am so glad this happened at a time I was on vacation (but what a way to spend that vacation!) because there is no way I could have gone to work looking like that. I have learned a big lesson. While I FINALLY do have eyebrows and it is WONDERFUL (instead of white hair that no one cold see), it was not worth the pain to achieve them. I live in a small town where no professional does brows so I guess when this fades I am back to 3 packs of eyebrow pencils every month like before.</li>
            <li> If you have thick brows this is perfect. You need to make sure to NOT get step 1 on the skin!! which is really hard if you have thin brows. Otherwise the tint gets on the skin. Needs getting used to before doing on other people. It does work very fast though.</li>
            <li> This product was somewhat difficult to apply and probably took around an hour for my eyelashes. The reason being is I had to repeat the process 4x over to get my lashes black. Also I could not get much color at all to take on my bottom lashes. In the end this only lasted a few weeks. I purchased in store and ended up returning the product. Not worth my time in my opinion, also not worth the chemical fumes being near my eye. My eyes did not water or sting however you definitely know that there are bad chemicals near your eyes.</li>
            <li> Was sent wrong product, black instead of brown. Will not order again. Did read all the warnings on directions, and it sounds dangerous to use.</li>
            <li> Nice!  But don&#x27;t get it near your eyes!  Just for eyebrows.  The fumes get to you eyes before it get to the lashes.</li>
            <li> once you get the hang of this... it&#x27;s a great time and $ saver. I use it on my brows only with good success. If you make a mistake it can be wiped away with the solution they provide. I also find that a wet q-tip will remove excess pretty well too.</li>
            <li> This stuff works GREAT. And if you mess up you can just wipe it off. It lasts long too so thank you so much. I have pale yellow eyebrows and this makes them a light brown.</li>
            <li> My mom loves this dye kit. Great brown color, lasts weeks. Easy to apply, good instructions. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been dying my eyelashes and brows with Roux since age 13 and I am now 64.  I have never had a problem using it and doubt I ever will.  I tried salon tints which use the same Roux products and they were expensive, $100. for brows and eyelashes.  They burnt my eyes and that does not have to happen if you use small pieces of cotton twisted around the toothpicks.  I tried 5 beauty supply houses in Ca. and none had the product.  This was so easy to buy and cost the same as I paid at beauty supply houses.  This is a no brainer!  Once you use it, you will never go back to the brow pencils and mascara.  terrielaca</li>
            <li> I have figured out how to use it with a tiny eyeliner brush for the brows and a q tip for the lashes. Works great on the brows, but I do not great great color on the lashes. It is cheap enough for me to keep using it as my natural lashes are so light. I still use mascara..</li>
            <li> Roux Lash and Brow Tint is easy to use, looks great and the color lasts for 3-4 weeks. Love it - can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Helps those sparse eyebrows.  So easy to use if you apply with a Q-tip. Just be sure to watch your time and remove with soap and water after time is allotted.  Natural look.</li>
            <li> It is the best! So easy to use, if you make a mistake, you have the remover at your finger tips.</li>
            <li> I prefer it for lashes mainly because as a blonde, it&#x27;s desirable to have dark lashes, but that same intensity can look harsh on brows.&lt;br /&gt;One must be careful and adept in application due to the watery nature of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For brows, I prefer the gel formula of men&#x27;s beard dye. Larger range of colors - so easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For lashes, Roux is the go to product. Just wish it didn&#x27;t fade so quickly.</li>
            <li> It works, but still messy to apply - seems like a gel would be easier.  I always seem to get some where I don&#x27;t want it.</li>
            <li> I;ve used this product for years, buut some purveyor&#x27;s color doesn&#x27;t last as long as others.  This is long lasting, and I&#x27;m very satisified with the quality.  It was sent quickly and arrived in very good condition.</li>
            <li> I have been getting my eyelashes dyed for years.  I was happy to find out there are products on the market that I can use to dye my own eyelashes. I have light blond lashes. This product did not work for me at all. Waste of money. Will try another product.</li>
            <li> great product, thanks</li>
            <li> I have vitiligo which is a loss of pigment in some areas of skin and hair.  The lashes on one eye and sections of my brows are white to the point of looking clear.  I tried the Roux Lash and Brow Tint on my eyelashes with high hopes of looking &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; without having to wear mascara.  The mascara never gets all the way down to the base of my lashes anyway.  My daughter helped me with the process, and we repeated it several times, using longer times each session, and some, but very little, color was deposited on my lashes.  Tried a few more times on my own with even longer times and had even less success.  What little color I got didn&#x27;t last very long at all.  Have not tried on my brows.  My experience may not be relevant because of my particular condition, but I&#x27;m posting because others with vitiligo may be looking for something like this.</li>
            <li> I love all of the comments here, read them all before I ordered, and, followed some of the advice.  If you are touchy about your eye area, practice first.  I&#x27;m a contact wearer and not too fussy about touching my eyes, but I did a few dry runs, just to become accustomed to the procedure.  Then instead of the toothpicks, I used a disposable eyelash wand and lightly wrapped it with a tiny bit of cotton to absorb more liquid.  Worked great. One disposable wand per solution.  I did use the paper lid protectors, but only to coat my skin with the thinnest layer of petroleum jelly possible.  I didn&#x27;t close my eyes until both sets of lashes were well coated, then I relaxed for five minutes or so to let it all dry.  I had a very small fan pointed at my face on low, creating a gentle breeze which prevented my eyes from stinging.  I also had my contacts in, so that may have helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two applications were needed - I used the brown shade instead of black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;d buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this product for several years and it&#x27;s reliable.  The color depending on how fast your hair grows and how hard you wash your brows will determine the length of time the dye will remain on your hair.  Hard washing is about every 2 weeks to reapply.</li>
