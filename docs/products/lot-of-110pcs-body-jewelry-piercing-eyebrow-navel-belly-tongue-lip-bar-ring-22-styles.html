            <li>If you get this body jewelry package you will love it.</li>
            <li>So many choices.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re probably perfect if your goal is to sell them individually at one of those jewelry stands.</li>

            <li>good quality product with fast delivery</li>
            <li>the balls break way to easy, flemsy jewlery.</li>
            <li>Not the best quality jewelry, the plastic balls have broken a lot, but for this cheap they&#x27;re good.</li>
            <li>Material feels a little cheap but excellent for the price.</li>
            <li>lip piercings were tight(maybe because my lips are huge, I don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I love this product, it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Thanks bunches for the help because I was in a jewelry crisis! !!</li>

            <li>The packaging was fine, the product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>and I soaked them in rubbing alcohol to clean them</li>
            <li>but when I was taking them out to clean them off I noticed 6-7</li>
            <li>Loved all the ones it came with absolutely cute and they included all the pieces it says not missing any make sure to buy a box to put them all in mine are sitting in my jewelry box and thats a lot of rings to be just sitting there without a bigger box</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for facial piercings.</li>
            <li>how cool they look and people asking where they can get some.</li>
            <li>So many that I wear a different one every day and my coworkers just love how cool they are.</li>
            <li>Some broke quickly, but you get what you pay for and</li>
            <li>But I got exactly 110!</li>
            <li>I wish that they had been equal amounts of all of the jewelry but for the price it was amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing collection of different designs</li>
            <li>the amount that held up was worth the price.</li>
            <li>they were worth every penny I spend...</li>

            <li>Buy worth the buy.  </li>
            <li>It was worth the money, just not for the piercings I have.</li>
            <li>Nice assortment, my only wish is that they came in assorted sizes also.</li>
            <li>Nice variety,  but could have used equal amounts of all plus matching nipple rings.</li>
            <li>but this one is probably worth just passing up.</li>
            <li>in all you get what you pay for, and if you&#x27;re into colorful body jewelry then I would suggest this to you.</li>

            <li> Not only was it early</li>
            <li> but most of the balls/spikes have broken or stripped.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Package arrived several days early, all the pieces present and accounted for.</li>
            <li> They arrived two days earlier than expected which is a god send because all of my body jewelry was gone.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not surprised</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a little larger in size</li>
            <li> careful what you buy.</li>
            <li> A few of the balls had fallen off but just screwed them back on.</li>
            <li> I would definetaly recommend these to other people</li>
            <li> but I only had one broken and only 6 pieces lost in the mail I have tons of options</li>
            <li> Quality seems fine, but the jewelry is really ugly.</li>
            <li> The majority of the plastic pieces either broke immediately or split in half within 3 days.</li>
            <li> Was missing a few balls, not very evenly distributed, LOTS of dice pieces</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t a bad purchase per say, but it had a few kinks.&lt;br /&gt;Starting with the good:&lt;br /&gt;the delivery was fast, as expected.&lt;br /&gt;There were a total of 110 body jewelry pieces.&lt;br /&gt;Wide</li>
            <li> it was in a little plastic bag.</li>
            <li> Its very uncomfortable :/ plus a couple broken things all that being said im okay with what I got</li>
            <li> again waste of money uneven on the eye ones</li>
            <li> not all they say it is don&#x27;t waste your time</li>
            <li> When I took them out of the packaging no pieces were missing and everything seemed to be intact.</li>
            <li> I was so sad because now some of my stuff doesn&#x27;t have matches and the ends of the other piece of jewelry</li>
            <li> There are no matches for any piece.. very small  bout size of a dime.  </li>
            <li> I only go 100 though, which isn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
            <li> packaging was horrible, it came in a little zip lock Baggie, causing them to knock up against each other, meaning a few pieces broke before I even used them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> had broken</li>
            <li> thats weird dudes.</li>
            <li> I received my jewelry and was afraid that it wouldn&#x27;t be a 110.</li>
            <li> so im very disappointed</li>

            <li> Am I the only one that doesnt want dice on my tongue? Its very uncomfortable :/ plus a couple broken things all that being said im okay with what I got just wouldnt do again..</li>
            <li> There are no matches for any piece.. very small  bout size of a dime.  I was hoping for a little larger in size</li>
            <li> At least ten or more of the pieces were broke, but still a good deal.  Nice for Gift giving...</li>
            <li> Some broke quickly, but you get what you pay for and the amount that held up was worth the price.</li>
            <li> Not the best quality jewelry, the plastic balls have broken a lot, but for this cheap they&#x27;re good.</li>
            <li> Some 15 pieces came broken but other than that it was good ! Will be ordering again ! :)</li>
            <li> This was all in all a great product. I wish that they had been equal amounts of all of the jewelry but for the price it was amazing. Also, there are no nose rings but I don&#x27;t think that they were promised in the details. The shipping was super fast and came within a week of placing my order. You guys did a great job, thank you.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas.....she loves this set...Nice variety of body jewelry and good quality. Verry happy with it.</li>
            <li> I received these today, and took all of them out and separated them. Not only were NONE of the pieces missing, they have awesome designs! They are beautiful and my clients LOVE them. If you are looking for a lot of jewelry like this and want good quality AND something that looks good, these are the ones for you. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Not of great quality.. kept breaking into pieces</li>
            <li> I got the right amount I was supposed to get and they came sooner than it said it would so that made me happy :) I would definetaly recommend these to other people</li>
            <li> Probably my favorite bulk of jewelry I&#x27;ve ever bought. Amazing collection of different designs and I got no duplicates of anything!</li>
            <li> I received my jewelry and was afraid that it wouldn&#x27;t be a 110. But when I took them out and counted them there was 110 and I was excited. I love them and there are so many styles. Thanks bunches for the help because I was in a jewelry crisis! !!</li>
            <li> I love this product, it is worth every penny. The jewelry is beautiful and sold the day I received it. I will buy from this seller again!</li>
            <li> i loved these items. Good for the prices. Great quality but some of the tongue rings didnt have balls at the ends all a few items missing but other then that it was great! Would recommend cant beat 16.99 for all of this!!</li>
            <li> the balls break way to easy, flemsy jewlery. do not purchase. it is cheaply made, i will not buy again!!</li>
            <li> absolutely love them. they were worth every penny I spend... thank u very much n I have so many nw... so excited thank u</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. I think I actually receive 5 more then supposed to. The only downside is there seemed to be a lot of the same ones. But for the price I was happy.</li>
            <li> it came really fast I was happy with my order  I well order from them aging  in the future  if u are looking to buy this produce its worth your money</li>
            <li> wow what a joke when received in the mail two of them were broke some of them are not even bent right some the ball strip in no time and then they are junk will definitely never order from this company again waste of money uneven on the eye ones</li>
            <li> So many that I wear a different one every day and my coworkers just love how cool they are.</li>
            <li> I got these yesterday and I soaked them in rubbing alcohol to clean them (I have done this with every piercing and jewelry I have gotten) but when I was taking them out to clean them off I noticed 6-7 had broken I was so sad because now some of my stuff doesn&#x27;t have matches and the ends of the other piece of jewelry so just to let you know don&#x27;t soak them in rubbing alcohol to clean them other than that I like them I&#x27;m getting my done pierced after my 18th birthday (February 17th) so I was excited to get these tongue rings and plus I have my lip done so I used the studs for my lip (obviously lol) and some of the hoops to go in my ears (I have 6 in each ear) so everything is good with everything else just thought I would warn people tho don&#x27;t soak them in rubbing alcohol thanks for reading</li>
            <li> I love all of the different styles and colors of the jewelry!</li>
            <li> Oh my god I love these so much!  They are perfect and EXACTLY what I was looking for. They are 14 dollors for 110!!! Wow! I LOVE them! I have over 200 pericings and these are the best outta all! And I only had a problem with one of the toung rings that are a spiked all I kinda chewed it off haha but that was my fault! But I got exactly 110! None where the same they all was different and they all look fabulous!!!! Just so happy they came in more to add to my collection! Maybe ill order more to see if I get any different ones plus I love having extras of the same just case I lose some or if they do fall out or something you never know. Buy worth the buy.  No need to not give 5 stars if you dont get 110 like oh wow I only got 100 oooo like naw thats weird dudes. Who cares? Life&#x27;s short. Get over it. Just sayin. But worth all the money love them!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the variety of designs and color.  I put them on as soon as they arrived and I&#x27;m happy to add some color and fun beads to my face!</li>
            <li> Just got my order today. I love it a lot 😁 so happy. They look nice. Thank you so much. ☺</li>
            <li> Decent quality and exactly as described.</li>
            <li> theyre cute. but most of the balls/spikes have broken or stripped.&lt;br /&gt;probably wouldnt buy again, i guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Definitely not what i was excepting</li>
            <li> Looks diferent when I got it.... it was not in a box it was in a little plastic bag. And did not have that many jelewery</li>
            <li> I wish their were better ones in there</li>
            <li> The majority of the plastic pieces either broke immediately or split in half within 3 days. Would not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Ehh showed up as something difrent then the picture</li>
            <li> various sizes and colors i love it !!</li>
            <li> These are a really great bargain, as the quality and selection are fantastic. Package arrived several days early, all the pieces present and accounted for.</li>
            <li> Just got my order in today, exactly on time with the delivery date. Jewelry seem to be of good quality. Would have got a five star  but i only received 101 pieces not 110 as described, which is still very well worth it only getting 101 pieces. Everything else is great</li>
            <li> Not only was it early but I only had one broken and only 6 pieces lost in the mail I have tons of options im happy with the colors and verity</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t get any nose or eyebrow rings just lip rings,belly button rings and lip rings..not all they say it is don&#x27;t waste your time</li>
            <li> Came with lots of rings mostly spikes dice and balls.</li>
            <li> Received correct amount of items, but some were broke.</li>
            <li> Loved all the ones it came with absolutely cute and they included all the pieces it says not missing any make sure to buy a box to put them all in mine are sitting in my jewelry box and thats a lot of rings to be just sitting there without a bigger box</li>
            <li> Actually wound up with 112 rings. Five of each size, six of two of them. Sorted them out once I got them, no missing or cracked balls -- Everything was as it should be!&lt;br /&gt;They are plastic, and I use hemostats to tighten my nipple rings. They held up to the pressure, didn&#x27;t crack or split. Great quality!</li>
            <li> All the pieces were there. It came in a baggy, not in a container. All were 16 gauge. Good for individual sale, not for personal use. I wouldn&#x27;t order it again. It&#x27;s good for facial piercings. It doesn&#x27;t have matches. It had a lot more eyebrow and lip rings than anything and I have neither. The jewelry is a good quality. It was worth the money, just not for the piercings I have.</li>
            <li> love them so mush there my new favorit persing rings</li>
            <li> shipping was ok. but, it all came in one bag. not like shown. it took time to seperate all the pieces. and some just fell apart. careful what you buy. pictures are decieving...over all they were nice.</li>
            <li> I dont like the jewelry pretty much all the same looking jewelry I dont want to were dice and gooey soft balls there very child like looks like they should have been earrings instead of body jewelry so im very disappointed</li>
            <li> So I received my package too find u only got 79 pieces . They offered me a 30% off but wouldnot offer too jus send me the rest of the Jews. I am NOT ever ordering from them agaim. They can take their 30% and shove it .</li>
            <li> Material feels a little cheap but excellent for the price. I would buy it again :)</li>
            <li> They arrived two days earlier than expected which is a god send because all of my body jewelry was gone. I had been wearing the same lip ring for almost a month. Gross! When I took them out of the packaging no pieces were missing and everything seemed to be intact. Most of the jewelry I buy online doesn&#x27;t make it through my sanitization and cleaning process but all of them made it through and I get compliments every day how cool they look and people asking where they can get some. If you get this body jewelry package you will love it.</li>
            <li> This was a great buy. So many choices.</li>
            <li> All 110pcs arrived to me undamaged. A few of the balls had fallen off but just screwed them back on. Will be buying these again. Nice assortment, my only wish is that they came in assorted sizes also.</li>
            <li> Has a variety of piercings and color full!!, and I got more than 110 piercings. (;</li>
            <li> Well, I got these almost a month after I ordered them. Other then that they are pretty good. I only go 100 though, which isn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
            <li> Nice variety,  but could have used equal amounts of all plus matching nipple rings.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with how fast they came in the mail. The balls break sometimes but I&#x27;m not surprised cause they are plastic but other than that good product</li>
            <li> I had an issue and they are working with me to get it figured out. I really appreciate it. They are awesome.</li>
            <li> Quality seems fine, but the jewelry is really ugly. 6 piercings, 110 pieces. I got this several months ago and to this date have not found a use for them. They&#x27;re probably perfect if your goal is to sell them individually at one of those jewelry stands. Maybe I&#x27;m just picky but this one is probably worth just passing up. They got 3 stars instead of 1 because I believe buying experience counts. The packaging was fine, the product arrived quickly. No complaints about the store at all and I&#x27;d probably do business again, but this item is not for me.</li>
            <li> Was missing a few balls, not very evenly distributed, LOTS of dice pieces</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t a bad purchase per say, but it had a few kinks.&lt;br /&gt;Starting with the good:&lt;br /&gt;the delivery was fast, as expected.&lt;br /&gt;There were a total of 110 body jewelry pieces.&lt;br /&gt;Wide variety of color and funny shaped balls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now here&#x27;s the bad:&lt;br /&gt;The picture shows all metallic piercings and I got colorful funny shaped balls&lt;br /&gt;The lip piercings were tight(maybe because my lips are huge, I don&#x27;t kno)&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was horrible, it came in a little zip lock Baggie, causing them to knock up against each other, meaning a few pieces broke before I even used them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all you get what you pay for, and if you&#x27;re into colorful body jewelry then I would suggest this to you.</li>
            <li> good quality product with fast delivery</li>
