    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>like all wen products, it is real good hair spray</li>
            <li>This volumizer is wonderful.</li>
            <li>It smell great too!</li>
            <li>Wonderfully holds, but is lightweight.  </li>
            <li>Wen products are the best.</li>
            <li>great product.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for my baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>Not the best, for very coarse hair, don&#x27;t use it with that sort of hair.</li>
            <li>My wife suggested the use of this volumizer to make the most of what I have on top.  </li>
            <li>Great product for controlling fly away hair without weighing it down and drying out my hair.  </li>
            <li>I dry and style and then use this as a hairspray/scrunch spray and it works great all day!!</li>
            <li>I like the lavender fragrance better than the sweet almond.</li>
            <li>I wish I could get it in a larger bottle, but it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>I use a few pumps of the Volumizing Treatment with a dab of the Styling Creme and it works perfectly without drying out your hair.</li>
            <li>The refreshing tingle of the mint is a great little bonus.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know how, but it makes my aging, thinning hair look full again.</li>
            <li>If you need some volume in your hair, or you are used to using a mousse&#x27; or gel for hold, than this is a great addition to the other Wen products.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s is not what I thought it would be, left my hair with nice body.  </li>
            <li>I first purchased this on the WEN website but their auto shipper could never get the shipping/billing correct.  </li>
            <li>This really tames curly, frizzy, hair into luscious locks.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good for at least 6 hours.</li>
            <li>The scent is very minty and lasts a long time so if you&#x27;re not crazy about this minty smell, don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li>The product works very well on my hair which is thick but very fine.</li>
            <li>it gives my fine hair body without weighing it down or drying it out.i wish it was not so exspensive</li>
            <li>I have very straight hair and left it with movement.  </li>
            <li>The thicker hair conceals my less than full head of hair.</li>
            <li>It works better than anything I have ever used for volume on my thin hair</li>

            <li> but not what I had expected.  </li>

            <li> I use this as a hair spray due to a scent/aerosol intolerance in other products.  </li>
            <li> Made my hair very dry!!!</li>
            <li> A little spray and style</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive and I just didn&#x27;t really like how the shampoo didn&#x27;t get sudsy, even though I know that&#x27;s bad for your hair.</li>
            <li> Was not good for my hair did not work the way it was supposed to work  on my hair at all</li>
            <li> but I was always skeptical.</li>

            <li> The scent is very minty and lasts a long time so if you&#x27;re not crazy about this minty smell, don&#x27;t buy this. It&#x27;s also very drying to hair, a little goes a long way.  I guess it&#x27;s volumizing to some extent but not what I had expected.  I wouldn&#x27;t order again.</li>
            <li> like all wen products, it is real good hair spray</li>
            <li> My mom has been using Wen for years and loves it but I was always skeptical. It&#x27;s expensive and I just didn&#x27;t really like how the shampoo didn&#x27;t get sudsy, even though I know that&#x27;s bad for your hair. Eventually, I caved and bought a couple Wen products and I am so glad I did! This volumizer is wonderful. Other volumizers I&#x27;ve used left my hair feeling stiff and crunchy, this spray doesn&#x27;t do that at all. It gives my hair just enough lift that I want. I will continue to keep using all Wen products, and especially this one.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for my baby fine hair. A little spray and style and I&#x27;m good for at least 6 hours. No hairspray necessary.</li>
            <li> I would not use this product again, nor would I advise anyone to! Made my hair very dry!!! I will return this product. I use all when cleanser and I haven&#x27;t used anything else in almost a year!</li>
            <li> Was not good for my hair did not work the way it was supposed to work  on my hair at all</li>
            <li> Great product for controlling fly away hair without weighing it down and drying out my hair.  Will buy nothing else.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I wish I could get it in a larger bottle, but it&#x27;s great.  I use this a volumizing spray and also a hair spray.  It smell great too!</li>
            <li> I use this as a hair spray due to a scent/aerosol intolerance in other products.  Wonderfully holds, but is lightweight.  Leaves no residue or flaking.  Lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> I first purchased this on the WEN website but their auto shipper could never get the shipping/billing correct.  I took a chance and looked for it alone on Amazon and Hooray!! This really tames curly, frizzy, hair into luscious locks.  I dry and style and then use this as a hairspray/scrunch spray and it works great all day!!</li>
            <li> heard about this on TV infomercial and decided to try it.  It works better than anything I have ever used for volume on my thin hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is not what I thought it would be, left my hair with nice body.  I have very straight hair and left it with movement.  Not the best, for very coarse hair, don&#x27;t use it with that sort of hair.</li>
            <li> i like it . it gives my fine hair body without weighing it down or drying it out.i wish it was not so exspensive</li>
            <li> Skinny jeans yes, skinny hair (Thinning hair) no.  While i am not bald, my hair on my crown is thinning out making me look like a monk.  My wife suggested the use of this volumizer to make the most of what I have on top.  Son of a gun it works.The thicker hair conceals my less than full head of hair. The refreshing tingle of the mint is a great little bonus.</li>
            <li> great product. will buy again.</li>
            <li> Wen products are the best.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how, but it makes my aging, thinning hair look full again.</li>
            <li> The product works very well on my hair which is thick but very fine. I like the lavender fragrance better than the sweet almond. Just my personal preference.</li>
            <li> If you need some volume in your hair, or you are used to using a mousse&#x27; or gel for hold, than this is a great addition to the other Wen products.  I use a few pumps of the Volumizing Treatment with a dab of the Styling Creme and it works perfectly without drying out your hair.</li>
