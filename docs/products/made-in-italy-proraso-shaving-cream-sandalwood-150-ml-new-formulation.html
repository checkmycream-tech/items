            <li>I love their sandalwood scent, and this always gives me a great lather.  </li>
            <li>Very very pleased with this.</li>
            <li>Glad I have three tubes of it now all for myself!</li>
            <li>While I have tried and liked eucalyptus creams, the sandalwood is a nice fragrance that is not too overpowering.</li>
            <li>This shave cream is nice.  </li>

            <li>Lathers well and gives a good smooth shave.</li>

            <li>Typical great lather and smells great!</li>
            <li>I love this shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Lather is excellent, only need to use a dime sized portion to load brush up for over 3 passes.</li>
            <li>but when I travel a tube is more convenient.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this stuff, the lather, and the shave I get with it.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face more moisturized after the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A good buy and worth a try.</li>
            <li>Great products shaves come out nice with  soft skin</li>
            <li>This stuff is my favorite.</li>
            <li>This shaving cream is simply the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li>I like it better than the &amp;#34;Taylor of Bond Street&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Note please, I love sandlewood</li>
            <li>It moisturizes my face better than the menthol-eucalyptus.  </li>
            <li>The smell is very discrete and the shaving cream is very kind to your skin.</li>
            <li>A tiny bit lathers up nicely and gives a great, smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Soft skin, easy shave and smells great.</li>
            <li>This leaves a very nice and masculine scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Like original Proraso, this cream creates outstanding lather...</li>
            <li>Hands down, the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>, the lather is really smooth and easy to build up.</li>
            <li>but this a another fine shave cream.</li>
            <li>Once worked into a lather, and after the shave, it does smell more like sandalwood, though a mild fragrance.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is super!  </li>
            <li>There is a huge difference between shaving foam and shaving cream.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing and you don&#x27;t have to use much to get a lot out of it.</li>
            <li>It does not smell like sandalwood, but it still smells pretty good, so I don&#x27;t really mind.</li>
            <li>Significantly improved.  </li>
            <li>This is another variety of a tried and true formula.  </li>
            <li>This seems tailor made for winter shaving when the moisturising effects are more appreciated.  </li>
            <li>like to put an almond size dab in my lather mixing bowl and then add a quick swirl of Col Conk glycerin soap to the mix.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about sandalwood scent.</li>
            <li>It lathers up quickly, gives great protection, and is slick as can be.</li>
            <li>Smells great, a little goes a long way, it makes my razor glide over my face, and it washes cleanly off very quickly.</li>
            <li>In fact it is very much like the scent of the soap in the Van Der Hagen Premium Shave Set.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>I love the sandalwood scent and lathers enough for 4 shaves.</li>
            <li>First ive used out of a tube instead of a puck.  </li>
            <li>Only thing i dont love is the tube, which has ripped twice now while rolling it up.  </li>
            <li>My son&#x27;s favorite and he has tried several!</li>
            <li>He is very picky and loves this!</li>
            <li>it was super smooth even with that much coarse beard growth.  </li>
            <li>I get a much closer shave with this.  </li>
            <li>(I have menthol proraso tub, really like it)</li>
            <li>I really put this cream to the test by using it after not shaving for about 10 days -</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing on the skin and very lubricating for the razor.</li>
            <li>It lathers super quick, and super thick.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE the Proraso Eucalyptus &amp; Menthol ( green tube) while others did not.</li>
            <li>Normally I use organic shave gels</li>
            <li>It makes the skin much more soft and after using it for a while, I noticed that shaving goes quicker with less nicks.</li>
            <li>Lathers GREAT but scent left a little me a little wanting</li>
            <li>I still like the menthol-eucalyptus for summer and maybe just a little bit better overall</li>
            <li>Negates need for aftershave balm on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a long time Proraso user, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve used Sandalwood.</li>
            <li>After reading the rave reviews about this Proraso shaving cream, I purchased it and WOW</li>
            <li>No cooling effect, but that isn&#x27;t necessarily a con as I have proraso green preshave :)</li>
            <li>Not as rich of a scent as other brands , but last forever.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for about a year now and this was my first time using Proraso.</li>
            <li>and I have sandalwood essential oil that I mix with my shave oil, but this stuff is not like the sandalwood I enjoy, nor is it like the green tube Proraso.</li>
            <li>rich, slick and protective.  </li>
            <li>This formulation might even perform a little better than the green.  </li>
            <li>Great product for wet shaving especially when you&#x27;re running late and don&#x27;t have time for a proper lather from a hard soap.</li>

            <li> Not awesome, not bad.  </li>
            <li> Not bad, but a little disappointing to me.  </li>
            <li> My previous shaving cream tube was discontinued</li>
            <li> This is my only complaint with this cream, but a very slight one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, out of the tube it smells a little odd to me...almost like cocoa.  </li>
            <li> Its crazy how some like certain scents and not others.</li>
            <li> If you are a fan of traditional wet shaving, you can&#x27;t go wrong with Proraso.  </li>
            <li> fragrance, sans menthol, is milder than the green.  </li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t  like it, at least you spent less and got a shave brush and bowl!</li>
            <li> Ill buy the sandlewood tub next time.</li>
            <li> So if you are not sure you would like this scent and need a shave brush and bowl, buy the Van Der Hagen.</li>
            <li> I had serious issues with pseudofolliculitis and have switched to a DE razor.  </li>
            <li> When I ordered the kit I threw the soap out because it made me sick to smell it.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> horrible company.</li>
            <li> do I hate the smell!</li>

            <li> I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price. Not as rich of a scent as other brands , but last forever.  horrible company. Ordered my product and had a delivery date of the 11th and I didn&#x27;t get it until the 23rd. I will use a different company.</li>
            <li> This is the forth time that I have ordered this shaving cream. There is a huge difference between shaving foam and shaving cream. I prefer the cream.  It makes the skin much more soft and after using it for a while, I noticed that shaving goes quicker with less nicks.</li>
            <li> I love this shaving cream. Lather is excellent, only need to use a dime sized portion to load brush up for over 3 passes. Scent is excellent. No cooling effect, but that isn&#x27;t necessarily a con as I have proraso green preshave :)</li>
            <li> My previous shaving cream tube was discontinued so I tried Proraso because of a recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a brush and mug at home but when I travel a tube is more convenient. While I have tried and liked eucalyptus creams, the sandalwood is a nice fragrance that is not too overpowering. A tiny bit lathers up nicely and gives a great, smooth shave. I will definitely purchase another when my current tube runs out.</li>
            <li> I love their sandalwood scent, and this always gives me a great lather.  The 150ml size seems to last me quite a while as well.</li>
            <li> Lathers well and gives a good smooth shave. The smell is very discrete and the shaving cream is very kind to your skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaving soap.  I had serious issues with pseudofolliculitis and have switched to a DE razor.  Significantly improved.  This soap is excellent, great lubrication, great scent, all around the best shave.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this stuff, the lather, and the shave I get with it. Gave it as a gift to my dad, but he didn&#x27;t like the smell. Glad I have three tubes of it now all for myself!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and you don&#x27;t have to use much to get a lot out of it.</li>
            <li> Lathers GREAT but scent left a little me a little wanting</li>
            <li> Like original Proraso, this cream creates outstanding lather...rich, slick and protective.  This formulation might even perform a little better than the green.

A good buy and worth a try.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great -- good lather and it lubricates well for shaving. Don&#x27;t see any difference between the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; formulations.</li>
            <li> This shaving cream works great, the lather is really smooth and easy to build up. It does not smell like sandalwood, but it still smells pretty good, so I don&#x27;t really mind.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for about a year now and this was my first time using Proraso. Let me say that i am very happy with this shaving cream.  I get a much closer shave with this.  I seem to avoid accidental nicks when using this as well.  Very very pleased with this.</li>
            <li> Most amazing shaving products ever!!  Negates need for aftershave balm on my sensitive skin. And won&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li> Great products shaves come out nice with  soft skin</li>
            <li> This stuff is my favorite. Use it every morning. I love the sandalwood scent and lathers enough for 4 shaves. This stuff is the best. I have used a lot of them and I always come back to Proraso sandalwood!</li>
            <li> ^&lt;br /&gt;This is a wonderful product. The scent is great and it lathers up nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to put an almond size dab in my lather mixing bowl and then add a quick swirl of Col Conk glycerin soap to the mix. It lathers up quickly, gives great protection, and is slick as can be. Give it a try. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This shave cream is nice.  First ive used out of a tube instead of a puck.  It lathers super quick, and super thick.  The scent is nice too.  Lubrication also tops.  Only thing i dont love is the tube, which has ripped twice now while rolling it up.  As for value, i&#x27;d say &amp;#34;up in the air&amp;#34;. Not awesome, not bad.  Ill buy the sandlewood tub next time. (I have menthol proraso tub, really like it)</li>
            <li> This shaving cream is simply the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.  If you are a fan of traditional wet shaving, you can&#x27;t go wrong with Proraso.  I really put this cream to the test by using it after not shaving for about 10 days - it was super smooth even with that much coarse beard growth.  Bottom line, buy it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time Proraso user, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve used Sandalwood. Typical great lather and smells great!</li>
            <li> Great product for wet shaving especially when you&#x27;re running late and don&#x27;t have time for a proper lather from a hard soap. Very moisturizing on the skin and very lubricating for the razor. I like to get my badger brush out for the Proraso. Excellent shave and great smelling.</li>
            <li> No need for aftershave and smells great.  I like it better than the &amp;#34;Taylor of Bond Street&amp;#34; brand.  Makes a great lather.</li>
            <li> Its crazy how some like certain scents and not others. I absolutely LOVE the Proraso Eucalyptus &amp; Menthol ( green tube) while others did not. After reading the rave reviews about this Proraso shaving cream, I purchased it and WOW do I hate the smell! It almost gags me. Note please, I love sandlewood and I have sandalwood essential oil that I mix with my shave oil, but this stuff is not like the sandalwood I enjoy, nor is it like the green tube Proraso. In fact it is very much like the scent of the soap in the Van Der Hagen Premium Shave Set. When I ordered the kit I threw the soap out because it made me sick to smell it. So if you are not sure you would like this scent and need a shave brush and bowl, buy the Van Der Hagen. If you like the way the soap smells, you will like Proraso Sandalwood, if you don&#x27;t  like it, at least you spent less and got a shave brush and bowl! I think Proraso is a good product, this smell is just not for me. Normally I use organic shave gels but because I like the Proraso (Green) scent so much I compromise.</li>
            <li> This stuff is super!  Hands down, the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  Smells great, a little goes a long way, it makes my razor glide over my face, and it washes cleanly off very quickly.</li>
            <li> The best by far. Used everything before. Shave face and scalp daily for ten years using this. Give it as gifts as well.</li>
            <li> Great shaving cream.  Not crazy about sandalwood scent.</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s favorite and he has tried several! He is very picky and loves this! Soft skin, easy shave and smells great.</li>
            <li> This is another variety of a tried and true formula.  It moisturizes my face better than the menthol-eucalyptus.  This leaves a very nice and masculine scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering.  This seems tailor made for winter shaving when the moisturising effects are more appreciated.  I still like the menthol-eucalyptus for summer and maybe just a little bit better overall but this a another fine shave cream.</li>
