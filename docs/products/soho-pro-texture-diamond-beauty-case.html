            <li>This seemed like the perfect gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, I thought of using it for fabric scraps for fiber projects, like quilting, and it is PERFECT for that.  </li>
            <li>The 4 trays are perfect for separating eye shadows, blushes, liner pencils and lip colors.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for me.</li>
            <li>And if she ever gets tire of the SOHO case, I&#x27;m taking it as it would make an awesome fishing tackle box.</li>

            <li>I am totally happy I bought it</li>
            <li>Some great mineral powders that cracked and went all over.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to see the vanity surface in my bathroom again.</li>
            <li>I needed a mid-sized tool box, and this is a great solution.  </li>
            <li>My daughter was thrilled and it was perfect for sorting her supplies.  </li>
            <li>&quot; x8.25\\&quot; x 12\\&quot;The diamond patterned exterior makes an attractive finish.</li>
            <li>love this case, everyone who coming over for nails commenting on it, saying it looks like CSI miami case :D</li>
            <li>Still, from a distance, it looks good and it may serve the purpose for a while.</li>
            <li>good &amp;iacute;tem</li>
            <li>size is good if you wear a TON of makeup.  </li>
            <li>It is fairly durable and good for travel too.  </li>
            <li>It would be a good buy at about $10-15.</li>
            <li>wanted this for tubes of artists paints and it works beautifully for this purpose, with jars of turpentine fitting neatly into the bottom, below the trays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>great gift for a college student, a stepping stone into her own apartment for her own tool set.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very stylish.  </li>
            <li>Anyone that has makeup that&#x27;s not crazy , this makeup case will be perfect for you.</li>
            <li>The fabric seems nice and gives it a good look</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>I love this case!</li>
            <li>It has very nice trays which pop up in an easy to see and use way.  </li>
            <li>it looks really nice on a shelf</li>
            <li>I own 4 and use them for hair accessories, nail polish, and make-up.</li>
            <li>It does have nice storage inside.</li>
            <li>For that amount of money, it&#x27;s a nice item.</li>
            <li>The four drawers are nice.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make you beautiful, itself, but it serves nicely in the role of supporting cast member.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, we are getting ready to move overseas, and this will serve that purpose perfectly - keeping her collection safe in one place.  </li>
            <li>It appears to be metal but is made of very strong man-made material.</li>
            <li>Fits most of my makeup and keeps it handy for use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I find this to be practical, attractive and useful.</li>
            <li>box is mostly light weight and has good quality clasps.  </li>
            <li>While it may not be the greatest in terms of construction and durability, it definitely does the trick for storage - keeping the bathroom neat and tidy.  </li>
            <li>and it is really cheap for its price too!</li>
            <li>your money--find something better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using my case as a portable storage as I don&#x27;t have any more space on my bathroom counter for all my things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The edge metal on the top isn&#x27;t flush or fastened to the case and has bubbled a bit</li>
            <li>It holds lots of cosmetics and even more (like nail products and some hair stuff)&lt;br</li>
            <li>The SOHO Pro Texture Diamond Beauty Case is really more of a \\&quot;SOSO\\&quot; beauty case.  </li>
            <li>This is really perfect for a teenager&#x27;s massive collection of beauty products, but not if she&#x27;s a world traveller.  </li>
            <li>For even the price of this box, I would expect a much better build quality.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, there are many who would find this product to be \\&quot;just right.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I love this case.</li>
            <li>Way better than any makeup case I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>Help her get a bit more organized, and it would help me reclaim some premium medicine cabinet space.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for all my makeup and tolietries , hair brushes flat iron hairdryer.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;locking lid\\&quot; is a joke at best; a child with a screwdriver could easily defeat the simple locking latches.</li>
            <li>It looks nice, it super functional and has a lock.</li>
            <li>It has so many shelves and compartments that make it easy to store and organize all of my makeup.  </li>
            <li>My roommate was delighted with it, and immediately transferred his large inventory of stage creams and ablutions, with plenty of room to spare.  </li>
            <li>The outside corners of the box are reinforced which is very good since the aluminum is easily</li>
            <li>Upon closer inspection, the faults are easy to spot.  </li>
            <li>but it would be a great case for so many different things.</li>
            <li>The lock on the unit is easily defeated with a nail file.  </li>
            <li>It opens easily.</li>
            <li>Upon first sight, this is a really nice case.</li>
            <li>The case holds almost all of her cosmetics, and I&#x27;ve been able to re-claim 2 full shelves of cabinet space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Got the case into my car just fine.</li>
            <li>It might be suitable for a younger kid/teenager to play with but by no means does this case make a good traveler.</li>
            <li>On first sight, this is a very attractive looking make up case...until you open it up.  </li>
            <li>Faster than a &#x27;vette hits 60mph, this case was filled with \\&quot;girly stuff\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>The fabric on the shelves is cut and glued and on the corner of shelves, it is already frayed and will soon be pulling free easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Time will tell if the box will hold up, but it really does look nice.  </li>
            <li>As it is, the SOHO would be acceptable for some light duty around the house (forget any travel).</li>
            <li>In the bottom I have a lot of stuff and could probably fit a bit more.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>For the price, I thought it was well-constructed and thoughtfully done.</li>
            <li>In addition, the case itself looks fantastic.  </li>
            <li>interior of the case and shelves are nicely wrapped in black Soho London New York printed fabric and very attractive.</li>
            <li>for the positive.  I quite enjoy how the box opens from the top giving easy access to the interior.  </li>
            <li>This was actually worth the money!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive the SOHO Pro Texture Diamond Silver Beauty Case from the Amazon Vine Program.</li>
            <li>At first glance, this SOHO beauty case looks pretty nice and durable.  </li>
            <li>She was able to get all kinds of products in there and loved how it all closed up neatly.  </li>
            <li>They make special cases for that, and this is not designed for that purpose.</li>
            <li>We haven&#x27;t travelled with it yet - seems a bit large for most types of travel.  </li>
            <li>The case is true to size.</li>
            <li>I have a fair amount of makeup, brushes, skin care products that were taking up an entire drawer that was unorganized</li>
            <li>The case is a good size, but my delivery was something else,  the box was left at my door and it was opened.</li>
            <li>I love this case I really do.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I can&#x27;t say that I know what half this stuff is used for, but I DO know that it all went from being jumbled together in a bag to being organized nicely in this box.</li>
            <li>None the less, it&#x27;s a beautiful case.</li>
            <li>It came quickly within two days of ordering it.</li>
            <li>From the outside this is most appealing, all in silver with sturdy metal clasps that lock and a faux-quilted look plastic surface.</li>
            <li>the current list price, I might have expected a slightly more sturdy product arriving in good condition; but this item should be more than adequate for use by any member of the undead.</li>
            <li>Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Whether this case is worth</li>
            <li>/&gt;Whether this case is worth</li>
            <li>No style whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;Costco carried a really nice makeup case earlier in the year.  </li>
            <li>They come with two keys which I think could be useful.  </li>
            <li>For my purpose, this product seems about right, and it will provide me with years &amp; years of use.</li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:mo3P5128TMAO3FN]]This case is very large and will hold a lot of products.  </li>
            <li>She has taken full advantage of it, and absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this as a present and was surprised to find out that- in spite of the rugged, metallic good looks, the construction is flimsy.</li>
            <li>So I give it at least four stars for quilters, maybe more depending on your need to see your pieces in nicely arrayed trays.</li>
            <li>would be such a great present combined with a Sephora, Ulta or MAC gift</li>
            <li>The compartment on the bottom is exactly what you would expect- very large.  </li>
            <li>The whole kit is made with light, cheap materials, and is barely bolted together.  </li>
            <li>I love my wife, I really do, but I&#x27;m not too thrilled having to share a relatively small bathroom with her.</li>
            <li>It is very roomy and spacious and fits all of my makeup, including my two sets of brushes with room let over!</li>
            <li>Partitions are mostly made of cardboard and the outside shell is just one step thicker than aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>The top tier trays are somewhat flimsy to me and they don&#x27;t glide out together when I open it.  </li>
            <li>It looks nice when it&#x27;s closed</li>
            <li>The materials seems substantial except I do not like how the upper shelves rub against the top of the case(see video review).</li>
            <li>When closed it fits nicely under my bathroom sink (even with the pipes</li>
            <li>design of the case is similar to most others on the market and follows a four tray design.</li>
            <li>When I saw this item the first time, it was about 25 bux.</li>
            <li>Just a tip though, dont set your hot iron on it when you&#x27;re doing your hair</li>
            <li>I am a zombie and horror enthusiast, and I attend many zombie marches and horror/comic conventions (and, hold yourself back...</li>
            <li>The facing edges of the box were nicely contoured to fit together when closed, and not sharp when opened, and appear to be aluminum.</li>
            <li>The top opens to expose four roomy drawers; underneath is a large compartment for larger items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The bottom can hold many items standing up, and there are four tiered shelves for flat items &amp; tools.</li>
            <li>Then I opened the case and it was quickly apparent how cheap the case is.</li>
            <li>The shelves are tall enough to accommodate most nail polishes,  and various squeeze tubed items, and what doesn&#x27;t fit easily, could be stored in the larger compartment</li>
            <li>The shelves, when pulled out are actually unsteady and the interior fabric easily pulls off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>opening the box, I was struck by the aesthetic beauty of the case; the outside, which is strong cardboard encased in what appears to be aluminum, has an industrial feel, rather like something you would expect for a lunchbox used by a construction worker.  </li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t think that this item is a rugged as it could be, it appears to be strong enough for the purpose intended.  </li>
            <li>would recommend this case, but just remember it&#x27;s not for a lot of large items like palettes or beauty eyeshadow books.</li>
            <li>Very roomy inside, has a lock and key with it, the hinges that move the trays inside are sturdy and strong.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s all in its nice little compartment.  </li>
            <li>Given the price, it&#x27;s a really nice little hobby/tool box.</li>
            <li>the price, you can do much better.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really like the space in this train case.  </li>
            <li>The real downside is in the hinges, both of the lid and the expanding drawers:  </li>
            <li>, I expected a better build quality.  </li>
            <li>The closure buckles are quiet and feel sturdy, this does not feel like those cheapy cases you can sometimes get around the holidays filled with(cheap)makeup.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I have about 20 shadows, 10 blushes, 20 or so lip colors and lots of liner pencils and pens and that&#x27;s about as much as the trays can handle.</li>
            <li>cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real issue with this product is build quality.  </li>
            <li>I consider this product disposable really.</li>
            <li>I have so much makeup that this makeup case could not handle the overload.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sturdy and well made</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get dirty easily &amp; perfect for travel.</li>
            <li>Though it appears metal, it is actually cardboard or something very similar with some kind of shell.  </li>
            <li>I thought SOHO stood for \\&quot;Small Office/Home Office\\&quot;, but my wife has informed me that it&#x27;s also a fancy place in New York where artistic and trendy people live.</li>
            <li>Not only can she store her cosmetics, jewelry and other feminine items, it is a huge case, I came up with other great ideas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although a tackle box is all plastic, there will be several designs and sizes available for $35 or less, and a good one will last for years.</li>
            <li>Instead of just trying to cram stuff on shelves or in drawers wherever there happens to be some room, she can actually organize her cosmetics and find what she wants relatively quickly.</li>
            <li>With a little but of creativity, there also are numerous \\&quot;dollar store\\&quot; solutions which might be more suitable for younger users.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has 4 tray sections and then the main bottom portion.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I got this for my wife and sh&amp;eacute; liked very much due for the plenty of space it provides, it has several places for You to store all your beauty suplies.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was surprised at just how much I could store in this case.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and attractive at a distance, but on closer review, its construction is not particularly impressive.  </li>
            <li>Normally, they go in a cloth bag and it gets disorganized.  </li>
            <li>It is very large, it looks deep</li>
            <li>/&gt;Inside, the bucket shelves that slide out and open are cardboard covered in cloth, which is fine, but fragile.</li>
            <li>Before shelling out $35 for this Made in China POS, I&#x27;d seriously look into a nice tackle box from the sporting goods department at Walmart.</li>
            <li>The corners are the most well made part- consisting of solid metal corners to prevent scuffing or damage to the most vulnerable part of the outer case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I intend to give it to my 12 yr old niece to do with what she wishes!</li>
            <li>but overall, it seems too much money for this particular case.</li>
            <li>This silver beauty case is can actually hold quite a bid, and with the accordian shelving, it folds up into a nice small size that can slide in under the sink.</li>
            <li>the money, not a bad make up case, but I don&#x27;t have high expectations for it lasting a long time.</li>
            <li>The top was bent down and it wouldn&#x27;t close in the middle.  </li>
            <li>My husband pushed the middle from the inside and fixed it so quickly that I was even more disappointed to see how easily it bent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Trays are long and undivided, so if you have long pencils, they will fit.</li>
            <li>I got the Soho Pro Texture Diamond Beauty Case for my roommate, who is a professional actor.  </li>
            <li>Up until now, he had been carrying his stage makeup around in an old tackle box.  </li>
            <li>I was not expecting the quality that one might get in a professional make-up artist&#x27;s case, which invariably would be a hundred-dollar-plus item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>glad I got this and will be gifting a few in the future.</li>
            <li>They are only attached at the bottom by a bracket and at the top by a slide bracket that isn&#x27;t firm enough to keep the shelves steady.</li>
            <li>Finally, there is a very large bottom section for things like bolts, nails, and other large items that I may want to apply to make myself look like a severely damaged zombie/demon...</li>
            <li>From a guy&#x27;s perspective, I believe it could (or should) be made of a little heavier gauge material, and that the internal and external hinges could be more sturdy than they are.</li>
            <li>From a guy&#x27;s perspective, I believe it could (or should) be made of a little heavier gauge material, and that the internal and external hinges could be more sturdy than they are.</li>
            <li>The hinges appear sturdy enough to me to hold the weight of numerous cosmetics, and the box certainly feels like it will survive.  </li>
            <li>bottom tray becomes securely covered by the top tray when closed, but the top tray is wide open above with at least an inch to the lids, allowing a small jostle to dislodge items and scatter them around within the box; a short drop or tip-over would completely scatter the contents and ruin any organization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When you open this from the top, on each side you have two sectioned boxes for small items (four total).  </li>
            <li>I feel like a professional make up artist with such a fancy case.</li>
            <li>I also question long-term durability, especially if the person using this case has to travel frequently with all this stuff (not on an airplane, of course).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Opened, it&#x27;s a little less appealing with four trays covered in a brown vinyl-like fabric.</li>
            <li>When I first saw this, I thought it was a metal diamondplate with heavy duty corners.  </li>
            <li>Cheap materials put together poorly, this case is barely usable and is not designed to last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have someone who is always decorating every available flat surface of your bathroom with beauty paraphernalia, you might want to give this case some serious consideration.</li>
            <li>The hinges and drawers feel cheap and weak.  </li>
            <li>I have a hard time thinking of anything this case would be useful for.  </li>
            <li>haha, the top warped a bit, but that was my bad.</li>

            <li> Some great mineral powders that cracked and went all over.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to see the vanity surface in my bathroom again.</li>
            <li> I needed a mid-sized tool box, and this is a great solution.  </li>
            <li> My daughter was thrilled and it was perfect for sorting her supplies.  </li>
            <li> &quot; x8.25\\&quot; x 12\\&quot;The diamond patterned exterior makes an attractive finish.</li>
            <li> love this case, everyone who coming over for nails commenting on it, saying it looks like CSI miami case :D</li>
            <li> Still, from a distance, it looks good and it may serve the purpose for a while.</li>
            <li> good &amp;iacute;tem</li>
            <li> size is good if you wear a TON of makeup.  </li>
            <li> It is fairly durable and good for travel too.  </li>
            <li> It would be a good buy at about $10-15.</li>
            <li> wanted this for tubes of artists paints and it works beautifully for this purpose, with jars of turpentine fitting neatly into the bottom, below the trays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> great gift for a college student, a stepping stone into her own apartment for her own tool set.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very stylish.  </li>
            <li> Anyone that has makeup that&#x27;s not crazy , this makeup case will be perfect for you.</li>
            <li> The fabric seems nice and gives it a good look</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> I love this case!</li>
            <li> It has very nice trays which pop up in an easy to see and use way.  </li>
            <li> it looks really nice on a shelf</li>
            <li> I own 4 and use them for hair accessories, nail polish, and make-up.</li>
            <li> It does have nice storage inside.</li>
            <li> For that amount of money, it&#x27;s a nice item.</li>
            <li> The four drawers are nice.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make you beautiful, itself, but it serves nicely in the role of supporting cast member.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, we are getting ready to move overseas, and this will serve that purpose perfectly - keeping her collection safe in one place.  </li>
            <li> It appears to be metal but is made of very strong man-made material.</li>
            <li> Fits most of my makeup and keeps it handy for use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I find this to be practical, attractive and useful.</li>
            <li> box is mostly light weight and has good quality clasps.  </li>
            <li> While it may not be the greatest in terms of construction and durability, it definitely does the trick for storage - keeping the bathroom neat and tidy.  </li>
            <li> and it is really cheap for its price too!</li>
            <li> your money--find something better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using my case as a portable storage as I don&#x27;t have any more space on my bathroom counter for all my things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The edge metal on the top isn&#x27;t flush or fastened to the case and has bubbled a bit</li>
            <li> It holds lots of cosmetics and even more (like nail products and some hair stuff)&lt;br</li>
            <li> The SOHO Pro Texture Diamond Beauty Case is really more of a \\&quot;SOSO\\&quot; beauty case.  </li>
            <li> This is really perfect for a teenager&#x27;s massive collection of beauty products, but not if she&#x27;s a world traveller.  </li>
            <li> For even the price of this box, I would expect a much better build quality.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, there are many who would find this product to be \\&quot;just right.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I love this case.</li>
            <li> Way better than any makeup case I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> Help her get a bit more organized, and it would help me reclaim some premium medicine cabinet space.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for all my makeup and tolietries , hair brushes flat iron hairdryer.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;locking lid\\&quot; is a joke at best; a child with a screwdriver could easily defeat the simple locking latches.</li>
            <li> It looks nice, it super functional and has a lock.</li>
            <li> It has so many shelves and compartments that make it easy to store and organize all of my makeup.  </li>
            <li> My roommate was delighted with it, and immediately transferred his large inventory of stage creams and ablutions, with plenty of room to spare.  </li>
            <li> The outside corners of the box are reinforced which is very good since the aluminum is easily</li>
            <li> Upon closer inspection, the faults are easy to spot.  </li>
            <li> but it would be a great case for so many different things.</li>
            <li> The lock on the unit is easily defeated with a nail file.  </li>
            <li> It opens easily.</li>
            <li> Upon first sight, this is a really nice case.</li>
            <li> The case holds almost all of her cosmetics, and I&#x27;ve been able to re-claim 2 full shelves of cabinet space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Got the case into my car just fine.</li>
            <li> It might be suitable for a younger kid/teenager to play with but by no means does this case make a good traveler.</li>
            <li> On first sight, this is a very attractive looking make up case...until you open it up.  </li>
            <li> Faster than a &#x27;vette hits 60mph, this case was filled with \\&quot;girly stuff\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The fabric on the shelves is cut and glued and on the corner of shelves, it is already frayed and will soon be pulling free easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Time will tell if the box will hold up, but it really does look nice.  </li>
            <li> As it is, the SOHO would be acceptable for some light duty around the house (forget any travel).</li>
            <li> In the bottom I have a lot of stuff and could probably fit a bit more.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> For the price, I thought it was well-constructed and thoughtfully done.</li>
            <li> In addition, the case itself looks fantastic.  </li>
            <li> interior of the case and shelves are nicely wrapped in black Soho London New York printed fabric and very attractive.</li>
            <li> for the positive.  I quite enjoy how the box opens from the top giving easy access to the interior.  </li>
            <li> This was actually worth the money!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive the SOHO Pro Texture Diamond Silver Beauty Case from the Amazon Vine Program.</li>
            <li> At first glance, this SOHO beauty case looks pretty nice and durable.  </li>
            <li> She was able to get all kinds of products in there and loved how it all closed up neatly.  </li>
            <li> They make special cases for that, and this is not designed for that purpose.</li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t travelled with it yet - seems a bit large for most types of travel.  </li>
            <li> The case is true to size.</li>
            <li> I have a fair amount of makeup, brushes, skin care products that were taking up an entire drawer that was unorganized</li>
            <li> The case is a good size, but my delivery was something else,  the box was left at my door and it was opened.</li>
            <li> I love this case I really do.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I can&#x27;t say that I know what half this stuff is used for, but I DO know that it all went from being jumbled together in a bag to being organized nicely in this box.</li>
            <li> None the less, it&#x27;s a beautiful case.</li>
            <li> It came quickly within two days of ordering it.</li>
            <li> From the outside this is most appealing, all in silver with sturdy metal clasps that lock and a faux-quilted look plastic surface.</li>
            <li> the current list price, I might have expected a slightly more sturdy product arriving in good condition; but this item should be more than adequate for use by any member of the undead.</li>
            <li> Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Whether this case is worth</li>
            <li> /&gt;Whether this case is worth</li>
            <li> No style whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;Costco carried a really nice makeup case earlier in the year.  </li>
            <li> They come with two keys which I think could be useful.  </li>
            <li> For my purpose, this product seems about right, and it will provide me with years &amp; years of use.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3P5128TMAO3FN]]This case is very large and will hold a lot of products.  </li>
            <li> She has taken full advantage of it, and absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this as a present and was surprised to find out that- in spite of the rugged, metallic good looks, the construction is flimsy.</li>
            <li> So I give it at least four stars for quilters, maybe more depending on your need to see your pieces in nicely arrayed trays.</li>
            <li> would be such a great present combined with a Sephora, Ulta or MAC gift</li>
            <li> The compartment on the bottom is exactly what you would expect- very large.  </li>
            <li> The whole kit is made with light, cheap materials, and is barely bolted together.  </li>
            <li> I love my wife, I really do, but I&#x27;m not too thrilled having to share a relatively small bathroom with her.</li>
            <li> It is very roomy and spacious and fits all of my makeup, including my two sets of brushes with room let over!</li>
            <li> Partitions are mostly made of cardboard and the outside shell is just one step thicker than aluminum foil.</li>
            <li> The top tier trays are somewhat flimsy to me and they don&#x27;t glide out together when I open it.  </li>
            <li> It looks nice when it&#x27;s closed</li>
            <li> The materials seems substantial except I do not like how the upper shelves rub against the top of the case(see video review).</li>
            <li> When closed it fits nicely under my bathroom sink (even with the pipes</li>
            <li> design of the case is similar to most others on the market and follows a four tray design.</li>
            <li> When I saw this item the first time, it was about 25 bux.</li>
            <li> Just a tip though, dont set your hot iron on it when you&#x27;re doing your hair</li>
            <li> I am a zombie and horror enthusiast, and I attend many zombie marches and horror/comic conventions (and, hold yourself back...</li>
            <li> The facing edges of the box were nicely contoured to fit together when closed, and not sharp when opened, and appear to be aluminum.</li>
            <li> The top opens to expose four roomy drawers; underneath is a large compartment for larger items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The bottom can hold many items standing up, and there are four tiered shelves for flat items &amp; tools.</li>
            <li> Then I opened the case and it was quickly apparent how cheap the case is.</li>
            <li> The shelves are tall enough to accommodate most nail polishes,  and various squeeze tubed items, and what doesn&#x27;t fit easily, could be stored in the larger compartment</li>
            <li> The shelves, when pulled out are actually unsteady and the interior fabric easily pulls off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> opening the box, I was struck by the aesthetic beauty of the case; the outside, which is strong cardboard encased in what appears to be aluminum, has an industrial feel, rather like something you would expect for a lunchbox used by a construction worker.  </li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t think that this item is a rugged as it could be, it appears to be strong enough for the purpose intended.  </li>
            <li> would recommend this case, but just remember it&#x27;s not for a lot of large items like palettes or beauty eyeshadow books.</li>
            <li> Very roomy inside, has a lock and key with it, the hinges that move the trays inside are sturdy and strong.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s all in its nice little compartment.  </li>
            <li> Given the price, it&#x27;s a really nice little hobby/tool box.</li>
            <li> the price, you can do much better.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really like the space in this train case.  </li>
            <li> The real downside is in the hinges, both of the lid and the expanding drawers:  </li>
            <li> , I expected a better build quality.  </li>
            <li> The closure buckles are quiet and feel sturdy, this does not feel like those cheapy cases you can sometimes get around the holidays filled with(cheap)makeup.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I have about 20 shadows, 10 blushes, 20 or so lip colors and lots of liner pencils and pens and that&#x27;s about as much as the trays can handle.</li>
            <li> cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real issue with this product is build quality.  </li>
            <li> I consider this product disposable really.</li>
            <li> I have so much makeup that this makeup case could not handle the overload.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sturdy and well made</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get dirty easily &amp; perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> Though it appears metal, it is actually cardboard or something very similar with some kind of shell.  </li>
            <li> I thought SOHO stood for \\&quot;Small Office/Home Office\\&quot;, but my wife has informed me that it&#x27;s also a fancy place in New York where artistic and trendy people live.</li>
            <li> Not only can she store her cosmetics, jewelry and other feminine items, it is a huge case, I came up with other great ideas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although a tackle box is all plastic, there will be several designs and sizes available for $35 or less, and a good one will last for years.</li>
            <li> Instead of just trying to cram stuff on shelves or in drawers wherever there happens to be some room, she can actually organize her cosmetics and find what she wants relatively quickly.</li>
            <li> With a little but of creativity, there also are numerous \\&quot;dollar store\\&quot; solutions which might be more suitable for younger users.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has 4 tray sections and then the main bottom portion.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife and sh&amp;eacute; liked very much due for the plenty of space it provides, it has several places for You to store all your beauty suplies.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was surprised at just how much I could store in this case.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and attractive at a distance, but on closer review, its construction is not particularly impressive.  </li>
            <li> Normally, they go in a cloth bag and it gets disorganized.  </li>
            <li> It is very large, it looks deep</li>
            <li> /&gt;Inside, the bucket shelves that slide out and open are cardboard covered in cloth, which is fine, but fragile.</li>
            <li> Before shelling out $35 for this Made in China POS, I&#x27;d seriously look into a nice tackle box from the sporting goods department at Walmart.</li>
            <li> The corners are the most well made part- consisting of solid metal corners to prevent scuffing or damage to the most vulnerable part of the outer case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I intend to give it to my 12 yr old niece to do with what she wishes!</li>
            <li> but overall, it seems too much money for this particular case.</li>
            <li> This silver beauty case is can actually hold quite a bid, and with the accordian shelving, it folds up into a nice small size that can slide in under the sink.</li>
            <li> the money, not a bad make up case, but I don&#x27;t have high expectations for it lasting a long time.</li>
            <li> The top was bent down and it wouldn&#x27;t close in the middle.  </li>
            <li> My husband pushed the middle from the inside and fixed it so quickly that I was even more disappointed to see how easily it bent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Trays are long and undivided, so if you have long pencils, they will fit.</li>
            <li> I got the Soho Pro Texture Diamond Beauty Case for my roommate, who is a professional actor.  </li>
            <li> Up until now, he had been carrying his stage makeup around in an old tackle box.  </li>
            <li> I was not expecting the quality that one might get in a professional make-up artist&#x27;s case, which invariably would be a hundred-dollar-plus item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> glad I got this and will be gifting a few in the future.</li>
            <li> They are only attached at the bottom by a bracket and at the top by a slide bracket that isn&#x27;t firm enough to keep the shelves steady.</li>
            <li> Finally, there is a very large bottom section for things like bolts, nails, and other large items that I may want to apply to make myself look like a severely damaged zombie/demon...</li>
            <li> From a guy&#x27;s perspective, I believe it could (or should) be made of a little heavier gauge material, and that the internal and external hinges could be more sturdy than they are.</li>
            <li> From a guy&#x27;s perspective, I believe it could (or should) be made of a little heavier gauge material, and that the internal and external hinges could be more sturdy than they are.</li>
            <li> The hinges appear sturdy enough to me to hold the weight of numerous cosmetics, and the box certainly feels like it will survive.  </li>
            <li> bottom tray becomes securely covered by the top tray when closed, but the top tray is wide open above with at least an inch to the lids, allowing a small jostle to dislodge items and scatter them around within the box; a short drop or tip-over would completely scatter the contents and ruin any organization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When you open this from the top, on each side you have two sectioned boxes for small items (four total).  </li>
            <li> I feel like a professional make up artist with such a fancy case.</li>
            <li> I also question long-term durability, especially if the person using this case has to travel frequently with all this stuff (not on an airplane, of course).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Opened, it&#x27;s a little less appealing with four trays covered in a brown vinyl-like fabric.</li>
            <li> When I first saw this, I thought it was a metal diamondplate with heavy duty corners.  </li>
            <li> Cheap materials put together poorly, this case is barely usable and is not designed to last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have someone who is always decorating every available flat surface of your bathroom with beauty paraphernalia, you might want to give this case some serious consideration.</li>
            <li> The hinges and drawers feel cheap and weak.  </li>
            <li> I have a hard time thinking of anything this case would be useful for.  </li>
            <li> haha, the top warped a bit, but that was my bad.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t big enough for pencils or screwdrivers or anything, but for small items they work very well.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s small enough that nobody really notices it.  </li>
            <li> That didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> What worries me about makeup being stored here is this box is very easy to set down on its wrong side.  </li>
            <li> (The clasps lock into place to prevent them from slipping open, and they also lock with a key which is</li>
            <li> /&gt;I can understand why many are unhappy with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying that this case is way bigger than what I expected (11.75\\&quot;L x 9.5\\&quot;H x 8.5\\&quot;W) which means I won&#x27;t be traveling with it</li>
            <li> It looks sleek, well built and, in my opinion, like a crazy little beauty safe!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think you can use it as a safe to store all your mad cash, because you&#x27;ll end up broke faster than the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Storage space is at a premium, so when you reach for the toothpaste in the sleepy haze of a Monday morning, the last thing you need is a bunch of nail polish, eye-liners, blush and varous other cosmetics</li>
            <li> The big &#x27;box&#x27; section in the center is big enough for some small tools, or rolls of tape, etc.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not gonna take a lot of abuse, and I can imagine that children, tweens, teens, college students - and anyone who travels - will have limited use for this.</li>
            <li> he&#x27;s single, ladies).  </li>
            <li> Overall this case looks really sharp!</li>
            <li> There are several small compartments, and the extra space on the bottom is helpful for things like needle nose pliers, scissors, etc.</li>
            <li> I would think a model would use this big box for such a use, not an ordinary person.  </li>
            <li> One time, the trays jammed so tightly that the lid would not open until I manually force-released the jammed tray-lifting mechanism.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is all that I expected.  </li>
            <li> I give it five stars for appearance and minus one for construction.</li>
            <li> The closed beauty case measures 9.5\\</li>
            <li> This one is heavy, rigid chromed plastic, but I would have personally preferred a metal handle.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> For me, this seems to be the right type of case to hold all my nail supplies, which I find difficult to store &amp; organize.</li>
            <li> suspect this case might be usable for a few months of daily use, and less if transported.</li>
            <li> The item is also slightly too big to use on-the-go, and would probably not fit in a medium sized backpack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s far too big for me for makeup, and far too ugly to give away as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> That includes nail stuff, foot stuff, lip stuff, face stuff, hair stuff, and other glittery stuff.</li>
            <li> But as an \\&quot;extra\\&quot; feature, there are a couple of small locks on the latches which allow the case to be kept shut until you want it open.</li>
            <li> Fits all of my palettes as well as brushes foundation and other make up goods.</li>
            <li> case came damaged due to some shipping problems.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The ideas are endless.</li>
            <li> I selected this case to give to my wife to help organize her makeup and other toiletries in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> It is a little smaller and has rounded edges--and is metal and heavy duty.  </li>
            <li> Also the inside is very clearly cardboard covered with a thin material--if anything spills in there it&#x27;s going to ruin it.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need a big tool box, but all the little ones were too small for my needs.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I prefer sturdier handles.</li>
            <li> The trays, about an inch deep do not come with dividers (at least ours did not).</li>
            <li> four trays that move out with the lids use parallel hinges which are meant to keep the trays level when open, but they are so sloppily attached that the trays tip backwards when the lids are open and often fail to close with the lids, causing jamming and requiring two hands to close properly.</li>
            <li> Just before I made it up to her front door, the handle broke and tumbled down the stairs.</li>
            <li> so you can push it up and down.</li>
            <li> The interior lining is also very plain - not soft or plush at all.  </li>
            <li> It must&#x27;ve been a ban ride, case my make u p case was slightly damage</li>
            <li> Even just around the house storing makeup or other small items, I feel that the case would fall apart or the sliders that move the drawers would become damaged and bent.  </li>
            <li> This keeps chapstick-eating little brothers, makeup-curious little sisters, or mooching roomates from getting into said case and coming away looking like Bozo or using up all your \\&quot;stuff\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The shelves wobble a little bit, but I put some tape around the arms that hold the shelves and that stabilized them.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s somewhat heavy.)</li>
            <li> I expect it to be broken in a week or so of regular use.</li>
            <li> Rather than the shell being actual metal, it&#x27;s basically some thin pressboard covered in a tinny covering.  </li>
            <li> The metal boarder on the edge of the box was bent, and the construction of the item does seem quite flimsy and not able to handle heavy use.  </li>
            <li> The square edges make it feel very boxy and ugly.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m not sure about the sturdiness of the interior sliding hinges.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not gonna hold up to excessive use &amp; abuse.</li>
            <li> The metal on the outside seems to be very thin facade over cardboard.</li>
            <li> inside trays are almost 2 inches smaller than the length of the case which leaves room to wiggle since the sliding mechanism is very thin.  </li>
            <li> The build quality on the SOHO Pro was shoddy to begin with.</li>
            <li> Such a disappointment.</li>
            <li> The shelves can be tilted, uneven, and feel so poorly attached to the case, I was expecting them to break just through my cursory inspection.</li>
            <li> and with all my carrying it around nothing has broken.</li>
            <li> a beauty case that&#x27;s approximately 12\\&quot;x10\\&quot;x9\\&quot; in size.</li>
            <li> industrial appearance on the outside is from a plastic applique applied to a base material (which I believe to be cardboard) and this outer facade is already separating on one side of one lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> In fact, the build quality is so poor, its almost embarrassing.  </li>
            <li> All in all, not too bad but not a fabulous product either.</li>
            <li> But my biggest disappointment was how these shelves were attached into the case.</li>
            <li> The $34.99 price point is insulting for this level of quality.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s terribly well made--I fear the clasp and handle will not stand the test of time, and I&#x27;ll come edit this if we have problems.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The case is true to size. It&#x27;s very stylish.  I feel like a professional make up artist with such a fancy case. It came quickly within two days of ordering it.</li>
            <li> It is all that I expected.  Fits most of my makeup and keeps it handy for use. Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I have a fair amount of makeup, brushes, skin care products that were taking up an entire drawer that was unorganized so I decided to buy this and it is GREAT! Stores all of my cosmetics in a organized fashion plus it looks really nice on a shelf I have it sitting on in my bathroom and goes well with my décor.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This was actually worth the money! It is very roomy and spacious and fits all of my makeup, including my two sets of brushes with room let over! I am totally happy I bought it and it is really cheap for its price too! A must buy!</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a present and was surprised to find out that- in spite of the rugged, metallic good looks, the construction is flimsy. Partitions are mostly made of cardboard and the outside shell is just one step thicker than aluminum foil. Still, from a distance, it looks good and it may serve the purpose for a while.</li>
            <li> At first glance, this SOHO beauty case looks pretty nice and durable.  Upon closer inspection, the faults are easy to spot.  The whole kit is made with light, cheap materials, and is barely bolted together.  The sidewalls are only secured in the corners, not on the edges, so the sides are flimsy and bend into the kit.  The hinges and drawers feel cheap and weak.  I have a hard time thinking of anything this case would be useful for.  Even just around the house storing makeup or other small items, I feel that the case would fall apart or the sliders that move the drawers would become damaged and bent.  The $34.99 price point is insulting for this level of quality.  Pass on this case...</li>
            <li> I love this! Durable and spacious. I own 4 and use them for hair accessories, nail polish, and make-up. It has kept me organized with a place to put everything.</li>
            <li> I love this case! I make jewelry and I use it to store all the beads and materials I use while working on a project but it would be a great case for so many different things. It looks nice, it super functional and has a lock. I haven&#x27;t noticed any problems any construction or design flaws with it and it&#x27;s very attractive. Great case!!</li>
            <li> From the outside this is most appealing, all in silver with sturdy metal clasps that lock and a faux-quilted look plastic surface. (The clasps lock into place to prevent them from slipping open, and they also lock with a key which is included.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opened, it&#x27;s a little less appealing with four trays covered in a brown vinyl-like fabric. And I&#x27;m not sure about the sturdiness of the interior sliding hinges. They may last for years, or they may not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Storage is wonderful, though, with plenty of tray space for mascaras, lipsticks, pencils and liners. Trays are long and undivided, so if you have long pencils, they will fit. And the bottom can accommodate jars and bulkier items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted this for tubes of artists paints and it works beautifully for this purpose, with jars of turpentine fitting neatly into the bottom, below the trays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another application for this beauty case would be as a treasure chest for the classroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I find this to be practical, attractive and useful. (Note: it weighs about four pounds. It&#x27;s somewhat heavy.)</li>
            <li> That didn&#x27;t last long. I didn&#x27;t have much in the case, just a few basics to do my sister&#x27;s makeup for an affair she was to attend. Got the case into my car just fine. Just before I made it up to her front door, the handle broke and tumbled down the stairs. What did I lose? Some great mineral powders that cracked and went all over. Well, lesson learned. The build quality on the SOHO Pro was shoddy to begin with. It might be suitable for a younger kid/teenager to play with but by no means does this case make a good traveler.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife and sh&amp;eacute; liked very much due for the plenty of space it provides, it has several places for You to store all your beauty suplies.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for travel it suits all of your needs, i contains a lock for safety travels&lt;br /&gt;Very good &amp;iacute;tem</li>
            <li> The case is a good size, but my delivery was something else,  the box was left at my door and it was opened. It must&#x27;ve been a ban ride, case my make u p case was slightly damage, I just hope it last.</li>
            <li> I bought this to organize all of my nail stuff.  It works great!! now instead of digging through a box, I just open this baby and it&#x27;s all in its nice little compartment.  It seems to be constructed well since it now weighs probably 30 lbs and with all my carrying it around nothing has broken.</li>
            <li> This review is for the \\&quot;SOHO Pro Texture Diamond Silver Beauty Case\\&quot;. I thought SOHO stood for \\&quot;Small Office/Home Office\\&quot;, but my wife has informed me that it&#x27;s also a fancy place in New York where artistic and trendy people live. So there&#x27;s that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, this case \\&quot;is what it is\\&quot;... a beauty case that&#x27;s approximately 12\\&quot;x10\\&quot;x9\\&quot; in size. I&#x27;m a dude, so my first thought was to whether I could use this for fishing lures, small tools, computer parts, etc. But it&#x27;s definitely not built to withstand the abuse a dude would put it through while doing dudely things. They make special cases for that, and this is not designed for that purpose. It is a \\&quot;beauty case\\&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t make you beautiful, itself, but it serves nicely in the role of supporting cast member.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what does a dude do with a beauty case? He lets his daughter use it! And that&#x27;s what I did. Faster than a &#x27;vette hits 60mph, this case was filled with \\&quot;girly stuff\\&quot;. That includes nail stuff, foot stuff, lip stuff, face stuff, hair stuff, and other glittery stuff. Honestly, I can&#x27;t say that I know what half this stuff is used for, but I DO know that it all went from being jumbled together in a bag to being organized nicely in this box. It did seem to me like the beauty case could benefit from some optional dividers to keep some of the smaller things seperate, if desired. I also question long-term durability, especially if the person using this case has to travel frequently with all this stuff (not on an airplane, of course). But as an \\&quot;extra\\&quot; feature, there are a couple of small locks on the latches which allow the case to be kept shut until you want it open. This keeps chapstick-eating little brothers, makeup-curious little sisters, or mooching roomates from getting into said case and coming away looking like Bozo or using up all your \\&quot;stuff\\&quot;. The lock is NOT by any means a heavy-duty Master lock. Don&#x27;t think you can use it as a safe to store all your mad cash, because you&#x27;ll end up broke faster than the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether this case is worth the price depends upon your need for it, and I thought it was a bit pricey for what it is (construction-wise). I also know there are versions out there with integrated mirrors, so that might prove helpful to those who are \\&quot;putting on a face\\&quot; and comparing cases. But OVERALL, it suits its purpose well. I am knocking off a star, though, for build quality. From a guy&#x27;s perspective, I believe it could (or should) be made of a little heavier gauge material, and that the internal and external hinges could be more sturdy than they are. As is, this case would probably NOT withstand a lot of abuse. But hey... for beauty stuff, I think you can buy with confidence.faster than the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether this case is worth the price depends upon your need for it, and I thought it was a bit pricey for what it is (construction-wise).

            <li> On first sight, this is a very attractive looking make up case...until you open it up.  The lining is not well done/low quality and the compartments that open up are flimsy and not sturdy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the money, not a bad make up case, but I don&#x27;t have high expectations for it lasting a long time.</li>
            <li> When I first saw this, I thought it was a metal diamondplate with heavy duty corners.  Not so!  It&#x27;s plastic, and has flimsy cheap-feeling compartments inside.&lt;br /&gt;The size is good if you wear a TON of makeup.  The square edges make it feel very boxy and ugly.  No style whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;Costco carried a really nice makeup case earlier in the year.  It is a little smaller and has rounded edges--and is metal and heavy duty.  I think I have seen similar at WalMart and Target, too.&lt;br /&gt;For the price, you can do much better.&lt;br /&gt;I will use it for something--I am an artist and travel for custom jobs.  I will probably use it for art supplies for the on-the-go-jobs.  But it&#x27;s far too big for me for makeup, and far too ugly to give away as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money--find something better.</li>
            <li> I really like the space in this train case.  It is roomy and holds a lot of my makeup products, however it doesn&#x27;t seem to be well constructed.  The top tier trays are somewhat flimsy to me and they don&#x27;t glide out together when I open it.  It is very large, it looks deep but it isn&#x27;t, but it does hold all my extra cosmetics like eyelashes, eye primer, makeup wipes, eyeshadows, bronzers, cotton pads and liquid foundations.  I&#x27;m using my case as a portable storage as I don&#x27;t have any more space on my bathroom counter for all my things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this case, but just remember it&#x27;s not for a lot of large items like palettes or beauty eyeshadow books.</li>
            <li> The SOHO Pro Texture Diamond Silver Beauty Case is well designed and functional.  It has so many shelves and compartments that make it easy to store and organize all of my makeup.  It is fairly durable and good for travel too.  I was surprised at just how much I could store in this case.  It&#x27;s great to see the vanity surface in my bathroom again.</li>
            <li> Upon first sight, this is a really nice case. It looks sleek, well built and, in my opinion, like a crazy little beauty safe! Then I opened the case and it was quickly apparent how cheap the case is. The edge metal on the top isn&#x27;t flush or fastened to the case and has bubbled a bit so you can push it up and down. The metal on the outside seems to be very thin facade over cardboard. The corners are the most well made part- consisting of solid metal corners to prevent scuffing or damage to the most vulnerable part of the outer case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inside, the bucket shelves that slide out and open are cardboard covered in cloth, which is fine, but fragile. But my biggest disappointment was how these shelves were attached into the case. They are only attached at the bottom by a bracket and at the top by a slide bracket that isn&#x27;t firm enough to keep the shelves steady. The shelves can be tilted, uneven, and feel so poorly attached to the case, I was expecting them to break just through my cursory inspection. The fabric on the shelves is cut and glued and on the corner of shelves, it is already frayed and will soon be pulling free easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clasps seem to have key holes, but no key was included...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t buy this for myself or anyone else, for that matter. I expect it to be broken in a week or so of regular use. I intend to give it to my 12 yr old niece to do with what she wishes! If it breaks, it breaks! (which I fully expect it to do).</li>
            <li> I saw this, and I thought I could use it as a place to keep my &#x27;repair kit&#x27; for my hobby. I need rolls of tape, sewing kit, magnifying lenses, scissors, various types of fasteners, touch-up paint, etc.  Normally, they go in a cloth bag and it gets disorganized.  I didn&#x27;t need a big tool box, but all the little ones were too small for my needs.  I needed a mid-sized tool box, and this is a great solution.  It keeps my stuff organized.  When you open this from the top, on each side you have two sectioned boxes for small items (four total).  These aren&#x27;t big enough for pencils or screwdrivers or anything, but for small items they work very well.  I lined them with cut-up towel ans held it with double stick poster tape.  That keeps stuff from rattling around in it.  The big &#x27;box&#x27; section in the center is big enough for some small tools, or rolls of tape, etc.  It looks nice when it&#x27;s closed and it&#x27;s small enough that nobody really notices it.  The shelves wobble a little bit, but I put some tape around the arms that hold the shelves and that stabilized them.  I put some foam rubber in the box to keep stuff from shifting around when I was carrying it, and that helped a lot.  Given the price, it&#x27;s a really nice little hobby/tool box.</li>
            <li> This organizing trunk is awesome! Very roomy inside, has a lock and key with it, the hinges that move the trays inside are sturdy and strong. Overall this Is a stable and sturdy . A great organizer !</li>
            <li> Fits all of my palettes as well as brushes foundation and other make up goods.</li>
            <li> I got the Soho Pro Texture Diamond Beauty Case for my roommate, who is a professional actor.  Up until now, he had been carrying his stage makeup around in an old tackle box.  This seemed like the perfect gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening the box, I was struck by the aesthetic beauty of the case; the outside, which is strong cardboard encased in what appears to be aluminum, has an industrial feel, rather like something you would expect for a lunchbox used by a construction worker.  The top opens to expose four roomy drawers; underneath is a large compartment for larger items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read the reviews that have categorized the construction as flimsy.  While I don&#x27;t think that this item is a rugged as it could be, it appears to be strong enough for the purpose intended.  The hinges appear sturdy enough to me to hold the weight of numerous cosmetics, and the box certainly feels like it will survive.  My roommate was delighted with it, and immediately transferred his large inventory of stage creams and ablutions, with plenty of room to spare.  Time will tell if the box will hold up, but it really does look nice.  I give it five stars for appearance and minus one for construction.</li>
            <li> Such a disappointment. Cheap materials put together poorly, this case is barely usable and is not designed to last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The four trays that move out with the lids use parallel hinges which are meant to keep the trays level when open, but they are so sloppily attached that the trays tip backwards when the lids are open and often fail to close with the lids, causing jamming and requiring two hands to close properly. One time, the trays jammed so tightly that the lid would not open until I manually force-released the jammed tray-lifting mechanism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trays are constructed of a lightweight material (plastic or cardboard?) covered with cloth which comes apart at the corners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I didn&#x27;t test it, I suspect that any spill or leak of fingernail polish remover would likely ruin the entire box. A walk in the rain is not advised either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They trays are just over an inch deep, but none are sub-divided to separate items and keep them from mixing up with one another within each tray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom tray becomes securely covered by the top tray when closed, but the top tray is wide open above with at least an inch to the lids, allowing a small jostle to dislodge items and scatter them around within the box; a short drop or tip-over would completely scatter the contents and ruin any organization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;locking lid\\&quot; is a joke at best; a child with a screwdriver could easily defeat the simple locking latches. The keys should be discarded upon receipt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The industrial appearance on the outside is from a plastic applique applied to a base material (which I believe to be cardboard) and this outer facade is already separating on one side of one lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: The handle is held with screws, and riveted tray connections are reinforced for the trays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect this case might be usable for a few months of daily use, and less if transported. Before shelling out $35 for this Made in China POS, I&#x27;d seriously look into a nice tackle box from the sporting goods department at Walmart. Although a tackle box is all plastic, there will be several designs and sizes available for $35 or less, and a good one will last for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying that this case is way bigger than what I expected (11.75\\&quot;L x 9.5\\&quot;H x 8.5\\&quot;W) which means I won&#x27;t be traveling with it like I thought.  It holds lots of cosmetics and even more (like nail products and some hair stuff)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box is mostly light weight and has good quality clasps.  They come with two keys which I think could be useful.  The outside corners of the box are reinforced which is very good since the aluminum is easily bendable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My case came damaged due to some shipping problems.  The top was bent down and it wouldn&#x27;t close in the middle.  My husband pushed the middle from the inside and fixed it so quickly that I was even more disappointed to see how easily it bent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The inside trays are almost 2 inches smaller than the length of the case which leaves room to wiggle since the sliding mechanism is very thin.  The fabric seems nice and gives it a good look but overall, it seems too much money for this particular case.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A REAL NICE STURDY CASE.Great for traveling and storing just about anything. not your run of the mill cosmetic case very good quality.</li>
            <li> The SOHO Pro Texture Diamond Beauty Case is really more of a \\&quot;SOSO\\&quot; beauty case.  It&#x27;s lightweight and attractive at a distance, but on closer review, its construction is not particularly impressive.  Rather than the shell being actual metal, it&#x27;s basically some thin pressboard covered in a tinny covering.  The interior lining is also very plain - not soft or plush at all.  The real downside is in the hinges, both of the lid and the expanding drawers:  any of them feel like the next time they flex may be the last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At its price, I expected a better build quality.  As it is, the SOHO would be acceptable for some light duty around the house (forget any travel).</li>
            <li> This case wasn&#x27;t quite as sturdy as I was expecting. The latches do lock with a key, but the lock is so flimsy you could probably hit it to break the lock. It does have nice storage inside. I use it for craft stuff. There are several small compartments, and the extra space on the bottom is helpful for things like needle nose pliers, scissors, etc.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3P5128TMAO3FN]]This case is very large and will hold a lot of products.  I do wish the lower area had a couple of sections so items would stay in place.  The materials seems substantial except I do not like how the upper shelves rub against the top of the case(see video review).</li>
            <li> Not only can she store her cosmetics, jewelry and other feminine items, it is a huge case, I came up with other great ideas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great gift for a college student, a stepping stone into her own apartment for her own tool set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ideas are endless.</li>
            <li> This box  should be shown open.  It has very nice trays which pop up in an easy to see and use way.  What worries me about makeup being stored here is this box is very easy to set down on its wrong side.  It has no lids so if the makeup is not well sealed, this box could turn into a disaster of spilled makeup.  You also would need to use one heck of a lot of makeup to justify the size of this box. I would think a model would use this big box for such a use, not an ordinary person.  So I would only give it three stars for its intended use.  HOWEVER, I thought of using it for fabric scraps for fiber projects, like quilting, and it is PERFECT for that.  It doesn&#x27;t matter if you upend it because there is nothing to spill.  Plus you can see all of the fabric pieces for your project as the trays pop up when you open it.  So I give it at least four stars for quilters, maybe more depending on your need to see your pieces in nicely arrayed trays.</li>
            <li> This is really perfect for a teenager&#x27;s massive collection of beauty products, but not if she&#x27;s a world traveller.  My daughter was thrilled and it was perfect for sorting her supplies.  It was larger than I was expecting, but not, it turns out, larger than she needed.  She was able to get all kinds of products in there and loved how it all closed up neatly.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s terribly well made--I fear the clasp and handle will not stand the test of time, and I&#x27;ll come edit this if we have problems. Also the inside is very clearly cardboard covered with a thin material--if anything spills in there it&#x27;s going to ruin it.  All in all, not too bad but not a fabulous product either.</li>
            <li> Overall this case looks really sharp! The closure buckles are quiet and feel sturdy, this does not feel like those cheapy cases you can sometimes get around the holidays filled with(cheap)makeup.&lt;br /&gt;It has 4 tray sections and then the main bottom portion. The 4 trays are perfect for separating eye shadows, blushes, liner pencils and lip colors. I use the deep part for my powders and foundations. When closed it fits nicely under my bathroom sink (even with the pipes there).&lt;br /&gt;This is probably not the case for someone with TONS of makeup but I have about 20 shadows, 10 blushes, 20 or so lip colors and lots of liner pencils and pens and that&#x27;s about as much as the trays can handle. In the bottom I have a lot of stuff and could probably fit a bit more.&lt;br /&gt;This would be such a great present combined with a Sephora, Ulta or MAC gift card!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I got this and will be gifting a few in the future.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive the SOHO Pro Texture Diamond Silver Beauty Case from the Amazon Vine Program. The closed beauty case measures 9.5\\&quot; x8.25\\&quot; x 12\\&quot;The diamond patterned exterior makes an attractive finish. The corners are reinforced and rounded with riveted metal. The double buckles that hold it shut are made of metal and also lock. The case is equipped with two keys. As the lid opens, he accordion shelves, two on each side, reveal space for make-up brushes, eyeliners, lip sticks. The shelves are tall enough to accommodate most nail polishes,  and various squeeze tubed items, and what doesn&#x27;t fit easily, could be stored in the larger compartment below.&lt;br /&gt;The interior of the case and shelves are nicely wrapped in black Soho London New York printed fabric and very attractive. The facing edges of the box were nicely contoured to fit together when closed, and not sharp when opened, and appear to be aluminum. The box feels well balanced when being carried. My only complaint is that I prefer sturdier handles. This one is heavy, rigid chromed plastic, but I would have personally preferred a metal handle.&lt;br /&gt;The case seems big enough to hold the make-up collection of one individual. It appears to be metal but is made of very strong man-made material. None the less, it&#x27;s a beautiful case. If you have someone who is always decorating every available flat surface of your bathroom with beauty paraphernalia, you might want to give this case some serious consideration.</li>
            <li> This case is a basic disposable solution for our daughter&#x27;s cheer-leading needs though I consider it over-priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design of the case is similar to most others on the market and follows a four tray design. The trays, about an inch deep do not come with dividers (at least ours did not). The lock on the unit is easily defeated with a nail file.  The compartment on the bottom is exactly what you would expect- very large.  The interior is covered with cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real issue with this product is build quality.  Though it appears metal, it is actually cardboard or something very similar with some kind of shell.  I doubt it is water resistant, never mind water proof. For even the price of this box, I would expect a much better build quality.  In fact, the build quality is so poor, its almost embarrassing.  The shelves, when pulled out are actually unsteady and the interior fabric easily pulls off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For our purposes, the case should last a season.  Maybe. I consider this product disposable really. It would be a good buy at about $10-15. Not the current price.</li>
            <li> When I saw this item the first time, it was about 25 bux. For that amount of money, it&#x27;s a nice item. It opens easily. The interior seems to be fabric covered, perhaps with a vinyl or plastic coating. The bottom can hold many items standing up, and there are four tiered shelves for flat items &amp; tools. For the price, I thought it was well-constructed and thoughtfully done. No, it&#x27;s not perfect, but it was better built than I was expecting. I was not expecting the quality that one might get in a professional make-up artist&#x27;s case, which invariably would be a hundred-dollar-plus item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can understand why many are unhappy with this product. It&#x27;s not gonna take a lot of abuse, and I can imagine that children, tweens, teens, college students - and anyone who travels - will have limited use for this. It&#x27;s just not gonna hold up to excessive use &amp; abuse. For those types of users, I&#x27;d suggest looking for simply constructed plastic cases at a lower price point. With a little but of creativity, there also are numerous \\&quot;dollar store\\&quot; solutions which might be more suitable for younger users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there are many who would find this product to be \\&quot;just right.\\&quot; For me, this seems to be the right type of case to hold all my nail supplies, which I find difficult to store &amp; organize. As a result, my nail supplies invariably accumulate all over the place, rather than in one location. This beauty case solves that problem for me. For my purpose, this product seems about right, and it will provide me with years &amp; years of use.</li>
            <li> I love this case I really do. I have so much makeup that this makeup case could not handle the overload. I use it when I want to keep makeup in there that I&#x27;m not taking with me when I travel. I bought a roll makeup case. It&#x27;s perfect for all my makeup and tolietries , hair brushes flat iron hairdryer. It&#x27;s perfect for me. Anyone that has makeup that&#x27;s not crazy , this makeup case will be perfect for you. It&#x27;s very sturdy and well made</li>
            <li> love this case, everyone who coming over for nails commenting on it, saying it looks like CSI miami case :D</li>
            <li> Quality, and overall perfection. Doesn&#x27;t get dirty easily &amp; perfect for travel. Just a tip though, dont set your hot iron on it when you&#x27;re doing your hair haha, the top warped a bit, but that was my bad. I love this case. Way better than any makeup case I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> I love my wife, I really do, but I&#x27;m not too thrilled having to share a relatively small bathroom with her. Storage space is at a premium, so when you reach for the toothpaste in the sleepy haze of a Monday morning, the last thing you need is a bunch of nail polish, eye-liners, blush and varous other cosmetics cascading out of the cabinet and into the sink and floor (yes..this has happened quite often).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw the SOHO case, I thought I would give it a shot. Help her get a bit more organized, and it would help me reclaim some premium medicine cabinet space. This silver beauty case is can actually hold quite a bid, and with the accordian shelving, it folds up into a nice small size that can slide in under the sink. It&#x27;s sturdy, and looks like it&#x27;s made to travel as well. The case holds almost all of her cosmetics, and I&#x27;ve been able to re-claim 2 full shelves of cabinet space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She also loves that her stuff is organized. Instead of just trying to cram stuff on shelves or in drawers wherever there happens to be some room, she can actually organize her cosmetics and find what she wants relatively quickly. And if she ever gets tire of the SOHO case, I&#x27;m taking it as it would make an awesome fishing tackle box.</li>
            <li> Take my review with a grain of salt, because I ordered this product for a very specific purpose.  I am a zombie and horror enthusiast, and I attend many zombie marches and horror/comic conventions (and, hold yourself back...he&#x27;s single, ladies).  Rather than keeping my brushes, flesh, and blood in a tattered plastic grocery bag; I decided to upgrade to something nicer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the drawbacks.  As another reviewer mentioned, the item arrived damaged.  The metal boarder on the edge of the box was bent, and the construction of the item does seem quite flimsy and not able to handle heavy use.  Also, the cardboard drawers within seem as though they may break under the mildest of stress.  As I plan to use this once every one or two months, that will not be a problem; but it may be for people who require something to use on a regular basis.  The item is also slightly too big to use on-the-go, and would probably not fit in a medium sized backpack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the positive.  I quite enjoy how the box opens from the top giving easy access to the interior.  The four drawers are nice.  One for my brushes and touch-up items such as cotton swabs and tongue depressors.  One for foundation, eyeliner, pencils, and such.  One for liquid flesh, latex, and adhesives.  Finally, a drawer for blood, blood capsules, coagulated blood, and so on (hint: the best blood uses maple syrup and chocolate rather than corn syrup).  Finally, there is a very large bottom section for things like bolts, nails, and other large items that I may want to apply to make myself look like a severely damaged zombie/demon...thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the current list price, I might have expected a slightly more sturdy product arriving in good condition; but this item should be more than adequate for use by any member of the undead.</li>
            <li> I selected this case to give to my wife to help organize her makeup and other toiletries in the bathroom.  She has taken full advantage of it, and absolutely loves it.  While it may not be the greatest in terms of construction and durability, it definitely does the trick for storage - keeping the bathroom neat and tidy.  In addition, the case itself looks fantastic.  We haven&#x27;t travelled with it yet - seems a bit large for most types of travel.  However, we are getting ready to move overseas, and this will serve that purpose perfectly - keeping her collection safe in one place.  Recommended!</li>
