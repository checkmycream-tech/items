            <li>Have used the brand for over 10 years and LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>This is good in many situations.</li>
            <li>It is nice to be able to get them in bulk from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With the toothpaste already inside, it&#x27;s easy to grab and go!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love these!</li>
            <li>I do wish I like the toothpaste more</li>
            <li>Still one of my favorite travel short-cuts.</li>
            <li>I have been using these toothbrushes for travel for many years.  </li>
            <li>For awhile, I could find them at most drug stores but they seem to have stopped selling them.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad Amazon has them.</li>
            <li>Love these for travel and overnite trips.</li>
            <li>Love these toothbrushes, so convenient for travel.  </li>
            <li>They are easy to take on any trip.  </li>
            <li>So easy.  </li>
            <li>I was happy to see that such an item existed.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These are also fabulous for house guests who have forgotten their toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>good soft bristles too.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to give them to family as &amp;#34;stocking stuffers&amp;#34;,</li>
            <li>I originally found these in a dollar store years ago but couldn&#x27;t find them again once the one I originally got ran out.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste tastes good, it lasts a long time and the bristles are fine for the purpose.  </li>
            <li>The toothpast was mildly mint flavored and we could keep our breath clean while we hiked all over Ireland.  </li>
            <li>It is convenient, easy to use, easy to pack and the toothpaste is refreshing and keeps my teeth white and clean.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush with paste in handle is quite adequate.  </li>
            <li>I use Fresh and Go toothbrush at home and on the road.</li>
            <li>Fresh &amp; Go brush lasts 10 days with twice-a-day brushing.  </li>
            <li>These are great for camping trips (especially for kids), prepper go-bags, car back-up, just about any place you need to potentially brush your teeth.</li>
            <li>I always thought it would be such a problem solver for me and many others who travel and sometimes forget their toothbrush or run out of toothpaste in a hotel room.  </li>
            <li>These are very convenient.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for travelers.</li>
            <li>No mess.  </li>

            <li> Love these toothbrushes!  They are easy to take on any trip.  No mess.  No extra tube of paste to get squished.  Love, love, love these!</li>
            <li> My daughter went on a school trip . I ordered for her and friends.  They loved them.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush with toothpaste in the handle for myself and a travel partner.  I worked exceptionally well.  The toothpast was mildly mint flavored and we could keep our breath clean while we hiked all over Ireland.  I highly recommend this product for travelers.</li>
            <li> I use Fresh and Go toothbrush at home and on the road. It is convenient, easy to use, easy to pack and the toothpaste is refreshing and keeps my teeth white and clean. This is the only toothbrush I use.</li>
            <li> I love these! I toss one in my purse whenever I am going to be away for a day or longer. I do wish I like the toothpaste more but it does the trick.</li>
            <li> great for travel, briefcase, purse, glove compartment, houseguests, you name it.  Quality control issue with this last batch - paste leaks out of the handle when you turn the knob.  Still one of my favorite travel short-cuts.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a toothbrush that had toothpaste in the handle for a long time.  I always thought it would be such a problem solver for me and many others who travel and sometimes forget their toothbrush or run out of toothpaste in a hotel room.  I was happy to see that such an item existed.  The toothbrush with paste in handle is quite adequate.  It serves the purpose for traveling or to just keep in your handbag or briefcase when you&#x27;re out and about.  I wish the toothbrush was refillable.  That would make it perfect!</li>
            <li> I got something similar in Europe out of a vending machine and thought it was the coolest thing!  I was so excited to give them to family as &amp;#34;stocking stuffers&amp;#34;, the loved them! great for travel, the office or car!</li>
            <li> What is there to say the picture shows it all great experience</li>
            <li> Arrvd on time &amp; well pkd.  This is good in many situations. Camping, traveling, or having on hand for houseguests who arrive without theirs.</li>
            <li> I have been using these toothbrushes for travel for many years.  For awhile, I could find them at most drug stores but they seem to have stopped selling them.  It is nice to be able to get them in bulk from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One Fresh &amp; Go brush lasts 10 days with twice-a-day brushing.  Perfect for vacation.  And even though the tube handle isn&#x27;t refillable, if I&#x27;m on vaca longer than 10 days, I just buy a trial size toothpaste wherever I am and keep using the toothbrush and toss it when I get home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are also fabulous for house guests who have forgotten their toothbrush.  I keep a stash on hand for this purpose, too.  I just give the guest one and then they can just take it with them when they go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package that is delivered is a small box with 6 individually packaged toothbrushes inside.  I only got green and pink, no red or blue.  Don&#x27;t know if that was just random or if the other colors aren&#x27;t available anymore.  But this is not a deal breaker by any means.</li>
            <li> These are great for people with braces who need to brush on the go all the time. I have no idea why they are so hard to get a hold of. You have to order them and even then they are hard to find. I&#x27;m glad Amazon has them.</li>
            <li> This is the best product on the market of its type.  Have used the brand for over 10 years and LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Love these for travel and overnite trips.</li>
            <li> I have used these before and will use them as my regular toothbrush from now on.  So easy.  Don&#x27;t have to buy toothpaste and squeeze tubes anymore.</li>
            <li> I originally found these in a dollar store years ago but couldn&#x27;t find them again once the one I originally got ran out. These are great for camping trips (especially for kids), prepper go-bags, car back-up, just about any place you need to potentially brush your teeth. I keep one with my camping gear and one with my (female) dopp kit which lives in my car. These are very convenient. I recommend buying these.</li>
            <li> Great product - great service.</li>
            <li> Love these toothbrushes, so convenient for travel.  good soft bristles too.  With the toothpaste already inside, it&#x27;s easy to grab and go!</li>
            <li> I have carried these brushes with me for years and people are always asking about them.  They are just so convenient.  The toothpaste tastes good, it lasts a long time and the bristles are fine for the purpose.  I will continue to keep one of these in each bag I have.</li>
