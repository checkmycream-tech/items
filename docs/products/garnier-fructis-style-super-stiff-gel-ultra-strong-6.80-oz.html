            <li>Any more than that</li>

            <li>This one works better than any I tried, and I&#x27;ve been using it for about 5 years now.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wiry, and can break out of most gels.  </li>
            <li>The smell is nice and light, kinda fruity but not overpowering.</li>

            <li>Good product, exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>The greatest product to gel my eyebrows up (and they are long).</li>

            <li>/&gt;Great product, I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone needing a strong hold on there hair.</li>
            <li>I have used several types and this works great.  </li>
            <li>frizz free all day.</li>
            <li>Works like gel is suppose to,finally found it on amazon,after failing to find it in stores,but this gel is like good old school gel &amp; holds up all day inside of out in the elements</li>
            <li>Came quickly</li>
            <li>This gel is incredibly sticky and slick.</li>
            <li>love this one, DON&#x27;T LIKE THE NEW ONE  .  </li>
            <li>Holds up very well and washes out easy.  </li>
            <li>And at the price, worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s prices make it economical to try all the products in this line to see what works for your hair type.</li>
            <li>the fragrance is not too strong, a big plus for me because i can&#x27;t handle strong smells  </li>
            <li>I just brush it through my bangs after a shower and it dries it in just the right position.</li>

            <li>The new one does not hold my hair as well</li>
            <li>Only kind I use; firm set and holds curling iron curls all day</li>
            <li>It does start off a little crunchy in my hair, but over the course of the day the crunch softens (probably because I play with my hair a lot), but my hair still looks fabulous.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to handle, creating a sticky mess, and doesn&#x27;t seem to do a good job maintaining the style.</li>

            <li>A little bit of gel goes a long ways, you don&#x27;t need very much to make your hair stay in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> This gel helps my fine, thin hair hold shape while I style it following shampoo.</li>
            <li> Hard to find, and worth it</li>
            <li> It is very very thick, kind of weird at first</li>
            <li> this gel is the only one that will hold my wimpy limp hair, esp in high humidity  </li>
            <li> I recommend using when hair is wet then let it dry naturally.</li>
            <li> The Fructis Super Stiff gel, just a little of it, keeps my hair looking freshly-combed.</li>
            <li> the tube will last a long time</li>
            <li> this is the only gel that keeps my long curly hair</li>
            <li> The gel I received was very watery and hardly had any form.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for a long time.  </li>
            <li> This gel holds for a long time, and even if it gives out (like I run my hands though my hair)</li>
            <li> A little amount gives a long lasting stiffness to the hair.</li>
            <li> Our local Walmart stopped carrying it, for some odd reason.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very stiff when it dries, then brushing my hair makes it look completely natural and like it just happens to be that shape and style.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no doubt that this was not the gel I ordered even though the bottle said so.</li>
            <li> May not be desirable by some, but didn&#x27;t bother me as I expected this from gel.</li>
            <li> Next day, I can wet my hands and run them through my hair and the stiff stuff is reactivated.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other gels, this one doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.</li>
            <li> Long ago, used to use Dep (green) styling gel (before the Internet).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other gels, creams, tacky, putty, (insert one of the billion products on the market) and none have worked</li>
            <li> The only downfall is that it is really thick and sticky.</li>
            <li> He wears the messy wet look style.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t make a flaky mess.  </li>
            <li> Plus, when you remove your hands from your gelled hair, little string of gel follow</li>
            <li> When it does, it usually creates a mess that looks like dandruff, not fun.</li>
            <li> As my hair dried out from putting the gel in, the hair is hard to the touch and looks wet.</li>
            <li> But i guess i should of expected to be extremely thick.</li>
            <li> but when it dries it leaves a heavy residue.</li>
            <li> I have short hair but weird cowlicks all over my head.</li>
            <li> It is VERY stiff</li>
            <li> If anyone has ever used this gel they would know its extreamly thick and sticky.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick hair, and a lot of it.  </li>
            <li> My curls stay thick and bouncy and defined all day!</li>
            <li> Very hard to handle and apply with any care at all.  </li>
            <li> It is very thick, goopy, and sticky when you squeeze it out of the tube.</li>
            <li> My hair is a bit thin and needs body and this adds some body.  </li>
            <li> Something must be wrong with mine: it comes out almost as thin as water.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say though, it does do the job as described.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, mine&#x27;s going in the trash.</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed.</li>

            <li> My wife was very happy to get this product. I think I need to buy it in a gallon size with a pumper on it.</li>
            <li> Works like gel is suppose to,finally found it on amazon,after failing to find it in stores,but this gel is like good old school gel &amp; holds up all day inside of out in the elements</li>
            <li> The hair gel is great. A little amount gives a long lasting stiffness to the hair. Good product, exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> love this one, DON&#x27;T LIKE THE NEW ONE  .  The new one does not hold my hair as well and I &#x27;m si glad I can order it on line.</li>
            <li> Only kind I use; firm set and holds curling iron curls all day</li>

            <li> I picked up some of this at the store a while ago, and it is really good! I just brush it through my bangs after a shower and it dries it in just the right position. It is VERY stiff though- so DON&#x27;T go touching hair with it in all day, that just makes your hand all sticky and your hair will start to chunk out in crunchy spikes!  Otherwise I love this! Use it everday!  :)</li>
            <li> i had to get alot of this one at work and one for home. good stiff stuff! get some. or alot. keep me looking good.</li>
            <li> I have used several types and this works great.  I like the tube - I fly a lot and this is the best for flying.  My hair does stay in place and hold the way I like.</li>
            <li> As described - thanks.</li>
            <li> Been using it for years best stuff.  Must get the ultra strong stuff not the others. They are 2 liquidy</li>
            <li> It holds good but its to sticky</li>
            <li> I have to use only a pin-head of gel.  Any more than that and it is overkill.  The greatest product to gel my eyebrows up (and they are long).</li>
            <li> this gel is the only one that will hold my wimpy limp hair, esp in high humidity  It is very very thick, kind of weird at first but you will get used to that  the fragrance is not too strong, a big plus for me because i can&#x27;t handle strong smells  the tube will last a long time</li>
            <li> Have used this product for a long time.  My hair is a bit thin and needs body and this adds some body.  Next day, I can wet my hands and run them through my hair and the stiff stuff is reactivated.  I would recommend along with the Body Boost shampoo.</li>
            <li> I ended up throwing it out. Basically was like putting glue in your hair. Plus, when you remove your hands from your gelled hair, little string of gel follow</li>
            <li> I love this hair gel but couldn&#x27;t find it in target or CVS. I was psyched to find it here! This gel is perfect for my curls. It is very thick, goopy, and sticky when you squeeze it out of the tube. You don&#x27;t need a ton of it. The goopy stickiness means it holds my hair in place really well. It does start off a little crunchy in my hair, but over the course of the day the crunch softens (probably because I play with my hair a lot), but my hair still looks fabulous. My curls stay thick and bouncy and defined all day!</li>
            <li> This gel helps my fine, thin hair hold shape while I style it following shampoo.</li>
            <li> This gel has worked wonders for my boys(3) hair.  They all have different hair types all of t hair with several cowlicks each and this product helps hold their hair in place and stay ALL day.</li>
            <li> This product does the job with some flaws. The only downfall is that it is really thick and sticky. It reminds me of the glue sticks that you have on your hands. Needless to say though, it does do the job as described. But i guess i should of expected to be extremely thick. If you  can get passed the stickiness, then its a must buy.</li>
            <li> I put some in my hand, I rub it on both palms, I put in my hair.  It works...5 stars.</li>
            <li> I tried hair gels for years before I found this one.  This one works better than any I tried, and I&#x27;ve been using it for about 5 years now.  I have extremely thick hair, and a lot of it.  It&#x27;s wiry, and can break out of most gels.  When it does, it usually creates a mess that looks like dandruff, not fun. This gel holds for a long time, and even if it gives out (like I run my hands though my hair) it doesn&#x27;t make a flaky mess.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> use it to give my hair substance and thickness - works just the way I want it to - have been using this product for years</li>
            <li> It holds really well, its just the fact that its stringy.</li>
            <li> Great hair goo that doesn&#x27;t flake afterward and holds excellent!</li>
            <li> As mentioned in my review of Garnier&#x27;s [[ASIN:B005GQ6FYS Garnier Sleek and Shine Shampoo, 25.4 Fluid Ounce]], my hair is all I got going for me as I roar through my middle years. Since I have a full head of thick hair, it is sometimes unruly. The Fructis Super Stiff gel, just a little of it, keeps my hair looking freshly-combed. Unlike other gels, this one doesn&#x27;t leave any residue. And at the price, worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Something must be wrong with mine: it comes out almost as thin as water.  Very hard to handle and apply with any care at all.  When you do get it on, it creates tangles later when you go to brush your hair.</li>
            <li> This gel is incredibly sticky and slick. Goes on the hair nicely but when it dries it leaves a heavy residue. I have tried all of the Garnier Fructis hair gels and the Curl Scrunch works the best on my hair and it does not flake. It is the only gel in the line that states no flaking on the label. Amazon&#x27;s prices make it economical to try all the products in this line to see what works for your hair type.</li>
            <li> Stickiest gel I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> This gel is very inexpensive yet the quality is very good.  No problems with flaking ever.  Holds up very well and washes out easy.  It also has a good smell and I have been complimented before about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and have every intention of continuing to do so. It&#x27;s very stiff when it dries, then brushing my hair makes it look completely natural and like it just happens to be that shape and style. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> this is the only gel that keeps my long curly hair frizz free all day. I recommend using when hair is wet then let it dry naturally.</li>
            <li> Long ago, used to use Dep (green) styling gel (before the Internet). Most recently have been using It&#x27;s a 10 (Great stuff and highly recommended), but it&#x27;s pricey. Thought I&#x27;d try the Fructis, since the reviews were very good. Was very disappointed. It&#x27;s hard to handle, creating a sticky mess, and doesn&#x27;t seem to do a good job maintaining the style. Maybe it&#x27;s a quality control issue, because there seem to be a lot of very satisfied customers. Unfortunately, mine&#x27;s going in the trash.</li>
            <li> Smells good. No build up. No flaking. No hardness. I have a relaxed African-American hair and this works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 1 month now. This is great stuff!!! I have short hair but weird cowlicks all over my head. This hair gel solved that problem. My hair stays in place all day. As my hair dried out from putting the gel in, the hair is hard to the touch and looks wet. May not be desirable by some, but didn&#x27;t bother me as I expected this from gel. I&#x27;ve tried other gels, creams, tacky, putty, (insert one of the billion products on the market) and none have worked but this gel held from morning to night. The smell is nice and light, kinda fruity but not overpowering. A little bit of gel goes a long ways, you don&#x27;t need very much to make your hair stay in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone needing a strong hold on there hair.</li>
            <li> The best hair gel I have used!!!</li>

            <li> My husband love&#x27;s this gel. He wears the messy wet look style. Our local Walmart stopped carrying it, for some odd reason. Anyway, I now buy it through Amazon. Thank you Amazon!</li>
