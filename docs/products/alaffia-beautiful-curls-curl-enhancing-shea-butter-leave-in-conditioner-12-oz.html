            <li>I&#x27;m happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>AND I was using good shampoos and conditioners.  </li>
            <li>This wonderful product is all I need and my hair is smooth but curly, has shine and it lasts for days.  </li>
            <li>I hope they stay in business for many years to come!</li>

            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>The shine in my hair is amazing.</li>
            <li>Though to be fair, I do use their gel too so this I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li>You know when you see someone with gorgeous shiny healthy looking hair</li>
            <li>I have been doing hair for 20 years and this is by far the best conditioner for curls!</li>
            <li>Seems like a great product, I just don&#x27;t have the right type of curls for this strength of product  (Arab/European mix).</li>
            <li>Well, all you need is $10 :) I bought this for my curls and the shine is so amazing my perfect ringlet curls are barely on my radar.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Fell in love immediately.  </li>
            <li>My curls don&#x27;t keep the shape during the day with this leave-in, the smell is not my favorite either.</li>
            <li>Will recommend to every one I know with curls : )</li>
            <li>I have very naturally curly hair which, in spite of good haircuts, seems to frizz easily!  </li>
            <li>today I have to say this is hands down the best leave in I have tried yet</li>
            <li>I have a lot of fine hair.</li>
            <li>Curious my husband tried it and his hair looks great.  </li>
            <li>It is pricey for a leave-in but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>I have frizzy hair when first shampooed and a drawer full of products to calm, curl and condition</li>
            <li>Not as good as their other products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try if you have fine kinky curly natural hair.</li>
            <li>However, when I used it like a traditional rinse-out conditioner but didn&#x27;t over-rinse, it was a very nice, softening conditioner that gave enough definition to my wavy curls.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different products from shea moisture to kinky curly knot</li>
            <li>I started using it in her hair two years ago when she was 5, because of the gentle ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I no longer have the desire to ware my hair straight...</li>
            <li>and it really helped me get a defined twist out</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t dry hair, but lightly comb hair out with a pick to lift hair and rid of stiffness.&lt;br</li>
            <li>frizz, we live in humid Houston.  </li>
            <li>This is a very natural product with ingredients you can read/know.</li>
            <li>Leaves curls soft bouncy, and defines curls!</li>
            <li>my hair is not dry anymore, and so much easier to care for.  </li>
            <li>This leaves my hair soft and gives me bouncy, manageable curls.</li>
            <li>I prefer the natural curly look.  </li>
            <li>I have 4a/b/c hair and my hair is incredibly soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>4a natural kinky curly hair</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and I&#x27;m not noticing any build-up yet</li>
            <li>I like this conditioner, but it was too heavy as a leave-in conditioner for my light brown wavy/curly hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve thick wavy to curly hair and this conditioner/shampoo combination has made me love my hair.</li>
            <li>I have wavy to curly hair and have not previously found a leave in that works as well as this.  </li>

            <li> (it continues to feel a bit gross to me until it is dry).  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve recommended to other African Americans as well.</li>
            <li> , we air dry her hair</li>
            <li> completely* dry</li>
            <li> I do put it in while my hair is soaking wet</li>
            <li> Costs much less than other specialty curl hair lines like Quidad.</li>
            <li> This keeps the curl down and and no helmet head.  </li>
            <li> and then I squeeze out the excess water after it is applied as to cut down on the heaviness.  </li>
            <li> My hair is less tangled, shiny, and my curls are well defined.  </li>
            <li> I decided to buy for the wavy to curly hair because I don&#x27;t have tight curls.  </li>
            <li> disappointed that I&#x27;ve paid for prime and free shipping is not available for this item!  </li>
            <li> He used to use a harsh gel that would harden his hair like a helmet.</li>
            <li> BUT, despite feeling heavy upon application, it does NOT feel heavy once *</li>

            <li> My daughter and husband both have thick curly hair.  I bought this to tame my daughters  frizz, we live in humid Houston.  It does wonders!  I started using it in her hair two years ago when she was 5, because of the gentle ingredients.  She leaves it in after she showers, we air dry her hair and she had beautiful blond locks, no frizz!  Curious my husband tried it and his hair looks great.  He used to use a harsh gel that would harden his hair like a helmet. This keeps the curl down and and no helmet head.  I recommend all their products!  We even keep a spray bottle with water and leave in conditioner in it to help for the mornings and also after we swim. I also recommend the curls cream, shampoo and regular conditioner for the days when the curls turn into a nests of knots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve thick wavy to curly hair and this conditioner/shampoo combination has made me love my hair. This leaves my hair soft and gives me bouncy, manageable curls. No crunchy curls here. This is a very natural product with ingredients you can read/know. Costs much less than other specialty curl hair lines like Quidad. For me smells great. Its a small business from Northwest which is a bonus. I hope they stay in business for many years to come!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I have wavy to curly hair and have not previously found a leave in that works as well as this.  My hair is less tangled, shiny, and my curls are well defined.  I use this in conjunction with Curl Keeper and am happy with my hair. It&#x27;s a miracle!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Great scent, great ingredients.</li>
            <li> the product was/is excellent. i wouldn&#x27;t use anything else on my hair. my hair is not dry anymore, and so much easier to care for.  I no longer have the desire to ware my hair straight... I prefer the natural curly look.  This product is awesome and I&#x27;ve recommended to other African Americans as well.</li>
            <li> I love this leave in!  I have 4a/b/c hair and my hair is incredibly soft and moisturized. It is pricey for a leave-in but it is worth it. It leaves my hair hair moisturized for days.</li>
            <li> 4a natural kinky curly hair I have a lot of fine hair. I have tried so many different products from shea moisture to kinky curly knot today I have to say this is hands down the best leave in I have tried yet my hair is so moisturiZed and it really helped me get a defined twist out I love it. Just might become a staple I&#x27;m currently deciding between this one and the Giovanni leave in they are very very similar. It&#x27;s worth a try if you have fine kinky curly natural hair.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy for the wavy to curly hair because I don&#x27;t have tight curls.  I&#x27;m happy with this product.  It leaves my hair soft and I&#x27;m not noticing any build-up yet (I&#x27;ve been using it for a week).  I will say, I do not love the smell (maybe it is the shea butter, I&#x27;m not sure) and my hair feels heavy after I put it in.  I do put it in while my hair is soaking wet and then I squeeze out the excess water after it is applied as to cut down on the heaviness.  BUT, despite feeling heavy upon application, it does NOT feel heavy once *completely* dry (it continues to feel a bit gross to me until it is dry).  Though to be fair, I do use their gel too so this I&#x27;m sure is adding to that heavy feeling!</li>
            <li> I added this and the gel (which isn&#x27;t a traditional gel) to my hair care routine. The shine in my hair is amazing. You know when you see someone with gorgeous shiny healthy looking hair and you say .... Oh what I wouldn&#x27;t give to have hair like that. Well, all you need is $10 :) I bought this for my curls and the shine is so amazing my perfect ringlet curls are barely on my radar. But they look awesome too! Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Tried this product at my daughter&#x27;s home.  Fell in love immediately.  I have very naturally curly hair which, in spite of good haircuts, seems to frizz easily!  Perhaps it&#x27;s the \\&quot;leave-in\\&quot; factor, but I no longer have the frizzies.  No need for additional product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed that I&#x27;ve paid for prime and free shipping is not available for this item!  Altho it says it is on the list before clicking on the actual product.  What gives Amazon?</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work out well for my hair type, but the return was processed promptly. Seems like a great product, I just don&#x27;t have the right type of curls for this strength of product  (Arab/European mix).</li>
            <li> I like this conditioner, but it was too heavy as a leave-in conditioner for my light brown wavy/curly hair. However, when I used it like a traditional rinse-out conditioner but didn&#x27;t over-rinse, it was a very nice, softening conditioner that gave enough definition to my wavy curls.</li>
            <li> This leave in conditioner is perfect for my hair.  I have frizzy hair when first shampooed and a drawer full of products to calm, curl and condition AND I was using good shampoos and conditioners.  This wonderful product is all I need and my hair is smooth but curly, has shine and it lasts for days.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure what the motive of this product was? It just makes the hair feel &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; , doesn&#x27;t curl it.</li>
            <li> The effect wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting. My curls don&#x27;t keep the shape during the day with this leave-in, the smell is not my favorite either.</li>
            <li> I do like this conditioner, however, I like it used with the Shea Butter curl activating Cream. The cream makes the hair stiff if&lt;br /&gt;you don&#x27;t dry hair, but lightly comb hair out with a pick to lift hair and rid of stiffness.&lt;br /&gt;That said, during the freezing weather, this product was delivered, left outside and froze. I placed it in my cupboard and recently went to get it. The ingredients have separated and won&#x27;t remix. I need to contact selker, Amazon, etc to rectify this products condition now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s o.k. Not as good as their other products.</li>
            <li> I have been doing hair for 20 years and this is by far the best conditioner for curls!</li>
            <li> Leaves curls soft bouncy, and defines curls! Will recommend to every one I know with curls : )</li>
