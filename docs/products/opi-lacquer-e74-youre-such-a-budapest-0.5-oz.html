            <li>I loved the color because its like a light color.</li>
            <li>You need 3 coats to achieve the color in the bottle &amp; it seems to have a self leveling crelly formula that&#x27;s nice quality like most OPI&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>The color is light and bright.</li>
            <li>Alone, I would not reccomend,but add glitter on top and it is amazing.</li>

            <li>If younput lighter layers on it looks better and dries faster inbetween layers.</li>

            <li>Love this color and quality</li>
            <li>My favorite color.  </li>

            <li>I love the color however the quality of the nail polish is crappy.</li>
            <li>I love purples and lavenders.</li>
            <li>, i love love love love this color.</li>
            <li>So glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I added OPI glitter polish on top and got a lot of compliments and questions of where I got it from.</li>
            <li>Anyway, if you love light purples or lavender tone colors you will love this one for sure.</li>
            <li>It is very creamy and good quality polish.  </li>
            <li>very pretty color goes on smooth and nice.</li>
            <li>A lovely, rich periwinkle.</li>
            <li>So instead of continuing to drive all over town searching, I found it easily with you guys.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful color that doesn&#x27;t need a second coat.</li>
            <li>While I normally use a topcoat, I haven&#x27;t been with this polish, because I love its finish all on its own.</li>
            <li>I really like this kind of light lavender/blue color for spring.</li>
            <li>This color is rich with simplicity and light/elegant.  </li>
            <li>This color is a nice light pastel purple that would look cute in the spring, especially for Easter ( if you celebrate it).</li>
            <li>Again, awesome color not sure what happened with the quality.</li>
            <li>great summer color and wears long</li>
            <li>so I used it anyway, but it sucked to not have a clean, fully functioning brush.</li>
            <li>The color is very pretty and light.  </li>
            <li>One coat of the real stuff is literally better than 3 coats of this sellers polish.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been happy with all the other OPI purchases, but this one was not as pictured.</li>
            <li>was good product only that is not seem to be new, was not protected , but i love the color ....</li>
            <li>OPI does not chip off so quickly.</li>
            <li>Well i love OPI and this is not a color i would normally get (makes me feel like bruised nails or something), but with Easter coming</li>
            <li>pretty color!  </li>
            <li>Product was fresh.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more lavender than light blue.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also arrived 2 days before the expected date in a very secure package!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very flattering color for cool skin tones.  </li>
            <li>Very fast shipping and well packaged.  </li>
            <li>Before writing this review I went out and bought this same color at a reputable OPI store.</li>
            <li>This color (You&#x27;re Such Budapest) is my favorite color.</li>
            <li>More like a sky blue with a touch of purple.</li>
            <li>Wear it constantly and get many compliments.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely willing to put the 2-3 coats on.  </li>
            <li>It is the first opi polish i have had that i had to paint 3 coats of though.  </li>
            <li>I first came across the color while at the salon</li>
            <li>Pretty pastel color.</li>
            <li>My 3rd favorite from the collection.</li>
            <li>When my nail tech put it on I fell in love with it instantly.</li>
            <li>First and foremost, the product was delivered to me within two days of purchase, awesome.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the shade and had been meaning to try it for some time and finally got around to it.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll need a few coats, as it goes on fairly translucent.</li>
            <li>None the less I love it!</li>
            <li>It also dries pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly certain that this polish is counterfeit.</li>
            <li>It was light but not to light to go unnoticed.  </li>
            <li>This nail polish is much prettier in person.</li>
            <li>FAST delivery from seller.</li>
            <li>Such a fantastic color.</li>
            <li>It is a very girley color</li>
            <li>The result looks very gel-like.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very springy.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be ready for spring wearing this shade.</li>
            <li>I put green dots on top for fun.</li>
            <li>Now this color I love, when on, it looks almost blue, its a purplish blue.  </li>
            <li>Such a pretty color!</li>
            <li>This is such a pretty color!  </li>
            <li>Really like the color very chic and adorable by itself, also I like to pair it with the OPI Euro Centrale Spring Collection and gives it an edgy look.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not thick and requires four coats before it ceases to be transparent.</li>
            <li>I only buy OPI and this periwinkle color adds a breath of fresh air to my day.</li>
            <li>I tried to return it the seller told me it was just the way the new color is and to ask for a refund from Amazon if I have a problem.</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend if you are looking for a pretty color</li>
            <li>BUT it lacks the wow factor.</li>
            <li>It really kicks up the pretty blue, pink and lavender pastels for spring.</li>
            <li>Typical OPI polish and very pretty spring color.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>This new spring color only takes one coat.</li>
            <li>But the shimmer is so light you can hardly notice it.</li>
            <li>I love this color, very subtle.</li>
            <li>Also the teeny tiny little shimmer in it makes it more then just a plain purple.</li>

            <li> The only thing is that it is a bit runny compared to other OPI brand nail lacquer I have used before.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very long wearing.</li>
            <li> Not a lot but a very little, which I was surprised by.</li>
            <li> It also stayed on longer than any other polish including other OPI polishes.</li>
            <li> It was hard to find in local stores.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say I didn&#x27;t since it would cost just as much to return</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a slight shimmer/sparkle to it</li>
            <li> only reason for not giving it the final 5th star is that the brush was damaged and some of the bristles are twisted off.</li>
            <li> Its like I have little m&amp;ms attached to my fingertips.</li>
            <li> Looks like it&#x27;s pictured except it has a little bit of shimmer.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had multiple OPI colors and none have been this poor a quality.</li>
            <li> but it is very subtle.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Now this color I love, when on, it looks almost blue, its a purplish blue.  Absolutely love it.  Grandkids can use, but they dont get this one!</li>
            <li> This nail polish is much prettier in person. There&#x27;s a slight shimmer/sparkle to it but it is very subtle. Beautiful color!</li>
            <li> Beautiful color that doesn&#x27;t need a second coat. It&#x27;s also long wear polish that doesn&#x27;t need to reapply after a couple days.</li>
            <li> The polish was COMPLETELY watered down. What a waste of money. I&#x27;ve had multiple OPI colors and none have been this poor a quality. Before writing this review I went out and bought this same color at a reputable OPI store. The consistency is totally different. One coat of the real stuff is literally better than 3 coats of this sellers polish.  Same with Czechbook color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I tried to return it the seller told me it was just the way the new color is and to ask for a refund from Amazon if I have a problem. Needless to say I didn&#x27;t since it would cost just as much to return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This color is rich with simplicity and light/elegant.  Perfect for the summer.  I received a lot of compliments when I wore this shade.  It was hard to find in local stores.  So instead of continuing to drive all over town searching, I found it easily with you guys.  I should&#x27;ve started my search online!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also arrived 2 days before the expected date in a very secure package!</li>
            <li> Something is off on this polish.  Took three coats and chipped off  the next day.  OPI does not chip off so quickly.</li>
            <li> I really love the color for summer!  It is very creamy and good quality polish.  I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love this colour. Its like I have little m&amp;ms attached to my fingertips. FAST delivery from seller.</li>
            <li> Well packaged for shipping. Received in a timely manner. Product was fresh. Perfect shade of periwinkle blue.</li>
            <li> Such a fantastic color.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> very pretty color goes on smooth and nice. It also dries pretty fast.If younput lighter layers on it looks better and dries faster inbetween layers.</li>
            <li> I loved the color because its like a light color. It is almost like a pastel purple. I totally would recommend this one</li>
            <li> This color is fantastic! A lovely, rich periwinkle. You&#x27;ll need a few coats, as it goes on fairly translucent. This is def. one of my fav polish colors!</li>
            <li> Love this color and quality</li>
            <li> My favorite color.  It stays on forever.  I put green dots on top for fun.</li>
            <li> This color (You&#x27;re Such Budapest) is my favorite color. It&#x27;s a touch lighter than lavender. More like a sky blue with a touch of purple. It is a very girley color but I am about as feminine as they come.</li>
            <li> I love this color, very subtle. I get a lot of compliment when I wear this color, very nice color.</li>
            <li> Such a pretty color! Wear it constantly and get many compliments. Perfect shade of lilac at a super price. :)</li>
            <li> Awesome color for summer!</li>
            <li> I really like this kind of light lavender/blue color for spring. You need 3 coats to achieve the color in the bottle &amp; it seems to have a self leveling crelly formula that&#x27;s nice quality like most OPI&#x27;s. It&#x27;s also very long wearing. I purchased this from Amazon because I couldn&#x27;t buy it at my local ULTA - it was all sold out &amp; I can see why! Anyway, if you love light purples or lavender tone colors you will love this one for sure. It&#x27;s truly the loveliest shade of lavender I&#x27;ve ever seen !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s truly a beautiful purple. Looks great on hands and feet. Goes on smooths. Needless to say I get so many compliments.</li>
            <li> was good product only that is not seem to be new, was not protected , but i love the color ....</li>
            <li> Loved this color! It was light but not to light to go unnoticed.  Bought two bottles. Very nice Spring color.</li>
            <li> Really like the color very chic and adorable by itself, also I like to pair it with the OPI Euro Centrale Spring Collection and gives it an edgy look. ;)</li>
            <li> This is such a pretty color!  It&#x27;s a bluish lavender polish, and the finish is about 90% opaque. I can just see the slightest hint of nail underneath.  The result looks very gel-like.  It&#x27;s very springy.  It&#x27;s a very flattering color for cool skin tones.  This is not a polish that can be worn with just one coat.  One coat is transparent and streaky.  I always do 2-3.  If you want something you can do in one coat and be done, you should look elsewhere.  I&#x27;m absolutely willing to put the 2-3 coats on.  While I normally use a topcoat, I haven&#x27;t been with this polish, because I love its finish all on its own.</li>
            <li> Got so many compliments on this color. It also stayed on longer than any other polish including other OPI polishes. Would definitely recommend if you are looking for a pretty color</li>
            <li> Well i love OPI and this is not a color i would normally get (makes me feel like bruised nails or something), but with Easter coming i thought why not.  The color, even though it looks solid, actually has the tinsiest bit of shimmer to it.  It is the first opi polish i have had that i had to paint 3 coats of though.  Overall i did like this polish, but don&#x27;t like having to do extra coats.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be ready for spring wearing this shade. I&#x27;d also recommend getting OPI&#x27;s Polka.com to wear over this polish. It really kicks up the pretty blue, pink and lavender pastels for spring.</li>
            <li> This color is a nice light pastel purple that would look cute in the spring, especially for Easter ( if you celebrate it). Also the teeny tiny little shimmer in it makes it more then just a plain purple. This is a must have!</li>
            <li> This polish is beautiful !!!!!!!!  it is a great color that goes on creamy and smooth.  Even after two weeks it still looks shiny , not chipped or lessened in any way.</li>
            <li> Typical OPI polish and very pretty spring color. The color is light and bright. No sparkle, but goes well with sprakle topcoats.</li>
            <li> I love the color however the quality of the nail polish is crappy. It&#x27;s not thick and requires four coats before it ceases to be transparent. I first came across the color while at the salon so I know it&#x27;s not the actual polish. Again, awesome color not sure what happened with the quality.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping and well packaged.  The color is very pretty and light.  Great for spring/summer.  Two to three coats or over another color it looks great.</li>
            <li> pretty color!  it&#x27;s more lavender than light blue.</li>
            <li> I only buy OPI and this periwinkle color adds a breath of fresh air to my day. It is a very appropriate color for Spring and Summer.</li>
            <li> You need 2-3 coats, but it is gorgeous and and doesn&#x27;t chip at all! I&#x27;ve had it on for about 5 days now with no chipping or flaking. I get compliments every day on the color.</li>
            <li> Pretty pastel color. My 3rd favorite from the collection. Looks like it&#x27;s pictured except it has a little bit of shimmer. Not a lot but a very little, which I was surprised by. I don&#x27;t like shimmer, just solid cream looking polish. But the shimmer is so light you can hardly notice it.</li>
            <li> I got this color cause I love purples and lavenders. When my nail tech put it on I fell in love with it instantly.</li>
            <li> First and foremost, the product was delivered to me within two days of purchase, awesome.&lt;br /&gt;second, i love love love love this color. it is perfect for spring, glides on smooth and can be worn with glitter and so on.&lt;br /&gt;my only reason for not giving it the final 5th star is that the brush was damaged and some of the bristles are twisted off. I tried cleaning it but nothing has worked. I&#x27;m optimistic so I used it anyway, but it sucked to not have a clean, fully functioning brush.</li>
            <li> Item arrived swiftly and well packaged.  Came before the promised date.  I love the shade and had been meaning to try it for some time and finally got around to it.  So glad I did.  I would recommend this Seller to anyone!</li>
            <li> This new spring color only takes one coat. BUT it lacks the wow factor. I added OPI glitter polish on top and got a lot of compliments and questions of where I got it from. Alone, I would not reccomend,but add glitter on top and it is amazing.</li>
            <li> I chose this color because it was light and fresh looking, my wife loved it because it was great for spring and summer lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly certain that this polish is counterfeit.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to get a baby blue nailpolish but this turned out to be a lilac color.  I&#x27;ve been happy with all the other OPI purchases, but this one was not as pictured.</li>
            <li> great summer color and wears long</li>
            <li> I bought this nail color as a spring present to myself.  I am very pleased with it!  The only thing is that it is a bit runny compared to other OPI brand nail lacquer I have used before.  None the less I love it!</li>
