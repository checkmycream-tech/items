            <li>I love this polish!</li>

            <li>but theyre honestly all</li>
            <li>This is every thing I thought it would be,SOO nice.</li>

            <li>I have painted my OWN nails three times with this since ordering.</li>
            <li>Super happy.</li>

            <li>Its my favorite and will buy more soon!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it would look that nice just by looking at the bottle, but it looks stunning when you paint it</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fascinating to look at the polish in light.</li>
            <li>This polish is gorgeous and REALLY holographic!!!</li>
            <li>This is by far my all time favorite!!!</li>
            <li>I used to have the the sally hansen magical holographic polish which was by far the best</li>
            <li>This polish is so fine!</li>
            <li>My bottle looked very light and all silver more like the pic of Angel Kiss or risqué.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite holo polishes.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I love the sort of back-of-a-CD, future-y look to it</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Edited to add, I have ordered twice now and love these.  </li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This polish is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Even with a top coat.</li>
            <li>The holographic color changes in this are captivating.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to try more shades.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m soo glad I got this polish.</li>

            <li>The color in the bottle had me hooked, and looks even better painted.</li>
            <li>So I will create a photo collage of each nail polish color, and I will include a photo with the flash on, a photo with indoor lighting, and a photo with outdoor lighting so customers can see what the polish looks like in each setting. :)</li>

            <li>I get so many compliments:)</li>
            <li>It is so beautiful and unique, dries pretty quick, looks amazing in sun light!</li>
            <li>It was pretty good</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t look exactly like the picture but its still gorgeous.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty indoors and gorgeous outdoors.</li>
            <li>Dries nice and quickly (takes about 5 minutes).</li>
            <li>I do wish the color descriptions from the seller were more accurate</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of polish and holos just happen to be my favorite.</li>
            <li>I get tons of compliments on the polish, I loved the polish so much</li>
            <li>Love this so much!!!</li>
            <li>Easy to apply</li>
            <li>This color is very eye catching and you will be sure to get compliments.</li>
            <li>It does not stain the nails, either, and comes off easily with nail polish remover.</li>
            <li>And doesn&#x27;t chip easy.</li>
            <li>Hands down best holo I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li>I simply love it and the seller is fantastic, it arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>I put on the polish and it was love at first sight!</li>
            <li>Color Club makes such fantastic holos, and of a great quality.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased this if it weren&#x27;t for the photos, but the photos are completely accurate to color</li>
            <li>The color is fabulous.</li>
            <li>Application was smooth, and the polish spread neatly without streaking.</li>
            <li>Every time I wear it I end up staring at my nails while I move them around in the light.  </li>
            <li>The color of this polish is simply fantastic.</li>
            <li>I just like a smooth coat of polish.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really holographic, and it applies nicely.</li>
            <li>But in sunlight, or single-source light, the holographic effect is mesmerizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its extremely light.</li>
            <li>exact words from my woman when she got it no chipping or fading seems pretty good to me</li>
            <li>They look gorgeous in the sunlight, and I took mine to my local nail salon and had them use 2 coats on top of a full acrylic set, the results were FABULOUS.</li>
            <li>this is my new favorite polish!</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t gum up like other holos and looks beautiful.</li>
            <li>I love the way it looks when i first put it on.</li>
            <li>It was worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I love this polish so much!</li>
            <li>Using one coat of this color also makes a nice top coat over another solid opaque color to give it sparkle.</li>
            <li>The nail polish I got is named Eternal Beauty which is a very pretty light purple</li>
            <li>I bought this based on the reviews, and they were right!</li>
            <li>The sparkle was great, it really looks like a metallic light blue.</li>
            <li>i love the whole holographic vibe.</li>
            <li>this isn&#x27;t true holo color.</li>
            <li>Love this nail polish and the rainbow hologram in it, dries fast also</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s as absolutely gorgeous on my nails as it is in the bottle, which totally exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li>and i love this color so much.</li>
            <li>then it&#x27;s cool.</li>
            <li>I love it so much.</li>
            <li>Looks beautiful understand heavy light or sunlight.</li>
            <li>Not only is the holo effect cool and just as advertised, but the formula is so amazing that it could easily be a one-coater if you wanted.</li>
            <li>That being said, my previous bottle was purchased in store and went on beautifully.  </li>
            <li>But pretty close&lt;br /&gt;Peels off easily and to quickly.</li>
            <li>The color was so pretty in the bottle I decided to try it, no black or other color underneath, just the polish and to my amazement it was gorgeous, with a spectacular holographic effect that got even better out in the sunlight.  </li>
            <li>Seriously, color club makes one of the best holos and you won&#x27;t regret getting it.</li>
            <li>this is seriously the best holographic nail polish I have ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and it dries incredibly quick.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>It chips quickly</li>
            <li>No streaking, clumps, and a quick drying time.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick and item arrived well wrapped.</li>
            <li>It also dries quickly and has staying power.</li>
            <li>I  wish it didn&#x27;t fade so quickly, but it could be that I work @</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t chip quickly</li>
            <li>SUPER linear holo.  </li>
            <li>Even when I&#x27;m not in the light the color is a really pretty.</li>
            <li>So pretty!</li>
            <li>Beware of using a top coat, like many holos, a top coat can dull the effect some.</li>
            <li>It is a silverfish-light blue, with an amazing holographic look to it.</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s now, by far, my favorite nail polish.</li>
            <li>The color is nice, but it doesn&#x27;t last a day.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the buy if you like sparkly nails</li>
            <li>BY FAR FAVORITE NAIL POLISH.</li>
            <li>it was definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Also, in some lights - especially more than one source of light (indoors, office settings, flourescent) the color appears mostly a pale blue to silvery gray.</li>
            <li>and I want more and will buy much more in due time.</li>
            <li>MY FAVE COLOR RIGHT NOW.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the light blue shade when it&#x27;s not working its holographic magic though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so pretty and doesn&#x27;t require a million coats to get the right shade</li>
            <li>shipped quickly and is one of my new fav nail polishes!</li>
            <li>, it is more silver than blue.</li>
            <li>This nail polish is exactly how I pictured it would be, after looking at the images and reading the description.</li>
            <li>that were truly as pretty as the pictures they post, or you had to polish your nails</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>so pretty.</li>
            <li>Pretty in photos.</li>
            <li>But I would definitely recommend:)</li>
            <li>ITS SO PRETTY.</li>
            <li>I put two coats but you may be able to get by with only one.</li>
            <li>and she loves it just as much as I do!</li>
            <li>Finally Bought it and am in love.</li>
            <li>What you see in the pictures is exactly how it is.</li>
            <li>But the color is so pretty, I don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li>I love this nail polish, it&#x27;s so different.</li>
            <li>this polish is so pretty.</li>
            <li>it looks exactly like this photo.</li>
            <li>The polish is great and long lasting!</li>
            <li>Polish not as pretty as picture</li>
            <li>I have somewhere near 150 bottles of nail polish and this color is my favorite by far.</li>
            <li>It is very shimmery, and dries very very fast.</li>
            <li>love it been wanting for a long time.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and easily with one coat, and looking at it (especially in the sun) feels like looking into the future or something.</li>
            <li>as long as you have a decent top coat to out over it</li>
            <li>But really it&#x27;s a nuance.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually a really durable polish.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t flake as much as others do.</li>
            <li>and it came fast to.</li>
            <li>I noticed some reviews said if you use a top coat it dulls the color, but I did not have that problem.</li>
            <li>my favorite color is &amp;#34;halo&amp;#34; which is a pink color</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s absolutely GOREGOUS.</li>
            <li>highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I highly, highly recommend this to anyone who was holographic nails!</li>
            <li>Dries fast.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast too.</li>
            <li>Legit holographic And fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast</li>
            <li>I ordered her one of her own for her birthday, and got myself a second one at the same time of course!</li>
            <li>It is such a beautiful light, airy, cheerful and dreamy blue with hues of pink, seafoam green, lavender, etc.</li>
            <li>I had been looking at many other brands and they were all around $20</li>
            <li>It takes shiny to a whole new level!</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the color of the polish is a lot closer to silver than I had thought, but it is still beautiful.  </li>
            <li>But never dull in the sun!</li>
            <li>very opaque you only need about 1-2 coats and doesnt dull from top coat :)</li>
            <li>Super pretty, but takes forever to dry.</li>
            <li>I used a black undercoat, and 2 coats of this on top.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like a vibrant rainbow.</li>
            <li>Received it very quickly, LOVE the color, but after drying the polish peels off very quickly... need to use this with a really good base coat with a lot of prior buffering</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this nail polish.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>Plus it dried super quick.</li>
            <li>The polish is by far a better quality than other holographic polishes on the market!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t chip right away which is a really big plus.</li>
            <li>With only 2 coats, it sparkles and shines when under light or outside.</li>
            <li>Smooth, shiny, you only need one coat (I like 2, personal preference).</li>
            <li>This is my first Color Club nail polish since they don&#x27;t sell it locally.  </li>
            <li>No chipping after 4 days so far!</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time and is just so mesmerizing to look at.</li>
            <li>The color is pretty solid.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While the name implies it is somehow predominately blue, it is actually a chrome-like silver with a full rainbow holographic effect.</li>
            <li>When I saw this the photo was such a beautiful blue and the price was much less than the other so called holographic polishes I had purchased, I decided to order.  </li>
            <li>WOW - WOW - WOW!</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>but wow...</li>
            <li>it goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t take long to dry.</li>
            <li>Looks plain but once put in the light</li>
            <li>Photo online looks like a vibrant halo blue</li>
            <li>Blue Heaven is a pretty silver color with maybe a hint of blue in it.  </li>
            <li>I put on three coats (it dries really fast, only took about 15 minutes total, if that) and it has been 4 days and no chipping or anything!</li>
            <li>My older daughter was constantly using my Blue Heaven nail polish.  </li>
            <li>but it may be hard to capture with the light.</li>
            <li>it reminda me of what everyone thought the future was gonna be in early 2000</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m officially addicted and need to order more Color Club nail polish soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its not as thick and doesn&#x27;t go on as smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely will keep stocked in this and have ordered other colors to add to my collection.</li>
            <li>I dont know if the other colors are as deceiving in real person.</li>
            <li>I have looked at other &amp;#34;holographic&amp;#34; polish &amp; this is the only one that I have looked at (and actually brought) that is really holographic.</li>

            <li> I love this polish!</li>

            <li> This colr is gorgeous love it</li>
            <li> but theyre honestly all</li>
            <li> This is every thing I thought it would be,SOO nice.</li>

            <li> I have painted my OWN nails three times with this since ordering.</li>
            <li> Super happy.</li>

            <li> Its my favorite and will buy more soon!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it would look that nice just by looking at the bottle, but it looks stunning when you paint it</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fascinating to look at the polish in light.</li>
            <li> This polish is gorgeous and REALLY holographic!!!</li>
            <li> This is by far my all time favorite!!!</li>
            <li> I used to have the the sally hansen magical holographic polish which was by far the best</li>
            <li> This polish is so fine!</li>
            <li> My bottle looked very light and all silver more like the pic of Angel Kiss or risqué.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite holo polishes.  </li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I love the sort of back-of-a-CD, future-y look to it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Edited to add, I have ordered twice now and love these.  </li>

            <li> I love it.</li>

            <li> Even with a top coat.</li>
            <li> The holographic color changes in this are captivating.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try more shades.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m soo glad I got this polish.</li>

            <li> Im IN LOVE.</li>
            <li> The color in the bottle had me hooked, and looks even better painted.</li>
            <li> So I will create a photo collage of each nail polish color, and I will include a photo with the flash on, a photo with indoor lighting, and a photo with outdoor lighting so customers can see what the polish looks like in each setting. :)</li>

            <li> its looks so much better on your nails.</li>

            <li> I get so many compliments:)</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s pretty indoors and gorgeous outdoors.</li>
            <li> Dries nice and quickly (takes about 5 minutes).</li>
            <li> I do wish the color descriptions from the seller were more accurate</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of polish and holos just happen to be my favorite.</li>
            <li> I get tons of compliments on the polish, I loved the polish so much</li>

            <li> Easy to apply</li>
            <li> This color is very eye catching and you will be sure to get compliments.</li>
            <li> It does not stain the nails, either, and comes off easily with nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> And doesn&#x27;t chip easy.</li>
            <li> Hands down best holo I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li> I simply love it and the seller is fantastic, it arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> I put on the polish and it was love at first sight!</li>
            <li> Color Club makes such fantastic holos, and of a great quality.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased this if it weren&#x27;t for the photos, but the photos are completely accurate to color</li>
            <li> The color is fabulous.</li>
            <li> Application was smooth, and the polish spread neatly without streaking.</li>
            <li> Every time I wear it I end up staring at my nails while I move them around in the light.  </li>
            <li> The color of this polish is simply fantastic.</li>
            <li> I just like a smooth coat of polish.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really holographic, and it applies nicely.</li>
            <li> But in sunlight, or single-source light, the holographic effect is mesmerizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its extremely light.</li>
            <li> exact words from my woman when she got it no chipping or fading seems pretty good to me</li>
            <li> They look gorgeous in the sunlight, and I took mine to my local nail salon and had them use 2 coats on top of a full acrylic set, the results were FABULOUS.</li>
            <li> this is my new favorite polish!</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t gum up like other holos and looks beautiful.</li>
            <li> I love the way it looks when i first put it on.</li>
            <li> It was worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I love this polish so much!</li>
            <li> Using one coat of this color also makes a nice top coat over another solid opaque color to give it sparkle.</li>
            <li> The nail polish I got is named Eternal Beauty which is a very pretty light purple</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the reviews, and they were right!</li>
            <li> The sparkle was great, it really looks like a metallic light blue.</li>
            <li> i love the whole holographic vibe.</li>
            <li> this isn&#x27;t true holo color.</li>
            <li> Love this nail polish and the rainbow hologram in it, dries fast also</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s as absolutely gorgeous on my nails as it is in the bottle, which totally exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li> and i love this color so much.</li>
            <li> then it&#x27;s cool.</li>
            <li> I love it so much.</li>
            <li> Looks beautiful understand heavy light or sunlight.</li>
            <li> Not only is the holo effect cool and just as advertised, but the formula is so amazing that it could easily be a one-coater if you wanted.</li>
            <li> That being said, my previous bottle was purchased in store and went on beautifully.  </li>
            <li> But pretty close&lt;br /&gt;Peels off easily and to quickly.</li>
            <li> The color was so pretty in the bottle I decided to try it, no black or other color underneath, just the polish and to my amazement it was gorgeous, with a spectacular holographic effect that got even better out in the sunlight.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, color club makes one of the best holos and you won&#x27;t regret getting it.</li>
            <li> this is seriously the best holographic nail polish I have ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it dries incredibly quick.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> It chips quickly</li>
            <li> No streaking, clumps, and a quick drying time.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick and item arrived well wrapped.</li>
            <li> It also dries quickly and has staying power.</li>
            <li> I  wish it didn&#x27;t fade so quickly, but it could be that I work @</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t chip quickly</li>
            <li> SUPER linear holo.  </li>
            <li> Even when I&#x27;m not in the light the color is a really pretty.</li>
            <li> So pretty!</li>
            <li> Beware of using a top coat, like many holos, a top coat can dull the effect some.</li>
            <li> It is a silverfish-light blue, with an amazing holographic look to it.</li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s now, by far, my favorite nail polish.</li>
            <li> The color is nice, but it doesn&#x27;t last a day.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the buy if you like sparkly nails</li>
            <li> BY FAR FAVORITE NAIL POLISH.</li>
            <li> it was definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Also, in some lights - especially more than one source of light (indoors, office settings, flourescent) the color appears mostly a pale blue to silvery gray.</li>
            <li> and I want more and will buy much more in due time.</li>
            <li> MY FAVE COLOR RIGHT NOW.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the light blue shade when it&#x27;s not working its holographic magic though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so pretty and doesn&#x27;t require a million coats to get the right shade</li>
            <li> shipped quickly and is one of my new fav nail polishes!</li>
            <li> , it is more silver than blue.</li>
            <li> This nail polish is exactly how I pictured it would be, after looking at the images and reading the description.</li>
            <li> that were truly as pretty as the pictures they post, or you had to polish your nails</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> so pretty.</li>
            <li> Pretty in photos.</li>
            <li> But I would definitely recommend:)</li>
            <li> ITS SO PRETTY.</li>
            <li> I put two coats but you may be able to get by with only one.</li>
            <li> and she loves it just as much as I do!</li>
            <li> Finally Bought it and am in love.</li>
            <li> What you see in the pictures is exactly how it is.</li>
            <li> But the color is so pretty, I don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish, it&#x27;s so different.</li>
            <li> this polish is so pretty.</li>
            <li> it looks exactly like this photo.</li>
            <li> The polish is great and long lasting!</li>
            <li> Polish not as pretty as picture</li>
            <li> I have somewhere near 150 bottles of nail polish and this color is my favorite by far.</li>
            <li> It is very shimmery, and dries very very fast.</li>
            <li> love it been wanting for a long time.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and easily with one coat, and looking at it (especially in the sun) feels like looking into the future or something.</li>
            <li> as long as you have a decent top coat to out over it</li>
            <li> But really it&#x27;s a nuance.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually a really durable polish.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t flake as much as others do.</li>
            <li> and it came fast to.</li>
            <li> I noticed some reviews said if you use a top coat it dulls the color, but I did not have that problem.</li>
            <li> my favorite color is &amp;#34;halo&amp;#34; which is a pink color</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s absolutely GOREGOUS.</li>
            <li> highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I highly, highly recommend this to anyone who was holographic nails!</li>
            <li> Dries fast.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast too.</li>
            <li> Legit holographic And fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast</li>
            <li> I ordered her one of her own for her birthday, and got myself a second one at the same time of course!</li>
            <li> It is such a beautiful light, airy, cheerful and dreamy blue with hues of pink, seafoam green, lavender, etc.</li>
            <li> I had been looking at many other brands and they were all around $20</li>
            <li> It takes shiny to a whole new level!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the color of the polish is a lot closer to silver than I had thought, but it is still beautiful.  </li>
            <li> But never dull in the sun!</li>
            <li> very opaque you only need about 1-2 coats and doesnt dull from top coat :)</li>
            <li> Super pretty, but takes forever to dry.</li>
            <li> I used a black undercoat, and 2 coats of this on top.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like a vibrant rainbow.</li>
            <li> Received it very quickly, LOVE the color, but after drying the polish peels off very quickly... need to use this with a really good base coat with a lot of prior buffering</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this nail polish.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Plus it dried super quick.</li>
            <li> The polish is by far a better quality than other holographic polishes on the market!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t chip right away which is a really big plus.</li>
            <li> With only 2 coats, it sparkles and shines when under light or outside.</li>
            <li> Smooth, shiny, you only need one coat (I like 2, personal preference).</li>
            <li> This is my first Color Club nail polish since they don&#x27;t sell it locally.  </li>
            <li> No chipping after 4 days so far!</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and is just so mesmerizing to look at.</li>
            <li> The color is pretty solid.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While the name implies it is somehow predominately blue, it is actually a chrome-like silver with a full rainbow holographic effect.</li>
            <li> When I saw this the photo was such a beautiful blue and the price was much less than the other so called holographic polishes I had purchased, I decided to order.  </li>
            <li> WOW - WOW - WOW!</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> but wow...</li>
            <li> it goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t take long to dry.</li>
            <li> Looks plain but once put in the light</li>
            <li> Photo online looks like a vibrant halo blue</li>
            <li> Blue Heaven is a pretty silver color with maybe a hint of blue in it.  </li>
            <li> I put on three coats (it dries really fast, only took about 15 minutes total, if that) and it has been 4 days and no chipping or anything!</li>
            <li> My older daughter was constantly using my Blue Heaven nail polish.  </li>
            <li> but it may be hard to capture with the light.</li>
            <li> it reminda me of what everyone thought the future was gonna be in early 2000</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m officially addicted and need to order more Color Club nail polish soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its not as thick and doesn&#x27;t go on as smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely will keep stocked in this and have ordered other colors to add to my collection.</li>
            <li> I dont know if the other colors are as deceiving in real person.</li>
            <li> I have looked at other &amp;#34;holographic&amp;#34; polish &amp; this is the only one that I have looked at (and actually brought) that is really holographic.</li>
            <li> So classy and pretty in normal lighting and once the sun/strong lighting hits it its RIDICULOUS!!</li>
            <li> black first, which of course made whatever polish it was......VERY DARK.  </li>
            <li> I love silver polish, this is a silver base with just pure awesomeness with the holographic shimmer added in.</li>
            <li> After purchasing several other brands and various colors of &amp;#34;Holographic&amp;#34; polishes, I had about decided that there were not any out there</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a dupe for a discontinued OPI nail polish that was currently selling on eBay for 80 bucks and was seriously considering shelling out that much because a holographic nail polish was my dream colour, but Iuckily found this one</li>
            <li> the pink one is next maybe in a couple of weeks</li>
            <li> The polish really comes off thick from the brush, one coat is all I needed.</li>
            <li> I used it over some other polish and only applied 1 coat</li>
            <li> looks like a matte gray when dry</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s dark outside</li>
            <li> This pic looks almost blue or green.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what I expected, but that&#x27;s my fault.</li>
            <li> Be careful when driving as you may be distracted by the rainbow on your finger tips.  </li>
            <li> I just ordered 2 other colors in this collection.  </li>
            <li> Not exactly what I thought it would look like.</li>
            <li> Will buy the other colors ASAP.</li>
            <li> Will repurchase, and will be getting other colors in the collection.</li>
            <li> Not sure how long it lasts without chipping.</li>
            <li> I have not really wore it for a week or even a day, but I did try it out for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I used OPI base and top coat on my nails.</li>
            <li> I tried a clear topcoat on one nail but decided the holographic effect isn&#x27;t as dramatic with a topcoat.</li>
            <li> It is subtle enough to wear everyday</li>
            <li> /&gt;After one week (on acrylic, as mentioned - one black coat, 2 coats of Color Club Holographic, no top coat), it has not chipped nor rubbed off the tips.</li>
            <li> Seller is fantastic and I received it within a couple days of ordering it, I was shocked!</li>
            <li> Although it does seem to dull in a few days.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t need a base coat and only needs one coat if you use enough.</li>
            <li> mean started chipping after a week.</li>
            <li> It is seriously holographic.</li>
            <li> I saw the OPI, but opted for this (less expensive) option instead.</li>
            <li> The only base coat I used is opi&#x27;s chip skip to help prevent chipping.</li>
            <li> You can get by with one coat if you want, and no special base coat at all.</li>
            <li> Completely obsessed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve no idea what people are complaining about unless they received a bad batch.</li>
            <li> Have to say I&#x27;m disappointed :(</li>
            <li> The colors are crazy!</li>
            <li> Kinda disappointed by it.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a base coat for this (although I don&#x27;t think it would hurt if you do use one).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s insane</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is one of my favorite holo polishes.  It&#x27;s great solo or with vinyls.  It doesn&#x27;t chip right away which is a really big plus.</li>
            <li> Awesome color! Love it</li>
            <li> Wow. Just wow. Believe the reviews. This stuff is amazing. It is just like it looks in bottle. Like a disco ball on my fingers!!!! Super happy. The bottle isn&#x27;t quite like the picture but it may be hard to capture with the light. My bottle looked very light and all silver more like the pic of Angel Kiss or risqué. This pic looks almost blue or green. But really it&#x27;s a nuance. The color is fabulous. Great shipping too. Arrived no cracks or leaks and well timed. Thanks. Will buys again!!&#x27;</li>
            <li> I was looking for a holographic nail polish similar to the one put out by Chanel years ago, and FOUND IT! This polish is gorgeous and REALLY holographic!!!</li>
            <li> Polish returned. Photo online looks like a vibrant halo blue, it is more silver than blue. I would call it slate blue. Not at all like online pic. I am a fan of color Club halos just not this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this polish on a whim, but I figured I&#x27;d have to put on a million coats to get the look I wanted--what the bottle looks like. Not the case! It goes on really well and one or two coats worked perfectly. I love the sort of back-of-a-CD, future-y look to it and I think it&#x27;s now, by far, my favorite nail polish.</li>
            <li> Super pretty, but takes forever to dry. You don&#x27;t need a lot of coats witch is a plus.</li>
            <li> Nice color. Looks darker in the bottle. Needs 3 coats.</li>
            <li> Takes a good light but is a great product</li>
            <li> This is soooooo holographic it&#x27;s insane I love it and always get compliments from strangers !</li>
            <li> This nail polish is exactly how I pictured it would be, after looking at the images and reading the description. A perfect rainbow slides across the surface as I move my nails. Application was smooth, and the polish spread neatly without streaking. I absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the name implies it is somehow predominately blue, it is actually a chrome-like silver with a full rainbow holographic effect.</li>
            <li> This is my first Color Club nail polish since they don&#x27;t sell it locally.  The holographic effect is amazing.  Every time I wear it I end up staring at my nails while I move them around in the light.  It&#x27;s almost hypnotic.  I&#x27;m officially addicted and need to order more Color Club nail polish soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited to add, I have ordered twice now and love these.  I do wish the color descriptions from the seller were more accurate but I&#x27;m sure all of them are gorgeous.  I took a chance on the polish labeled with the color &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34;.  It has a photo of a darker purple nail polish.  The nail polish I got is named Eternal Beauty which is a very pretty light purple polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Blue Heaven is a pretty silver color with maybe a hint of blue in it.  They&#x27;re both amazing colors.  My older daughter was constantly using my Blue Heaven nail polish.  I ordered her one of her own for her birthday, and got myself a second one at the same time of course!</li>
            <li> If you want your nails to look like that of a unicorn&#x27;s sparkly mane, or maybe a mermaid&#x27;s tail you should probably buy this nail polish. It&#x27;s so lovely. Seriously, color club makes one of the best holos and you won&#x27;t regret getting it. It goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t gum up like other holos and looks beautiful. Beware of using a top coat, like many holos, a top coat can dull the effect some. So so gorgeous. &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> 4 stars... It&#x27;s not what I expected, but that&#x27;s my fault. My friend posted a picture of her nails, I loved it, I ordered it.... It looks better on her. Lol. It&#x27;s not as &amp;#34;colorful sparkly&amp;#34; as I thought. The product itself is great. The polish was delivered on time. 10 days from placing my order. It&#x27;s actually a really durable polish. It doesn&#x27;t flake as much as others do. It seems I do my nails, later that night do a load of dishes and 2/3 is flaked off. I received this polish 4 days ago, and after loads of dishes and 2 kids it&#x27;s still holding up like it isn&#x27;t anything.</li>
            <li> After purchasing several other brands and various colors of &amp;#34;Holographic&amp;#34; polishes, I had about decided that there were not any out there that were truly as pretty as the pictures they post, or you had to polish your nails black first, which of course made whatever polish it was......VERY DARK.  When I saw this the photo was such a beautiful blue and the price was much less than the other so called holographic polishes I had purchased, I decided to order.  To my amazement, on the second day after I ordered, it arrived!!!  The color was so pretty in the bottle I decided to try it, no black or other color underneath, just the polish and to my amazement it was gorgeous, with a spectacular holographic effect that got even better out in the sunlight.  I have worn this polish every day since I got it and am thinking of ordering another bottle so I don&#x27;t run out.  It is such a beautiful light, airy, cheerful and dreamy blue with hues of pink, seafoam green, lavender, etc. it actually has a prismatic effect.  I simply love it and the seller is fantastic, it arrived quickly.  The polish goes on wonderfully, dries very quickly and you can actually get by with just one coat if you are in a hurry (it has a wonderful smooth formula with good coverage).  Two coats is Phenomenal!!!  I get tons of compliments on the polish, I loved the polish so much I just ordered 2 other colors in this collection.  Will let you know if the are as good!!  This one is &amp;#34;Better than 5 Stars&amp;#34; in my book!!</li>
            <li> It looks so good, many people have asked to borrow this color from me. Easy to apply and it dries incredibly quick.</li>
            <li> love it been wanting for a long time. and it came fast to. thank you</li>
            <li> MY FAVE COLOR RIGHT NOW. It is seriously holographic. I love it.</li>
            <li> I have somewhere near 150 bottles of nail polish and this color is my favorite by far. That being said, my previous bottle was purchased in store and went on beautifully.  This bottle just seems... off. Its not as thick and doesn&#x27;t go on as smoothly.  Have to say I&#x27;m disappointed :(</li>
            <li> It was pretty good but i was hoping for a holographic overcoat. And It is only holographic in the sun, otherwise its just silver.</li>
            <li> yes and I want more and will buy much more in due time. the pink one is next maybe in a couple of weeks</li>
            <li> This polish is fantastic! It is also VERY affordable for how AWESOME it is! With only 2 coats, it sparkles and shines when under light or outside. It is subtle enough to wear everyday but when you really look at it up close, the holographic color is beautiful!</li>
            <li> Looks plain but once put in the light it&#x27;s like a vibrant rainbow. I love it!!</li>
            <li> This colr is gorgeous love it</li>
            <li> Great color! Looks beautiful understand heavy light or sunlight. Very nice addition to a collection of polish. It last a while too! mean started chipping after a week.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly. Not exactly what I thought it would look like. But pretty close&lt;br /&gt;Peels off easily and to quickly. Even with a top coat.</li>
            <li> The color of this polish is simply fantastic. The holographic color changes in this are captivating. A nail polish for any nail polish lover.</li>
            <li> Best holographic nail color I&#x27;ve ever used.  Can&#x27;t wait to try more shades.  No chipping after 4 days so far!</li>
            <li> I love the way it looks when i first put it on. It chips quickly and i didnt like that part. as long as you have a decent top coat to out over it and you buff your nails before you paint your nails, it lasts longer. ;)</li>
            <li> ITS SO BEAUTIFUL! A MUST HAVE IF YOU&#x27;RE A HOLO LOVER!</li>
            <li> This is by far my all time favorite!!! It is a silverfish-light blue, with an amazing holographic look to it. No streaking, clumps, and a quick drying time. The shimmer is just that- shimmer, not that gritty glitter that I am so unfond of. (no offense to those that are) I just like a smooth coat of polish. This one is great, and I plan to buy more from this collection!</li>
            <li> WOW - WOW - WOW! I love this! You can get by with one coat if you want, and no special base coat at all. Color Club &amp;#34;gets it&amp;#34;!!!</li>
            <li> I have not really wore it for a week or even a day, but I did try it out for a few minutes. It&#x27;s beautiful! It&#x27;s really holographic, and it applies nicely. You don&#x27;t need a base coat for this (although I don&#x27;t think it would hurt if you do use one). It&#x27;s great! I&#x27;m soo glad I got this polish. I have looked at other &amp;#34;holographic&amp;#34; polish &amp; this is the only one that I have looked at (and actually brought) that is really holographic.</li>
            <li> Completely obsessed. Since Chanel discontinued their Holographic polish, this is the closest I&#x27;ve come to finding one to match it. They look gorgeous in the sunlight, and I took mine to my local nail salon and had them use 2 coats on top of a full acrylic set, the results were FABULOUS. Will buy the other colors ASAP.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to get my hands on this polish. I&#x27;m a huge fan of polish and holos just happen to be my favorite. Perfect for your spring and summer time mani and pedi. This color is very eye catching and you will be sure to get compliments. Shipping was quick and item arrived well wrapped. I love it</li>
            <li> Love this polish!  It almost glows in the sunlight (or even bright lighting).</li>
            <li> Beautiful holographic color!</li>
            <li> this just isn&#x27;t my thing. The sparkle was great, it really looks like a metallic light blue.</li>
            <li> good polish! no complaints here. i love the whole holographic vibe. it reminda me of what everyone thought the future was gonna be in early 2000 (ex. zenon)</li>
            <li> This polish is as holographic on my nails as it is on the bottle. Would love to purchase the rest of the collection.</li>
            <li> Received it very quickly, LOVE the color, but after drying the polish peels off very quickly... need to use this with a really good base coat with a lot of prior buffering</li>
            <li> Color is AMAZING!! Im IN LOVE. So classy and pretty in normal lighting and once the sun/strong lighting hits it its RIDICULOUS!! GORGEOUS!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best nail polish I&#x27;ve ever used. Not only is the holo effect cool and just as advertised, but the formula is so amazing that it could easily be a one-coater if you wanted. It also dries quickly and has staying power.</li>
            <li> The color in the bottle had me hooked, and looks even better painted. I used a black undercoat, and 2 coats of this on top. I tried a clear topcoat on one nail but decided the holographic effect isn&#x27;t as dramatic with a topcoat. Also, in some lights - especially more than one source of light (indoors, office settings, flourescent) the color appears mostly a pale blue to silvery gray. But in sunlight, or single-source light, the holographic effect is mesmerizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After one week (on acrylic, as mentioned - one black coat, 2 coats of Color Club Holographic, no top coat), it has not chipped nor rubbed off the tips. I would recommend this polish.</li>
            <li> so pretty. this isn&#x27;t true holo color. it has a blue tint (hence the name)</li>
            <li> I love this nailpolish! It is very shimmery, and dries very very fast. I noticed some reviews said if you use a top coat it dulls the color, but I did not have that problem. I used OPI base and top coat on my nails. I bought blue heaven, halo graphic, and harp on it. I will add pictures as I receive my nail polishes! When I looked at the pictures on the reviews, they looked dazzling. BUT the nailpolish only dazzles like that if you take a picture with the camera flash on. So I will create a photo collage of each nail polish color, and I will include a photo with the flash on, a photo with indoor lighting, and a photo with outdoor lighting so customers can see what the polish looks like in each setting. :)</li>
            <li> These polishes are great! The colors are crazy!</li>
            <li> Using one coat of this color also makes a nice top coat over another solid opaque color to give it sparkle.</li>
            <li> This is insanely gorgeous!  Whether used as a stand alone color or for fancy nail art work, the Blue Heaven is to die for.  Be careful when driving as you may be distracted by the rainbow on your finger tips.  Absolutely will keep stocked in this and have ordered other colors to add to my collection.</li>
            <li> Pretty in photos. In person its just ok. It chips very easily. Kinda disappointed by it. I was going to buy more nail polish from this brand but won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> When I saw holographic nail polish on Pinterest, I had to have it. I saw the OPI, but opted for this (less expensive) option instead. It&#x27;s an absolutely gorgeous sky-blue toned holographic. Check google images to see pictures of it. It stays on for a good 4 days without chipping. I put seche vite over it, which takes its lasting power up to 2 weeks. It does not stain the nails, either, and comes off easily with nail polish remover. Will repurchase, and will be getting other colors in the collection. Absolutely gorgeous.</li>
            <li> I love love love this nail polish. It is so beautiful and unique, dries pretty quick, looks amazing in sun light! And doesn&#x27;t chip easy. I&#x27;ve had it on my nail for 3 days and theres no chips at all.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t look exactly like the picture but its still gorgeous. You don&#x27;t need to add any designs because the polish is beautiful on its own.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommand this product :)</li>
            <li> Love this nail polish and the rainbow hologram in it, dries fast also</li>
            <li> This polish is like magic. It goes on smoothly and easily with one coat, and looking at it (especially in the sun) feels like looking into the future or something. It also works great for accents and stamping. A must-have!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so pretty and doesn&#x27;t require a million coats to get the right shade</li>
            <li> Love it! I ordered the &amp;#34;Blue Heaven &amp;#34; polish and it&#x27;s definitely in my top 3 favorite polishes of all time. Even when I&#x27;m not in the light the color is a really pretty. It was worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Got a lot of compliments on the is polish.  With a top coat, lasted a couple weeks!</li>
            <li> this is seriously the best holographic nail polish I have ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;I was on a hunt for quite some times and I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. I went with this one because of the reviews and it did not disappoint. my favorite color is &amp;#34;halo&amp;#34; which is a pink color but theyre honestly all so lovely.&lt;br /&gt;I ALWAYS get compliments on this polish (even my manicurist was in awe when I pulled out this bottle from my purse)&lt;br /&gt;GET THIS NOW</li>
            <li> Hands down best holo I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li> I obsoletely love this! It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Love the color! I  wish it didn&#x27;t fade so quickly, but it could be that I work @ home, garden and have many animals so I am always washing my hands. But I would definitely recommend:)</li>
            <li> ITS SO PRETTY. exact words from my woman when she got it no chipping or fading seems pretty good to me</li>
            <li> My first holo and it is PERFECT. I&#x27;ll never wear another polish again because it doesn&#x27;t sparkle like this one. I see no flaws. I put two coats but you may be able to get by with only one. I wanted to write a review immediately so I haven&#x27;t seen it in the sunlight yet (it&#x27;s dark outside and I&#x27;m watching The Bachelor) but I took a photo with the flash on my phone and it&#x27;s absolutely GOREGOUS. If you&#x27;re looking for a holo polish, get this one!</li>
            <li> looks like a matte gray when dry</li>
            <li> This nail polish is amazing. I had been looking at many other brands and they were all around $20 so I wasn&#x27;t expecting this one to be as good but I figured I&#x27;d try it. I put on three coats (it dries really fast, only took about 15 minutes total, if that) and it has been 4 days and no chipping or anything! There is no streaks and the effect is definitely there! Outside, the nail polish is even prettier and I didn&#x27;t think it was possible! I would highly recommend this nail polish. Seller is fantastic and I received it within a couple days of ordering it, I was shocked!</li>
            <li> Not Holographic as described.</li>
            <li> This is every thing I thought it would be,SOO nice.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a dupe for a discontinued OPI nail polish that was currently selling on eBay for 80 bucks and was seriously considering shelling out that much because a holographic nail polish was my dream colour, but Iuckily found this one and it&#x27;s as absolutely gorgeous on my nails as it is in the bottle, which totally exceeded my expectations! I loved it so much that I bought it for my best friend as a gift too and she loves it just as much as I do!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this nail polish!  It looks amazing in the bottle... but wow... its looks so much better on your nails. Plus it dried super quick. Anyone wanting some holographic nail polish should definitely get this!</li>
            <li> Wonderful color! Absolutely beautiful! Would definitely recommend this to a friend. Great buy and a beautiful stunning color. Love love!</li>
            <li> Love this so much!!! I had read all the reviews and was eyeing this up for several months. Finally Bought it and am in love. What you see in the pictures is exactly how it is. Smooth, shiny, you only need one coat (I like 2, personal preference). The only base coat I used is opi&#x27;s chip skip to help prevent chipping. Top coat does not interfere with shine at all. Not sure how long it lasts without chipping. But the color is so pretty, I don&#x27;t care. I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> The color is nice, but it doesn&#x27;t last a day. I guess if you are going out to the club, this is a good option, but if you work with your hands, you better wear gloves. It chips in a day.</li>
            <li> Amazing color. Just two coats and you are good to go. Came packaged well and i love this color so much.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it! Although it does seem to dull in a few days. But never dull in the sun!</li>
            <li> Beautiful color and finish</li>
            <li> This is my favorite color of nail polish! I wore it for my wedding and LOVED how it reflected the sun.</li>
            <li> If you want  Holo that isnt striky and a pain to apply, this is the Best choice. Also I love that appliying a top coat Doesnt affect the Holo effect. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Not quite as holographic as I&#x27;d hoped for. Only under very specific lighting…. then it&#x27;s cool. I don&#x27;t really like the light blue shade when it&#x27;s not working its holographic magic though.</li>
            <li> shipped quickly and is one of my new fav nail polishes! very opaque you only need about 1-2 coats and doesnt dull from top coat :)</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish. I get tons of compliments when I wear it. The color in light is amazing. It doesn&#x27;t chip quickly</li>
            <li> I have painted my OWN nails three times with this since ordering. It is so hynotic. I find myself looking at it often and recommend it all the time to the clients.</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish, it&#x27;s so different. It takes shiny to a whole new level! It&#x27;s magnificent. Definitely worth the buy if you like sparkly nails</li>
            <li> this polish is so pretty. it looks silver but reflects off many colors. it goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t take long to dry.</li>
            <li> Color Club makes such fantastic holos, and of a great quality.  My only complaint is that the color of the polish is a lot closer to silver than I had thought, but it is still beautiful.  I would definitely recommend purchasing thes Holos, and I will definitely buy another one at some point!</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish its beautiful.</li>
            <li> I put this polish on as soon as it arrived. I couldn&#x27;t wait. I used to have the the sally hansen magical holographic polish which was by far the best but they stopped making it but when I read the reviews I had to try it out. Glad I did!</li>
            <li> I saw this nail polish on a YouTube video and I just had to have it. The color is amazing and lasts. It&#x27;s my favorite and I&#x27;ll defiantly order the rest of the collection.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on this nail polish! My fiancé got it for me as one of my birthday/Christmas gifts. I didn&#x27;t think it would look that nice just by looking at the bottle, but it looks stunning when you paint it on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend buying this product. It lasts a long time and is just so mesmerizing to look at.</li>
            <li> This nail polish is AMAZING!!!! it looks exactly like this photo. A must-have for anyone looking for a Chrome or multichrome / color changing / glitter / metal nail polish.</li>
            <li> OMG!! So pretty! Can&#x27;t stop staring at my nails.</li>
            <li> 11/10 if i could!!! I put on the polish and it was love at first sight! highly recommended! Great price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I love this holographic nail polish and the Color Club brand is the best if you are looking for this type!!</li>
            <li> Love this nail polish ! The polish is great and long lasting!</li>
            <li> BY FAR FAVORITE NAIL POLISH. It&#x27;s pretty indoors and gorgeous outdoors. Definitely should look at the pic I post of it.</li>
            <li> this is my new favorite polish! it doesn&#x27;t need a base coat and only needs one coat if you use enough. stunning color and great quality. it was definitely worth the money. I love it so much. only thing to worry about is that the name on the bottle is different from the picture but the color is the same.</li>
            <li> Came on time. Looks beautiful on my nails!</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the reviews, and they were right! This polish is so fine! I used it over some other polish and only applied 1 coat and it&#x27;s like I did many coats with it. It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> The polish really comes off thick from the brush, one coat is all I needed. It looks just like this picture shown and has a great holographic effect, it shines well in normal indoor lighting but in the sunlight was brilliant. I&#x27;ve no idea what people are complaining about unless they received a bad batch.</li>
            <li> I love this product i would buy again!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve had this nail polish on for two weeks now without re painting them and they still look great... Here is a pic</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased this if it weren&#x27;t for the photos, but the photos are completely accurate to color and it&#x27;s fascinating to look at the polish in light. Mine took two coats (one probably would have sufficed, but I was excited) and the color was just gorgeous! I did not put a top coat on and the polish lasted me two days before it began to chip. I highly, highly recommend this to anyone who was holographic nails!</li>
            <li> The shine is perfect. I love silver polish, this is a silver base with just pure awesomeness with the holographic shimmer added in. Its my favorite and will buy more soon!</li>
            <li> This color is my favorite and it&#x27;s beautiful!  The polish is by far a better quality than other holographic polishes on the market!</li>
            <li> The color is pretty solid. No streaking. Dries nice and quickly (takes about 5 minutes). The holographic effect is there. I just dont like that the color is wayyyyy lighter than it appears in the picture. Its a silverish baby blue. Its extremely light. Again.. nothing like the picture. I would not buy this product again. I dont know if the other colors are as deceiving in real person.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous and this picture does not do it justice lol...very beautiful</li>
            <li> Polish not as pretty as picture</li>
            <li> SUPER linear holo.  I&#x27;m in LOVE - the color is gorgeous!  Looks like a matte silver in the shade.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and unique color, just as advertised.</li>
            <li> I love this polish! The color is great and very unique. Dries fast. The shipping was fast too.</li>
            <li> My favorite nail polish!!! I get so many compliments:)</li>
            <li> Looks just like the picture. Legit holographic And fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Absolutely beautiful! I love this polish so much! Arrived fast</li>
