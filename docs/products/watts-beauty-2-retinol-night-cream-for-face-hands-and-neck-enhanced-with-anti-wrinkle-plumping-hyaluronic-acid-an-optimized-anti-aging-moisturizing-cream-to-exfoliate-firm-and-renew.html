            <li>I use it as my foundation and my makeup looks great.</li>
            <li>Great price too.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled by the no frills packaging; this is a very effective product that won&#x27;t irritate your skin.</li>
            <li>Really love that it is fragrance free!!!!</li>
            <li>I also noticed a pleasant pinker tinge to my skin after a week.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>This product rocks along with a good serum.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t sting me though which is good too.</li>
            <li>without it, the texture and color of my skin was not as good.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I have good skin</li>
            <li>and I am very happy with how mild it</li>
            <li>Great product if used consistently for a very fair price.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Did not find this product to be effective.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight, absorbs in quickly and does a great job!!</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m impressed with this cream  </li>
            <li>Not seeing many results yet</li>
            <li>I love the price</li>
            <li>I am extremely happy I chose this wonderful product and the cost is reasonable; I plan to reorder when my supply gets low.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 27 and just want to get on top of the aging skin.</li>
            <li>Will update in 2 more months.</li>
            <li>but excited to ser what it does in a month or so!</li>
            <li>Currently, the Watts 2% Retinol with Vitamin A works beautifully, keeping my skin moist, plumped up, almost wrinkle free (not bad for 68 years of age), and feeling very healthy.  </li>
            <li>product is good if you cannot get the real Retinol</li>
            <li>This is a great cream, I can feel it working after the first use, I will most certainly order again.</li>
            <li>Based on her good comments on my skin and her less than good comments on the results to her skin</li>
            <li>(Note:the bottle let&#x27;s light in so as soon as I received this</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Bottle is translucent and I read retinol products don&#x27;t do well in light.</li>
            <li>but I told her that this was my primary skin care product.</li>
            <li>I makes my skin soft and feels good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and is not greasy.  </li>
            <li>I will finish the bottle but may move on to stronger % or more notable brands next time.</li>
            <li>forehead looks less shiny in the day.&lt;br /&gt;Makes a great night</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, so the pump style top is perfect</li>
            <li>the skin on my face is much tighter and so smooth.</li>
            <li>This next morning my skin looked plump, dewy with a nice glow that had not been there with just the argan oil alone.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is definitely cost effective.</li>
            <li>I used this in the beginning but doesn&#x27;t work as well as the REAL one , which is a true Retinol that you can get from any Medispa or plastic surgery office without an prescription ...</li>
            <li>my skin feels very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the first time that has happened.</li>
            <li>I moved onto a retinol serum and a brand new product you virtually can not find anywhere which I was lucky enough to be able to test drive....</li>
            <li>I was especially pleased that it saw me through a serious recent illness, keeping my face and neck well hydrated.</li>
            <li>With certain eye creams (lancome) I&#x27;ve gotten clogged poors and increased acne, even with just eye application, it somehow finds a way, probably by being rubbed in by my pillow in the night, and breaks me out.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I purchased this moisturizer in conjunction with the Hyaluronic Acid Serum that I absolutely adore.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it do everything it claims to do, it&#x27;s remarkably light weight.  </li>
            <li>I like the pump, keeps me from using too much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product about a month so haven&#x27;t seen a real difference</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t spend much time examining my skin.</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>It clears up any acne amazingly fast</li>
            <li>, I just don&#x27;t pay that much attention to my face, have since stopped using it.  </li>
            <li>Not greasy, no icky smell.</li>
            <li>First time I used it I saw results the next morning.  </li>
            <li>I was almost through the first bottle when I met my current girlfriend.</li>
            <li>Gotta love 40!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s soaks into your skin quickly, there is no smell at all.... and believe me, I have smelled raunchy creams and oils and no, this is not one.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for two days now and no reaction on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling soft and not oily.</li>
            <li>always appreciate the sensitive skinned peeps to post on if/how this affected them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 63 year old man.</li>
            <li>I bought her some and so far she has not seen any results (about a month).</li>
            <li>I went ahead and gave it 5 stars because as far as a product that performs its&#x27; function, it does.</li>
            <li>I used regularly for 2 months, and I really can&#x27;t say wether</li>
            <li>As someone who usually goes for the expensive &amp;#34;drop a name&amp;#34; brands, I was surprised by the excellent quality.</li>
            <li>very gentle on the skin, works as well as can be expected.</li>
            <li>The point of this is to encourage your skin to peel to make way for the new skin and a newer and younger you..</li>
            <li>I also found it very gentle compared to the other retinol products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I was having trouble with adult acne, but after using this product consistently, my skin is 100% clear.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend commented several times during our early dating that I had no wrinkles and asked what I do for that.</li>
            <li>If it were a serum instead of a cream, I&#x27;d personally adore it but 5 stars is far for others who read the reviews knowing that it is a cream.</li>
            <li>That said, it is a light cream and a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I may have noticed a slight tingle (maybe?)...</li>
            <li>and I see this bottle lasting much longer than I would have expected!  </li>
            <li>This has seemed to help with my smile lines, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a miracle cream yet.</li>

            <li> I thought  I&#x27;d try this instead of the usual Skinceuticals  Retinol 1.0 that I get, because it claims to have twice as much retinol.  </li>
            <li> Tried the roc retinol overnight cream and it smelled and made my skin very dry and sensitive to my other lotions .</li>
            <li> It also hasn&#x27;t anything remotely Hyaluronic Acid in it.  </li>
            <li> I use it twice a day and after a couple weeks I have to skip a few days because my skin gets a little tender which to me means the 2% is definitely in there.</li>
            <li> the dark spots are lighter.</li>
            <li> but here&#x27;s my scoring break down.</li>
            <li> -Someone- was apparently having a bad day or a rancid upper</li>
            <li> Hard to say if this stuff improved my skin.</li>
            <li> I have to unscrew and dump the product out, which will ultimately mean 50 % of it will be inaccessible.  </li>
            <li> If there is improvement expect it to be subtle and not night-and-day dramatic like some reviews.</li>
            <li> I am guessing the woman who gave this a bad review was a victim of a bad batch.</li>
            <li> Allergies to fragrance make life difficult - don&#x27;t know why everything has to be overdone with fragrance.</li>
            <li> and I am at that age that my hormones are going crazy and acne keeps coming and going.</li>
            <li> The price makes it easier to not feel too bad if it&#x27;s not a fountain of youth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Just started using this product. Not seeing many results yet but I will keep you posted as time goes by</li>
            <li> I love the price and I like what I&#x27;ve seen this do for my skin.  First time I used it I saw results the next morning.  I use it nightly immediately after washing my face.  It absorbs quickly and is not greasy.  Afterwards, I use argan oil as I&#x27;ve done for years.  This next morning my skin looked plump, dewy with a nice glow that had not been there with just the argan oil alone.  I&#x27;ll definite buy this again!  The only thing it hasn&#x27;t helped is my one age spot.</li>
            <li> Pump did not work.  I have to unscrew and dump the product out, which will ultimately mean 50 % of it will be inaccessible.  After two weeks have seen no effects of the retinol.</li>
            <li> very gentle on the skin, works as well as can be expected.</li>
            <li> Really love that it is fragrance free!!!! Allergies to fragrance make life difficult - don&#x27;t know why everything has to be overdone with fragrance. This product rocks along with a good serum. It&#x27;s light weight, absorbs in quickly and does a great job!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect a retinol jolt. This product is creamy and moisturizing. I also found it very gentle compared to the other retinol products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It is retinol like they say.  It has helped my skin.  I makes my skin soft and feels good. It doesn&#x27;t sting me though which is good too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this moisturizer in conjunction with the Hyaluronic Acid Serum that I absolutely adore.  Not only does it do everything it claims to do, it&#x27;s remarkably light weight.  A little goes a long way, so the pump style top is perfect and I see this bottle lasting much longer than I would have expected!  I am very happy with it.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that I still get a shiny forehead after a couple hours following application... although that has been an issue for me with every product, so it is likely not the formula, simply my skin PH.  Great stuff for an excellent price!</li>
            <li> i was using this for 6 mos and then said eh, it&#x27;s not doing anything and stopped- then i saw what a difference it made- without it, the texture and color of my skin was not as good. this has some moisturizing benefits as well.</li>
            <li> Not greasy, no icky smell. So far so good. Been using it about a month with a regular moisurizer with Sun protection over.</li>
            <li> I used this in the beginning but doesn&#x27;t work as well as the REAL one , which is a true Retinol that you can get from any Medispa or plastic surgery office without an prescription ... The point of this is to encourage your skin to peel to make way for the new skin and a newer and younger you..&lt;br /&gt;This product is good if you cannot get the real Retinol</li>
            <li> Tried the roc retinol overnight cream and it smelled and made my skin very dry and sensitive to my other lotions . So far I&#x27;m impressed with this cream  my skin feels very soft and smooth. Only have used it for a week or so but excited to ser what it does in a month or so!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for two days now and no reaction on my sensitive skin.  I like the pump, keeps me from using too much.</li>
            <li> Did not find this product to be effective.</li>
            <li> Be been using for about a month and I have noticed a difference in the appearance of my skin and the dark spots are lighter. I use it twice a day and after a couple weeks I have to skip a few days because my skin gets a little tender which to me means the 2% is definitely in there. Great product if used consistently for a very fair price.</li>
            <li> I use it as my foundation and my makeup looks great. Leaves my skin feeling soft and not oily. Great product!</li>
            <li> This is a great cream, I can feel it working after the first use, I will most certainly order again. Great price too.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a relatively short time so I am reserving my long-term evaluation for a later date.  Currently, the Watts 2% Retinol with Vitamin A works beautifully, keeping my skin moist, plumped up, almost wrinkle free (not bad for 68 years of age), and feeling very healthy.  I am extremely happy I chose this wonderful product and the cost is reasonable; I plan to reorder when my supply gets low.  I was especially pleased that it saw me through a serious recent illness, keeping my face and neck well hydrated.</li>
            <li> maximum retinol I can get over the counter. absorbs well, no smell and can be worm under make-up.  I like that it also has vitamin A</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for 2 wks. I&#x27;m 27 and just want to get on top of the aging skin. This has seemed to help with my smile lines, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a miracle cream yet. The price makes it easier to not feel too bad if it&#x27;s not a fountain of youth.&lt;br /&gt;I always appreciate the sensitive skinned peeps to post on if/how this affected them. With certain eye creams (lancome) I&#x27;ve gotten clogged poors and increased acne, even with just eye application, it somehow finds a way, probably by being rubbed in by my pillow in the night, and breaks me out.&lt;br /&gt;This cream does not and I am very happy with how mild it is.&lt;br /&gt;Also, this product wears well in the day, and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product about a month so haven&#x27;t seen a real difference but here&#x27;s my scoring break down. (Note:the bottle let&#x27;s light in so as soon as I received this I covered the bottle in masking tape so the cream wouldn&#x27;t become further compromised)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The cream does make your skin softer.&lt;br /&gt; I also noticed a pleasant pinker tinge to my skin after a week.&lt;br /&gt;My forehead looks less shiny in the day.&lt;br /&gt;Makes a great night cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Bottle is translucent and I read retinol products don&#x27;t do well in light. Mask the bottle in tape to fix this.&lt;br /&gt;If you have an existing pimple and you apply this it will make it bigger. So it doesn&#x27;t make you break out but it will &amp;#34;fertilize&amp;#34; an existing blemish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There you go. Will update in 2 more months.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I may have noticed a slight tingle (maybe?)...but I use it daily and haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my skin. I will finish the bottle but may move on to stronger % or more notable brands next time.</li>
            <li> Since I started using this Watts Retinol and Hyaluronic Acid serum the skin on my face is much tighter and so smooth. I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Bought based on reviews. I&#x27;m a 63 year old man. I was almost through the first bottle when I met my current girlfriend. I don&#x27;t think I have good skin and that is one reason I bought this. My girlfriend commented several times during our early dating that I had no wrinkles and asked what I do for that. I think I have plenty of wrinkles but I told her that this was my primary skin care product. I bought her some and so far she has not seen any results (about a month). She is 57. Hard to say if this stuff improved my skin. I don&#x27;t really notice but I don&#x27;t spend much time examining my skin. Based on her good comments on my skin and her less than good comments on the results to her skin I have to give this product 3 stars. If there is improvement expect it to be subtle and not night-and-day dramatic like some reviews.</li>
            <li> I was having trouble with adult acne, but after using this product consistently, my skin is 100% clear. You really can&#x27;t beat the price. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the no frills packaging; this is a very effective product that won&#x27;t irritate your skin.</li>
            <li> I went ahead and gave it 5 stars because as far as a product that performs its&#x27; function, it does. If it were a serum instead of a cream, I&#x27;d personally adore it but 5 stars is far for others who read the reviews knowing that it is a cream. That said, it is a light cream and a little goes a very long way. It clears up any acne amazingly fast and I am at that age that my hormones are going crazy and acne keeps coming and going. Gotta love 40!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s soaks into your skin quickly, there is no smell at all.... and believe me, I have smelled raunchy creams and oils and no, this is not one. -Someone- was apparently having a bad day or a rancid upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;It is definitely cost effective. As someone who usually goes for the expensive &amp;#34;drop a name&amp;#34; brands, I was surprised by the excellent quality. I moved onto a retinol serum and a brand new product you virtually can not find anywhere which I was lucky enough to be able to test drive.... wait until it hits the open market. wooo! AND it&#x27;s not TOO pricey! Anyway, I&#x27;ve tried several WATTS products including teeth whitener and sometimes the formulation can be inconsistent in the creams and serums. I am guessing the woman who gave this a bad review was a victim of a bad batch. It&#x27;s not the first time that has happened. However, my experience with this cream has been 95% spot on.</li>
            <li> I used regularly for 2 months, and I really can&#x27;t say wether I noticed a difference or not, I just don&#x27;t pay that much attention to my face, have since stopped using it.  I think it did make my face softer.</li>
            <li> I thought  I&#x27;d try this instead of the usual Skinceuticals  Retinol 1.0 that I get, because it claims to have twice as much retinol.  It doesn&#x27;t, just a lot of smelly oils to act as a moisturizers.  It also hasn&#x27;t anything remotely Hyaluronic Acid in it.  Total ripoff.</li>
