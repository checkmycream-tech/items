    <ol>
            <li>But it surpassed my expectations by eradicating itchy legs, elephant skin by it&#x27;s excellent moisturization.</li>
            <li>Best belly balm on the market!</li>
            <li>It works so well and smells great.</li>
            <li>A great way to go to prevent stretch marks, in our opinion.</li>
            <li>and I put it on while my skin is still warm after my shower every day!</li>
            <li>during two months of all-day nausea I still loved the smell of this.</li>
            <li>She loved it.  </li>
            <li>But this product is really good.</li>
            <li>Love the product!</li>
            <li>Just be sure you wear a shirt you don&#x27;t care about!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>The smell is very strong and was not for me (or hubby who would often ask what &amp;#34;that smell was&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Really liked this for my pregnant belly!!</li>
            <li>Excellent all natural balm for your skin</li>
            <li>It smells great and goes on smoothly and it easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>awesome product love that its all natural.</li>
            <li>It mostly smells like lavender.</li>
            <li>Love the company.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fabulous!</li>
            <li>I love the ingredient list.</li>
            <li>I really love this balm.  </li>
            <li>I love the consistency of it</li>
            <li>LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I started with cocoa butter, and moved along to a stretch mark oil, but once I found this belly balm, I stuck with it because it&#x27;s phenomenal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been complimented by friends and family on how soft and beautiful my bump is.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other creams, and this is the best for the price.</li>
            <li>The smell is more smoothing now and doesn&#x27;t seem as strong, my senses must have been heightened during the beginning of pregnancy when i wrote my original review.</li>
            <li>Shipment came quickly and I love the scent during my pregnancy as well as how easily it smooths on.</li>
            <li>I dropped 2 jars of these and the jars were fine, caps cracked but</li>
            <li>I used this about 2 days and the skin there felt fine again.  </li>
            <li>This is a must have for all pregnant mommies!</li>
            <li>( I had twins and had a huge belly).</li>
            <li>No additives/artificial anything is a HUGE bonus.  </li>
            <li>Under $20 and a light scent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it through two pregnancies, and my skin has been comfortable and smooth.</li>
            <li>that you wont mind ruining but trust me, its worth it!</li>
            <li>Gets one of my rare 5 star ratings!</li>
            <li>It is a bit pricey but in my opinion totally worth it!</li>
            <li>I liked it so much I bought a jar for my cousin for her first pregnancy.</li>
            <li>My co-worker referred this to me and she is super conscious of harmful additives in today&#x27;s beauty products; so I knew it would be amazing.</li>
            <li>Thank you for the quick response on the order.  </li>
            <li>Now I recommend it to all my friends when they are pregnant.</li>
            <li>I was pregnant 42 weeks and used this 2-3 times per day.  </li>
            <li>My mom had stretch marks, and I thought I would, but luckily I did not.  </li>
            <li>I used this every night after a shower on my belly from 12 weeks pregnant until the end</li>
            <li>My wife started using this when she was 32 weeks pregnant and started to feel itchy in her belly area.</li>
            <li>I have been recommending it to all my pregnant friends</li>
            <li>luckily it wears off quickly.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews on here right</li>
            <li>It does come off on clothes if you dress right after using it, but after awhile it absorbs into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I LOVED the berts bees belly balm a few years ago when I was pregnant</li>
            <li>w/twins &amp; only have very mild light stretch marks under my belly ;-)</li>
            <li>It is super moisturizing, and stays on very well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit greasy at first but absorbs quickly if you don&#x27;t use too much and rub it in well.</li>
            <li>I used this with my first pregnancy and didn&#x27;t get a stretch mark</li>
            <li>The scent is so light and natural.</li>
            <li>The only redeeming quality is the texture which is luxurious and absorbs into your skin well.</li>
            <li>The first two tore me a part.</li>
            <li>This is my first pregnancy</li>
            <li>However, most people say they don&#x27;t get it until their last weeks of pregnancy.  </li>
            <li>When I first started using this balm, I thought it was greasy.</li>
            <li>This is my first pregnancy</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t absorb light a light lotion, so be careful with your clothes right after applying, but it is not as sticky as say Vasoline.  </li>
            <li>I started off with mother love belly salve, which is similar to this produce, but motherlove has a much fainter smell.  </li>
            <li>Whenever I start to feel my skin getting tight or itchy I use this and it feels better right away.</li>
            <li>I am very prone to stretch marks I already had some</li>
            <li>Much appreciated.  </li>
            <li>but I did not get any stretch marks the whole pregnancy.</li>
            <li>haha  </li>
            <li>For me the biggest issues was easing the discomfort of fast stretching skin &amp; the itchiness.</li>
            <li>You might not like the smell, but it does not stain your clothes and it is very comforting.</li>
            <li>I wanted something natural and I heard so many mixed reviews on everything else</li>
            <li>have added other WiseWays products to my baby registry as I am hoping to try more of their items.</li>
            <li>My multiples pregnancy is making me grow much faster than normal</li>
            <li>The scent IS different, but not bad</li>
            <li>when I found out I was pregnant and started using this every night starting at 6 weeks (also used coconut oil once a day)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 30 weeks pregnant and on my 3rd jar.  </li>
            <li>, currently I am 32 wks pregnant</li>
            <li>As the days pasted, I realized it was the only cream/balm I used to get rid of itchy pregnant belly.</li>
            <li>so I was really worried but so far at 29 weeks, not one!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend purchasing this item ...</li>
            <li>I actually don&#x27;t care for the smell too much, but I used it every day since month 4 and no stretch marks all the way through 9 months!!  </li>
            <li>I am not pregnant but love keeping my soft skin as if I were!</li>
            <li>Smell wasn&#x27;t bad, but wasn&#x27;t the best</li>
            <li>My belly and breast were really staring to get itchy and this has completely gotten rid of that problem.</li>
            <li>I bought a similar product from the honest co. for a similar price and the jar was a third of the size.</li>
            <li>I was sure I was going to get stretch marks at the site of the belly piercing (I had removed it) due to the skin being very taught and tender above the hole.  </li>
            <li>I am currently at 34 weeks and have no stretch marks; this is our first child.</li>
            <li>It was worth the 20 dollars, and one jar goes a long way.</li>
            <li>After using it for the past three months, I have gotten used to the smell and love it.</li>
            <li>At first, I only used it twice a day (morning and night).</li>
            <li>I used this balm throughout my whole pregnancy in 2014 and now again for my second.</li>
            <li>I am only 18 weeks and not showing much</li>
            <li>I used two jars my whole pregnancy and still have some left.</li>
            <li>She applies the balm at night and it has made her skin quite soft.</li>
            <li>Her stomach was incredibly soft and does not have one stretch mark after her delivery.</li>
            <li>it is all natural ingredients, doesn&#x27;t stain your clothing, has a calming smell and leaves your skin feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>This does have natural ingredients, but does have a stronger smell.  </li>
            <li>She is now 8 months along and no stretch marks so far.</li>
            <li>it was frozen, when it defrosted it was half full.  </li>
            <li>The jar really goes a long way</li>
            <li>Despite that it felt and smelled like rubbing crisco all over my big belly every night I would recommend this to other pregnant women trying not to get stretch marks.</li>
            <li>Edit: 30 weeks and not a single stretch mark so far ( I got stretch marks when i gained weight before</li>
            <li>This is a thick oil that has a strong herbal smell.</li>
            <li>Other than that, great product, works wonderfully, no stretch marks on this belly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second jar, and I have no stretch marks so far.</li>
            <li>so far it has helped with dry skin and the smell is soothing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this belly balm for half of my pregnancy and it has really kept my belly moisturized.  </li>
            <li>The mixture of herbs gives this balm an odd scent, but the balm moisturizes really well.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this belly balm for half of my pregnancy and it has really kept my belly moisturized.  </li>
            <li> The mixture of herbs gives this balm an odd scent, but the balm moisturizes really well.</li>
            <li> The balm will last through the day, telling us it&#x27;s moisturizing all day long.</li>
            <li> I used it diligently morning and night for 3 weeks with little to no effect on my stretch marks (existing and new).</li>
            <li> Got very few new marks with third baby.</li>
            <li> The thickness makes it go a long way.</li>
            <li> - you can tell because you stay greasy a long time.</li>
            <li> I am still satisfied with the balm but very disappointed that my jars have been less than full!</li>
            <li> I dropped the jar and broke it half way through my pregnancy, but I salvaged enough to last the rest of the time.</li>
            <li> It smells very different from any other cream or lotion you have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even purchased a little extra of this to use on my arms and legs after delivery since I am having a winter baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 35 weeks and this time no new strecht marks!!</li>
            <li> Also use on my neck area now because it is extremely moisturizing and skin nourishing.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m 7 weeks away from my due date.</li>
            <li> ( i was skeptical at first).</li>
            <li> As my belly started getting itchier (due to it&#x27;s stretching) at about 20 weeks, I started using it 3xs a day.  </li>
            <li> and I found it odd.  </li>
            <li> little too oily to wear it to work.</li>
            <li> My Aunt recommended this product to me after having a 9lb baby w/ little to no stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> Its definitely a little greasy so put aside one or two shirts to sleep in</li>
            <li> I try and use it everyday and would suggest this to anyone.     </li>
            <li> My wife got stretch mark and used it everyday</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure about how it does on stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Also, the balm is liquidy in some parts (not sure why).  </li>
            <li> There is mostly solid balm and then random liquid balm spots.  </li>
            <li> Other belly balms are ridiculously expensive, which brought me to this product.  </li>
            <li> Cocoa butter just smells nasty to me when pregnant, so that wasn&#x27;t an option.  </li>
            <li> It is greasy and smells a little weird</li>
            <li> (I know weird...)  </li>
            <li> Maybe its because it came frozen to me and was a weird texture after???  </li>
            <li> But it was quite expensive $15 for 4 oz.</li>
            <li> But... I think they should post a disclaimer if it can not be frozen to not order it in cold states in winter.</li>
            <li> and my mother has bad stretch marks</li>
            <li> Im afraid I will have it too since it is genetics!</li>
            <li> still got stretch marks :(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Edit: I used this balm throughout my whole pregnancy in 2014 and now again for my second. I am still satisfied with the balm but very disappointed that my jars have been less than full! I never had this problem last time. I buy this product once a month, please fix this problem!   I just had a baby. I read the reviews on here right when I found out I was pregnant and started using this every night starting at 6 weeks (also used coconut oil once a day) I do not have any stretch marks! I am very prone to stretch marks I already had some and my mother has bad stretch marks, so I thought I didn&#x27;t have a chance. Don&#x27;t let people tell you stretch marks are genetic! This stuff worked for me!!</li>
            <li> Thank you for the quick response on the order.  Much appreciated.  Thank you  Emil</li>
            <li> My co-worker referred this to me and she is super conscious of harmful additives in today&#x27;s beauty products; so I knew it would be amazing. But it surpassed my expectations by eradicating itchy legs, elephant skin by it&#x27;s excellent moisturization. I try and use it everyday and would suggest this to anyone.     P.S.  I am not pregnant but love keeping my soft skin as if I were!</li>
            <li> This is a thick oil that has a strong herbal smell. It mostly smells like lavender. The thickness makes it go a long way. I am only 18 weeks and not showing much so I&#x27;m not sure about how it does on stretch marks. There is a lot in the jar! I bought a similar product from the honest co. for a similar price and the jar was a third of the size. I recommend this product. so far it has helped with dry skin and the smell is soothing.  Edit: 30 weeks and not a single stretch mark so far ( I got stretch marks when i gained weight before so I know I am prone to them and I am larger than when I gained and lost weight now). The smell is more smoothing now and doesn&#x27;t seem as strong, my senses must have been heightened during the beginning of pregnancy when i wrote my original review. Whenever I start to feel my skin getting tight or itchy I use this and it feels better right away.</li>
            <li> Used throughout pregnancy. No stretch marks whatsoever. Also use on my neck area now because it is extremely moisturizing and skin nourishing. I dropped 2 jars of these and the jars were fine, caps cracked but a 2 minute call to WiseWays and they&#x27;re sending me replacements! Love the company. Love the product!</li>
            <li> This stuff is fabulous! It works so well and smells great.</li>
            <li> I used this with my first pregnancy and didn&#x27;t get a stretch mark so thought 8 years later I would try it again and you got it no stretch marks again. Now I recommend it to all my friends when they are pregnant. Just be sure you wear a shirt you don&#x27;t care about!</li>
            <li> I was sure I was going to get stretch marks at the site of the belly piercing (I had removed it) due to the skin being very taught and tender above the hole.  I used this about 2 days and the skin there felt fine again.  I was pregnant 42 weeks and used this 2-3 times per day.  My mom had stretch marks, and I thought I would, but luckily I did not.  I am thinking it&#x27;s because of this balm.  It is a bit oily, but I never minded the feel of it and it didn&#x27;t stain my clothes.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this balm. I am currently at 34 weeks and have no stretch marks; this is our first child. My doc even noticed. My husband has been a dear and has put this on my belly, sides, etc. every night before bedtime since we were around 8 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even during two months of all-day nausea I still loved the smell of this. It smells very different from any other cream or lotion you have tried. The scent is so light and natural. I love the ingredient list. I&#x27;ve even purchased a little extra of this to use on my arms and legs after delivery since I am having a winter baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve not had any issues with staining or oiliness getting on my clothes. We only apply it at night time under jammies. I think any residue that gets on clothes has washed away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to any mom who is into simple, uncomplicated ingredients. This balm is the bomb!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have added other WiseWays products to my baby registry as I am hoping to try more of their items.</li>
            <li> I used this every night after a shower on my belly from 12 weeks pregnant until the end ( I had twins and had a huge belly). It is greasy and smells a little weird but I did not get any stretch marks the whole pregnancy. It is super moisturizing, and stays on very well - you can tell because you stay greasy a long time. Despite that it felt and smelled like rubbing crisco all over my big belly every night I would recommend this to other pregnant women trying not to get stretch marks. I used two jars my whole pregnancy and still have some left. It was worth the 20 dollars, and one jar goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I actually don&#x27;t care for the smell too much, but I used it every day since month 4 and no stretch marks all the way through 9 months!!  I&#x27;d like to believe this Belly Balm was the reason why (because I AM a person prone to getting stretch marks).  It is a bit greasy feeling, but I rub it in well at night and haven&#x27;t had an issue with it staining my PJ&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> My wife started using this when she was 32 weeks pregnant and started to feel itchy in her belly area. She applies the balm at night and it has made her skin quite soft. She has been using this ever day for 3 weeks and she loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;The smell takes a bit of getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;A little too oily to wear it to work.</li>
            <li> I started to develop stretch marks at about 16wks into my pregnancy despite trying a bunch of different oils and lotions. Decided to give this a try based on reviews. I used it diligently morning and night for 3 weeks with little to no effect on my stretch marks (existing and new). The smell is very strong and was not for me (or hubby who would often ask what &amp;#34;that smell was&amp;#34; after I used it). The only redeeming quality is the texture which is luxurious and absorbs into your skin well.</li>
            <li> I really love this balm.  I&#x27;m 30 weeks pregnant and on my 3rd jar.  It helps with my itchy belly and it leaves it moisturized for hours.  I&#x27;ve been complimented by friends and family on how soft and beautiful my bump is.</li>
            <li> uses it every day, had to buy another bottle before she ran out and start to complain. cant wait til the baby arrives</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this belly balm for half of my pregnancy and it has really kept my belly moisturized.  It smells great and goes on smoothly and it easy to apply.  My only gripe is that it&#x27;s greasy and takes a while to soak in.  Also, the balm is liquidy in some parts (not sure why).  There is mostly solid balm and then random liquid balm spots.  Other than that, great product, works wonderfully, no stretch marks on this belly and I&#x27;m 7 weeks away from my due date.</li>
            <li> Shipment came quickly and I love the scent during my pregnancy as well as how easily it smooths on. I haven&#x27;t gotten any stretch marks yet but I have not had the baby yet.</li>
            <li> Used this throughout my entire pregnancy and didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks.  I love the consistency of it but the smell can bother some, like my husband. haha  I have been recommending it to all my pregnant friends</li>
            <li> Got very few new marks with third baby. The first two tore me a part. I wish I could have had this from the start.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product. I&#x27;m on my second jar &amp; nothing works as well for an itchy pregnancy belly. My multiples pregnancy is making me grow much faster than normal and this product soothes the itchiness and softens the skin. The jar really goes a long way ( i was skeptical at first). I use it 2-3 times/day and to date no stretch marks. For me the biggest issues was easing the discomfort of fast stretching skin &amp; the itchiness. This product addresses both.</li>
            <li> This is my first pregnancy and I was unsure of what sort of belly balm to use to keep stretch marks at bay. I started with cocoa butter, and moved along to a stretch mark oil, but once I found this belly balm, I stuck with it because it&#x27;s phenomenal. After using it for the past three months, I have gotten used to the smell and love it. It does come off on clothes if you dress right after using it, but after awhile it absorbs into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> My Aunt recommended this product to me after having a 9lb baby w/ little to no stretch marks.  It soothes my itchy belly, currently I am 32 wks pregnant w/twins &amp; only have very mild light stretch marks under my belly ;-)</li>
            <li> Really liked this for my pregnant belly!! Smell wasn&#x27;t bad, but wasn&#x27;t the best luckily it wears off quickly.</li>
            <li> I have been faithfully putting this on my belly/body once a day before bed since about 20 weeks.  I am 40 weeks now and have zero stretchmarks.  The doctor told me it was a lost cause because my mother has stretchmarks and its hereditary.  I still stuck with it and proved her wrong :-) Its definitely a little greasy so put aside one or two shirts to sleep in that you wont mind ruining but trust me, its worth it!</li>
            <li> Cocoa butter just smells nasty to me when pregnant, so that wasn&#x27;t an option.  Other belly balms are ridiculously expensive, which brought me to this product.  Under $20 and a light scent.  The scent IS different, but not bad...calming actually. It doesn&#x27;t absorb light a light lotion, so be careful with your clothes right after applying, but it is not as sticky as say Vasoline.  I dropped the jar and broke it half way through my pregnancy, but I salvaged enough to last the rest of the time. No additives/artificial anything is a HUGE bonus.  I will buy this for my next pregnancy! Gets one of my rare 5 star ratings!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughters pregnancy. She loved it.  Her stomach was incredibly soft and does not have one stretch mark after her delivery.</li>
            <li> The mixture of herbs gives this balm an odd scent, but the balm moisturizes really well. I&#x27;ve used it through two pregnancies, and my skin has been comfortable and smooth. It&#x27;s a bit greasy at first but absorbs quickly if you don&#x27;t use too much and rub it in well. I liked it so much I bought a jar for my cousin for her first pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I found this product oily, and it made my skin feel sorta -fleshy- (I know weird...)  It smelled like plastic and when I got it through the mail it was frozen, when it defrosted it was half full.  I LOVED the berts bees belly balm a few years ago when I was pregnant but they discontinued that, people were online posting that this was similar and I found it odd.  Maybe its because it came frozen to me and was a weird texture after???  But... I think they should post a disclaimer if it can not be frozen to not order it in cold states in winter.</li>
            <li> Best belly balm on the market! Highly recommend purchasing this item ...it is all natural ingredients, doesn&#x27;t stain your clothing, has a calming smell and leaves your skin feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> My mom said she got stretch marks, so Im afraid I will have it too since it is genetics! I started using something on my belly at 15 weeks. I started off with mother love belly salve, which is similar to this produce, but motherlove has a much fainter smell.  But it was quite expensive $15 for 4 oz. So I decided to give this one a try $20 for 8 oz. This one seems greasier, but I do not mind it.  This does have natural ingredients, but does have a stronger smell.  I feel like this one stays on my belly longer!  At first, I only used it twice a day (morning and night). As my belly started getting itchier (due to it&#x27;s stretching) at about 20 weeks, I started using it 3xs a day.  I am now almost 32 weeks and haven&#x27;t had any reactions or stretch marks.  However, most people say they don&#x27;t get it until their last weeks of pregnancy.  So I will definitely have to update on whether or not I get stretch marks in the end.  If I don&#x27;t update, then you can assume that I had none!</li>
            <li> awesome product love that its all natural.</li>
            <li> This is my sixth pregnancy. I&#x27;ve tried everything before. Nothing seems to work, if you&#x27;re gonna get strecht marks there&#x27;s nothing you can do. But this product is really good. I&#x27;m 35 weeks and this time no new strecht marks!! You might not like the smell, but it does not stain your clothes and it is very comforting.</li>
            <li> When I first started using this balm, I thought it was greasy. As the days pasted, I realized it was the only cream/balm I used to get rid of itchy pregnant belly. I&#x27;ve gotten used to how much to apply, and it goes on everyday. I love it! I&#x27;m on my second jar, and I have no stretch marks so far. I&#x27;m 7 months along. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other creams, and this is the best for the price.</li>
            <li> We have been using this balm since my wife started showing. She is now 8 months along and no stretch marks so far. The balm will last through the day, telling us it&#x27;s moisturizing all day long. A great way to go to prevent stretch marks, in our opinion.</li>
            <li> I wanted something natural and I heard so many mixed reviews on everything else so I decided to try it! It is a bit pricey but in my opinion totally worth it! It is oily when applied but I have yet to have it ruin any of my clothing and I put it on while my skin is still warm after my shower every day! The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me at all, I find it almost calming. This is my first pregnancy and my mom had tons of stretch marks so I was really worried but so far at 29 weeks, not one! I will have to update after delivery! I already recommend this product to all of my friends!</li>
            <li> still got stretch marks :(</li>
            <li> This is a must have for all pregnant mommies! My sister , myself and any friend that&#x27;s ever used it from the beginning of my pregnancy has never ever gotten one stretch mark!</li>
            <li> My wife got stretch mark and used it everyday</li>
            <li> I bought this product to help keep my body moist as it grows. My belly and breast were really staring to get itchy and this has completely gotten rid of that problem. I am 23 weeks and have been using it since 15 and will continue to use it. Excellent all natural balm for your skin</li>
