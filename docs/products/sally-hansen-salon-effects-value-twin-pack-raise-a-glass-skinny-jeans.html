            <li>They also emailed me and called me to make sure I was satisfied with the transaction.</li>
            <li>Because if this experience, I won&#x27;t buy any more Sally Hansen products through Amazon.</li>

            <li>Fast delivery and great product.</li>

            <li>Love everything about it, i even did my toes with them.</li>
            <li>But i still love them, saves alot of nail polish applying time</li>
            <li>The Skinny Jeans look just like jeans, I received many compliments.</li>
            <li>I love these for my nails.  </li>
            <li>I will be getting more for sure.</li>
            <li>and they are SO super cute!</li>
            <li>These salon effects are perfect for a quick manicure and pedicure, very simple and easy to do and they work great for anyone who wants to do their nails for any event.</li>
            <li>It not only ripped but it was incredibly sticky.</li>
            <li>Takes a bit of practice to master application but lots of cute designs available.  </li>
            <li>These nail polish stickers are the easy way to change nail color in a jiffy.</li>
            <li>Easily remedied once they&#x27;re in place though, as the polish doesn&#x27;t adhere to your skin the way it does to the nail.</li>
            <li>They are easy to apply and shape.  </li>
            <li>Raise a glass applied easily and wore well.  </li>
            <li>easy to remove.</li>
            <li>my new favorite!</li>
            <li>They promptly fulfilled the original order, plus they let me keep the one that I received in error.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this, but didn&#x27;t realize the amount of time involved.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be a fairly straightforward process, but it was not.</li>
            <li>I am a perfectionist and wanted them to look as near to perfect as possible.</li>
            <li>I think they are great if you can get a good deal on them because then if you do get a dud box (perhaps a box that sat in back stock for too long, or something like that)</li>
            <li>Those lasted almost the full 10 days.  </li>
            <li>The &#x27;Raise a Glass&#x27; color is simply stunning, very chic.  </li>
            <li>They all ask me where I get all of my cool colors and how I can afford them....</li>
            <li>wear if initial application is good.  </li>
            <li>The other jean pattern wasn&#x27;t so great.</li>
            <li>The Raise a glass was very nice--a light gold.  </li>
            <li>I really cannot think of any reason why these would be better or more convenient than regular, old-fashioned nail polish.</li>
            <li>Sometimes Salon Effects nails go on smoothly and stay on for nearly two weeks (sometimes longer) and look fabulous and snag compliments and all that jazz.  </li>
            <li>And the jeans design looks pretty cool</li>
            <li>They last pretty long and my friends are always impressed with the details in them.</li>
            <li>Then they didnt look right.</li>
            <li>I used the black sally hansen nail strips with sparkles and loved them.  </li>
            <li>They did not work at all, they ripped the first time I tried to remove them from their sticky backing and if they didn&#x27;t they just wouldn&#x27;t stick to my nail.</li>
            <li>Bought this in hopes of having pretty nails without the salon.</li>
            <li>It took me over 5 min to get the first nail on then</li>
            <li>The Gold is actually metallic, and the denim is really cute.</li>
            <li>None of the stickers were small enough for my pinky nails (and I don&#x27;t exactly have dainty nails).  </li>
            <li>This product is so easy to apply and it really can last up to 10 days.</li>
            <li>one kept ripping when I gently peeled it off the backing.</li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t complain about the price and how fast it shipped.</li>
            <li>looks very unattractive where you file off the excess.</li>
            <li>So much cheaper on Amazon then at the drug store.</li>
            <li>I had to fiddle around a little to make sure everything was straight, but there weren&#x27;t any surprises and it lasted for quite some time.</li>
            <li>I am usually very good with directions, but awful at painting my own nails.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because there are 2 layers, the white bottom layer and the blue denim design on top that maybe didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>These are cute, easy to apply and last for at least a week!</li>
            <li>I had some strips left from the first application</li>
            <li>I will say this: my mother is a frequent user of this product and has had more hits than misses, but those few bad boxes greatly discouraged her from continuing to purchase them.  </li>
            <li>Strips either tore or would not come of backing strips at all prompting me to believe the product was old.  </li>
            <li>When I opened these I was surprised to find that they were not sticky when you peeled off the backing</li>
            <li>The denim nails, however, do not peel off the strips easily or completely, leaving part of the polish on the backing.  </li>
            <li>More expensive, but worth the money.</li>
            <li>They do stay on pretty good without chipping too badly though.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I noticed is that some of the strips didn&#x27;t fit my nails, however I have small nail beds</li>
            <li>Mine last frequently for 7, but I&#x27;m in the pool a lot.  </li>
            <li>However, raise a glass has not lasted anywhere near as long.  </li>
            <li>I went to use the first on it was dried out...</li>

            <li> I went to use the first on it was dried out...</li>
            <li> and it won&#x27;t be just one random one, it will be the whole box that has a tearing problem) and then they start peeling almost right away.  </li>
            <li> But be aware, some of them do seem a little wide.</li>
            <li> so i put them back inside the box and wanted to use them again, but when i opened it back, all the strips have gone dry</li>
            <li> You mean I don&#x27;t have to spend so much time painting my nails, but can instead just stick on these fancy stickers and be on my way?  </li>
            <li> They also don&#x27;t tear easily at the nail tip, ripping part of the polish off of the nail, leaving them looking sloppy and messy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve done other colors and did not encounter the same issues as I did with the skinny jean set.</li>
            <li> The Other color same thing both packages..</li>
            <li> they stay on for a very long time.</li>
            <li> It takes about 10 minutes and your nails are already dry.</li>
            <li> These strips are already dry, so the minute you&#x27;re finished you can move on to other things.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I spent money on these.</li>
            <li> It is just as expected.  </li>
            <li> The goldish/neutral color went on my nail as expected.</li>
            <li> This is the only pattern that I have had trouble with</li>
            <li> Skinny jeans tore when removing due to sticking to the edge of the backing.</li>
            <li> about 4 to get EACH other one on.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t adhere well to nail and began peeling within less than 24 hours.</li>
            <li> that you can buy them here for a lot less than what you would pay at a store.</li>
            <li> so I had to use nail polish remover and a little bit of elbow grease.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of time and money.  </li>
            <li> dried out as well.</li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> When they rip, it leaves white strips where it ripped, and looks even worse.  </li>
            <li> It was NOT easy, but eventually I ended up with half-decent-looking nails (from a distance).  </li>
            <li> I received an incomplete product where some of the nail polish strips were missing as well as all the placement sticks and both small files.  </li>
            <li> but I get bored and want to try the next design.</li>
            <li> I hate waiting for nail polish to dry and inevitably end up nicking or chipping it because I get impatient.</li>
            <li> I tried to scrape the polish off but it was near impossible</li>
            <li> I have slowly converted into using these all of the time.</li>
            <li> They were very hard to get on.  </li>
            <li> The quality of these nail strips is poor.</li>
            <li> They are thin and do not go on well.</li>
            <li> But, what I got from  LookofBeauty was a bad product that wouldn&#x27;t adhere due to the age of the product, so how these colors look, I can&#x27;t say as  </li>
            <li> It took me AT LEAST a half an hour to get these stupid things on my fingernails.  </li>
            <li> I got the wrong color in my shipment, so I emailed them and asked about it.</li>
            <li> They look really fake.  </li>
            <li> I wish they were easier to put on and weren&#x27;t so expensive.  </li>
            <li> Consider the seller&#x27;s integrity for sending bad product and non-responsiveness, just not good practice at all.</li>
            <li> These stickers where the biggest disappointment I have ever ordered from Amazon.</li>
            <li> WRONG!  </li>
            <li> sally hansen nail strips are bad.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed with these nail strips...</li>
            <li> (:(</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate the product, I am beyond disappointed in the seller Treasure Hunt.  </li>
            <li> I hate putting on nail polish.  </li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> After spending 45 minutes putting it on, I couldn&#x27;t stand how awful it appeared to me.</li>
            <li> The cost isn&#x27;t horrible, but basically it is for one time use.  </li>

            <li> I bought this product because it was a great price! I haven&#x27;t had any problems with receiving the product or ordering.  I will continue buying.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a great idea!  You mean I don&#x27;t have to spend so much time painting my nails, but can instead just stick on these fancy stickers and be on my way?  WRONG!  It took me AT LEAST a half an hour to get these stupid things on my fingernails.  They come with sixteen stickers of each color.  None of the stickers were small enough for my pinky nails (and I don&#x27;t exactly have dainty nails).  I followed the instructions and tried my best to trim and fit the stickers on my nails.  It was NOT easy, but eventually I ended up with half-decent-looking nails (from a distance).  And, by the way, they still smell like nail polish.  After an hour or two, two of my nails were already wrinkled-looking, so I just peeled it all off.  I really cannot think of any reason why these would be better or more convenient than regular, old-fashioned nail polish.</li>
            <li> Sometimes Salon Effects nails go on smoothly and stay on for nearly two weeks (sometimes longer) and look fabulous and snag compliments and all that jazz.  Sometimes they tear when applied (and it won&#x27;t be just one random one, it will be the whole box that has a tearing problem) and then they start peeling almost right away.  It depends entirely on the box.  I will say this: my mother is a frequent user of this product and has had more hits than misses, but those few bad boxes greatly discouraged her from continuing to purchase them.  I think they are great if you can get a good deal on them because then if you do get a dud box (perhaps a box that sat in back stock for too long, or something like that) then it&#x27;s not such a financial loss.</li>
            <li> The gold color was just not my thing but the skinny jean one kept ripping when I gently peeled it off the backing. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because there are 2 layers, the white bottom layer and the blue denim design on top that maybe didn&#x27;t help. It not only ripped but it was incredibly sticky. It kept sticking to my skin and was a pain to take off, even with 100% acetone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve done other colors and did not encounter the same issues as I did with the skinny jean set.</li>
            <li> These nail polish stickers are the easy way to change nail color in a jiffy. It takes about 10 minutes and your nails are already dry. The greatest invention since the light bulb.</li>
            <li> The ease of use alone warrants five stars. I hate waiting for nail polish to dry and inevitably end up nicking or chipping it because I get impatient. These strips are already dry, so the minute you&#x27;re finished you can move on to other things. The only thing I noticed is that some of the strips didn&#x27;t fit my nails, however I have small nail beds so I don&#x27;t think that would be a problem for most people. But be aware, some of them do seem a little wide. Easily remedied once they&#x27;re in place though, as the polish doesn&#x27;t adhere to your skin the way it does to the nail. So you can simply peel or pick it off without damaging the part that&#x27;s attached to your nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed that while I&#x27;m wearing the strips my nails grow out a lot stronger. I was having problems with peeling, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any since using these strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I received great customer service from the seller of the item. I got the wrong color in my shipment, so I emailed them and asked about it. They promptly fulfilled the original order, plus they let me keep the one that I received in error. They also emailed me and called me to make sure I was satisfied with the transaction. I will definitely order from them again.</li>
            <li> Strips either tore or would not come of backing strips at all prompting me to believe the product was old.  This was a waste of time and money.  Because if this experience, I won&#x27;t buy any more Sally Hansen products through Amazon.</li>
            <li> These stickers where the biggest disappointment I have ever ordered from Amazon. They did not work at all, they ripped the first time I tried to remove them from their sticky backing and if they didn&#x27;t they just wouldn&#x27;t stick to my nail. Horrible.</li>
            <li> I use these often...so I know a rip off when I see it.  I went to use the first on it was dried out...hmmm.  Second one same thing the entire package was like that.  So I open the second package (each box comes w/ 2 pack in it) dried out as well. The Other color same thing both packages.. I will buy from Walgreens from now on.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts about these nail polish press on tabs, but these work great!  They are easy to apply and shape.  I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> Raise a glass applied easily and wore well.  Skinny jeans tore when removing due to sticking to the edge of the backing. White backing shows through denim pattern when using orange stick to apply.  Didn&#x27;t adhere well to nail and began peeling within less than 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Great price and they are SO super cute! I love this product and I love decorating my fingers and toes with these! Wore the neutral color on my wedding day :)</li>
            <li> I have a dilemma here in how to rate this one. I know that the Sally Hansen strips are good. But, what I got from  LookofBeauty was a bad product that wouldn&#x27;t adhere due to the age of the product, so how these colors look, I can&#x27;t say as  I couldn&#x27;t get them off the backing paper.</li>
            <li> Just started doing my own nails and love this easy process of putting them on and not waiting for drying time.</li>
            <li> Never ever buy this product. When I opened these I was surprised to find that they were not sticky when you peeled off the backing and they ripped very very easily. If you want to buy nail strips buy them from China Glaze. I think they work ugh better.</li>
            <li> These fell apart before I could even apply them. They were sticky/tacky and did not come off of the plastic as they should have. I can&#x27;t believe I spent money on these. I though I was getting a good deal since they are $12-15 in stores. I should have just saved my money. What a waste.</li>
            <li> I am usually very good with directions, but awful at painting my own nails. Bought this in hopes of having pretty nails without the salon. Then fought with this product attempting to apply them. I am a perfectionist and wanted them to look as near to perfect as possible. In the end I couldn&#x27;t make that happen.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and great product. The same drugstore quality. It stayed on my nails it looks amazing. Stayed on for about 7 days</li>
            <li> I love these! I hate putting on nail polish.  A day later and I have chips galore, no matter what brand or how expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have done the gel, but they take forever and removal is a pain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have finally found my answer.  These are cute, easy to apply and last for at least a week! probably more but I get bored and want to try the next design.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t the seller&#x27;s, but the Skinny Jeans sally hansen nail strips are bad.  They look really fake.  They started ripping when I tried to put them on.  When they rip, it leaves white strips where it ripped, and looks even worse.  The Raise a glass was very nice--a light gold.  I used the black sally hansen nail strips with sparkles and loved them.  Those lasted almost the full 10 days.  However, raise a glass has not lasted anywhere near as long.  I am disappointed with these nail strips...</li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t complain about the price and how fast it shipped. The only issue I had was with the denim was that is looks very unattractive where you file off the excess. It turns white and looks like its been worn for days.</li>
            <li> I bought these , love the patterns and colors, its comes in 2 mini packs/ box.. Love everything about it, i even did my toes with them. I had some strips left from the first application so i put them back inside the box and wanted to use them again, but when i opened it back, all the strips have gone dry and it doesn&#x27;t work anymore,,,, I would have given it a 5 star if it wasn&#x27;t for the drying of the rest of the strips, so if you open one either you use it till the last bit or throw the remaining away.... But i still love them, saves alot of nail polish applying time</li>
            <li> It is just as expected.  It arrived on time.  It is a very good quality and we are happy with it.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this, but didn&#x27;t realize the amount of time involved. I prepped my fingernails according to the package, but the strips will not stick to my fingernails. After an hour of frustration I gave up. I thought this would be a fairly straightforward process, but it was not. Sticking to regular fingernail polish!</li>
            <li> The goldish/neutral color went on my nail as expected. I had to fiddle around a little to make sure everything was straight, but there weren&#x27;t any surprises and it lasted for quite some time. The other jean pattern wasn&#x27;t so great. It was stuck to the paper and plastic and kept immediately lumping up when I tried putting it on my nail. After spending 45 minutes putting it on, I couldn&#x27;t stand how awful it appeared to me. I tried to scrape the polish off but it was near impossible so I had to use nail polish remover and a little bit of elbow grease. If I could, I would only buy the gold/neutral color.</li>
            <li> I have been a long-time fan of this product.  The denim nails, however, do not peel off the strips easily or completely, leaving part of the polish on the backing.  They also don&#x27;t tear easily at the nail tip, ripping part of the polish off of the nail, leaving them looking sloppy and messy.  This is the only pattern that I have had trouble with but I will not use the denim design again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate the product, I am beyond disappointed in the seller Treasure Hunt.  I received an incomplete product where some of the nail polish strips were missing as well as all the placement sticks and both small files.  I wrote to them request a return/replacement on 10/30/13, now over a year later nothing.... no response .... nada.  Oh well, this is a loss.  Consider the seller&#x27;s integrity for sending bad product and non-responsiveness, just not good practice at all. :(:(</li>
            <li> These did not stick to my fingers at all.  I thought I had them stuck and started to fix dinner and they just peeled off.  They didn&#x27;t peel in strips the entire thing pulled off.  They were very hard to get on.  I would never buy them again.</li>
            <li> I like these.  I wish they were easier to put on and weren&#x27;t so expensive.  The cost isn&#x27;t horrible, but basically it is for one time use.  Like buying a bottle of nail polish and throwing the bottle away after you paint your nails one time with it.  They do stay on pretty good without chipping too badly though.  So that counts for something.  And the jeans design looks pretty cool</li>
            <li> The quality of these nail strips is poor. They are thin and do not go on well. They do not look like a manicure once on. The Sephora by OPI nail strips are the best. More expensive, but worth the money.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;Raise a Glass&#x27; color is simply stunning, very chic.  The Skinny Jeans look just like jeans, I received many compliments.</li>
            <li> love these! they work so well! they stay on for a very long time. loo great! easy to remove. my new favorite!</li>
            <li> It took me over 5 min to get the first nail on then about 4 to get EACH other one on. Then they didnt look right. For the price and the effort to put on I can get 2 things of nail polish.</li>
            <li> I love these for my nails.  Great colors and they stay on forever! So much cheaper on Amazon then at the drug store. I will be getting more for sure.</li>
            <li> I have slowly converted into using these all of the time. I tried it once on a trial at CVS and have been hook ever since. They last pretty long and my friends are always impressed with the details in them. They all ask me where I get all of my cool colors and how I can afford them....AMAZON!!</li>
            <li> The Gold is actually metallic, and the denim is really cute. This product is so easy to apply and it really can last up to 10 days. Mine last frequently for 7, but I&#x27;m in the pool a lot.  I always get compliments about my nails when I use these products. Love it!</li>
            <li> Great product and even more great that you can buy them here for a lot less than what you would pay at a store.</li>
            <li> These salon effects are perfect for a quick manicure and pedicure, very simple and easy to do and they work great for anyone who wants to do their nails for any event.</li>
            <li> Takes a bit of practice to master application but lots of cute designs available.  Can get up to two weeks wear if initial application is good.  Not a big fan of these colors.</li>
