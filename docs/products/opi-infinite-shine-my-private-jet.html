            <li>You will love it and it will make you feel good just looking at your hands (or toes) with it on.</li>
            <li>This color is awesome, it is a mix between purple and gold when it gets in the light, super excited to use it!</li>
            <li>I received many compliments on this color, and I plan to use it regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>I love the way it has an iridescent sheen.</li>
            <li>It takes many coats to make the nail look not see through.  </li>
            <li>The packaging was great, and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Love the</li>
            <li>Love the color</li>
            <li>It came in the mail yesterday, and I have to say that I am well pleased.</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that this nail color dries quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>nail polish is my all time favorite color.</li>
            <li>Opi is my all time favorite brand of nail polish.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received many compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li>She was really pleased with how well it matched.</li>
            <li>I put it on as soon as I got it and have received so many compliments on it.  </li>
            <li>OPI&#x27;s nail colors are usually pretty good.</li>
            <li>I have always had good luck when wearing OPI, so it lasts around 7 days on without much wear.  </li>
            <li>This is a cool color!</li>
            <li>I agree with others that wrote that this can almost be a neutral, it is bright, but when you turn your head (or hand) the color changes to a lighter bright pink.</li>
            <li>I applied two coats and found that to be adequate for me!</li>
            <li>so I searched all over town to find the bottle and found it for super cheap here on Amazon!</li>
            <li>Depending on the light, it looks gold, pink-ish or purple.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and with two coats stays put.</li>
            <li>It is a good color; I got lots of comments on it when I wore it last week.</li>
            <li>not ugly its just not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on very smoothly, and is full of vibrant sparkle.</li>
            <li>Simply put: it&#x27;s a pretty, feminine color and a nice pick-me-up!</li>
            <li>My Year is my new favorite nail</li>
            <li>I first saw this color here on Amazon.com and placed it on my Wish List because, thought that it would be a unique color for my nails.</li>
            <li>This color is interesting and looks different depending on how the light hits it.</li>
            <li>Great for everyday use!</li>
            <li>It takes several coats to get it opaque, but it lasts a long time and is beautiful.</li>
            <li>and my mom keeps stealing it from me ;)</li>
            <li>so pretty everytime</li>
            <li>This product ooks exactly like the coat from the salon.  </li>
            <li>This color is in the pinks, but on the nail it looks like a pinky/purple mauve, but the fine gold/bronze glitter is a major part of how it hits the eye.  </li>
            <li>and I chose this same color because I love it so much.</li>
            <li>I think this color is so pretty and very feminine.</li>
            <li>: This is very much like Serena Willams&#x27; \\&quot;Rally Pretty in Pink\\&quot; except that \\&quot;It&#x27;s my Year\\&quot; is slightly more mauve/purple and less gold.</li>
            <li>I really like the shades of gold and purple.</li>
            <li>Get pumped to ring in the new year!</li>
            <li>This color comes off easily with acetone or nail polish remover but holds up well (minimal chipping).</li>
            <li>Removal was pretty standard; the sparkle in it is less like glitter and more like shine.</li>
            <li>Local selection is limited; ergo web access is appealing.</li>
            <li>Not as purple as the picture of the bottle, but the picture above of the color on the nails is exactly how it looked on my nails.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s a unique color that you don&#x27;t see everyday.</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this color when I went to get a pedicure a few months ago.</li>

            <li> I love this polish! It takes several coats to get it opaque, but it lasts a long time and is beautiful.</li>
            <li> Opi It&#x27;s My Year is my new favorite nail polish!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on very smoothly, and is full of vibrant sparkle. Depending on the light, it looks gold, pink-ish or purple. I applied two coats and found that to be adequate for me! (I prefer a lighter look on my nails.) I received many compliments on this color, and I plan to use it regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step into the sunshine, and be prepared to be dazzled! :D</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this color when I went to get a pedicure a few months ago. I think this color is so pretty and very feminine. I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on it. I just went back to get a manicure and I got my pedicure redone and I chose this same color because I love it so much. If you like sparkly and feminine colors then you&#x27;ll love this color!</li>
            <li> This is a cool color! I love the way it has an iridescent sheen.</li>
            <li> It takes many coats to make the nail look not see through.  I am a pageant girl and I feel confident when I wear this on my toes!  Beautiful color, changes from gold to purple in the sun!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen anything like this color.  I have always had good luck when wearing OPI, so it lasts around 7 days on without much wear.  The packaging was great, and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Love the It&#x27;s My Year color! It&#x27;s purple with gold in it. I went to a salon and got a manicure so I searched all over town to find the bottle and found it for super cheap here on Amazon! Love the color and my mom keeps stealing it from me ;)</li>
            <li> I bought this color because my coworker got a manicure and loved it! I really like the shades of gold and purple. OPI is the best!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite color! I paint my toes this color almost every time. This was also the color my best friend used for her wedding. It was gorgeous!</li>
            <li> This color is in the pinks, but on the nail it looks like a pinky/purple mauve, but the fine gold/bronze glitter is a major part of how it hits the eye.  Great look!</li>
            <li> I had to give a review for this nail color. I first saw this color here on Amazon.com and placed it on my Wish List because, thought that it would be a unique color for my nails. OPI&#x27;s nail colors are usually pretty good. Anyways, I finally decided to order it last week, and was curious about what it was going to look like. It came in the mail yesterday, and I have to say that I am well pleased. So beautiful! It has a pinkish/purple base color with a top note of shimmering gold. I love it! So feminine, and so pretty----in just one coat! I used two coats because I wanted the color to be richer. Three coats would do well also. I also love the fact that this nail color dries quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, anyone out there that is curious about this color, just get it. You will love it and it will make you feel good just looking at your hands (or toes) with it on. It did for me. Simply put: it&#x27;s a pretty, feminine color and a nice pick-me-up!</li>
            <li> \\&quot;It&#x27;s my Year\\&quot; (pinkish sparkle with gold undertone): This is very much like Serena Willams&#x27; \\&quot;Rally Pretty in Pink\\&quot; except that \\&quot;It&#x27;s my Year\\&quot; is slightly more mauve/purple and less gold. It is a good color; I got lots of comments on it when I wore it last week. Removal was pretty standard; the sparkle in it is less like glitter and more like shine. It definitely appears to change color as your hands move.</li>
            <li> Love this color!  I feel so pretty everytime I wear it.  Its not really purple but not really pink.  Great for everyday use!</li>
            <li> I thought it would look like the galaxy design I&#x27;ve been looking for but it isn&#x27;t. not ugly its just not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> OPI it&#x27;s my year nail polish is my all time favorite color. Goes on smooth and with two coats stays put. I put my nails through a lot of abuse and OPI nail polish stays on.</li>
            <li> Opi is my all time favorite brand of nail polish. It&#x27;s the only brand I&#x27;ve ever found that doesn&#x27;t chip immediately. This color is interesting and looks different depending on how the light hits it. I&#x27;ve received many compliments when I wear it. And it&#x27;s a unique color that you don&#x27;t see everyday.</li>
            <li> Lovely colour, perfect! Thank you.</li>
            <li> LOVE this color! &amp;#34;It&#x27;s My Year&amp;#34; is an awesome name as well. Get pumped to ring in the new year!</li>
            <li> Wonderful polish to use if you like purple.</li>
            <li> This was a perfect match for her outfit.  She was really pleased with how well it matched.</li>
            <li> This product ooks exactly like the coat from the salon.  I love this color!  Goes with everything and every other color.</li>
            <li> I agree with others that wrote that this can almost be a neutral, it is bright, but when you turn your head (or hand) the color changes to a lighter bright pink. I am really happy with this shade and am glad I bought it!!</li>
            <li> I love love this color!! has a Nice shine to it!! It goes on well and did not chip or peel!Great quality product</li>
            <li> This color is great.  Not as purple as the picture of the bottle, but the picture above of the color on the nails is exactly how it looked on my nails.  The color is almost mauve with a gold shine.  I put it on as soon as I got it and have received so many compliments on it.  I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Beautiful color, nice and shiny, wears well.  Makes a great addition to anyone&#x27;s polish collection!</li>
            <li> This color is awesome, it is a mix between purple and gold when it gets in the light, super excited to use it!</li>
            <li> I had been lusting after this color for months and finally broke down and bought it. It has a gorgeous duo-chrome of gold and purple. While it has sparkle, it&#x27;s not a chunky glitter. This color comes off easily with acetone or nail polish remover but holds up well (minimal chipping). I could not take my eyes off of my nails when I had this color on; I received lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> Love OPI! Selection is great and polish doesn&#x27;t chip or peel. Local selection is limited; ergo web access is appealing.</li>
