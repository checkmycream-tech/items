            <li>I strongly recommended!</li>
            <li>, it arrived fast and the roller is designed beautifully.</li>
            <li>but I was looking for something more for my skin.</li>
            <li>Am happy w/ micro needle ready for another one</li>
            <li>my skin now has a healthy  glow to it and&lt;br</li>
            <li>love this microdermabrasion roller</li>
            <li>This company really makes sure the customer is happy regardless if they lose money.</li>
            <li>Plus the second roller is perfect and I started rolling today.</li>
            <li>I think the stamper penetrates better and gives more control.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>advice out there about how many times per week you should use the rollers run the gamut from every day to once a month.  </li>
            <li>Now my skin glows and looks radiantly healthy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It arrived at my door FAST, and in great condition.</li>
            <li>the Aesthetic Stuff roller does that and more-</li>
            <li>This is a most have beauty product.</li>
            <li>Love this derma roller.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many skin products on the market.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finding more videos on YouTube about rollers from shows like The Doctors and Rachel Ray, I felt more comfortable and bought a roller for myself and my daughter.  </li>
            <li>It comes with its own case and is super easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and I&#x27;m beginning to see results.  </li>
            <li>Great product, it sure opens up my pores before face wash, removing every single dirt underneath my skin , my skin is sure glowing...</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed diminished fine lines.</li>
            <li>I  started to notice that it is helping with my fine lines .</li>
            <li>it has helped with scars and fine lines.  </li>
            <li>Cool concept, amazingly simple, good quality and affordable!</li>
            <li>but I am seeing great results in just the short time I&#x27;ve used it</li>
            <li>I use Egyptian Magic Cream (or a Vitamin E Serum) to &#x27;calm&#x27; my skin after the process.</li>
            <li>Looking forward to fabulous skin.  </li>
            <li>Buy a cheap $5 roller from China and save $</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to read how to use it.  </li>
            <li>I am glad that the Aesthetic Stuff product is comfortable on my face and can already notice a smooth  and fresh skin generating on my face.</li>
            <li>It started to smooth out my scars and blemishes with ease and a comfortable process.  </li>
            <li>I watched so many videos produced by everyday women who had used the rollers and although it seemed safe, I was still nervous to try rolling needles over my own face!  </li>
            <li>but what do you expect with a roller full of needles going into your skin?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The seller contacted me right away, refunded my money, and sent me a replacement free of charge.</li>
            <li>Arrived quick.</li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I saw visible results quickly.  </li>
            <li>I received the roller quickly.  </li>
            <li>I am 100% satisfied with my new roller.</li>
            <li>I have a pretty good daily beauty regimen</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and most products</li>
            <li>but if you want to smooth out your skin and wrinkles it really works.  </li>
            <li>Thank you Ana for introducing me to an amazing yet simple revolution in skin care!!</li>
            <li>I do it with fresh aloe vera and 5.5ph toning water.  </li>
            <li>and she sends lots of information to guarantee your success in using a derma roller.  </li>
            <li>All you need is the right products.  </li>
            <li>The needles are very sharp, rolls smoothly, and has a nice handle.</li>
            <li>sure after a few weeks I will have even more things to say,  MJ</li>
            <li>this product helps my moisturizer penetrate quickly, &amp; hydrate my skin very well.</li>
            <li>This roller works fine, came packaged well, and so far no needles falling out.</li>
            <li>I already have pretty good skin, but having a job that takes up a lot of my time can leave me with little time for beauty care.</li>
            <li>Glad these rating are made by people who actually use the product.</li>
            <li>So I had to return the first one because of bent needles.</li>
            <li>Plus you can&#x27;t use a roller around the nose area and it&#x27;s difficult to use under the eye area (so the stamper is best for these areas.</li>
            <li>my skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The .5 mm doesn&#x27;t not hurt but it&#x27;s more tolerable than the larger needles.  </li>
            <li>But, everyone is different and someone else may have better luck.</li>
            <li>I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;Within a few days of using it before bed</li>
            <li>I also tried this on a raised  scar and it seems to have become more flat because of use.  </li>
            <li>I saw the needles on this thing, and at first I thought this is going to really hurt</li>
            <li>easy to use , it takes 10 minutes for each treatment-I would say to all you ladies out&lt;br /&gt;there to buy this great product and save your hard earn money!!!</li>
            <li>I found the rollers purely by chance one day while searching on products that cure acne.  </li>
            <li>the company rep follows up on the order to make certain you know how to use it</li>
            <li>I have always had oily skin and large pores.  </li>
            <li>Some people have said my skin is a little more fresh looking, so I&#x27;m guessing it helps (</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s so much out there</li>
            <li>really helps product get into your skin.</li>
            <li>and it was very affordable.</li>
            <li>Hope you like it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>The roller is very compact, doesn&#x27;t take too much space, which is convenient if you need to take it with you.</li>
            <li>Well today, I thought maybe I&#x27;d keep it just to do more frequent rolling in between the bigger rolls.  </li>
            <li>I was very surprised when i first use it.</li>
            <li>For me, I was more interested in getting rid of a few acne scars</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always looked younger than my true age but at some point you do age.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have time for skin treatments, therefore my skin gets very dry easily</li>
            <li>I have noticed some difference in the way my skin feels after I use the needle roller and apply my moisturizer, its stings a little but feels really good about 10 minutes later.</li>
            <li>Light exfoliation and removal of dead skin is seen right away.    </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have been doing some research on arternative options to keep my skin healthy and i came across this little roller.</li>
            <li>I am very please with results so far</li>
            <li>but I use this product a few nights a week before bed and let it do its magic.</li>
            <li>By the morning my face looks normal.  </li>
            <li>got tired of all the hype out in the market today, a good friend told&lt;br /&gt;about</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical at first about the use of rollers, but this turned out to be perfect!</li>
            <li>I am new to this method, so I bought a roller and stamper.</li>
            <li>The  cost is very reasonable compared to similar products I have found online.</li>
            <li>I use a basic moisturizer ( not expensive name brand ).</li>
            <li>Have used my titanium micro needle roller for a little over a week and am seeing quick results!</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with the Aesthetic stuff roller.</li>
            <li>I have seen advertisments to get this done professionally</li>
            <li>WOW  </li>
            <li>They were surprised when I told them 57.</li>
            <li>In fact, I think I&#x27;ve only had one pimple in two weeks--an absolute record.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really has cleared my facial skin.  </li>
            <li>The Aesthetic Stuff roller is fast  Terrific for my skin    </li>
            <li>Starting a new career and new business during mid-life does not leave much time for commercial facials.</li>
            <li>I put the serum on my face and got a bonafide &amp;#34;sunburn&amp;#34; exactly as I&#x27;d gotten with my other .5&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I bought it convinced by some friends and it has worked out to clear my skin marks in just a short time.  </li>
            <li>The serum apparently softens your skin so the needles go in deeper.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin especially around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I was a little scared at first (ouch), but after using it about every 2-3 days I have gotten used to it.</li>
            <li>I was intimidated at first, after a few uses, I was rolling away with no issues.</li>
            <li>My skin gets harsh use all day, every day.&lt;br /&gt;I first decided to try the Needle Roller on my face, while using a face mask.</li>
            <li>I was upset at first because I believed I&#x27;d been sent a 2.5 mm roller, even though it was plainly labeled on the box in 2 places as .5.  </li>
            <li>The rolling action should not be done every single day</li>
            <li>The tiny needles looked like it will be painful on the skin, but it was very soothing and calming combine with my favorite serum.</li>

            <li> and she sends lots of information to guarantee your success in using a derma roller.  </li>
            <li> All you need is the right products.  </li>
            <li> The needles are very sharp, rolls smoothly, and has a nice handle.</li>
            <li> sure after a few weeks I will have even more things to say,  MJ</li>
            <li> this product helps my moisturizer penetrate quickly, &amp; hydrate my skin very well.</li>
            <li> This roller works fine, came packaged well, and so far no needles falling out.</li>
            <li> I already have pretty good skin, but having a job that takes up a lot of my time can leave me with little time for beauty care.</li>
            <li> Glad these rating are made by people who actually use the product.</li>
            <li> So I had to return the first one because of bent needles.</li>
            <li> Plus you can&#x27;t use a roller around the nose area and it&#x27;s difficult to use under the eye area (so the stamper is best for these areas.</li>
            <li> my skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The .5 mm doesn&#x27;t not hurt but it&#x27;s more tolerable than the larger needles.  </li>
            <li> But, everyone is different and someone else may have better luck.</li>
            <li> I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;Within a few days of using it before bed</li>
            <li> I also tried this on a raised  scar and it seems to have become more flat because of use.  </li>
            <li> I saw the needles on this thing, and at first I thought this is going to really hurt</li>
            <li> easy to use , it takes 10 minutes for each treatment-I would say to all you ladies out&lt;br /&gt;there to buy this great product and save your hard earn money!!!</li>
            <li> I found the rollers purely by chance one day while searching on products that cure acne.  </li>
            <li> the company rep follows up on the order to make certain you know how to use it</li>
            <li> I have always had oily skin and large pores.  </li>
            <li> Some people have said my skin is a little more fresh looking, so I&#x27;m guessing it helps (</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s so much out there</li>
            <li> really helps product get into your skin.</li>
            <li> and it was very affordable.</li>
            <li> Hope you like it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> The roller is very compact, doesn&#x27;t take too much space, which is convenient if you need to take it with you.</li>
            <li> Well today, I thought maybe I&#x27;d keep it just to do more frequent rolling in between the bigger rolls.  </li>
            <li> I was very surprised when i first use it.</li>
            <li> For me, I was more interested in getting rid of a few acne scars</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always looked younger than my true age but at some point you do age.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have time for skin treatments, therefore my skin gets very dry easily</li>
            <li> I have noticed some difference in the way my skin feels after I use the needle roller and apply my moisturizer, its stings a little but feels really good about 10 minutes later.</li>
            <li> Light exfoliation and removal of dead skin is seen right away.    </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been doing some research on arternative options to keep my skin healthy and i came across this little roller.</li>
            <li> I am very please with results so far</li>
            <li> but I use this product a few nights a week before bed and let it do its magic.</li>
            <li> By the morning my face looks normal.  </li>
            <li> got tired of all the hype out in the market today, a good friend told&lt;br /&gt;about</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first about the use of rollers, but this turned out to be perfect!</li>
            <li> I am new to this method, so I bought a roller and stamper.</li>
            <li> The  cost is very reasonable compared to similar products I have found online.</li>
            <li> I use a basic moisturizer ( not expensive name brand ).</li>
            <li> Have used my titanium micro needle roller for a little over a week and am seeing quick results!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with the Aesthetic stuff roller.</li>
            <li> I have seen advertisments to get this done professionally</li>
            <li> WOW  </li>
            <li> They were surprised when I told them 57.</li>
            <li> In fact, I think I&#x27;ve only had one pimple in two weeks--an absolute record.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really has cleared my facial skin.  </li>
            <li> The Aesthetic Stuff roller is fast  Terrific for my skin    </li>
            <li> Starting a new career and new business during mid-life does not leave much time for commercial facials.</li>
            <li> I put the serum on my face and got a bonafide &amp;#34;sunburn&amp;#34; exactly as I&#x27;d gotten with my other .5&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I bought it convinced by some friends and it has worked out to clear my skin marks in just a short time.  </li>
            <li> The serum apparently softens your skin so the needles go in deeper.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin especially around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I was a little scared at first (ouch), but after using it about every 2-3 days I have gotten used to it.</li>
            <li> I was intimidated at first, after a few uses, I was rolling away with no issues.</li>
            <li> My skin gets harsh use all day, every day.&lt;br /&gt;I first decided to try the Needle Roller on my face, while using a face mask.</li>
            <li> I was upset at first because I believed I&#x27;d been sent a 2.5 mm roller, even though it was plainly labeled on the box in 2 places as .5.  </li>
            <li> The rolling action should not be done every single day</li>
            <li> The tiny needles looked like it will be painful on the skin, but it was very soothing and calming combine with my favorite serum.</li>
            <li> I rolled with it, my neck area this time, and barely anything happened, my neck was just barely pink.  </li>
            <li> i started with .05 200 needles i will start slow and gradually go higher.</li>
            <li> I compared it to 2 other .5 rollers I&#x27;d used in the past, and it was very &amp;#34;weak&amp;#34;, it just didn&#x27;t seem to be getting deep enough.  </li>
            <li> At first, it felt a bit odd to roll titanium needles on your face but after a few days, it started to feel like a massage.</li>
            <li> So, if you have very sensitive skin, I&#x27;m not sure this will be a usable product.  </li>
            <li> trying it on my stretch marks and dark eye-circles next.</li>
            <li> So far i&#x27;m seeing small changes in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone starting to work seriously on improving your skin!</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me and my super sensitive skin, but this was to painful to use on my face.  </li>
            <li> The overall texture of my skin is not smooth.  </li>
            <li> Faced with a lifelong struggle with dry skin and recent shoulder surgeries I was desperate for a low budget less time consuming and non evasive natural way to tackle my skin challenges.</li>
            <li> I use a little face wash and water and let it dry overnight.</li>
            <li> My life is active with my three children keeping me going 24/7, &amp; I weight train four to five days per week.</li>
            <li> After 4 uses, I do think the needles are starting to dull as well.</li>
            <li> My bad, I totally forgot to put the serum on first before rolling my neck area.  </li>
            <li> I will continue using this product in hopes it reduces the appearance of my wrinkles and my dark spots.</li>
            <li> The micro roller has stimulated blood cells and reduced my puffy eyes and dark circles.  </li>
            <li> I had teen acne and have scaring that is begining to slowly fade away.  </li>
            <li> I do the rolling at night, wait a half hour and then put on my Retin-A and go to bed.  </li>
            <li> Well, you have to get used to the idea of a little pain</li>
            <li> The texture seems to be a little firmer</li>
            <li> are a bit too harsh.</li>
            <li> After a few treatments I can already notice improvement in my skin texture and lightning of scaring from surgery.</li>
            <li> It took several applications getting use to the sharp micro needles which initially felt painful.  </li>
            <li> My skin always looked dull and &#x27;lifeless&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a figure skater, as well as a fitness fanatic.</li>
            <li> I see subtle changes.</li>
            <li> I can go without make-up at last and no longer look &#x27;sick&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> After having a child four years ago my skin became tired and no longer youthful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had insomnia for years and always looked noticeably tired.  </li>
            <li> The results have been dramatic.  </li>
            <li> My friends and family have all noticed the dramatic difference.</li>
            <li> It hurt...not tingling or a slight burning sensation, it was painful.  </li>
            <li> Trust me, it&#x27;s going to feel weird</li>
            <li> -- you will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> Why pay expensive skin spa treatments when you can do it at home for a fraction of the cost?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard that it would be slightly uncomfortable; but it wasn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> that are very expensive</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have a pretty good daily beauty regimen but I was looking for something more for my skin. There&#x27;s so much out there and most of it is nothing but hype! I found this roller on Amazon and I decided to try it for a deeper treatment. I was pleasantly surprised with the Aesthetic stuff roller. It made my healthy skin even more beautiful, smoother and I get great comments from everyone. Awesome product! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first about the use of rollers, but this turned out to be perfect! I bought it convinced by some friends and it has worked out to clear my skin marks in just a short time.  I am 100% satisfied with my new roller. I strongly recommended!</li>
            <li> For about three weeks now I have used the .50 size and I can  tell my skin feels softer, my skin tone looks brighter and I&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed diminished fine lines. I also tried this on a raised  scar and it seems to have become more flat because of use.  At first, it felt a bit odd to roll titanium needles on your face but after a few days, it started to feel like a massage. The rolling action should not be done every single day but I use this product a few nights a week before bed and let it do its magic. This is a tool meant for one person use only and not shared. The  cost is very reasonable compared to similar products I have found online. It comes with its own case and is super easy to clean. I use a little face wash and water and let it dry overnight.</li>
            <li> awesome product and fast delivery</li>
            <li> It was what was described and I am using it daily.  Waiting for resultsl</li>
            <li> I was upset at first because I believed I&#x27;d been sent a 2.5 mm roller, even though it was plainly labeled on the box in 2 places as .5.  I rolled with it, my neck area this time, and barely anything happened, my neck was just barely pink.  I compared it to 2 other .5 rollers I&#x27;d used in the past, and it was very &amp;#34;weak&amp;#34;, it just didn&#x27;t seem to be getting deep enough.  Well today, I thought maybe I&#x27;d keep it just to do more frequent rolling in between the bigger rolls.  I put the serum on my face and got a bonafide &amp;#34;sunburn&amp;#34; exactly as I&#x27;d gotten with my other .5&#x27;s.  My bad, I totally forgot to put the serum on first before rolling my neck area.  The serum apparently softens your skin so the needles go in deeper.  So yes, I would buy this again and believe it is of very good quality.  The only thing nicer is if the spool had come in a sterilized packet like some others do.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful. I can tell an improvement in my jowl lines. Very very pleased. really helps product get into your skin.</li>
            <li> Been using this product on my stomach and my arms. One to help tighten the skin around my navel and two to help the skin lighter fade my sun/age spots. Seems to be helping. I see subtle changes.</li>
            <li> Am happy w/ micro needle ready for another one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy &amp; highly satisfied with this product.  I have seen advertisments to get this done professionally that are very expensive but I am seeing great results in just the short time I&#x27;ve used it and it was very affordable. I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> -I just wanted to find a great and cost effective skin treatment.&lt;br /&gt;I got tired of all the hype out in the market today, a good friend told&lt;br /&gt;about this product- she said it did wonders for her skin- so I ordered&lt;br /&gt;the product, it arrived fast and the roller is designed beautifully. The roller really&lt;br /&gt;worked even tho I&#x27;ve only been using it for a short time, it has smootheden my skin and  it has given me a&lt;br /&gt;healthier over all appearance to my face. I am very please with results so far and it is&lt;br /&gt;very easy to use , it takes 10 minutes for each treatment-I would say to all you ladies out&lt;br /&gt;there to buy this great product and save your hard earn money!!!</li>
            <li> WOW  --------  I have been using this for about 2 weeks now. I was a little scared at first (ouch), but after using it about every 2-3 days I have gotten used to it. I use a basic moisturizer ( not expensive name brand ). I have noticed some difference in the way my skin feels after I use the needle roller and apply my moisturizer, its stings a little but feels really good about 10 minutes later. Some people have said my skin is a little more fresh looking, so I&#x27;m guessing it helps (because that is the only change I have made). I will continue using this product in hopes it reduces the appearance of my wrinkles and my dark spots. I couldn&#x27;t go wrong with the price either, I have seen these for way more. Thinking about it ? Give it a try. Hope you like it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> Arrived quick. Like the product. Waiting for results, hope they come as promised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always looked younger than my true age but at some point you do age. After having a child four years ago my skin became tired and no longer youthful.&lt;br /&gt;I changed my diet and started using the Aesthetic stuff roller- my skin now has a healthy  glow to it and&lt;br /&gt;also I  started to notice that it is helping with my fine lines . happy mommy-get this great product!!</li>
            <li> Good seller. Good product.</li>
            <li> love this microdermabrasion roller it is everything the sellers say it is. I plan on buying another one with longer needles. i started with .05 200 needles i will start slow and gradually go higher. strong product good quality.This roller is a must have if you are into beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> I was intimidated at first, after a few uses, I was rolling away with no issues. Glad these rating are made by people who actually use the product.</li>
            <li> So I had to return the first one because of bent needles. The seller contacted me right away, refunded my money, and sent me a replacement free of charge. This company really makes sure the customer is happy regardless if they lose money. I can&#x27;t say anything but good things about them. Plus the second roller is perfect and I started rolling today. The needles are very sharp, rolls smoothly, and has a nice handle. Hope to see results soon.</li>
            <li> I am new to this method, so I bought a roller and stamper. This roller works fine, came packaged well, and so far no needles falling out. That said - I think the stamper penetrates better and gives more control. Plus you can&#x27;t use a roller around the nose area and it&#x27;s difficult to use under the eye area (so the stamper is best for these areas. After 4 uses, I do think the needles are starting to dull as well.</li>
            <li> The roller is very compact, doesn&#x27;t take too much space, which is convenient if you need to take it with you. The quality is very good too. I&#x27;m using it for stretch marks, and although I&#x27;ve started just recently, I already see improvements on my skin. Great investment! What also helps is the guide that the seller sends to you with all information on how to use it. Very good product!</li>
            <li> This product is excellent. I have very sensitive skin and most products are a bit too harsh. I use this before I go to bed after cleansing and in the morning my skin feels soft and smooth. I love it!:))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Los Angeles</li>
            <li> Well, you have to get used to the idea of a little pain but if you want to smooth out your skin and wrinkles it really works.  I do it with fresh aloe vera and 5.5ph toning water.  I was in the grocery store Sunday and someone thought I was 40.  They were surprised when I told them 57.</li>
            <li> Cool concept, amazingly simple, good quality and affordable!</li>
            <li> Very good Product, excellent quality, good results.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to any and all.</li>
            <li> My razor bumps are gone. My cousin  told me about  the Aesthetic stuff roller, I bought it even though I had doubts. I saw the needles on this thing, and at first I thought this is going to really hurt but it didn&#x27;t it actually massaged my face and it smoothed out the bumps and the roughness that shaving would do to my skin.  great stuff ! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product and has improved how my skin feels and looks!</li>
            <li> I found the rollers purely by chance one day while searching on products that cure acne.  I watched so many videos produced by everyday women who had used the rollers and although it seemed safe, I was still nervous to try rolling needles over my own face!  I must confess to being a fraidy cat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finding more videos on YouTube about rollers from shows like The Doctors and Rachel Ray, I felt more comfortable and bought a roller for myself and my daughter.  I figured I could try it once and see what happened.  For me, I was more interested in getting rid of a few acne scars and if I got rid of a couple wrinkles?  Bonus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is this after only using the rollers two times:  I will never stop using my rollers and especially from this company.  My acne scars are already filling in and my face is looking smoother than ever.  In addition, I have experienced fewer break-outs; I think it&#x27;s because the Retin-A I use can go deeper.  In fact, I think I&#x27;ve only had one pimple in two weeks--an absolute record.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only bit of advice is to start with the .5mm needles.  I started with 1.5 mm and boy, that kind of hurt!  I am still getting great results with the .5 mm.  The .5 mm doesn&#x27;t not hurt but it&#x27;s more tolerable than the larger needles.  Trust me, it&#x27;s going to feel weird but what do you expect with a roller full of needles going into your skin?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The advice out there about how many times per week you should use the rollers run the gamut from every day to once a month.  I use it once a week and that seems to be working great.  Your face will look sun burned after the treatment but it&#x27;s short lived.  I do the rolling at night, wait a half hour and then put on my Retin-A and go to bed.  By the morning my face looks normal.  No redness or any issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this roller today -- you will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> Great product. Can feel immediate results and look forward to using it often.</li>
            <li> Starting a new career and new business during mid-life does not leave much time for commercial facials. Faced with a lifelong struggle with dry skin and recent shoulder surgeries I was desperate for a low budget less time consuming and non evasive natural way to tackle my skin challenges. And then I met Aesthetic Stuff&#x27;s creator on a business trip in Los Angeles. What a blessing. After a few treatments I can already notice improvement in my skin texture and lightning of scaring from surgery. Thank you Ana for introducing me to an amazing yet simple revolution in skin care!!</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin especially around my eyes.  It took several applications getting use to the sharp micro needles which initially felt painful.  I use Egyptian Magic Cream (or a Vitamin E Serum) to &#x27;calm&#x27; my skin after the process. The results have been dramatic.  I&#x27;ve had insomnia for years and always looked noticeably tired.  My skin always looked dull and &#x27;lifeless&#x27;.  The micro roller has stimulated blood cells and reduced my puffy eyes and dark circles.  Now my skin glows and looks radiantly healthy.  My friends and family have all noticed the dramatic difference. I can go without make-up at last and no longer look &#x27;sick&#x27;.  Why pay expensive skin spa treatments when you can do it at home for a fraction of the cost?  All you need is the right products.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> I have always heard about these rollers from beauty gurus on YouTube, and I decided to try this one out.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived at my door FAST, and in great condition. I&#x27;m a figure skater, as well as a fitness fanatic. My skin gets harsh use all day, every day.&lt;br /&gt;I first decided to try the Needle Roller on my face, while using a face mask. I&#x27;ve heard that it would be slightly uncomfortable; but it wasn&#x27;t! I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;Within a few days of using it before bed my face cleared up!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how this thing works, or why, but it&#x27;s wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m trying it on my stretch marks and dark eye-circles next.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to fabulous skin.  It&#x27;s easy to use and I&#x27;m beginning to see results.  My skin looks healthier and feels great.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure after a few weeks I will have even more things to say,  MJ</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 40something and i refuse to get Botox. I have been doing some research on arternative options to keep my skin healthy and i came across this little roller. I was very surprised when i first use it. The tiny needles looked like it will be painful on the skin, but it was very soothing and calming combine with my favorite serum. I hope to get rid of my sun spots and restore some of the elasticity back into my skin.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  I have seen results after using it for 3 days.  I had teen acne and have scaring that is begining to slowly fade away.  This is a great seller and I recomend doing business with them.</li>
            <li> No instructions or Vit C serum as in description. Buy a cheap $5 roller from China and save $</li>
            <li> with having two teenage girls and five month twin  boys , I don&#x27;t have time to take care of my skin. I need something&lt;br /&gt;fast and easy to keep my skin looking good . the Aesthetic Stuff roller does that and more- it refined the texture of my skin and now my skin is radiant-  I received the product in a timely manner- and thank you for the product book/ guide!</li>

            <li> Fantastic product!!! Have used my titanium micro needle roller for a little over a week and am seeing quick results! A must have product for everyone!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this derma roller.  Use it once a week and it has made a difference in my skin.  A plus is the company rep follows up on the order to make certain you know how to use it and she sends lots of information to guarantee your success in using a derma roller.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone starting to work seriously on improving your skin!</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly. I have used several products on my face and this one is a necessity in my facial ritual.  I saw visible results quickly.  My skin is tighter and smoother.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My face is already feeling and looking better!</li>
            <li> Just getting started using this product.  It&#x27;s important to read how to use it.  So far i&#x27;m seeing small changes in my skin.  The texture seems to be a little firmer and it&#x27;s appearance has improved.  My skin looks healthier.&lt;br /&gt;Mu skin is off to a great start!!!  Very happy about that.  Las</li>
            <li> Great product, it sure opens up my pores before face wash, removing every single dirt underneath my skin , my skin is sure glowing... Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I have always had oily skin and large pores.  The overall texture of my skin is not smooth.  I have tried many skin products on the market. To be honest I was very thoughtful about trying this product, but a friend that brought the product told me about it.  To my surprise after just one treatment, I started to see an improvement of my skin - the texture is smoother.  I received the roller quickly.  When I opened the package I noticed the quality of workmanship and style.  I would recommend buying this excellent roller because it helped me with the well-being of my skin, and helps the body to produce collagen as a repair mechanism.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s WONDERDFUL for my skin!  I already have pretty good skin, but having a job that takes up a lot of my time can leave me with little time for beauty care. The Aesthetic Stuff roller is fast  Terrific for my skin    I tried the roller on my face every day for a week. Just 10 minutes a day gave my face a smoother look and I feel. Light exfoliation and removal of dead skin is seen right away.    I&#x27;ve read that this product is also good at diminishing stretch marks. I think I will try that next! Thank you for a Terrific product!!</li>
            <li> Just as ordered. Thank you. Arrived in about four days.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me and my super sensitive skin, but this was to painful to use on my face.  It hurt...not tingling or a slight burning sensation, it was painful.  So, if you have very sensitive skin, I&#x27;m not sure this will be a usable product.  But, everyone is different and someone else may have better luck.</li>
            <li> My life is active with my three children keeping me going 24/7, &amp; I weight train four to five days per week. I don&#x27;t have time for skin treatments, therefore my skin gets very dry easily this product helps my moisturizer penetrate quickly, &amp; hydrate my skin very well. I am glad that the Aesthetic Stuff product is comfortable on my face and can already notice a smooth  and fresh skin generating on my face.</li>
            <li> This product was incredibly helpful. It started to smooth out my scars and blemishes with ease and a comfortable process.  I recommended this product if you have scars and burns it helps diminish them properly.</li>
