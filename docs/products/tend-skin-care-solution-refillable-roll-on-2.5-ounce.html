            <li>The roll-on worked great</li>
            <li>Like the product, but the roll-on bottle isn&#x27;t great.  </li>
            <li>It was working great</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>Amazing product!</li>
            <li>I love Tend Skin and thought that the roll-on applicator would be awesome.  </li>
            <li>I shave my bikini area and it was so smooth and flawless that the person I was seeing thought I had waxed.</li>
            <li>I had been using face trimmers which were good</li>
            <li>This is good for travel.</li>
            <li>The product itself is good.</li>
            <li>You can even put it lightly over your eyebrows after tweezing and it works great!</li>
            <li>Nothing I&#x27;ve ever tried is a good at keeping razor burn at bay.</li>
            <li>The roll-on device applies a good amount while rolling on.  </li>
            <li>And this roll-on applicator is a great idea and much more efficient and cost-effective than cotton balls, gauze pads, etc.  </li>
            <li>And being able to refill the roll-on is a great option.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>It works like magic!  </li>
            <li>I love it and will cherish forever :P</li>
            <li>Nothing I have ever tried works better!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>I love tend skin!</li>
            <li>I love tend skin!</li>
            <li>Now I can just roll this all over my face instead of using a cotton ball, which is messier and more wasteful!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>The roll on applicator is exceptional as it makes it very easy to apply the product.  </li>
            <li>I have to say it works amazingly well.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing for ingrown hairs OR incoming zits.</li>
            <li>This is amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, resolved all my issues with ingrown hairs without over drying my skin and roll on bottle allows me to take it where ever I go.  </li>
            <li>Exfoliate using warm water and a wash cloth twice a day, followed by this roll-on.</li>
            <li>Tend skin roller is nice.</li>
            <li>I guess the best option is to use a product that exfoliates gently.</li>
            <li>This Way, Since I&#x27;d Rather Apply My OWN Fragrance</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s basically a cap fitted over a bottle that has its own screw cap to prevent leakage)</li>
            <li>It rolls on nicely.  </li>
            <li>good product love the roller</li>
            <li>My neck looks so much better after using this product, its that good.</li>
            <li>Nice roller, very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I ordered a new one and it works awesome.  </li>
            <li>my face felt different but my skin loved it.&lt;br /&gt;The fact that the manufacturer lets you try before you buy and sends a lot of information with the sample impressed me.</li>
            <li>The roll on bottle makes it very easy to apply though.  </li>
            <li>It always makes me happy to see an already stellar product get even better!</li>
            <li>great product, love that I am able to easily roll it on with out having to use cotton puffs</li>
            <li>The roll on applicator is by far the best way to use tend skin.  </li>
            <li>And the roll on makes application so easy!</li>
            <li>the roll on applicator makes it easy to apply!</li>
            <li>The rolling ball isn&#x27;t very smooth</li>
            <li>less solution comes out of tend skin, which is good, but the roll on best works when its to skin contact.</li>
            <li>The roll on applicator is way more convenient</li>
            <li>Love how I can use the travel cap and not have any product leakage in my luggage.  </li>
            <li>It works fabulously!</li>
            <li>I have used Tend Skin for years now (absolutely love it).  </li>
            <li>Love the roller.</li>
            <li>So glad this comes in a roll on.</li>
            <li>I guess it works like a hardcore exfoliant. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>this stuff is like magic.</li>
            <li>This product has helped eliminate most ingrown hairs along my bikini line and has minimized the bumps/ingrown hairs that are still there.</li>
            <li>I have fallen in love with Tend Skin.</li>
            <li>Love it and will keep on buying it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see many results.</li>
            <li>I will give it one more try.</li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome and definitely helps keep the ingrown hairs at bay.  </li>
            <li>, is more efficient and lasts longer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure.  </li>
            <li>If there is a better way to apply this product please let me know.</li>
            <li>Tend skin is indispensable if you engage in any kind of hair removal and are prone to getting ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this also because it&#x27;s refillable.</li>
            <li>Works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>It really lets out just the perfect amount of product and you arent wasting any that is absorbed into a cotton round.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I will use it more since it is one step now.</li>
            <li>I recommend the roll on applicator because you get more for your money out of the product, instead of using a cotton swab that soaks up the product.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m incredibly pleased.</li>
            <li>I must say I have been pleased.  </li>
            <li>the roll on for skin time is better.</li>
            <li>The roll-on version is much more convenient, too.</li>
            <li>Apply it after you shave when you&#x27;re out of the shower and your skin has cooled, and it should prevent most razor burns and rashes.</li>
            <li>I LOVE Tend Skin, which does an outstanding job of deterring razor burn, bumps, rashes, etc.</li>
            <li>This is ok.</li>
            <li>Others seem to have had a better experience with it.</li>
            <li>Love love the roller ball applicator.  </li>
            <li>Not in love with the roll on applicator.  </li>
            <li>really does a great job or keeping me from breaking out on my body.</li>
            <li>I love you, Tend Skin.</li>
            <li>This roll on idea is so cute</li>
            <li>Best when applied after shower since pores are open.</li>
            <li>awesome product, totally does what it advertised.&lt;br</li>
            <li>though I was going to have to have my bikini line lasered for sure because I am a triathlete, I prefer to have no body hair.</li>
            <li>Make sure not to purchase from the Amazon Fulfillment for BIGFLYSPORTS.</li>
            <li>Love this applicator.</li>
            <li>Tried to fix, ended up spilling most.  </li>
            <li>love the roller</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than using nothing at all.</li>
            <li>Reccommend this product to more women of color.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>the Tend Skin I love</li>
            <li>Could be better</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>I love the roll-on bottle, too.</li>
            <li>Maybe I just need to give it more time and will update my review if anything changes.</li>
            <li>Love, love, LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>The liquid works better than the roller for some reason</li>
            <li>Great product, really works.</li>
            <li>pretty good product... did what it was supposed to do by removing the razor bumps</li>
            <li>Love that it is a roll-on too, easy delivery of product.</li>
            <li>But I will not recomment the Roll on though, because after 4 use the lotion becomes dirty, it&#x27;s best to use with a cotton on your face and neck after shaving,,,,    Again,,, it&#x27;s the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Tend Skin is great for any ingrown hairs and very easy to use if used on a regular basis; it prevents ingrown hairs</li>
            <li>It helps slough off the excess keratin cells and the salicylic acid penetrates the follicle pores allowing for easy removal and significantly reducing the amount of ingrown hairs!</li>
            <li>I had 3 days of sexy goatee and smooth skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just as good as Min NY but much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference with this product in just one week, it&#x27;s really that good.</li>
            <li>I bought this stuff to deal with shave bumps under my arms and around my bikini line, and I&#x27;m pleased to say it has significantly improved the irritation.</li>
            <li>Yes, it can be drying, but that&#x27;s easily remedied with moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>No, but it&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve found so far, so I will continue to use it until I really find a miracle-cure.</li>
            <li>and it was shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li>As long as you follow the instructions I think you will see some very good results.</li>
            <li>It works like a charm and the roll-on top makes it a quick and easy experience.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s fine for me.  </li>
            <li>Rec&#x27;d quick!  </li>
            <li>The roll-on is a huge improvement.  </li>
            <li>Great for refilling from larger bottles.</li>
            <li>It stopped rolling smoothly.  </li>
            <li>The product I was formally using was backordered with no information on when it would be available</li>
            <li>Its good, will eventually clear the ingrown hair spots</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good</li>
            <li>SkinTend goes on easily, is absorbed by the skin quickly, does not smell and most importantly...</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen a product this effective in stores, so I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>and I am not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>this baby is worth it!</li>
            <li>An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth every cent!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say if it actually works, since this one is going in the trash :P</li>
            <li>My main concern was preventing ingrown hairs, and exfoliation combined with this product does a pretty good job of eliminating that.</li>
            <li>This product has so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried another popular brand but will go back to this kind because it doesn&#x27;t have as medicinal smell as the other kind, and I do feel like it works a bit better - for me,</li>
            <li>I always use Tend skin, it&#x27;s a great product against razor bumps and irritation, however this bottle can&#x27;t be used, it can&#x27;t be closed, the bottle with liquid can not be screw to the roller, so</li>
            <li>I get full Brazilian waxes.  </li>
            <li>works well  feels smooth n fresh</li>
            <li>so ordered the full size bottle here.</li>
            <li>Need to buy full sealing bottle of tendskin also.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff really helps with razor bumps on my neck area.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about Tend Skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit smelly but not bad.</li>
            <li>Gotta tell you, it made a huge difference right away.</li>
            <li>My son swears this is the best product on the planet and says it&#x27;s the only made that actually does what it&#x27;s suppose to do!  </li>
            <li>Clears up embarrassing bumps quickly and prevents them from ever happening.</li>
            <li>It has worked tremendously.</li>
            <li>ten skin is the best product I have used in 20 years where have its been, love this for black men.</li>
            <li>Use it consistently out of the bottle before it evaporates, it works better consistently anyways.</li>
            <li>So far so good, has really helped with bumps and razor burn.  </li>
            <li>This product goes on smoothly and works exactly as described.</li>
            <li>so much easier to use than having to put on a cotton ball!!</li>
            <li>Worked after first application!</li>
            <li>So far no leaks or mess &amp; dispenses the perfect amount of product.  </li>
            <li>Since using this stuff, I rarely get an ingrown hair.  </li>
            <li>After using this i rarely see any bumps ...</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>but I rarely have ingrown hairs anymore.  </li>
            <li>Gets rid of my ingrown hairs and works as expected - good product</li>
            <li>It is the only effective product I have found in preventing razor burn.</li>
            <li>It may sting when used, but man is it useful for any shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product and the Min2 roll on solution, this one seems to work just as well, if not a little better.  </li>
            <li>This product burns more than the other product I had and has more of a scent</li>
            <li>It burns if you use it right away.  </li>
            <li>I put mine on usually right</li>
            <li>but right after I waxed</li>
            <li>It will also burn if you use it right after shaving, of course.     </li>
            <li>Saw improvements right away</li>
            <li>Worked right away.</li>
            <li>The applicator ball distributes just the right amount</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always thought a roll-on would be a great idea, as with the bottle version you waste the product by first applying Tend Skin to a cotton ball (or whatever used to apply the product).</li>
            <li>now I don&#x27;t bother with waxing because its easy enough to shave and use this product for a bump free bikini line</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money because it really WORKS!  </li>
            <li>I have also used it on small bumps on my face and it works great.</li>
            <li>Nice that it can be re-filled, however if you tighten the applicator lid down too much to prevent leaking, then the roller doesn&#x27;t turn easily.</li>
            <li>And this new roll-on dispenser is fantastic?  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply directly to the affected area.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for stocking this stuff!</li>
            <li>but the Tend Skin arrived first</li>
            <li>but I decided to grow a goatee and to keep it crisp lookin</li>
            <li>Tend skin does exactly what it claims to</li>
            <li>I still get them as it is inevitable when you epilate, however I think that because I use this stuff, I don&#x27;t get nearly as many ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>so I was interested in this Roll On form factor I had never seen in stores.  </li>
            <li>in mind, especially on sensitive, freshly shaved skin, that this stuff can burn.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t work exactly like the one I&#x27;ve bought from the salon.</li>
            <li>Be consistent and patient.</li>
            <li>The first time I used It</li>
            <li>First off I want to say that this product really does work!</li>
            <li>It enables me to get this product exactly where I need it, without saturating several cotton balls and wasting more than I&#x27;d care to.</li>
            <li>They adapted, but at first, the skin was a bit irritated.&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first I use this twice a day.</li>
            <li>But you have to use it consistently.</li>
            <li>I finally just removed the top roller portion &amp; used it on a cotton ball</li>
            <li>I hope others will see this review and choose the seller wisely to avoid all this trouble.</li>
            <li>Works fantastic even better than by previous brand I used Whish.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, I love tend skin, but the roller makes it so easy to use without having to waste product putting in onto a cotton ball, and some of the product wasting out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you get the gentle sting if you put it on right after you shave, but it&#x27;s not unbearable.  </li>
            <li>Great for my ingrown chin hairs that I get from tweezing those dang course black hairs!!!</li>
            <li>Is NOT 100% Effective, But It Works \\&quot;Okay\\&quot; For Me, As It Has DEFINITELY Lessened The Occurrence Of My Razor Bumps, And The Ones That DO Appear, Go Through A 2 Day \\&quot;Whitehead-Phase\\&quot;, Before Disappearing Completely.  </li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s even better than cotton rounds because now it&#x27;s much easier to use when there is stubble growing back.</li>
            <li>( Like pretty much any product, you have to use it every day in order for it to work.</li>
            <li>As a side note, the area needs to be completely dry before applying or it will not work as well. :)</li>
            <li>Its simple and easy to use and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>At first I figured it would be awkward or would drip the liquid everywhere, but this delivery system works perfectly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s alcohol based so it will sting a tiny bit, but it feels fresh, not painful.</li>
            <li>you have to hit a certain angle</li>
            <li>Plus as a lady, Tend Skin will mess up your nail polish a little, so this is the perfect application.</li>
            <li>This product has definitely made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I just started waxing my face and was very upset to see bumps.  </li>
            <li>would absolutely recommend this product, but not the vendor AmericaRx.  </li>
            <li>same results, baby smooth skin.</li>
            <li>Even then it doesn&#x27;t roll very well.</li>
            <li>I use tend skin after shaving, waxing, or even lasering, and it really helps the ingrowns work their way to the surface.  </li>
            <li>It gets rid of razor bumps fast.</li>
            <li>Smooth, non-irritated skin post shave use and days later!</li>
            <li>but, thanks to this product my face has  zero razor bumps.</li>
            <li>I would really suggest it if you&#x27;re waxing.</li>
            <li>Absolutely nukes them away.</li>
            <li>I never realized how much tend skin</li>
            <li>-- even though the stuff virtually sets your face on fire after a really close shave.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really did help my ingrown hairs on my neck.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works with all types of skin irritations.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This roll-on is really neat</li>
            <li>makes application much easier</li>
            <li>This roll on applicator makes this product much easier and cleaner to use.  </li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>Really helped with shaving bumps and ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t roll very well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always wondered how much product I must be wasting that get sucked up by the cotton ball.  </li>
            <li>I suffered from razor bumps my whole life until I found this product.</li>
            <li>It was a bit wasteful, as the cotton retained much of the liquid, and it also would get through to my fingertips.  </li>
            <li>Makes the application much easier.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>and it really helps.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t like as much as I do.</li>
            <li>Just started using it, and the actually formula seems okay, too early to tell.</li>
            <li>My legs and bikini area are smooth and lack ingrowns for the first time in a long time.</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews and was excited to finally get rid of my ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>It works so much better than I had expected!  </li>
            <li>I have been buying it since it only came in pour bottles and this is a welcome change - so much faster and easier to apply and don&#x27;t have to waste any cotton balls!</li>
            <li>But it seems to be better after the first few uses</li>
            <li>Also, while it&#x27;s a minor issue, applying the old way with cotton tends to push the solution deeper into the skin, whereas this way it stays a bit more on the surface.  </li>
            <li>Not sure what started it, but it wasn&#x27;t cool even though ingrown hair and razor bumps are a huge problem for many of us Black men.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had been using Bikini Zone and thought that was decent stuff.</li>
            <li>Its refillable and you can purchase more refill containers in larger amounts to save money later.</li>
            <li>So I discovered it&#x27;s mainly just rubbing alcohol.  </li>
            <li>mess cause more bumps than I had</li>
            <li>/&gt;both sting, but the work.&lt;br /&gt;the roller on skin tight is much better though.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product and am still waiting to see what it can do for me.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend you give it a try.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended to anyone who gets skin irritation from shaving.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I also love that this little bottle is refillable.</li>
            <li>and you can easily manage how much solution drips out the roller with the skin tight.</li>
            <li>It definitely helped calm irritation, but did not decrease ingrown hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overrated, this stuff works and the refillable roll-on is a definite plus (great portable size for travel, I get it through TSA as a carry-on without any issues), helps make application targeted with precision/less messy, and you can buy the larger 8 oz sizes for refill.</li>
            <li>I use it almost everyday in the summer when I tend to shave more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay doesn&#x27;t clear any dark spots from ingrown hair..</li>
            <li>For years, I used the normal bottle version, applied it to cotton, and dabbed that on my face.  </li>
            <li>I no longer have red, irritated, bumpy skin and with the exception of ONE new ingrown hair, my bikini line finally looks clear and smooth!</li>
            <li>I do need to apply it every day, but I&#x27;m happy to do that as long as I&#x27;m not a red, bumpy mess.</li>
            <li>Their company is located in New York.  </li>
            <li>I live in New York.  </li>
            <li>It reduces all the swelling and redness, seems to coax the hairs up towards the surface, and keeps new ones from forming.  </li>
            <li>The spots (or perhaps new ones) are still there, but they are clearing and the are not as irritated.</li>
            <li>I have tried Bliss Ingrown Eliminator Pads, Hovan&#x27;s Medi Cream, Bikini Zone Medicated Cream and Min New York Solution2</li>
            <li>Loved the applicator, but ultimately was not effective for me.</li>
            <li>Next, it does have kinda a funny smell, but so does the pfb vanish, and it&#x27;s gone after a couple seconds.  </li>
            <li>I will say that I have been curious about the difference between this and tend skin&#x27;s sister product \\&quot;bump be gone,\\&quot; which I believe is specifically made for razor bumps and which I nearly ordered to refill this roll-on, but decided to get the original.</li>
            <li>I used it twice a day for the first couple of weeks and now I use it daily after I shower.</li>
            <li>and this product resolves the issue completely!</li>
            <li>The rollon application method is pretty gross.</li>
            <li>and my bumps are almost completely gone, I have considerably fewer ingrown hairs and the redness has disappeared!  </li>
            <li>Also be careful of using this product too often as it can dry out the skin &amp; cause more irritation during shaving or hair breakage during waxing</li>
            <li>In my most recent order to re-stock my TendSkin supply, I found this little do-dad.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still showing as not being shipped on Amazon, so clearly there are some communications issues with AmericaRx.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and so I wanted something to clear them up.  </li>
            <li>Refillable - well sort of - you end up wasting a lot of product as there isn&#x27;t clear directions on how to refill the product</li>
            <li>The last time that I ran out I could definitely tell a huge difference until I got more,this will definitely be a product that I will keep on hand!</li>
            <li>Complete BS.</li>
            <li>The roll on bottle allows there to be no wasted product, and unlike the pfb vanish, it is refillable, whereas the pfb vanish bottle can&#x27;t be opened from what I can see.    </li>
            <li>Tend Skin cleared up the few bikini bumps I had and leaves my skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Use it every time I shave sensitive areas and works like a charm.</li>
            <li>I use it every time I shave and so far have had no issues with irritations or ingrown hair.</li>
            <li>This fixed that problem</li>
            <li>He likes it so much that I just ordered a larger bottle of just the liquid, and he refills the roll-on and takes it with him when he travels, etc.    </li>
            <li>too self conscious knowing that someone might notice it).</li>
            <li>Since I started using it the old bumps, even ones I thought were scars, have gone away.</li>
            <li>With the roller there is absolutely no waste</li>
            <li>I use it every night and sometimes it&#x27;s a very noticeable difference just one day later!</li>
            <li>Tried using this for perhaps a month or so and found no improvement as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>Its not clearing it up completely but dose make my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>Easier to not waste product</li>
            <li>: My old one quit on me.  </li>
            <li>Does it completely fix everything?</li>
            <li>I have seriously sensitive skin, esp around my bikini line, and this stuff coupled with a Microdermabrasion mitt keeps 99% of razor burn and ingrown hairs in check.</li>
            <li>And that putting alcohol on your skin after shaving is an old barber&#x27;s trick.  </li>
            <li>Not only was it messy, but this method used more Tend Skin with each application.</li>
            <li>(although the latter isn&#x27;t worth mentioning, entirely ineffective).</li>
            <li>It is defiantly worth every penny spent.</li>
            <li>The roll on ball makes application so quick and easy and you don&#x27;t have to mess with wasted product on a cotton ball or have to wash any residue off of your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mostly alcohol, which evaporates quickly, but it does leave a slightly tacky feeling behind, although very minute.</li>
            <li>It stings a little when you use it (like rubbing alcohol would) but it keeps the pores clean and helps guard against ingrown hairs and irritation.  </li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t completely eliminated razor burn as I had hoped, but it definitely minimizes any bumps as long as I&#x27;m sure to follow the other steps of my shaving routine along with it.</li>
            <li>You know the kind of product that you are just afraid that it will finish one day even if you are using it for the first day....</li>
            <li>The Main  Ingredients (Of 22) Are Acetylsalicylate (Aspirin), And Alcohol;However, I Actually Prefer It</li>
            <li>There simply is NO other product that works like Tend Skin!  </li>
            <li>I was never able to use razors without getting huge bumps.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was new to using epilators, so I read on-line about regular exfoliation to avoid ingrown hair, well, exfoliate</li>
            <li>did absolutely nothing for me except dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>All the negatives are common and temporary, however the positives results are most definitely not.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a major difference in amount of bumps on my legs.</li>
            <li>Only downside is on dry days you&#x27;ll have to use a moisturizer on top of it, but other than that, it&#x27;s the only product I use.    </li>
            <li>First, it stings, but really, no more than alcohol or any alcohol based aftershave, which makes sense, since Alcohol is the main ingredient.  </li>
            <li>I am hoping with regular use that all issues with disappear completely.  </li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s a tip for frequent travelers, though: Only fill it about halfway; then, cut the thumb off of a surgical glove and pull it over the uncovered roller ball end and screw the cap on over the surgical glove rubber.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the stuff you can buy at drug stores, but there is nothing that offers the same results!</li>
            <li>Roller barely works.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical spending the same price for the roller with 2.5 ounces versus the 4oz, but so glad I did!</li>
            <li>It burns a little when you first put it on</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s a convenient way to apply this solution, I was not prepared for the tweezing-the-hair-downstairs effect the first time this little ball grabbed a stray...</li>
            <li>The first few times I used it (and I&#x27;ve used tend skin before)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a person that usually sees immediate results and finds success in a product like this</li>
            <li>Spent years fighting ingrown hair issues following shaving (particularly in the bikini area)</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t find that too much or too little product comes out with the roller ball as others have mentioned.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> So happy they came out with this REFILLABLE roller.  </li>
            <li> but it still does a great job.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great.</li>
            <li> It works as a great liquid deodorant and helps to keep under arm razor bumps away.</li>
            <li> I think the roll on application works great</li>
            <li> Great product and I love the roll on!!</li>
            <li> This is truly an amazing product!</li>
            <li> Simply amazing product!  </li>
            <li> Amazing product!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> Amazing product!</li>
            <li> I love Tend Skin and thought that the roll-on applicator would be awesome.  </li>
            <li> I shave my bikini area and it was so smooth and flawless that the person I was seeing thought I had waxed.</li>
            <li> I had been using face trimmers which were good</li>
            <li> This is good for travel.</li>
            <li> The product itself is good.</li>
            <li> You can even put it lightly over your eyebrows after tweezing and it works great!</li>
            <li> Nothing I&#x27;ve ever tried is a good at keeping razor burn at bay.</li>
            <li> The roll-on device applies a good amount while rolling on.  </li>
            <li> And this roll-on applicator is a great idea and much more efficient and cost-effective than cotton balls, gauze pads, etc.  </li>
            <li> And being able to refill the roll-on is a great option.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> It works like magic!  </li>
            <li> I love it and will cherish forever :P</li>
            <li> Nothing I have ever tried works better!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Love!</li>
            <li> I love tend skin!</li>
            <li> I love tend skin!</li>
            <li> Now I can just roll this all over my face instead of using a cotton ball, which is messier and more wasteful!  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> The roll on applicator is exceptional as it makes it very easy to apply the product.  </li>
            <li> I have to say it works amazingly well.  </li>
            <li> This stuff works amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing for ingrown hairs OR incoming zits.</li>
            <li> This is amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, resolved all my issues with ingrown hairs without over drying my skin and roll on bottle allows me to take it where ever I go.  </li>
            <li> Exfoliate using warm water and a wash cloth twice a day, followed by this roll-on.</li>
            <li> Tend skin roller is nice.</li>
            <li> I guess the best option is to use a product that exfoliates gently.</li>
            <li> This Way, Since I&#x27;d Rather Apply My OWN Fragrance</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s basically a cap fitted over a bottle that has its own screw cap to prevent leakage)</li>
            <li> It rolls on nicely.  </li>
            <li> good product love the roller</li>
            <li> My neck looks so much better after using this product, its that good.</li>
            <li> Nice roller, very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I ordered a new one and it works awesome.  </li>
            <li> my face felt different but my skin loved it.&lt;br /&gt;The fact that the manufacturer lets you try before you buy and sends a lot of information with the sample impressed me.</li>
            <li> The roll on bottle makes it very easy to apply though.  </li>
            <li> It always makes me happy to see an already stellar product get even better!</li>
            <li> great product, love that I am able to easily roll it on with out having to use cotton puffs</li>
            <li> The roll on applicator is by far the best way to use tend skin.  </li>
            <li> And the roll on makes application so easy!</li>
            <li> the roll on applicator makes it easy to apply!</li>
            <li> The rolling ball isn&#x27;t very smooth</li>
            <li> less solution comes out of tend skin, which is good, but the roll on best works when its to skin contact.</li>
            <li> The roll on applicator is way more convenient</li>
            <li> Love how I can use the travel cap and not have any product leakage in my luggage.  </li>
            <li> It works fabulously!</li>
            <li> I have used Tend Skin for years now (absolutely love it).  </li>
            <li> Love the roller.</li>
            <li> So glad this comes in a roll on.</li>
            <li> I guess it works like a hardcore exfoliant. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> this stuff is like magic.</li>
            <li> This product has helped eliminate most ingrown hairs along my bikini line and has minimized the bumps/ingrown hairs that are still there.</li>
            <li> I have fallen in love with Tend Skin.</li>
            <li> Love it and will keep on buying it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see many results.</li>
            <li> I will give it one more try.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome and definitely helps keep the ingrown hairs at bay.  </li>
            <li> , is more efficient and lasts longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure.  </li>
            <li> If there is a better way to apply this product please let me know.</li>
            <li> Tend skin is indispensable if you engage in any kind of hair removal and are prone to getting ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> but I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this also because it&#x27;s refillable.</li>
            <li> Works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> It really lets out just the perfect amount of product and you arent wasting any that is absorbed into a cotton round.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I will use it more since it is one step now.</li>
            <li> I recommend the roll on applicator because you get more for your money out of the product, instead of using a cotton swab that soaks up the product.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m incredibly pleased.</li>
            <li> I must say I have been pleased.  </li>
            <li> the roll on for skin time is better.</li>
            <li> The roll-on version is much more convenient, too.</li>
            <li> Apply it after you shave when you&#x27;re out of the shower and your skin has cooled, and it should prevent most razor burns and rashes.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Tend Skin, which does an outstanding job of deterring razor burn, bumps, rashes, etc.</li>
            <li> This is ok.</li>
            <li> Others seem to have had a better experience with it.</li>
            <li> Love love the roller ball applicator.  </li>
            <li> Not in love with the roll on applicator.  </li>
            <li> really does a great job or keeping me from breaking out on my body.</li>
            <li> I love you, Tend Skin.</li>
            <li> This roll on idea is so cute</li>
            <li> Best when applied after shower since pores are open.</li>
            <li> awesome product, totally does what it advertised.&lt;br</li>
            <li> though I was going to have to have my bikini line lasered for sure because I am a triathlete, I prefer to have no body hair.</li>
            <li> Make sure not to purchase from the Amazon Fulfillment for BIGFLYSPORTS.</li>
            <li> Love this applicator.</li>
            <li> Tried to fix, ended up spilling most.  </li>
            <li> love the roller</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than using nothing at all.</li>
            <li> Reccommend this product to more women of color.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> the Tend Skin I love</li>
            <li> Could be better</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> I love the roll-on bottle, too.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just need to give it more time and will update my review if anything changes.</li>
            <li> Love, love, LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> The liquid works better than the roller for some reason</li>
            <li> Great product, really works.</li>
            <li> pretty good product... did what it was supposed to do by removing the razor bumps</li>
            <li> Love that it is a roll-on too, easy delivery of product.</li>
            <li> But I will not recomment the Roll on though, because after 4 use the lotion becomes dirty, it&#x27;s best to use with a cotton on your face and neck after shaving,,,,    Again,,, it&#x27;s the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Tend Skin is great for any ingrown hairs and very easy to use if used on a regular basis; it prevents ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> It helps slough off the excess keratin cells and the salicylic acid penetrates the follicle pores allowing for easy removal and significantly reducing the amount of ingrown hairs!</li>
            <li> I had 3 days of sexy goatee and smooth skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just as good as Min NY but much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference with this product in just one week, it&#x27;s really that good.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff to deal with shave bumps under my arms and around my bikini line, and I&#x27;m pleased to say it has significantly improved the irritation.</li>
            <li> Yes, it can be drying, but that&#x27;s easily remedied with moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> No, but it&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve found so far, so I will continue to use it until I really find a miracle-cure.</li>
            <li> and it was shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> As long as you follow the instructions I think you will see some very good results.</li>
            <li> It works like a charm and the roll-on top makes it a quick and easy experience.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s fine for me.  </li>
            <li> Rec&#x27;d quick!  </li>
            <li> The roll-on is a huge improvement.  </li>
            <li> Great for refilling from larger bottles.</li>
            <li> It stopped rolling smoothly.  </li>
            <li> The product I was formally using was backordered with no information on when it would be available</li>
            <li> Its good, will eventually clear the ingrown hair spots</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good</li>
            <li> SkinTend goes on easily, is absorbed by the skin quickly, does not smell and most importantly...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a product this effective in stores, so I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> and I am not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> this baby is worth it!</li>
            <li> An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth every cent!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say if it actually works, since this one is going in the trash :P</li>
            <li> My main concern was preventing ingrown hairs, and exfoliation combined with this product does a pretty good job of eliminating that.</li>
            <li> This product has so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried another popular brand but will go back to this kind because it doesn&#x27;t have as medicinal smell as the other kind, and I do feel like it works a bit better - for me,</li>
            <li> I always use Tend skin, it&#x27;s a great product against razor bumps and irritation, however this bottle can&#x27;t be used, it can&#x27;t be closed, the bottle with liquid can not be screw to the roller, so</li>
            <li> I get full Brazilian waxes.  </li>
            <li> works well  feels smooth n fresh</li>
            <li> so ordered the full size bottle here.</li>
            <li> Need to buy full sealing bottle of tendskin also.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff really helps with razor bumps on my neck area.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about Tend Skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit smelly but not bad.</li>
            <li> Gotta tell you, it made a huge difference right away.</li>
            <li> My son swears this is the best product on the planet and says it&#x27;s the only made that actually does what it&#x27;s suppose to do!  </li>
            <li> Clears up embarrassing bumps quickly and prevents them from ever happening.</li>
            <li> It has worked tremendously.</li>
            <li> ten skin is the best product I have used in 20 years where have its been, love this for black men.</li>
            <li> Use it consistently out of the bottle before it evaporates, it works better consistently anyways.</li>
            <li> So far so good, has really helped with bumps and razor burn.  </li>
            <li> This product goes on smoothly and works exactly as described.</li>
            <li> so much easier to use than having to put on a cotton ball!!</li>
            <li> Worked after first application!</li>
            <li> So far no leaks or mess &amp; dispenses the perfect amount of product.  </li>
            <li> Since using this stuff, I rarely get an ingrown hair.  </li>
            <li> After using this i rarely see any bumps ...</li>
            <li> Well worth it.</li>
            <li> but I rarely have ingrown hairs anymore.  </li>
            <li> Gets rid of my ingrown hairs and works as expected - good product</li>
            <li> It is the only effective product I have found in preventing razor burn.</li>
            <li> It may sting when used, but man is it useful for any shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product and the Min2 roll on solution, this one seems to work just as well, if not a little better.  </li>
            <li> This product burns more than the other product I had and has more of a scent</li>
            <li> It burns if you use it right away.  </li>
            <li> I put mine on usually right</li>
            <li> but right after I waxed</li>
            <li> It will also burn if you use it right after shaving, of course.     </li>
            <li> Saw improvements right away</li>
            <li> Worked right away.</li>
            <li> The applicator ball distributes just the right amount</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always thought a roll-on would be a great idea, as with the bottle version you waste the product by first applying Tend Skin to a cotton ball (or whatever used to apply the product).</li>
            <li> now I don&#x27;t bother with waxing because its easy enough to shave and use this product for a bump free bikini line</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money because it really WORKS!  </li>
            <li> I have also used it on small bumps on my face and it works great.</li>
            <li> Nice that it can be re-filled, however if you tighten the applicator lid down too much to prevent leaking, then the roller doesn&#x27;t turn easily.</li>
            <li> And this new roll-on dispenser is fantastic?  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply directly to the affected area.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for stocking this stuff!</li>
            <li> but the Tend Skin arrived first</li>
            <li> but I decided to grow a goatee and to keep it crisp lookin</li>
            <li> Tend skin does exactly what it claims to</li>
            <li> I still get them as it is inevitable when you epilate, however I think that because I use this stuff, I don&#x27;t get nearly as many ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> so I was interested in this Roll On form factor I had never seen in stores.  </li>
            <li> in mind, especially on sensitive, freshly shaved skin, that this stuff can burn.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t work exactly like the one I&#x27;ve bought from the salon.</li>
            <li> Be consistent and patient.</li>
            <li> The first time I used It</li>
            <li> First off I want to say that this product really does work!</li>
            <li> It enables me to get this product exactly where I need it, without saturating several cotton balls and wasting more than I&#x27;d care to.</li>
            <li> They adapted, but at first, the skin was a bit irritated.&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first I use this twice a day.</li>
            <li> But you have to use it consistently.</li>
            <li> I finally just removed the top roller portion &amp; used it on a cotton ball</li>
            <li> I hope others will see this review and choose the seller wisely to avoid all this trouble.</li>
            <li> Works fantastic even better than by previous brand I used Whish.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, I love tend skin, but the roller makes it so easy to use without having to waste product putting in onto a cotton ball, and some of the product wasting out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you get the gentle sting if you put it on right after you shave, but it&#x27;s not unbearable.  </li>
            <li> Great for my ingrown chin hairs that I get from tweezing those dang course black hairs!!!</li>
            <li> Is NOT 100% Effective, But It Works \\&quot;Okay\\&quot; For Me, As It Has DEFINITELY Lessened The Occurrence Of My Razor Bumps, And The Ones That DO Appear, Go Through A 2 Day \\&quot;Whitehead-Phase\\&quot;, Before Disappearing Completely.  </li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s even better than cotton rounds because now it&#x27;s much easier to use when there is stubble growing back.</li>
            <li> ( Like pretty much any product, you have to use it every day in order for it to work.</li>
            <li> As a side note, the area needs to be completely dry before applying or it will not work as well. :)</li>
            <li> Its simple and easy to use and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> At first I figured it would be awkward or would drip the liquid everywhere, but this delivery system works perfectly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alcohol based so it will sting a tiny bit, but it feels fresh, not painful.</li>
            <li> you have to hit a certain angle</li>
            <li> Plus as a lady, Tend Skin will mess up your nail polish a little, so this is the perfect application.</li>
            <li> This product has definitely made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I just started waxing my face and was very upset to see bumps.  </li>
            <li> would absolutely recommend this product, but not the vendor AmericaRx.  </li>
            <li> same results, baby smooth skin.</li>
            <li> Even then it doesn&#x27;t roll very well.</li>
            <li> I use tend skin after shaving, waxing, or even lasering, and it really helps the ingrowns work their way to the surface.  </li>
            <li> It gets rid of razor bumps fast.</li>
            <li> Smooth, non-irritated skin post shave use and days later!</li>
            <li> but, thanks to this product my face has  zero razor bumps.</li>
            <li> I would really suggest it if you&#x27;re waxing.</li>
            <li> Absolutely nukes them away.</li>
            <li> I never realized how much tend skin</li>
            <li> -- even though the stuff virtually sets your face on fire after a really close shave.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really did help my ingrown hairs on my neck.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works with all types of skin irritations.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This roll-on is really neat</li>
            <li> makes application much easier</li>
            <li> This roll on applicator makes this product much easier and cleaner to use.  </li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> Really helped with shaving bumps and ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t roll very well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wondered how much product I must be wasting that get sucked up by the cotton ball.  </li>
            <li> I suffered from razor bumps my whole life until I found this product.</li>
            <li> It was a bit wasteful, as the cotton retained much of the liquid, and it also would get through to my fingertips.  </li>
            <li> Makes the application much easier.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li> and it really helps.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t like as much as I do.</li>
            <li> Just started using it, and the actually formula seems okay, too early to tell.</li>
            <li> My legs and bikini area are smooth and lack ingrowns for the first time in a long time.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and was excited to finally get rid of my ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> It works so much better than I had expected!  </li>
            <li> I have been buying it since it only came in pour bottles and this is a welcome change - so much faster and easier to apply and don&#x27;t have to waste any cotton balls!</li>
            <li> But it seems to be better after the first few uses</li>
            <li> Also, while it&#x27;s a minor issue, applying the old way with cotton tends to push the solution deeper into the skin, whereas this way it stays a bit more on the surface.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what started it, but it wasn&#x27;t cool even though ingrown hair and razor bumps are a huge problem for many of us Black men.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had been using Bikini Zone and thought that was decent stuff.</li>
            <li> Its refillable and you can purchase more refill containers in larger amounts to save money later.</li>
            <li> So I discovered it&#x27;s mainly just rubbing alcohol.  </li>
            <li> mess cause more bumps than I had</li>
            <li> /&gt;both sting, but the work.&lt;br /&gt;the roller on skin tight is much better though.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product and am still waiting to see what it can do for me.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend you give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended to anyone who gets skin irritation from shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I also love that this little bottle is refillable.</li>
            <li> and you can easily manage how much solution drips out the roller with the skin tight.</li>
            <li> It definitely helped calm irritation, but did not decrease ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overrated, this stuff works and the refillable roll-on is a definite plus (great portable size for travel, I get it through TSA as a carry-on without any issues), helps make application targeted with precision/less messy, and you can buy the larger 8 oz sizes for refill.</li>
            <li> I use it almost everyday in the summer when I tend to shave more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay doesn&#x27;t clear any dark spots from ingrown hair..</li>
            <li> For years, I used the normal bottle version, applied it to cotton, and dabbed that on my face.  </li>
            <li> I no longer have red, irritated, bumpy skin and with the exception of ONE new ingrown hair, my bikini line finally looks clear and smooth!</li>
            <li> I do need to apply it every day, but I&#x27;m happy to do that as long as I&#x27;m not a red, bumpy mess.</li>
            <li> Their company is located in New York.  </li>
            <li> I live in New York.  </li>
            <li> It reduces all the swelling and redness, seems to coax the hairs up towards the surface, and keeps new ones from forming.  </li>
            <li> The spots (or perhaps new ones) are still there, but they are clearing and the are not as irritated.</li>
            <li> I have tried Bliss Ingrown Eliminator Pads, Hovan&#x27;s Medi Cream, Bikini Zone Medicated Cream and Min New York Solution2</li>
            <li> Loved the applicator, but ultimately was not effective for me.</li>
            <li> Next, it does have kinda a funny smell, but so does the pfb vanish, and it&#x27;s gone after a couple seconds.  </li>
            <li> I will say that I have been curious about the difference between this and tend skin&#x27;s sister product \\&quot;bump be gone,\\&quot; which I believe is specifically made for razor bumps and which I nearly ordered to refill this roll-on, but decided to get the original.</li>
            <li> I used it twice a day for the first couple of weeks and now I use it daily after I shower.</li>
            <li> and this product resolves the issue completely!</li>
            <li> The rollon application method is pretty gross.</li>
            <li> and my bumps are almost completely gone, I have considerably fewer ingrown hairs and the redness has disappeared!  </li>
            <li> Also be careful of using this product too often as it can dry out the skin &amp; cause more irritation during shaving or hair breakage during waxing</li>
            <li> In my most recent order to re-stock my TendSkin supply, I found this little do-dad.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still showing as not being shipped on Amazon, so clearly there are some communications issues with AmericaRx.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and so I wanted something to clear them up.  </li>
            <li> Refillable - well sort of - you end up wasting a lot of product as there isn&#x27;t clear directions on how to refill the product</li>
            <li> The last time that I ran out I could definitely tell a huge difference until I got more,this will definitely be a product that I will keep on hand!</li>
            <li> Complete BS.</li>
            <li> The roll on bottle allows there to be no wasted product, and unlike the pfb vanish, it is refillable, whereas the pfb vanish bottle can&#x27;t be opened from what I can see.    </li>
            <li> Tend Skin cleared up the few bikini bumps I had and leaves my skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Use it every time I shave sensitive areas and works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I use it every time I shave and so far have had no issues with irritations or ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> This fixed that problem</li>
            <li> He likes it so much that I just ordered a larger bottle of just the liquid, and he refills the roll-on and takes it with him when he travels, etc.    </li>
            <li> too self conscious knowing that someone might notice it).</li>
            <li> Since I started using it the old bumps, even ones I thought were scars, have gone away.</li>
            <li> With the roller there is absolutely no waste</li>
            <li> I use it every night and sometimes it&#x27;s a very noticeable difference just one day later!</li>
            <li> Tried using this for perhaps a month or so and found no improvement as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> Its not clearing it up completely but dose make my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> Easier to not waste product</li>
            <li> : My old one quit on me.  </li>
            <li> Does it completely fix everything?</li>
            <li> I have seriously sensitive skin, esp around my bikini line, and this stuff coupled with a Microdermabrasion mitt keeps 99% of razor burn and ingrown hairs in check.</li>
            <li> And that putting alcohol on your skin after shaving is an old barber&#x27;s trick.  </li>
            <li> Not only was it messy, but this method used more Tend Skin with each application.</li>
            <li> (although the latter isn&#x27;t worth mentioning, entirely ineffective).</li>
            <li> It is defiantly worth every penny spent.</li>
            <li> The roll on ball makes application so quick and easy and you don&#x27;t have to mess with wasted product on a cotton ball or have to wash any residue off of your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mostly alcohol, which evaporates quickly, but it does leave a slightly tacky feeling behind, although very minute.</li>
            <li> It stings a little when you use it (like rubbing alcohol would) but it keeps the pores clean and helps guard against ingrown hairs and irritation.  </li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t completely eliminated razor burn as I had hoped, but it definitely minimizes any bumps as long as I&#x27;m sure to follow the other steps of my shaving routine along with it.</li>
            <li> You know the kind of product that you are just afraid that it will finish one day even if you are using it for the first day....</li>
            <li> The Main  Ingredients (Of 22) Are Acetylsalicylate (Aspirin), And Alcohol;However, I Actually Prefer It</li>
            <li> There simply is NO other product that works like Tend Skin!  </li>
            <li> I was never able to use razors without getting huge bumps.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was new to using epilators, so I read on-line about regular exfoliation to avoid ingrown hair, well, exfoliate</li>
            <li> did absolutely nothing for me except dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> All the negatives are common and temporary, however the positives results are most definitely not.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a major difference in amount of bumps on my legs.</li>
            <li> Only downside is on dry days you&#x27;ll have to use a moisturizer on top of it, but other than that, it&#x27;s the only product I use.    </li>
            <li> First, it stings, but really, no more than alcohol or any alcohol based aftershave, which makes sense, since Alcohol is the main ingredient.  </li>
            <li> I am hoping with regular use that all issues with disappear completely.  </li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a tip for frequent travelers, though: Only fill it about halfway; then, cut the thumb off of a surgical glove and pull it over the uncovered roller ball end and screw the cap on over the surgical glove rubber.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the stuff you can buy at drug stores, but there is nothing that offers the same results!</li>
            <li> Roller barely works.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical spending the same price for the roller with 2.5 ounces versus the 4oz, but so glad I did!</li>
            <li> It burns a little when you first put it on</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s a convenient way to apply this solution, I was not prepared for the tweezing-the-hair-downstairs effect the first time this little ball grabbed a stray...</li>
            <li> The first few times I used it (and I&#x27;ve used tend skin before)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a person that usually sees immediate results and finds success in a product like this</li>
            <li> Spent years fighting ingrown hair issues following shaving (particularly in the bikini area)</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t find that too much or too little product comes out with the roller ball as others have mentioned.</li>
            <li> Must have for every men especially body groomers, it helped not only prevent any razor/electric shaver bumps but also clear old thick bumps and marks as well...</li>
            <li> The small roll on is very convenient to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had razor bumps on my face and neck for as long as I&#x27;ve had facial hair.  </li>
            <li> It seems like they all help equally, somewhat but not completely.</li>
            <li> so so she suggested this a long while back.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my hair shows up less frequently, and the bumps are disappearing.</li>
            <li> We have used other products both cheaper and way more expensive.</li>
            <li> Ever since using it I have had little to no trouble with shaving irritation.</li>
            <li> The old bottles were wasteful and messy.  </li>
            <li> It has not completely eliminated this issue for me, but does seem to make a difference in the number and severity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll save you money in the long run because you&#x27;re not wasting liquid each time as you would be if you were trying to juggle cotton balls or dribble it over q-tips (or wasting disposable cotton balls and q-tips too for that matter).  </li>
            <li> The roller really cuts down on waste from using cotton balls and swabs to apply.</li>
            <li> I have tried several other products to reduce the irritation and ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products such as PFB Vanish, and some others, I can&#x27;t remember names.</li>
            <li> the bottle lasts me a very long time.</li>
            <li> Recommend use in conjunction with Cera-Ve Lotion to prevent dry skin.</li>
            <li> It does dry out the hair bums</li>
            <li> doesnt seem to dry my skin.</li>
            <li> It does sting a bit and dry out the skin, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> The manufacturer actually offers a small sample on their website so I paid the 3 or 4 bucks for shipping to try it.  </li>
            <li> and now im left with dark marks...</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m not sure if because i have sensitive skin that in the area where i applied the product my skin began peeling after a week of use.</li>
            <li> I have course thick African American hair and tend skin is the only thing that keeps me from getting hair bumps.</li>
            <li> The roller ball moves only slightly and</li>
            <li> Guys, use this product for your neck,,, I&#x27;ve been using for only 4 days, and not one single razor bump!!!!    </li>
            <li> Apply gently with caution, or the burning sensation will be the least of your concerns!</li>
            <li> The only negative is that the the roller ball does not rotate easily and makes it slightly difficult to apply the product.</li>
            <li> However that is no longer an option now (military)</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> After using this product for almost a month now, there is dead skin particles and \\&quot;floaty things\\&quot; in the container.. which to get rid of you would need to dump the entire product.</li>
            <li> as hair starts growing, it become harder for the roll to work.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of use, I notice i don&#x27;t have inflammed red skin anymore when i wax my face.</li>
            <li> When I was in the military</li>
            <li> I spent all kinds of time trying to file and sand away at the roller and ball</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly facial and body hair, with which I am constantly fighting a battle.  </li>
            <li> Not only do I have one less thing to carry with me when traveling or staying at a friend&#x27;s house for the night, but it&#x27;s small enough to go in a carry-on on an airplane (under 3oz).  </li>
            <li> as such I end up having to just drag the ball across the skin surface while getting very little product out.  </li>
            <li> I was constantly using cotton swabs to use tend skin previously and although it&#x27;s not a lot it was still waste throwing the cotton swabs away every day.</li>
            <li> and then I use it every other day.  </li>
            <li> not sure if that roll on actually spread sufficient amount of solution.</li>
            <li> As an extra precaution, I also stow the &amp;#34;surgically sealed&amp;#34; contained roll-on in a separate Ziplock plastic bag just in case the Tend Skin manages to leak past the glove/rubber seal trick.</li>
            <li> Only put small amounts into roll on at a time for use, that way you prevent evaporation.</li>
            <li> Would give it 5 stars if it got rid of every single bump, but I still get about 4, 5 little bumps</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the roll on (at least the one I received) simply will not roll very much, if at all.  </li>
            <li> , I sort of wish they produced it for other products, or sold empty roll on bottles that you can personalize and fill with other potentially messy liquids</li>
            <li> It subsides quickly, but I found it quite shocking the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li> I found this product on line while searching for a solution to a very serious and sudden outbreak of ingrown facial hair.</li>
            <li> This product does an average job with ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> The product is good but the bottle design is terrible!</li>
            <li> Hands down</li>
            <li> I use Tend Skin on my bikini area after shaving to help cut down on the number on bumps and ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> It keeps stubble down and slows up hair growth.  </li>
            <li> It is alcohol based so it will burn like crazy if done right after waxing.  </li>
            <li> im black and dark skinned.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the roll-on thinking it would make a mess and let too much liquid out.  </li>
            <li> I have tried locally purchased products such as No Bump, with no improvement, so was skeptical about this product.  </li>
            <li> The cotton ball absorbs nearly half of what you pour out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Product contains salicylic acid, which is the active ingredientin ASPIRIN!</li>
            <li> no flaky skin and less breakouts.</li>
            <li> If the roller is no good, it only deserves one star.</li>
            <li> i dont have that issue with skin tight at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;both tend skin and skin tight</li>
            <li> and I felt like there was much less product wasted.  </li>
            <li> Also a little pricey given the ingredients.</li>
            <li> Also, it can be a little drying, but again, so is anything that&#x27;s alcohol based.    </li>
            <li> Thought I might save a little money on this brand.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s hard to use in tight spots - around your eyes or nose, for example.  </li>
            <li> I really needed this but was afraid to purchase because it might not have worked to my \\&quot;standards\\&quot;...</li>
            <li> Biggest waste of money ever.</li>
            <li> When I have trouble around my bikini area, this product will take the color away from razor bumps, but not eliminate the bump.</li>
            <li> You have to use it everyday till the irritation is gone</li>
            <li> Took a few weeks</li>
            <li> I have found it harder to find lately.</li>
            <li> I prefer it to using a cotton ball which can waste up to 30% of your product.  </li>
            <li> (aloe vera, witch hazel, tea tree oil, coconut oil, apple cider vinegar are a few that come to mind).</li>
            <li> There is minimal discomfort when applying immediately after a shave, and when I say minimal, I mean hardly noticeable at all.</li>
            <li> and I usually get bumps down there</li>
            <li> I bought this for my significant other who gets very bad razor bumps under his chin.</li>
            <li> After getting some pretty bad irritation with ingrowns after waxing, i was recommended this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The little ball thats supposed to roll it on constantly sticks, so it&#x27;s basically useless.</li>
            <li> No more nasty razor rash or infected in grown hairs (sorry for the visual, but let&#x27;s be honest).</li>
            <li> It applies an even, thin layer to your face, and doesn&#x27;t cause spills, or dry out like cotton balls or pads.  </li>
            <li> I have used the product for years and THIS little gem of an applicator is GENIUS!</li>
            <li> I moved recently and was unable to find it around here.</li>
            <li> I bought this small size just to test it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how these 1 or 2 star reviewers are using it, but I don&#x27;t find it abrasive at all...</li>
            <li> There is no magical solution...</li>
            <li> No more razor burn.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t have time to write a review</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff in helping combat the horrible shaving bumps!</li>
            <li> just not sure it did anything.  </li>
            <li> Definitely not magical though:</li>
            <li> I had been trying to only shave when necessary to avoid terrible red bumps and irritation.</li>
            <li> like I usually would.</li>
            <li> I have to apply crazy pressure for it to barely move.</li>
            <li> I got tired of trying to track it down when I ran out of the product, so I started using aloe, and then a toner, or lotion with alpha hydroxy.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard on my saddle area.</li>
            <li> Hard to find and</li>
            <li> Should be used after you shave for at least two days everytime after you shower.</li>
            <li> One star for the roll on (again at least the one I received).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> at least a couple months, maybe longer</li>
            <li> it sings like &amp;#34;Home Alone&amp;#34; but razor burn no more!</li>
            <li> It took about a week and a half to receive the product, which to me seems absolutely absurd.  </li>
            <li> Seriously works wonders.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had bad razor bumps from shaving on my legs and over the last month of using this the bumps are slowly disappearing!</li>
            <li> I was afraid it was going to sting due to the Isopropyl Alcohol in it, but I have never had any issues with it.  </li>
            <li> therefore you have to press very hard against your head and face to get it to roll.</li>
            <li> or else I will continue to poorly review this item.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve never had a problem with the Tend Skin irritating my skin.  </li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using this product I haven&#x27;t gotten any bumps and can use a razor when I use together with shave secret oil.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m slightly confused as to the refillable part...  </li>
            <li> It is way to thin to splash on.</li>
            <li> It has helped with the worse itching i would get after shaving as well.  </li>
            <li> However, I may be wrong about how your product will work, since mine arrived seriously EXPIRED.</li>
            <li> I get ingrown hairs on parts of my neck, and this saves me the trouble of having to dig them out with a pair of tweezers (which is quite painful).  </li>
            <li> It was always a point of concern, I of course hated how they looked and felt, and would opt to just grown facial hair as to prevent them from being as noticeable.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The roll on applicator is way more convenient</li>
            <li> This product burns like heck but does minimize bumps and razor burn. Should be used after you shave for at least two days everytime after you shower.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Eliminates ingrown hairs if used daily.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm! I use it after waxing and have NO issues!</li>
            <li> Must have for every men especially body groomers, it helped not only prevent any razor/electric shaver bumps but also clear old thick bumps and marks as well...</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. I moved recently and was unable to find it around here. I bought some bump stop stuff, but it didn&#x27;t work as well. Thanks Amazon for stocking this stuff! This is truly an amazing product! As a side note, the area needs to be completely dry before applying or it will not work as well. :)</li>
            <li> I just started waxing my face and was very upset to see bumps.  I googled the problem and this product came up.  I bought this small size just to test it and I am not disappointed.  It&#x27;s several weeks of waxing later and there are no bumps.  It burns if you use it right away.  I wait until the next day and then I use it every other day.  Between this and using St. Ives&#x27; exfoliant (found here on Amazon) I&#x27;m very happy with waxing now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely order the larger size and refill the roller which keeps me from wasting it using cotton balls and there is no leakage when using the roller.</li>
            <li> Loved the applicator, but ultimately was not effective for me. It definitely helped calm irritation, but did not decrease ingrown hair. Also a little pricey given the ingredients. Recommend use in conjunction with Cera-Ve Lotion to prevent dry skin.</li>
            <li> Tend Skin is great for any ingrown hairs and very easy to use if used on a regular basis; it prevents ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> Great product I swear by it. My wife got me to try it because I often break out with hair bumps after shaving my head and my face. I have course thick African American hair and tend skin is the only thing that keeps me from getting hair bumps. It&#x27;s pricey (especially at Ulta) but if you break out in hair bumps like I do this baby is worth it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I get full Brazilian waxes.  Since using this stuff, I rarely get an ingrown hair.  Love how I can use the travel cap and not have any product leakage in my luggage.  I also use it to freshen up my arm pits after getting sweaty.</li>
            <li> Yeah I just purchased this product and it won&#x27;t even open. I DEMAND my money back or else I will continue to poorly review this item. Biggest waste of money ever. Complete BS.</li>
            <li> If you havery razor bumps buy this product.  It works fabulously!</li>
            <li> not a miracle but helps.</li>
            <li> I have used Tend Skin for years now (absolutely love it).  I get ingrown hairs on parts of my neck, and this saves me the trouble of having to dig them out with a pair of tweezers (which is quite painful).  Now I don&#x27;t have to get a cotton ball or anything to put it on... just roll it on and go!  I&#x27;m not sure how these 1 or 2 star reviewers are using it, but I don&#x27;t find it abrasive at all... you get the gentle sting if you put it on right after you shave, but it&#x27;s not unbearable.  This isn&#x27;t a \\&quot;use once and all your problems will go away\\&quot; product.  There is no magical solution... you have to actually USE it.  I put mine on usually right after I shave, and the following morning.  I used to have to SCRUB my neck daily to get the same effectiveness as Tend Skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely recommend this product, but not the vendor AmericaRx.  Their company is located in New York.  I live in New York.  It took about a week and a half to receive the product, which to me seems absolutely absurd.  Days ago I had contacted the vendor about the status (since it had been a week since I ordered it and received no indication of it shipping) and received no answer.  Also I&#x27;ve received the product and it&#x27;s still showing as not being shipped on Amazon, so clearly there are some communications issues with AmericaRx.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall awesome product, but BEWARE of vendor AmericaRx!</li>
            <li> Great for ingrown hairs and acne. It has salicylic acid which helps skin turnover. It is the best for after waxing or shaving bumps.</li>
            <li> Love the roller. Makes it so convientent to apply. Especially since it&#x27;s recommend to apply twice a day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had razor bumps on my face and neck for as long as I&#x27;ve had facial hair.  It was always a point of concern, I of course hated how they looked and felt, and would opt to just grown facial hair as to prevent them from being as noticeable. Also for the record I am an african american male.    However that is no longer an option now (military) and so I wanted something to clear them up.  Bought this as well as PFB Vanish but the Tend Skin arrived first so that&#x27;s what I used.  I have to say it works amazingly well.  I&#x27;m no stranger to alcohol and dissolved aspirin on my face but this actually works.  It reduces all the swelling and redness, seems to coax the hairs up towards the surface, and keeps new ones from forming.  The roll on bottle allows there to be no wasted product, and unlike the pfb vanish, it is refillable, whereas the pfb vanish bottle can&#x27;t be opened from what I can see.    However it does have it&#x27;s downsides.  First, it stings, but really, no more than alcohol or any alcohol based aftershave, which makes sense, since Alcohol is the main ingredient.  Next, it does have kinda a funny smell, but so does the pfb vanish, and it&#x27;s gone after a couple seconds.  Also, it can be a little drying, but again, so is anything that&#x27;s alcohol based.    So all in all, this product works excellently.  I use it in conjunction with a buff puf to help exfoliate despite the website saying not to do that, it&#x27;s fine for me.  All the negatives are common and temporary, however the positives results are most definitely not.</li>
            <li> I had been using Bikini Zone and thought that was decent stuff. It does not compare to Tend Skin. Tend Skin cleared up the few bikini bumps I had and leaves my skin silky smooth. I shave my bikini area and it was so smooth and flawless that the person I was seeing thought I had waxed. I also use it on my underarms...same results, baby smooth skin. I will continue to purchase Tend Skin in both the roll on and squeeze bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve known tend skin for ages. It works perfect on ingrown and razor burns</li>
            <li> The best skin care for men of color</li>
            <li> This is miracle liquid. I still get the occasional ingrown hair but this product makes a night and day difference.</li>
            <li> so much easier to use than having to put on a cotton ball!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I wish I would have found this years ago!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for 5+ years.  It works great! The formula seems to have gotten a lil weaker throughout the years but still does a great job at preventing breakouts and making the ones I get from time to time go away!</li>
            <li> So glad this comes in a roll on. The roller really cuts down on waste from using cotton balls and swabs to apply. This stuff is the TRUTH for stopping ingrown hairs! Thank you, Tend Skin!</li>
            <li> Works as expected. Just watch out. Prolonged exposure will cause you skin to peel. I guess it works like a hardcore exfoliant. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> this stuff is like magic. I had ingrown hairs that had been there for months and this took care of them in 2 days. now I don&#x27;t bother with waxing because its easy enough to shave and use this product for a bump free bikini line</li>
            <li> I had been using face trimmers which were good but I decided to grow a goatee and to keep it crisp lookin I used my razor I had 3 days of sexy goatee and smooth skin then the razor bumps came all over my neck .I ordered tend skin on Tuesday and got it Friday.cut my facial hair with the clippers and rolled this stuff on and of course it stung.So its been 3 days and the bumps are almost gone so this stuff works</li>
            <li> This product has helped eliminate most ingrown hairs along my bikini line and has minimized the bumps/ingrown hairs that are still there. If you have any open cuts or anything like that, this stuff does sting! I feel that this product is the equivalent of rubbing alcohol, so if you want to save some money just dab on  some rubbing alcohol. After using this product for almost a month now, there is dead skin particles and \\&quot;floaty things\\&quot; in the container.. which to get rid of you would need to dump the entire product. the roll on part is convenient. however i would recommend saving your money and buying rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> works well  feels smooth n fresh</li>
            <li> i would constantly get ingrown hairs and bumps on my neck after shaving... NOT ANYMORE!  After using this i rarely see any bumps ... great product. will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> This product did not help with razor burn/bumps at all. The only thing it did was cause my skin to peel horribly. Almost like a sunburn! I will not be repurchasing this product.</li>
            <li> I have fallen in love with Tend Skin. It&#x27;s just as good as Min NY but much cheaper. Love it and will keep on buying it.</li>
            <li> Product is great and did help with razor bumps. This 2.5 fl oz travel size bottle is convenient when travelling.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see many results. This product has so many positive reviews. I will give it one more try.</li>
            <li> An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure! I roll this onto my skin after I shave and it prevents red bumps and ingrown hairs. It&#x27;s aftershave. It&#x27;s alcohol based so it will sting a tiny bit, but it feels fresh, not painful. Great product.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t make it through the summer without!  Great for underarms and bikini area--I suffered with horrible razor burn before I found this product.  Definitely worth every cent!</li>
            <li> Best thing on the market for preventing razor bumps. Hands down</li>
            <li> Use it every time I shave sensitive areas and works like a charm. No more razor burn.</li>
            <li> This product is great!  Tend skin does exactly what it claims to and my bumps are almost completely gone, I have considerably fewer ingrown hairs and the redness has disappeared!  The only negative is that the the roller ball does not rotate easily and makes it slightly difficult to apply the product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome and definitely helps keep the ingrown hairs at bay.  I still get them as it is inevitable when you epilate, however I think that because I use this stuff, I don&#x27;t get nearly as many ingrown hairs.  It stings a little when you use it (like rubbing alcohol would) but it keeps the pores clean and helps guard against ingrown hairs and irritation.  I think it works great!</li>
            <li> It works like magic!  Ingrown hairs, razor bumps, pimples… they all vanish in what seems like no time at all.  And I&#x27;ve never had a problem with the Tend Skin irritating my skin.  Yes, it can be drying, but that&#x27;s easily remedied with moisturizer.  And this new roll-on dispenser is fantastic?  The old bottles were wasteful and messy.  The roll-on is a huge improvement.  Give it a try!</li>
            <li> I really needed this but was afraid to purchase because it might not have worked to my \\&quot;standards\\&quot;...it did!  I love it and will cherish forever :P</li>
            <li> great product for sugaring or waxing!</li>
            <li> Thank you great product</li>
            <li> NOT AS IMPRESSED AS HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE ON HIS FACE DONT SEE HIM USING IT, USED IT A MONTH THEN QUIT</li>
            <li> Before this roll-on, one had to apply Tend Skin with a cotton-ball. Not only was it messy, but this method used more Tend Skin with each application. The refillable roll on is an excellent idea, is more efficient and lasts longer. Tend skin is the only product I&#x27;ve ever used that simply prevents razor bumps. Period.</li>
            <li> Its good, will eventually clear the ingrown hair spots I&#x27;m sure.  I&#x27;ve been using it 3 weeks.  The spots (or perhaps new ones) are still there, but they are clearing and the are not as irritated.</li>
            <li> This product does a great job getting rid of ingrown hairs and bumps.</li>
            <li> Well I have to tell you, I wasn&#x27;t convinced this would work, BUT, it does. I don&#x27;t know how but it takes the bumps away. It takes a day or two, it&#x27;s not instant, not for me anyway. It&#x27;s a bit smelly but not bad. Hey, if it works, I can put up with it!</li>
            <li> Just used this on my bikini area after shaving and I had no issues with ingrown hairs or bumps.  I used it twice a day for several days, as recommended on the bottle.</li>
            <li> Although the product works well. The roll on is nothing to bring home to mom. It doesn&#x27;t quite roll therefore you have to press very hard against your head and face to get it to roll. Even then it doesn&#x27;t roll very well. But what you gonna do? If there is a better way to apply this product please let me know.</li>
            <li> You know the kind of product that you are just afraid that it will finish one day even if you are using it for the first day.... well it&#x27;s that product,,,,,,,, I recommand it 10 million times. I usually don&#x27;t have time to write a review but this deserve it&#x27;s 5 stars.........  Guys, use this product for your neck,,, I&#x27;ve been using for only 4 days, and not one single razor bump!!!!    But I will not recomment the Roll on though, because after 4 use the lotion becomes dirty, it&#x27;s best to use with a cotton on your face and neck after shaving,,,,    Again,,, it&#x27;s the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My son swears this is the best product on the planet and says it&#x27;s the only made that actually does what it&#x27;s suppose to do!  It&#x27;s worth the money because it really WORKS!  So the product justifies the price and it&#x27;s refillable.  Great buy!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! Wish I would have discovered it years ago. Love that it is a roll-on too, easy delivery of product. Someone had commented that nothing came out, wonder if they forgot to remove the shipping/travel cap before &amp;#34;assembling&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used. No more nasty razor rash or infected in grown hairs (sorry for the visual, but let&#x27;s be honest). Simply amazing product!  This works on underarms, bikini area, legs and even my husbands face! Best. Product. Ever!</li>
            <li> Great, great products. Clears up embarrassing bumps quickly and prevents them from ever happening. Will burn a but if not used correctly. Well worth it.</li>
            <li> Tend skin is indispensable if you engage in any kind of hair removal and are prone to getting ingrown hairs.  I have thick, curly facial and body hair, with which I am constantly fighting a battle.  I use tend skin after shaving, waxing, or even lasering, and it really helps the ingrowns work their way to the surface.  Only downside is on dry days you&#x27;ll have to use a moisturizer on top of it, but other than that, it&#x27;s the only product I use.    The roll on applicator is by far the best way to use tend skin.  It applies an even, thin layer to your face, and doesn&#x27;t cause spills, or dry out like cotton balls or pads.  Great for refilling from larger bottles.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!  Nothing I have ever tried works better!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as it was promoted.</li>
            <li> Luv this stuff....its a great travel option....def recommend buying. helps in no longer using the pads and reusable. luv it</li>
            <li> This stuff works great. I use it almost everyday in the summer when I tend to shave more. It gets rid of razor bumps fast. My husband uses it as an after shave too. It burns a little when you first put it on but I love it.</li>
            <li> I have used Tend Skin products for a while now so I was interested in this Roll On form factor I had never seen in stores.  Unfortunately, the roll on (at least the one I received) simply will not roll very much, if at all.  The roller ball moves only slightly and as such I end up having to just drag the ball across the skin surface while getting very little product out.  I will continue to use the solution but not the Roll On.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five stars for the Tend Skin solution.  One star for the roll on (again at least the one I received).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One caution:  This product can not be returned to be Amazon if your Roll On also does not roll which is understandable but you will have paid $15+ dollars for 2.5 ounces of product.</li>
            <li> No burning, no problems...just comfort/relief of irritation feels instant to me. Smooth, non-irritated skin post shave use and days later! Rec&#x27;d quick!  Will 100% buy again!!</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for 2 months. Stuff just works. I can&#x27;t say it will work for all, but as for me and my neck (shaved head) and chin. It has worked tremendously.</li>
            <li> How did I not know about this stuff before?!? It is seriously as good as all the reviews say! So impressed. Worked after first application!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing! I&#x27;ve tried lots of things for my folliculitis and only this has worked. My legs don&#x27;t get red bumps anymore after shaving or waxing. I have also used it on small bumps on my face and it works great.</li>
            <li> I use Tend Skin on my bikini area after shaving to help cut down on the number on bumps and ingrown hairs. It has not completely eliminated this issue for me, but does seem to make a difference in the number and severity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind, especially on sensitive, freshly shaved skin, that this stuff can burn. It subsides quickly, but I found it quite shocking the first time I tried it. Also, the nature of the roller ball, it will grab any tiny hairs that happen to be hanging around. While it&#x27;s a convenient way to apply this solution, I was not prepared for the tweezing-the-hair-downstairs effect the first time this little ball grabbed a stray... wowsers!! OUCH! Apply gently with caution, or the burning sensation will be the least of your concerns! Perhaps next time I will buy a different packaging and use a cotton ball to apply.</li>
            <li> Works fantastic even better than by previous brand I used Whish. I like how it&#x27;s a roll on and refillable too.</li>
            <li> Gets rid of ingrown hairs.  Since using this product, I have none!</li>
            <li> This has improved my face a lot. I used to get razor bumps whenever I shaved my face but, thanks to this product my face has  zero razor bumps.</li>
            <li> ten skin is the best product I have used in 20 years where have its been, love this for black men.</li>
            <li> great product...seems to help with bumps</li>
            <li> This is a great product that delivers on its promise. The small roll on is very convenient to use.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and was excited to finally get rid of my ingrown hairs. Unfortunate, this didn&#x27;t work. I followed the directions perfectly but it made no difference in my ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I love Tend Skin and thought that the roll-on applicator would be awesome.  It&#x27;s not.  It doesn&#x27;t roll at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Tend Skin works wonders on my ingrowns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;You might as well buy it in a different container because the roller on this doesn&#x27;t work at all.  At all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zero stars for the container, five stars for the contents, so three stars overall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had bad razor bumps from shaving on my legs and over the last month of using this the bumps are slowly disappearing!</li>
            <li> This is the best ting for ingrown hair, and pimples.&lt;br /&gt;Almost overnight it dries me out. I always have some in my travel bags.</li>
            <li> Why haven&#x27;t I been using this all along?!? This stuff works great</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t completely eliminated razor burn as I had hoped, but it definitely minimizes any bumps as long as I&#x27;m sure to follow the other steps of my shaving routine along with it.</li>
            <li> I love it! I wax and I usually get bumps down there but right after I waxed I used this product and there weren&#x27;t and bumps or redness at all. I would really suggest it if you&#x27;re waxing.</li>
            <li> This product does an average job with ingrown hair. It is alcohol based so it will burn like crazy if done right after waxing.  The roll on bottle makes it very easy to apply though.  It does not seem to travel well.  The bottle leaks when taken on planes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not entirely sure if this is exactly tend skin formula. The first few times I used it (and I&#x27;ve used tend skin before) it didn&#x27;t work exactly like the one I&#x27;ve bought from the salon. And it didn&#x27;t smell the same either. But it seems to be better after the first few uses so I don&#x27;t know if that was just a fluke.</li>
            <li> Just started using it, and the actually formula seems okay, too early to tell. However I wish I read the reviews about the packaging! It&#x27;s TERRIBLE! The little ball thats supposed to roll it on constantly sticks, so it&#x27;s basically useless. You have to open it up and dab in on with cotton balls. So my rating is formula: B+, packaging: F-.</li>
            <li> This is good for travel. The product itself is good. I use it every time I shave and so far have had no issues with irritations or ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> The roll-on worked great and I felt like there was much less product wasted.  Easy to apply directly to the affected area.  Love this also because it&#x27;s refillable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a person that usually sees immediate results and finds success in a product like this but this has become a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; for after shaving.  Ever since using it I have had little to no trouble with shaving irritation.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to everyone I know who complains of razor bumps. Exfoliate using warm water and a wash cloth twice a day, followed by this roll-on. Be consistent and patient. Can also be used as deodorant in a bind.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two weeks now and I have yet to notice a difference. There is minimal discomfort when applying immediately after a shave, and when I say minimal, I mean hardly noticeable at all. The scent is a bit like rubbing-alcohol and there is no residue or stickiness. When I have trouble around my bikini area, this product will take the color away from razor bumps, but not eliminate the bump. I had high hopes for this product and am still waiting to see what it can do for me. Until then, it&#x27;s just a so-so.</li>
            <li> Like the product, but the roll-on bottle isn&#x27;t great.  Nice that it can be re-filled, however if you tighten the applicator lid down too much to prevent leaking, then the roller doesn&#x27;t turn easily.</li>
            <li> Works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and its great stuff! I was skeptical about the roll-on thinking it would make a mess and let too much liquid out.  The roller is perfect!  It works so much better than I had expected!  It really lets out just the perfect amount of product and you arent wasting any that is absorbed into a cotton round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The roller is going to make my life easier and I will use it more since it is one step now.</li>
            <li> I have had several issues with shaving and razor bumps as well as waxing. I have tried several other products to reduce the irritation and ingrown hairs. My Waxing lady told me about Tend Skin and gave me a sample before I went out to purchase. This stuff works amazing. You have to use it everyday till the irritation is gone and I use it with the roller applicator after showering. Its simple and easy to use and gets the job done. I recommend the roll on applicator because you get more for your money out of the product, instead of using a cotton swab that soaks up the product. Its refillable and you can purchase more refill containers in larger amounts to save money later.</li>
            <li> It does dry out the hair bums</li>
            <li> I found this product on line while searching for a solution to a very serious and sudden outbreak of ingrown facial hair. Not sure what started it, but it wasn&#x27;t cool even though ingrown hair and razor bumps are a huge problem for many of us Black men.&lt;br /&gt; The manufacturer actually offers a small sample on their website so I paid the 3 or 4 bucks for shipping to try it.  Gotta tell you, it made a huge difference right away. The first time I used It my face felt different but my skin loved it.&lt;br /&gt;The fact that the manufacturer lets you try before you buy and sends a lot of information with the sample impressed me. It was working great so ordered the full size bottle here. Product arrived on time and was packaged well. I highly recommend you give it a try.  As long as you follow the instructions I think you will see some very good results.</li>
            <li> I use tend skin on the daily basis for my bikini area, but I have always felt like I was wasting a lot of the product by using cotton pads. This fixed that problem so I&#x27;m incredibly pleased.</li>
            <li> not sure if that roll on actually spread sufficient amount of solution.</li>
            <li> As someone who has waxed their legs for the last 10 years, bumps and ingrown hairs have been a fairly constant problem.  I have tried locally purchased products such as No Bump, with no improvement, so was skeptical about this product.  I must say I have been pleased.  There is a great reduction in bumps and ingrown hairs, by probably 80%.  I am hoping with regular use that all issues with disappear completely.  I will keep using.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my significant other who gets very bad razor bumps under his chin. He started using this as directed and the bumps cleared up within a week. I believe the key is exfoliation, which can be drying, so those who use this will want to take that into consideration. It will also burn if you use it right after shaving, of course.     I also love that this little bottle is refillable. He likes it so much that I just ordered a larger bottle of just the liquid, and he refills the roll-on and takes it with him when he travels, etc.    I will say that I have been curious about the difference between this and tend skin&#x27;s sister product \\&quot;bump be gone,\\&quot; which I believe is specifically made for razor bumps and which I nearly ordered to refill this roll-on, but decided to get the original. But like I said, this works great and I think we&#x27;ll definitely be reordering again and again.</li>
            <li> does the job. doesnt seem to dry my skin. ive been using skin time for years. im black and dark skinned. the roll on for skin time is better. less solution comes out of tend skin, which is good, but the roll on best works when its to skin contact. as hair starts growing, it become harder for the roll to work. i dont have that issue with skin tight at all. and you can easily manage how much solution drips out the roller with the skin tight. thats never an issue. the bottle lasts me a very long time. at least a couple months, maybe longer and thats with almost every day use.&lt;br /&gt;both tend skin and skin tight do the job well.&lt;br /&gt;both sting, but the work.&lt;br /&gt;the roller on skin tight is much better though.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing for ingrown hairs OR incoming zits. Absolutely nukes them away.</li>
            <li> I have had really bad issues with ingrown hairs and razor bumps on my bikini line ever since I can remember. I hated to wear a bathing suit because I was so embarrassed about how it looked (not that anyone was staring at my bikini bottom but I just felt too self conscious knowing that someone might notice it). It didn&#x27;t matter if I shaved, epilated or waxed. I exfoliated and moisturized daily and still got red bumps and ingrown hairs that I just couldn&#x27;t leave alone and ended up making bigger blemishes trying to dig the darn hairs out! I have tried Bliss Ingrown Eliminator Pads, Hovan&#x27;s Medi Cream, Bikini Zone Medicated Cream and Min New York Solution2 (which burned like heck!). While I know they have worked for some, none of them seemed to make any bit of difference for me. But Tend Skin has been my skin savior! I used it twice a day for the first couple of weeks and now I use it daily after I shower. Since I started using it the old bumps, even ones I thought were scars, have gone away. I no longer have red, irritated, bumpy skin and with the exception of ONE new ingrown hair, my bikini line finally looks clear and smooth! I would recommend this to anyone that suffers like I did to give this a try. The roll on ball makes application so quick and easy and you don&#x27;t have to mess with wasted product on a cotton ball or have to wash any residue off of your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I love it!</li>
            <li> it stopped my hair on my chin from become ingrown.It corrected my ingrown hairs about 90 percent. but you must use it every day.</li>
            <li> After getting some pretty bad irritation with ingrowns after waxing, i was recommended this product.&lt;br /&gt;It did absolutely nothing for me except dry out my skin. I continued to get ingrowns and now im left with dark marks...definitely didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Took a few weeks but I rarely have ingrown hairs anymore.  The roll-on version is much more convenient, too.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Have always tried different products for razor burn around my bikini line and nothing seemed to work. This product is the best! Saw improvements right away</li>
            <li> This makes it easier to apply as well saves money.</li>
            <li> Love! Always got tend skin and it works so well! I have found it harder to find lately. I was skeptical spending the same price for the roller with 2.5 ounces versus the 4oz, but so glad I did! I never realized how much tend skin I was wasting putting it on the cotton ball. With the roller there is absolutely no waste and you can cover a bigger area! You can even put it lightly over your eyebrows after tweezing and it works great!</li>
            <li> Gets rid of my ingrown hairs and works as expected - good product</li>
            <li> My skin looks great after I start using this product.</li>
            <li> First off I want to say that this product really does work! I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different things and this is the only product to work on the back of my neck. Would give it 5 stars if it got rid of every single bump, but I still get about 4, 5 little bumps but it&#x27;s not even CLOSE to what I used to get. Also this product burns and my skin gets itchy for about 10 minutes before it goes away, but in all it WORKS! So give it a try</li>
            <li> Tend skin roller is nice. Now I don&#x27;t have to always dig to use a cotton ball</li>
            <li> This is the best!!!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff in helping combat the horrible shaving bumps!</li>
            <li> Amazing! My legs and bikini area are smooth and lack ingrowns for the first time in a long time. It even helps acne from ingrowns on my face. I have started buying the bigger bottles to refill the roll on. I&#x27;m hooked on this product.</li>
            <li> I get razor bumps just thinking about shaving. This product has definitely made a huge difference. Apply it after you shave when you&#x27;re out of the shower and your skin has cooled, and it should prevent most razor burns and rashes. I do need to apply it every day, but I&#x27;m happy to do that as long as I&#x27;m not a red, bumpy mess. Also: this works as a deodorant.</li>
            <li> Great product and I love the roll on!! It enables me to get this product exactly where I need it, without saturating several cotton balls and wasting more than I&#x27;d care to. This product works, believe me, if I don&#x27;t have bumps, IT WORKS!!</li>
            <li> mess cause more bumps than I had</li>
            <li> Great product!!  Nothing has worked as well as this on razor burn/red bumps.  Highly recommended to anyone who gets skin irritation from shaving.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Tend Skin, which does an outstanding job of deterring razor burn, bumps, rashes, etc. -- even though the stuff virtually sets your face on fire after a really close shave.  And this roll-on applicator is a great idea and much more efficient and cost-effective than cotton balls, gauze pads, etc.  But be warned: the applicator is NOT travel-safe -- it leaks like a sieve.  Here&#x27;s a tip for frequent travelers, though: Only fill it about halfway; then, cut the thumb off of a surgical glove and pull it over the uncovered roller ball end and screw the cap on over the surgical glove rubber.  Come to think of it, a Trojan might do the same trick if you happen to travel with those.  Either way, that will keep it from leaking all over your suitcase.  As an extra precaution, I also stow the &amp;#34;surgically sealed&amp;#34; contained roll-on in a separate Ziplock plastic bag just in case the Tend Skin manages to leak past the glove/rubber seal trick.</li>
            <li> Worked right away. It does sting a bit and dry out the skin, but it does the job. I will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> Excellent stuff for ingrowns!</li>
            <li> This is amazing stuff. I&#x27;ve tried the stuff you can buy at drug stores, but there is nothing that offers the same results!</li>
            <li> This stuff really did help my ingrown hairs on my neck. Its not the best smelling stuff and it stings after you apply it but it works.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY product that keep the bumps off the underarms of my teen daughter. If she does not use this... its really bad. We have used other products both cheaper and way more expensive. This is the one!</li>
            <li> This is ok. Others seem to have had a better experience with it. There were still ingrown hairs, but perhaps fewer. I&#x27;ll keep looking for something to help.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is the only product that will help with ingrown hairs and redness. I got tired of trying to track it down when I ran out of the product, so I started using aloe, and then a toner, or lotion with alpha hydroxy. I guess the best option is to use a product that exfoliates gently.</li>
            <li> One of my all time fav products.  This stuff really works with all types of skin irritations.  Love love the roller ball applicator.  So far no leaks or mess &amp; dispenses the perfect amount of product.  Eliminates wasteful need for cotton balls.  It always makes me happy to see an already stellar product get even better!</li>
            <li> Nice roller, very easy to use.  I prefer it to using a cotton ball which can waste up to 30% of your product.  I also like that it is refillable.</li>
            <li> Not in love with the roll on applicator.  If you have body hair it tends to catch.  I&#x27;m a big fan of tend skin though.  really does a great job or keeping me from breaking out on my body.</li>
            <li> Refillable - well sort of - you end up wasting a lot of product as there isn&#x27;t clear directions on how to refill the product</li>
            <li> pretty good product... did what it was supposed to do by removing the razor bumps but i&#x27;m not sure if because i have sensitive skin that in the area where i applied the product my skin began peeling after a week of use.</li>
            <li> This. Stuff. Is. The. Best. I&#x27;m a lady again, instead of a yeti. Bonus: I&#x27;m a non-scratchy, non-bumpy lady. Because this stuff works. I love you, Tend Skin.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B002NVBR24 Tend Skin Tend Skin 2.5 oz Refillable Roll On]] Is NOT 100% Effective, But It Works \\&quot;Okay\\&quot; For Me, As It Has DEFINITELY Lessened The Occurrence Of My Razor Bumps, And The Ones That DO Appear, Go Through A 2 Day \\&quot;Whitehead-Phase\\&quot;, Before Disappearing Completely.  I&#x27;ve Read The Reviews That Mention The Terrible Smell, But One Shouldn&#x27;t Be Surprised, Considering The Main  Ingredients (Of 22) Are Acetylsalicylate (Aspirin), And Alcohol;However, I Actually Prefer It This Way, Since I&#x27;d Rather Apply My OWN Fragrance To Take Care Of The Smell, Than Have The Product-Makers Try To Mask It Themselves, By Adding A Fragrance That May Be Just As Unpleasant, Or Simply NOT To One&#x27;s Personal Taste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tend Skin for years. I&#x27;ve even converted my husband to it. Nothing I&#x27;ve ever tried is a good at keeping razor burn at bay. Now that they make a roll-on version, it&#x27;s PERFECT!!!! I&#x27;ve always thought a roll-on would be a great idea, as with the bottle version you waste the product by first applying Tend Skin to a cotton ball (or whatever used to apply the product). The cotton ball absorbs nearly half of what you pour out of the bottle. Now the roll on is here!! I&#x27;d highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My son says it works. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Only product that has worked for my son!</li>
            <li> This is one instance where you should believe all the great reviews and hype surrounding this product! It&#x27;s not overrated, this stuff works and the refillable roll-on is a definite plus (great portable size for travel, I get it through TSA as a carry-on without any issues), helps make application targeted with precision/less messy, and you can buy the larger 8 oz sizes for refill. It&#x27;ll save you money in the long run because you&#x27;re not wasting liquid each time as you would be if you were trying to juggle cotton balls or dribble it over q-tips (or wasting disposable cotton balls and q-tips too for that matter).  If you&#x27;re hesitant about buying the chunky 8 oz bottle, and just want to test it out to see if tend skin works for your skin, get the roll on. This roll on idea is so cute (it&#x27;s basically a cap fitted over a bottle that has its own screw cap to prevent leakage), I sort of wish they produced it for other products, or sold empty roll on bottles that you can personalize and fill with other potentially messy liquids (aloe vera, witch hazel, tea tree oil, coconut oil, apple cider vinegar are a few that come to mind). One thing to keep in mind for tend skin is that since it&#x27;s alcohol based, it tends to evaporate. Use it consistently out of the bottle before it evaporates, it works better consistently anyways. Best when applied after shower since pores are open. In my experience, tend skin definitely trumps GiGi no bump and Bikini Zone and Olay Bikini (although the latter isn&#x27;t worth mentioning, entirely ineffective).</li>
            <li> awesome product, totally does what it advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was new to using epilators, so I read on-line about regular exfoliation to avoid ingrown hair, well, exfoliate I did, and ingrown hair I got. then I read about tend skin, ordered the sample, and now the roll on applicator, convenient and best of all, I don&#x27;t have to worry about forgetting, which have happened with exfoliating. and guess what, I haven&#x27;t had any ingrown hair, and no bumps either, all and all, I am loving it, Tend Skin Rock!!</li>
            <li> Great for my ingrown chin hairs that I get from tweezing those dang course black hairs!!! Ugh!! It helps slough off the excess keratin cells and the salicylic acid penetrates the follicle pores allowing for easy removal and significantly reducing the amount of ingrown hairs! It rolls on nicely.  It does tend to sting if you have any type of preexisting skin irritation like acne.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have tried it all! I though I was going to have to have my bikini line lasered for sure because I am a triathlete, I prefer to have no body hair. I bike several hours at a time and it&#x27;s hard on my saddle area. This product is amazing, resolved all my issues with ingrown hairs without over drying my skin and roll on bottle allows me to take it where ever I go.  I shave and then as soon as I get out of the shower I roll it all over my bikini zone and under my arms.</li>
            <li> This roll-on is really neat, I didn&#x27;t find that too much or too little product comes out with the roller ball as others have mentioned. It&#x27;s mostly alcohol, which evaporates quickly, but it does leave a slightly tacky feeling behind, although very minute. However, I may be wrong about how your product will work, since mine arrived seriously EXPIRED. Make sure not to purchase from the Amazon Fulfillment for BIGFLYSPORTS. Mine EXPIRED 8 MONTHS ago (I found out after I tried it out). Since it was fulfilled by Amazon, I got a refund, but I was hoping to have a replacement sent to me that isn&#x27;t expired. Now I have to re-order it and hope I get one that isn&#x27;t expired again!! I&#x27;m putting this review here for others like me, who rely on the reviews to mention seller issues (who bothers to check on a sellers&#x27; feedback history to verify purchase validity? And even then, you don&#x27;t know what products the feedback is for). P.S. When you get it, you have to open it up, there is a cap inside that you have to remove (although mine wasn&#x27;t sealed?). I can&#x27;t say if it actually works, since this one is going in the trash :P I hope others will see this review and choose the seller wisely to avoid all this trouble.</li>
            <li> It definitely works in getting rid of ingrowns. I use it every night and sometimes it&#x27;s a very noticeable difference just one day later! I haven&#x27;t seen a product this effective in stores, so I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> makes application much easier</li>
            <li> just not sure it did anything.  Tried using this for perhaps a month or so and found no improvement as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> Love this applicator. Need to buy full sealing bottle of tendskin also. Only put small amounts into roll on at a time for use, that way you prevent evaporation.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed.  Thought I might save a little money on this brand.  No way.  Roller barely works.  Tried to fix, ended up spilling most.  Just going to order what I had before.  You think a product design might be tested before going on sale.</li>
            <li> did not work well for ingrown hair</li>
            <li> This has been a life saver for bikini line razor bumps.  I was afraid it was going to sting due to the Isopropyl Alcohol in it, but I have never had any issues with it.  My only issue I sometimes have is when rolling it around the bikini line area, it can sometime pull the hair in the roller ball, but this is user error, and can be avoided.</li>
            <li> The roller makes it SOOO easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I love tend skin, but the roller makes it so easy to use without having to waste product putting in onto a cotton ball, and some of the product wasting out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the roller I love tend skin!</li>
            <li> Its not clearing it up completely but dose make my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> This product is great I been use for while now.look be it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had an issue with controlling ingrown hairs and this helps. It&#x27;s better than using nothing at all. I&#x27;ve tried other products such as PFB Vanish, and some others, I can&#x27;t remember names. It seems like they all help equally, somewhat but not completely. I haven&#x27;t found a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; product yet.</li>
            <li> This roll on applicator makes this product much easier and cleaner to use.  If you use Tend Skin, I would definitely recommend getting the Roll On as well.</li>
            <li> the best.  it sings like &amp;#34;Home Alone&amp;#34; but razor burn no more!</li>
            <li> It really works. Very happy</li>
            <li> Good as a roll on! Easier to not waste product</li>
            <li> Just use the regular bottle with a cotton ball.</li>
            <li> Really helped with shaving bumps and ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Best thing you could ever do for ingrown hairs!</li>
            <li> As a woman of color, I didn&#x27;t know if this product would work on me. I read the reviews saying that it was unisex, but I didn&#x27;t know if it would work after reading the amazon reviews and seeing only men commenting. I decided to try the product anyway. The product does work. After a few weeks of use, I notice i don&#x27;t have inflammed red skin anymore when i wax my face. I have noticed that my hair shows up less frequently, and the bumps are disappearing. Reccommend this product to more women of color.</li>
            <li> Totally cleared my problem</li>
            <li> It actually works as advertised.  I am amazed with no bumps on the bikini line!</li>
            <li> I love tend skin! I have been using it for years after I shave to avoid razor burn. It is the only effective product I have found in preventing razor burn. And the roll on makes application so easy!</li>
            <li> The rolling ball isn&#x27;t very smooth so it doesn&#x27;t roll very well.  I ended up just using cotton swabs to apply the solution instead of the applicator itself.</li>
            <li> Spent years fighting ingrown hair issues following shaving (particularly in the bikini area) and this product resolves the issue completely! The roll on applicator is exceptional as it makes it very easy to apply the product.  SkinTend goes on easily, is absorbed by the skin quickly, does not smell and most importantly...IT WORKS!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of TendSkin.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and years.  I use it after shaving each morning by applying it with a cotton ball to my face.  I&#x27;ve always wondered how much product I must be wasting that get sucked up by the cotton ball.  In my most recent order to re-stock my TendSkin supply, I found this little do-dad.  It&#x27;s AWESOME.  It&#x27;s a re-fillable roll-on device that comes loaded with TendSkin!!!!  It&#x27;s GREAT.  Now I can just roll this all over my face instead of using a cotton ball, which is messier and more wasteful!  The roll-on device applies a good amount while rolling on.  My only complaint is that it&#x27;s hard to use in tight spots - around your eyes or nose, for example.  A pen-sized roll-on version is probably already in the works (if not - I get royalties from that idea!!).  But I&#x27;m psyched to have this and can re-fill it with more TendSkin!!!  Hooray!!!&lt;br /&gt;-&lt;br /&gt;Update: My old one quit on me.  I guess after a year or so of using this, the ball piece wears out.  It stopped rolling smoothly.  I ordered a new one and it works awesome.  Just a note to you that you&#x27;ll need to replace the roll-on bit every year or so.</li>
            <li> Great product. With the roll on I don&#x27;t need cotton balls any longer. When I was in the military I was never able to use razors without getting huge bumps. Since I&#x27;ve been using this product I haven&#x27;t gotten any bumps and can use a razor when I use together with shave secret oil. My face doesn&#x27;t feel like I shaved with sandpaper on fire!</li>
            <li> Best product for ingrown hairs! Must have in between waxes!!!!</li>
            <li> What else is there to say? I suffered from razor bumps my whole life until I found this product. It works like a charm and the roll-on top makes it a quick and easy experience. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Fantastic! the Tend Skin I love but in a roll on! At first I figured it would be awkward or would drip the liquid everywhere, but this delivery system works perfectly. So it&#x27;s even better than cotton rounds because now it&#x27;s much easier to use when there is stubble growing back. Plus as a lady, Tend Skin will mess up your nail polish a little, so this is the perfect application.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay doesn&#x27;t clear any dark spots from ingrown hair.. But eliminates ingrown hair while using!! Could be better but it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> Love this stuff really helps with razor bumps on my neck area. I use it whenever I shave and in between.</li>
            <li> I was using tend skin but had problems if my nails were polished.  Not an issue with this roller ball applicator!</li>
            <li> So far so good. It does the job others before me said it would.</li>
            <li> Great product. Gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I have been using Tend Skin for about thirteen years.  It is the only product I ever found that eliminated the unsightly red bumps on my neck.  I have tender skin, and very coarse beard hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, my review is specific to the roll on.  For years, I used the normal bottle version, applied it to cotton, and dabbed that on my face.  It was a bit wasteful, as the cotton retained much of the liquid, and it also would get through to my fingertips.  They adapted, but at first, the skin was a bit irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The roll on is brilliant.  Not only do I have one less thing to carry with me when traveling or staying at a friend&#x27;s house for the night, but it&#x27;s small enough to go in a carry-on on an airplane (under 3oz).  The applicator ball distributes just the right amount and I would say that overall a bit of time is shaved (pardon the pun) off of my morning routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m slightly confused as to the refillable part...  I guess you just buy bottles and pour them in; it doesn&#x27;t seem to be a cartridge-based system.  I would wonder if, over time, the roller ball will begin to stick, or whether it could harbor bacteria as some types of plastic do.  Also, while it&#x27;s a minor issue, applying the old way with cotton tends to push the solution deeper into the skin, whereas this way it stays a bit more on the surface.  However, after a week of use, I have noticed no reduction in results; it works just as well, just easier.  Great job, Tend Skin, on innovating on an already perfect product!</li>
            <li> This product goes on smoothly and works exactly as described. It is defiantly worth every penny spent. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Works great!!! If you use as directed, you will see results!!</li>
            <li> There simply is NO other product that works like Tend Skin!  So happy they came out with this REFILLABLE roller.  Makes the application much easier.  I&#x27;ve tried them all and will never use anything else for shaving bumps.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Buy if you every get razor bumps/ingrown hairs. I tell everyone I know to buy this stuff! Hard to find and the roll on applicator makes it easy to apply!</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff to deal with shave bumps under my arms and around my bikini line, and I&#x27;m pleased to say it has significantly improved the irritation. Does it completely fix everything? No, but it&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve found so far, so I will continue to use it until I really find a miracle-cure. My main concern was preventing ingrown hairs, and exfoliation combined with this product does a pretty good job of eliminating that.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  For me, underarm ingrown are the worst.  This liquid helped immensely.  Definitely not magical though:( Like pretty much any product, you have to use it every day in order for it to work.</li>
            <li> The product I was formally using was backordered with no information on when it would be available so I started looking for a replacement. I have tried this formula before but never in the roll-on form. This product burns more than the other product I had and has more of a scent but it still does a great job.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! I suffered from terrible razor bumps after I shaved. I noticed a difference with this product in just one week, it&#x27;s really that good. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how the fluid works because the roller doesn&#x27;t apply any to my skin. I spent all kinds of time trying to file and sand away at the roller and ball so it would roll the fluid onto my skin. Nope. If the roller is no good, it only deserves one star.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great. I have seriously sensitive skin, esp around my bikini line, and this stuff coupled with a Microdermabrasion mitt keeps 99% of razor burn and ingrown hairs in check. I&#x27;ve tried another popular brand but will go back to this kind because it doesn&#x27;t have as medicinal smell as the other kind, and I do feel like it works a bit better - for me, that is. Not all things work for everyone of course. I love the roll-on bottle, too. I have been buying it since it only came in pour bottles and this is a welcome change - so much faster and easier to apply and don&#x27;t have to waste any cotton balls!</li>
            <li> I have persistent ingrown hairs on the back of thighs that will just not go away.  After recommendation from a doctor and dermatolgist I was told about this product.  After daily use as directed for two weeks, I have not noticed any change in the ingrown hairs and have not seen it working to prevent ingrown hairs or treat razor bumps either.  Maybe I just need to give it more time and will update my review if anything changes.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It keeps stubble down and slows up hair growth.  I do not like to run out of this product.</li>
            <li> Not a miracle worker, but it does the job.  I&#x27;ve always had bad razor burn and ingrown problems on my legs and bikini area. I&#x27;ve used this product and the Min2 roll on solution, this one seems to work just as well, if not a little better.  And being able to refill the roll-on is a great option. I still get razor burn and ingrown hairs but not to the point that they are causing pain.  The last time that I ran out I could definitely tell a huge difference until I got more,this will definitely be a product that I will keep on hand!</li>
            <li> Roll on is definitely the way to go with this product. It is way to thin to splash on. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> The rollon application method is pretty gross. After a while, the color of the product starts to change from repeated rubs.I prefer the bottle and a cotton pad.</li>
            <li> I works to my surprise!</li>
            <li> good product love the roller</li>
            <li> I like this item a lot, it works well and it was shipped very quickly. I will definitely buy this product again from this seller.</li>
            <li> Seems to be doing the job!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my daughter told me I should. Every time I shave my legs I get bumps so so she suggested this a long while back. So far so good</li>
            <li> It works as a great liquid deodorant and helps to keep under arm razor bumps away.</li>
            <li> It may sting when used, but man is it useful for any shave. My neck looks so much better after using this product, its that good. Try it.</li>
            <li> This has helped with severe razor burn.  I shave with tend skin shaving gel and then apply this after. I have noticed a major difference in amount of bumps on my legs. It has helped with the worse itching i would get after shaving as well.  I buy the bigger bottle to refill the roll on one.  I think the roll on application works great you have to hit a certain angle and it goes on well.</li>
            <li> Did not roll on well at all.</li>
            <li> Seriously works wonders. Definitely recommend for bikini line bumps.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about Tend Skin. I have used the product for years and THIS little gem of an applicator is GENIUS! Love, love, LOVE it.  (WARNING! Product contains salicylic acid, which is the active ingredientin ASPIRIN! DO NOT use if you are allergic to ASPIRIN!)</li>
            <li> been using on acne and it really helps. no flaky skin and less breakouts.</li>
            <li> This just works! I had been trying to only shave when necessary to avoid terrible red bumps and irritation. At first I use this twice a day. Now I use it once a day and sometimes I forget and can skip a day!</li>
            <li> So far so good, has really helped with bumps and razor burn.  But you have to use it consistently.</li>
            <li> The liquid works better than the roller for some reason</li>
            <li> Great product, really works.</li>
            <li> So I discovered it&#x27;s mainly just rubbing alcohol.  And that putting alcohol on your skin after shaving is an old barber&#x27;s trick.  But yes it does work, will I refill with &amp;#34;Ted skin&amp;#34;, probably not because of the cost but I will fill it with rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> The product is good but the bottle design is terrible! The ball just does not roll! I have to apply crazy pressure for it to barely move.</li>
            <li> So disappointed! I always use Tend skin, it&#x27;s a great product against razor bumps and irritation, however this bottle can&#x27;t be used, it can&#x27;t be closed, the bottle with liquid can not be screw to the roller, so the liquid is all over! Waist of money!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking I wouldn&#x27;t like as much as I do. I was constantly using cotton swabs to use tend skin previously and although it&#x27;s not a lot it was still waste throwing the cotton swabs away every day.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s is refillable! great product, love that I am able to easily roll it on with out having to use cotton puffs</li>
            <li> i didnt find that it made a big difference for me</li>
            <li> Tend skin formula is excellent for getting rid of ingrown hairs! I just did not care for the roller ball application. If there is any hair growing above skin level between waxing/shaving, that hair gets caught on the edge of the rollerball &amp; hurts like heck! I finally just removed the top roller portion &amp; used it on a cotton ball like I usually would. Also be careful of using this product too often as it can dry out the skin &amp; cause more irritation during shaving or hair breakage during waxing</li>
            <li> Great product! And the shipping was on time!</li>
