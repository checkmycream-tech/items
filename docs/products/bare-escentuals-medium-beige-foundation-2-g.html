    <ol>
            <li>BareMinerals is an awesome make up.</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Best mineral foundation!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li>I thought Gaby&#x27;s shipped my order timely and provided good service</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get the good deal I was expecting, but I think because it was more inexpensive and I saved taxes I got what I paid for.  </li>
            <li>Love the light weight coverage!!</li>
            <li>I did just switch this lid with the old one and now it is perfect.</li>
            <li>This is a really great product at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>It has an exceptionally good wear life--standing up to the hot, humid climate that is Florida in high summer--while providing excellent sunscreening ability and coverage.  </li>
            <li>Also be sure to know what size you are getting.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t order this online anymore since I want to be sure I&#x27;m paying for a BareMinerals item and not a knock off.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure</li>
            <li>I love how it improves my skin, too.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love their powder foundation.</li>
            <li>I have been a fan of bareMinerals for many years now.</li>
            <li>Love the product.  </li>
            <li>I love this make up.  </li>
            <li>I think for better coverage you may want to order the Primer.</li>
            <li>The foundation is great as usual and provides good coverage.</li>
            <li>It is so light</li>
            <li>I almost ALWAYS read reviews before buying anything online and because I&#x27;m familiar with this product I didn&#x27;t this time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved it which is why i&#x27;ve been a loyal customer for so long.  </li>
            <li>then that the product is great, just a little pricey for the size you get.</li>
            <li>I did some research and learned counterfeit makeup is becoming more and more common.</li>
            <li>Great product, small container.  </li>
            <li>The product was exactly was</li>
            <li>The only days my face felt OK were days I didn&#x27;t wear any makeup.</li>
            <li>This is the only foundation I have used for years, product is good but the size i received was smaller than I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much for such fantastic service - I&#x27;d almost run out and it arrived just in time!  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this buy full size. ....</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a for sure answer what caused the rash but the only thing I changed was my makeup and in the end, it actually cost me more money than if I had just bought direct from a vendor I knew I could trust.</li>
            <li>I had a rash develop on my face right after using my new makeup, it lasted about a month.</li>
            <li>again thanks for the product</li>
            <li>Counterfeit makeup can have very harmful chemicals in them and some, may have never been tested.</li>
            <li>Product is good, but it was a much smaller container than I expected.  </li>
            <li>Good product but not a particularly good value.</li>
            <li>Cost isn&#x27;t worth the much smaller size.</li>
            <li>it was the normal size i buy at the store but its a mini size.  </li>
            <li>I expected though much better presented in a pretty pink bag, thank you!</li>
            <li>I have tried other brands of mineral make up, but bare minerals is the smoothest, more natural looking makeup I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>The product size is much smaller - it is the same size as bareMinerals Warmth, so you are paying full price for a sample size.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Description didn&#x27;t clearly outline that this is the trial size, and was surprised when I received.  </li>
            <li>Nothing else has the natural looking coverage that this gives me.</li>
            <li>, I use it all the time, thanks, wish it came in a bigger size.</li>
            <li>completely misleading</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s half the size of the full size item in the store for around the same price</li>
            <li>I have used Bare Escentuals for 8 years.</li>
            <li>I want the old lid back.</li>
            <li>Thought I watched descriptions carefully but ended up buying a 2 gram product for slightly less than 8 gram product available from non Amazon Prime vendors.  </li>
            <li>This is a mini version of the product for $5 less than the delivered price for the 8 gram (.28 oz) version available from other vendors.</li>
            <li>It also covers up any small imperfections quite nicely, especially if you pair it with the right brushes.</li>

            <li> In the past I have always bought my make-up direct from a BareMinerals boutique ( which they&#x27;ve changed their name to BareEscentuals now).</li>

            <li> I wasn&#x27;t at home when I ordered it but should have waited to see what size I usually get.  </li>

            <li> Not a good value.</li>

            <li> Price to expensive for that.</li>
            <li> brand once in that time and was verrrry disappointed and re-purchased this immediately.  </li>
            <li> Doubtful</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking with this purchase but over priced for size. Do not waste your money on this buy full size. ....</li>
            <li> Same product but much smaller size than I was expecting.  I wasn&#x27;t at home when I ordered it but should have waited to see what size I usually get.  Good product but not a particularly good value.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this was the actual product.  Also be sure to know what size you are getting.  I don&#x27;t order this online anymore since I want to be sure I&#x27;m paying for a BareMinerals item and not a knock off.  BareMinerals is an awesome make up. Just make sure you know what you are getting.</li>
            <li> Price to expensive for that.</li>
            <li> Description didn&#x27;t clearly outline that this is the trial size, and was surprised when I received.  Cost isn&#x27;t worth the much smaller size.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for such fantastic service - I&#x27;d almost run out and it arrived just in time!  The product was exactly was I expected though much better presented in a pretty pink bag, thank you!</li>
            <li> This foundation has been a staple for me for years.  I tried a drugstore &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; brand once in that time and was verrrry disappointed and re-purchased this immediately.  Nothing else has the natural looking coverage that this gives me.</li>
            <li> This is the small version, beware of that before you purchase this.  It&#x27;s a great product but this is the travel size</li>
            <li> Thought I watched descriptions carefully but ended up buying a 2 gram product for slightly less than 8 gram product available from non Amazon Prime vendors.  This is a mini version of the product for $5 less than the delivered price for the 8 gram (.28 oz) version available from other vendors. I will keep it for travel and consider it a lesson learned.</li>
            <li> Used it for years! I always get complements on my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I have tried other brands of mineral make up, but bare minerals is the smoothest, more natural looking makeup I&#x27;ve tried. Maybe a little pricier than the others, but for a reason. I love how it improves my skin, too. Great product!</li>
            <li> The wife loves this stuff!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used Bare Escentuals for 8 years. I absolutely love their powder foundation. It is so light and it makes it feel as if you aren&#x27;t wearing any make up at all. It also covers up any small imperfections quite nicely, especially if you pair it with the right brushes.</li>
            <li> The product size is much smaller - it is the same size as bareMinerals Warmth, so you are paying full price for a sample size.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the one I received did not have the rotating travel lid as shown in the picture. This is a small detail but ends up being a big deal if you just throw it in your purse.</li>
            <li> Product is good, but it was a much smaller container than I expected.  I can get a much larger container of same item at a Sephora or Ulta for same price.</li>
            <li> This is a really great product at a very reasonable price.  It has an exceptionally good wear life--standing up to the hot, humid climate that is Florida in high summer--while providing excellent sunscreening ability and coverage.  Because it is a powder, it never runs off my face when I am engaged in outdoors or sporty activities.  Did I also mention it never spoils like a cream foundation can?</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of bareMinerals for many years now.</li>
            <li> I like it, I use it all the time, thanks, wish it came in a bigger size. again thanks for the product</li>
            <li> I see the benefit of the new lids on the powder make up however it makes it very difficult for me to get enough out to use. I want the old lid back. I did just switch this lid with the old one and now it is perfect. The foundation is great as usual and provides good coverage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using BareMinerals for over 5 years and never once have I ever had an issue with it. I&#x27;ve always loved it which is why i&#x27;ve been a loyal customer for so long.  In the past I have always bought my make-up direct from a BareMinerals boutique ( which they&#x27;ve changed their name to BareEscentuals now). I saw the &amp;#34;same&amp;#34; make up from this vendor and couldn&#x27;t pass up the deal and decided to try it out. Long story short I had a rash develop on my face right after using my new makeup, it lasted about a month.I tried all different things to help it go away but nothing worked. The only days my face felt OK were days I didn&#x27;t wear any makeup. I did some research and learned counterfeit makeup is becoming more and more common. I bought the same makeup but from an actual BareMinerals Boutique and my face is clearing up, thank goodness. I don&#x27;t have a for sure answer what caused the rash but the only thing I changed was my makeup and in the end, it actually cost me more money than if I had just bought direct from a vendor I knew I could trust. Counterfeit makeup can have very harmful chemicals in them and some, may have never been tested. I don&#x27;t know where Gaby&#x27;s purchased the makeup I received from but just do your research anytime you buy makeup from a third party. I thought Gaby&#x27;s shipped my order timely and provided good service it just wasn&#x27;t the quality of product I expected.</li>
            <li> Not a good value. It&#x27;s half the size of the full size item in the store for around the same price</li>
            <li> Best mineral foundation!! Love the light weight coverage!!</li>
            <li> Love the product.  Expected it to be larger in size.</li>
            <li> Great product, small container.  I ordered this thinking it was the normal size i buy at the store but its a mini size.  So look at the size.  Other then that the product is great, just a little pricey for the size you get.</li>
            <li> This is the only foundation I have used for years, product is good but the size i received was smaller than I thought it would be.  I didn&#x27;t get the good deal I was expecting, but I think because it was more inexpensive and I saved taxes I got what I paid for.  That is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.  I almost ALWAYS read reviews before buying anything online and because I&#x27;m familiar with this product I didn&#x27;t this time.  Doubtful I would have purchased this one had I read the comments.</li>
            <li> For this price you can buy the regular size of 8 g and this one is only 2.5....completely misleading and I feel ripped off.  Don&#x27;t be misled as this is a tiny trial size version.</li>
            <li> i thought I was buying the larger container and when I went to order the larger one the provider was out of this product.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous.....so small!!!</li>
            <li> I love this make up.  I have been using it for years.  I think for better coverage you may want to order the Primer.</li>
