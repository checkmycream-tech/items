            <li>All-in-all, this is my favorite shave cream ever!</li>
            <li>Still smells amazing and feels nice on the skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, I like it but don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>Anyway, it works great, nice clean shave, no nicks......</li>
            <li>I was happy to find this but mainly because the smell was a happy memory from when I was a kid.</li>
            <li>Not as good as real soap or cream but for canned cream it is good.</li>
            <li>This stuff is just OK.  </li>
            <li>dont love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a magic shave guy.</li>
            <li>, I will be ordering more</li>
            <li>Like so many others who have reviewed it</li>
            <li>love this prouduct...</li>
            <li>Does not irritate the skin and not as many chemicals as some of the gels on the market.</li>
            <li>Will not return to the gel products - love this much better and has a more manly scent.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this product.  </li>
            <li>my favorite.  </li>
            <li>love Clubman products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with Barbasol Pacific Rush for shaving and use Clubman aftershave for that barbershop smell so many of us love...</li>
            <li>Prefer creams that require a brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foams up nicely and provides a close comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t used it before, this is a very rich shave cream which gives a lot of protection.</li>
            <li>It is rich and smells really nice.  </li>
            <li>It has the great Clubman sent and provides decent protection.</li>
            <li>Scent is that great Clubman smell I remember as a child in the barbershop, but lubrication is just not as good as other top line, shaving creams.</li>
            <li>this is the very best shaving cream I have used in a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Clubman!</li>
            <li>, to me the foam is more like light whipped cream than shaving cream.</li>
            <li>really what good is that in a shaving cream?</li>
            <li>Arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Love the great Clubman smell and with aloevera it leaves behind great softness!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Nice, mostly neutral shaving cream in a decent size can.</li>
            <li>Shaving was smooth and easy.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m so happy that clubman&#x27;s FINNALY brought back there shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Smells just like the barbershop and goes great with the aftershave with the same scent by clubman.</li>
            <li>I am so happy that it is back.</li>
            <li>So if you enjoy Clubman products, go with this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s timeless, and so worth a couple of dollars more than Gillette.</li>
            <li>It did the job and it was smooth.</li>
            <li>So if you enjoy Clubman products, go with this or just give it a try.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t provides as smooth of a shave as I would like.</li>
            <li>It was smooth like a gel, without being one.</li>
            <li>and I get a smooth shave with my DE razors.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t rinse my face after using it as well, I just sue a washcloth and wipe off the extra foam, that way that great smell, and that &#x27;barber shop&#x27; finish remains.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>The best part besides the fact that it smells great, is that a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>The original Pinaud Clubman shave cream</li>
            <li>Thick foam shave cream that does a good job of softening your beard and gives you a close shave at a good price.</li>
            <li>If you have used more modern gels and soaps, please be prepared for a lightweight difference.</li>
            <li>and if you need a quick shave.</li>
            <li>This is HIGH quality shave cream, goes a very long way, is a large can, and again, smells just like the perfect aftershave.</li>
            <li>Nice old barber shop scent, not as foamy as expected, but good enough.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Good lather and doesnt dry my skin</li>
            <li>I love starting a new day with the smell of this outstanding shave cream!  </li>
            <li>The aloe in it really does leave your face and neck smooth.</li>
            <li>Worth the&lt;br /&gt;try</li>
            <li>Husband LOVES Clubman, and this shaving cream has that gorgeous original CLUBMAN scent I love (and he likes a lot), and lasts a LONG LONG time!  </li>
            <li>I find it better than most gels and frankly, just a tad less luxurious as my soaps and creams.</li>
            <li>but might be more of a personal preference.</li>
            <li>It also works really well with the shaving brush!</li>
            <li>but this one is exactly that.</li>
            <li>Not much different from Barbasol, but with a better scent.  </li>
            <li>It seems to last me a good bit longer than other brands and, as importantly, it does not come out &amp;#34;liquidy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Honestly, I got it to go with all of the other Clubman products, it matches the colors in my medicine cabinet.  </li>
            <li>If you are a newbie, and enjoy the smell of baby powder mixed with barber shops and a tiny hint of vanilla, you will truly love this product.</li>
            <li>Once you shave, the cream and the smell is pretty much gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Large can.</li>
            <li>My skin was super smooth after using it and I felt like I didn&#x27;t even need to put on extra lotion because my skin was soft and moisturized from the cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a good shaving cream</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The can lasts a loooong time, much longer than gillette or barbasol products.</li>
            <li>I really like the consistency of the lather itself.  </li>
            <li>I really like this shave cream.  </li>
            <li>But, at 6-8x the cost, I don&#x27;t see much value</li>
            <li>the after effects and the smell are what you really reap out of it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Classic scent, decent canned shave cream.  </li>
            <li>if  you like the classic Clubman scent.</li>
            <li>High volume foam.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend this product to anyone who wants an old school fragrance shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I normally use shaving cream that you have to whip up with a brush</li>
            <li>Nice scent and thick lather.  </li>
            <li>This is not a heavy product and its scent is something that may appear musky and older.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t messy or leave residue around my face and my face feels smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt, just how the ladies like.</li>
            <li>It is not heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li>old school barber shop stuff which i like</li>
            <li>It works really well, will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li>Nothing special except the slight Clubman scent.</li>
            <li>Even though it costs more, it is much less expensive to use than most.</li>
            <li>Classic sent takes me back to the barber shop days.</li>
            <li>Has the same sent as classic clubman.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice but expensive.</li>
            <li>They both get a much closer shave than with other shaving creams.</li>
            <li>This is a thick, luxurious lather that feels rich and silky on the skin.</li>
            <li>I can use a wet brush and get a close approximation of a higher priced cream in a jar however this stuff just stays dry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a large container, probably half again as tall as Barbasol.</li>

            <li> They both get a much closer shave than with other shaving creams.</li>
            <li> This is a thick, luxurious lather that feels rich and silky on the skin.</li>
            <li> I can use a wet brush and get a close approximation of a higher priced cream in a jar however this stuff just stays dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a large container, probably half again as tall as Barbasol.</li>
            <li> and I guess it can be fixed by using less at a time but still its very thick and makes it difficult to get a clean shave on the first run of the blade</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin but will require some getting used to.</li>
            <li> is back - not reformulated or dumbed down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very dense.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a lot of drag on the razor as with other inferior Shave Cream&#x27;s and it doesn&#x27;t take a lot to do the job.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, and there&#x27;s a lot in a 12 oz can.</li>
            <li> Seems to work as well as other foams.</li>
            <li> May take a little &amp;#34;getting used to.&amp;#34; Consider it seriously if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t &#x27;lather&#x27; or seem as &#x27;thick&#x27; as something like a standard Barbasol or Gillette foamy</li>
            <li> At 12 bucks or so, little steep</li>
            <li> shave cream might need a little getting used to, but the aroma and the quality of Clubman is what you&#x27;d</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel very much moisture or protection and glide is bad.</li>
            <li> If you would like to have a classic smell and have a product that performs well, you wont be disappointed with Pinaud or this shave cream.</li>
            <li> I feel like its a bit too thick</li>
            <li> Way too thin.</li>
            <li> Yeah, this here is a game changer.</li>
            <li> I guess you can&#x27;t go wrong with a product that barbers use.</li>
            <li> Rather disappointed.  </li>

            <li> i&#x27;m so happy that clubman&#x27;s FINNALY brought back there shaving cream. It&#x27;s great on the face for comfort, and smelling just like their after shave.Please don&#x27;t remove this ever again!! Thanks</li>
            <li> Smells just like the barbershop and goes great with the aftershave with the same scent by clubman.</li>
            <li> Use several Clubman products so thought I&#x27;d give this one&lt;br /&gt;a try. At 12 bucks or so, little steep but I thought, what&lt;br /&gt;the heck! Way too thin. Barbasol in the grocery is much&lt;br /&gt;better lather, thicker, and obviously cheaper. Worth the&lt;br /&gt;try though.</li>
            <li> Best shaving cr√®me I have used in a while</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clubman, what&#x27;s not to like?  The shave cream is excellent.  I got one of those shave cream warmers for christmas, yep like the one you got your dad.  Anyway, it works great, nice clean shave, no nicks......</li>
            <li> Husband LOVES Clubman, and this shaving cream has that gorgeous original CLUBMAN scent I love (and he likes a lot), and lasts a LONG LONG time!  Only shave cream he uses!</li>
            <li> This stuff is just OK.  I normally use shaving cream that you have to whip up with a brush but sometimes I don&#x27;t have enough time. I still use a brush to whip up the canned foam but this stuff just doesn&#x27;t whip.  With Noxema Foam I can use a wet brush and get a close approximation of a higher priced cream in a jar however this stuff just stays dry. I don&#x27;t feel very much moisture or protection and glide is bad. I think they need to go back to the drawing board with this product.</li>
            <li> I buy this shaving cream for both my husband and father-in-law.  They both get a much closer shave than with other shaving creams.</li>
            <li> The original Pinaud Clubman shave cream is back - not reformulated or dumbed down. The can lasts a loooong time, much longer than gillette or barbasol products. Even though it costs more, it is much less expensive to use than most. If you haven&#x27;t used it before, this is a very rich shave cream which gives a lot of protection. May take a little &amp;#34;getting used to.&amp;#34; Consider it seriously if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, I like it but don&#x27;t love it. I feel like its a bit too thick and I guess it can be fixed by using less at a time but still its very thick and makes it difficult to get a clean shave on the first run of the blade, meanwhile I use a blade with 4 razors on it. Still smells amazing and feels nice on the skin, I like it- dont love it though- but might be more of a personal preference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a magic shave guy. Until today. Great smell before and after shaving. The foam feels great on my skin. It isn&#x27;t messy or leave residue around my face and my face feels smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt, just how the ladies like. Yeah, this here is a game changer. Great product!!!!</li>
            <li> Classic sent takes me back to the barber shop days. Good lather and doesnt dry my skin, I will be ordering more</li>
            <li> Would recommend this product to anyone who wants an old school fragrance shaving cream. It also works really well with the shaving brush!</li>
            <li> This is the best shave cream I have ever used. Gives you a great shave. I am so happy that it is back.</li>
            <li> All I can say is it&#x27;s JUST like the Clubman aftershave scent. SOOOO good! This is HIGH quality shave cream, goes a very long way, is a large can, and again, smells just like the perfect aftershave. So if you enjoy Clubman products, go with this. If you are a newbie, and enjoy the smell of baby powder mixed with barber shops and a tiny hint of vanilla, you will truly love this product. It&#x27;s timeless, and so worth a couple of dollars more than Gillette. Enjoy!!! Cheers.</li>
            <li> High volume foam.  Has the same sent as classic clubman.  If you&#x27;ve never used it, its sent is the same as powered from the barber shop.  Does not irritate the skin and gives a great shave.</li>
            <li> I love starting a new day with the smell of this outstanding shave cream!  Like so many others who have reviewed it, the smell reminds me of being in the barbershop with my dad and brother, getting our hair cuts.  I really like the consistency of the lather itself.  There isn&#x27;t a lot of drag on the razor as with other inferior Shave Cream&#x27;s and it doesn&#x27;t take a lot to do the job.  All-in-all, this is my favorite shave cream ever!</li>
            <li> Large can. Very nice texture. Will order again</li>
            <li> Great value for the money and the aroma is absolutely amazing!  I guess you can&#x27;t go wrong with a product that barbers use.</li>
            <li> It smelled good but to me it didn&#x27;t lather well. Rather disappointed.  So I gave it to my stepfather. Meh.</li>
            <li> Clubman makes a wonderful shave cream.  It has a wonderful aroma and the creaminess is delightful!  However, the cap cap totally damaged.</li>
            <li> Love the great Clubman smell and with aloevera it leaves behind great softness!&lt;br /&gt;I love this prouduct... I recremend to anyone!</li>
            <li> This is one of only two canned cream that I will use. It has the great Clubman sent and provides decent protection. Good for travel and if you need a quick shave. Not as good as real soap or cream but for canned cream it is good.</li>
            <li> yes very nice on all three of the products Gerald Hunt</li>
            <li> Great shaving cream.  A barbershop shave at home.</li>
            <li> I can not wait to get this product. I&#x27;m happy that i can get this great product 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I really like this shave cream.  It is rich and smells really nice.  It is not heavy or greasy.  The scent is very traditional.  Does not irritate the skin and not as many chemicals as some of the gels on the market.</li>
            <li> Clubman makes very traditional mens skin care products, and the shave cream that they offer is going to be thinner than traditional foam creams. It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin but will require some getting used to. If you have used more modern gels and soaps, please be prepared for a lightweight difference. This is not a heavy product and its scent is something that may appear musky and older. That&#x27;s a traditional shave cream for you. If you would like to have a classic smell and have a product that performs well, you wont be disappointed with Pinaud or this shave cream.</li>
            <li> This is a thick, luxurious lather that feels rich and silky on the skin. Shaving was smooth and easy. My skin feels softer and moisturized. A little bit goes a long way, and there&#x27;s a lot in a 12 oz can. With a concentrated musk scent, this is a shaving cream definitely geared toward men.</li>
            <li> Nice, mostly neutral shaving cream in a decent size can. It seems to last me a good bit longer than other brands and, as importantly, it does not come out &amp;#34;liquidy&amp;#34; when the canis near empty (Gillette comes to mind).</li>
            <li> Nice scent and thick lather.  Will not return to the gel products - love this much better and has a more manly scent.</li>
            <li> It did the job and it was smooth. This is GREAT quality shave cream, and it smells just like the perfect and pleasant aftershave you want to be noticed. So if you enjoy Clubman products, go with this or just give it a try. The best thing about this is that it is enriched with aloe vera for a truly smoother shave.</li>
            <li> Classic scent, decent canned shave cream.  Honestly, I got it to go with all of the other Clubman products, it matches the colors in my medicine cabinet.  Nothing special except the slight Clubman scent.</li>
            <li> Good shave cream. This can will last months.</li>
            <li> Great that this is being produced again.  But, the scent is just ever so slightly different than in olden days.</li>
            <li> That clubman smell, I guess that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re paying for. Not the best lather though.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find this but mainly because the smell was a happy memory from when I was a kid. Can remember this in the club house when I was a caddy and that was plenty for me. Seems to work as well as other foams.</li>
            <li> Thick foam shave cream that does a good job of softening your beard and gives you a close shave at a good price.</li>
            <li> Scent is that great Clubman smell I remember as a child in the barbershop, but lubrication is just not as good as other top line, shaving creams. It doesn&#x27;t provides as smooth of a shave as I would like. Going back to Aveeno.</li>
            <li> Great product smells very good and lathers very well used with a shaving brush and without you get a very good shave with this product, Will be buying again this is the very best shaving cream I have used in a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Clubman!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a good shaving cream but this one is exactly that. The foam goes on think and the aloe is soothing. My skin was super smooth after using it and I felt like I didn&#x27;t even need to put on extra lotion because my skin was soft and moisturized from the cream. The best part besides the fact that it smells great, is that a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product.  It was smooth like a gel, without being one. Arrived very quickly.  No razor burn, which for me is a rarity!</li>
            <li> Nice old barber shop scent, not as foamy as expected, but good enough.&lt;br /&gt;I still would recommend.</li>
            <li> For the price, this stuff rocks. When I don&#x27;t have time to use the brush and bowl, I go to this. Smells great, lathers nicely and I get a smooth shave with my DE razors. I find it better than most gels and frankly, just a tad less luxurious as my soaps and creams. The aloe in it really does leave your face and neck smooth.</li>
            <li> my favorite.  old school barber shop stuff which i like</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a large container, probably half again as tall as Barbasol. But, at 6-8x the cost, I don&#x27;t see much value here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, to me the foam is more like light whipped cream than shaving cream. It&#x27;s not very dense. It smells like a Clubman product, but really what good is that in a shaving cream? Once you shave, the cream and the smell is pretty much gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Clubman products. But, this is one I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll repurchase. I&#x27;ll stick with Barbasol Pacific Rush for shaving and use Clubman aftershave for that barbershop smell so many of us love...</li>
            <li> Cream has a nice weight to it and it smells great. It works really well, will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Not much different from Barbasol, but with a better scent.  But way more expensive.  I would say stick with the after shave if  you like the classic Clubman scent.</li>
            <li> Prefer creams that require a brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foams up nicely and provides a close comfortable shave.  Good post shave feeling.</li>
            <li> I do like the Clubman products.&lt;br /&gt;This shave cream might need a little getting used to, but the aroma and the quality of Clubman is what you&#x27;d expect.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t &#x27;lather&#x27; or seem as &#x27;thick&#x27; as something like a standard Barbasol or Gillette foamy, so you do use a bit more.&lt;br /&gt;But the after effects and the smell are what you really reap out of it.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t rinse my face after using it as well, I just sue a washcloth and wipe off the extra foam, that way that great smell, and that &#x27;barber shop&#x27; finish remains.&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff and a manly scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice but expensive.</li>
