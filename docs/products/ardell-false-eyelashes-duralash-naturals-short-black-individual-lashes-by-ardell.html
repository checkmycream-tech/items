    <ol>
            <li> First time use of this product. Am very happy with the knot free Duralash Natural Flare Lashes. Bought \\&quot;single\\&quot; loose lashes for bottom row, the knot free were alittle too much to look natural. Used in conjunction with Ardell Lashtite Adhesive (black).      Helpful Hints:     1. had to learn to carefully remove lashes from holder (although durable i wrecked some)  2. i placed lashes on a white paper plate in the amount to use to shorten application time (the adhesive glue has a short window of time for use once poured out onto glass or stone ect)  3. used varying lengths in the Duralash 6-pack for a more natural effect   4. manifying mirror helped tremendously!      What I wish I&#x27;d known before use:     Watching \\&quot;how to\\&quot; videos on false eyelash application/what lenghts, thicknesses to use for certain looks would have made my learning curve alot shorter (as a first time user)</li>
            <li> Great quality and easily applied &amp; realistic mini lashes.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy these again, I threw out more than I used. The eyelashes would split apart when taking them out of the holder.Cheap price for a cheap product.</li>
            <li> I love these and in a 6 pack it is a great deal .  The short length look natural.  Would re-order.</li>
            <li> Loved buying them in bulk. Better and inexpensive this way. Would recommend to anyone. Although recently Duralash lashes have been breaking apart and can sometimes be a bad batch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn false eyelashes for a while now, and these are GREAT!  They don&#x27;t have that little bump at the end that makes the lashes more noticably false looking.

            <li> I just started doing my own eyelashes and these eyelashes have a look and feel of something like plastic.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend</li>
            <li> I really like Like these for going out, cheap enough not to need to re use. Natural length, but still looks great</li>
            <li> Very good eyelashes. They stay on well.</li>
            <li> I use them all the time!!</li>
            <li> They look like good quality but they would not adhere to my lashes- application was horrendous. I used the same brand black adhesive. I ended up returning them.</li>
