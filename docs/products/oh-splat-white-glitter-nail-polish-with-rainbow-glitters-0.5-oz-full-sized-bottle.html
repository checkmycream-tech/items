            <li>It seems to be good quality as some of her nail polish starts chipping off after a day or two and this one has been on her nails for a week.</li>

            <li>Very pretty and PERFECT for Spring!</li>

            <li>Thist is a unique and attractive polish and I have gotten a lot of compliments.  </li>
            <li>2-3 coats, not bad formula, goes on nicely, beautiful, i love it.</li>

            <li>Love love love this nail polish!</li>
            <li>So very super cute!</li>
            <li>Great polish and fast delivery!</li>
            <li>Great nail polish looks exactly like the picture</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments</li>
            <li>I would recommend putting on a top coat.</li>
            <li>I really love this glitter polish</li>
            <li>I will be buying more from KB shimmer.</li>
            <li>Oh Splat and Shipwreck look great in the bottle and not so much on my fingernails.</li>
            <li>Even with that step, I found myself wishing for more sparkle in the end.  </li>
            <li>Got many compliments on it while it lasted.</li>
            <li>It is interesting, but you need to have 2-3 layers to get it to look like the picture.</li>
            <li>I apply a top coat so it lasts longer.</li>
            <li>It has been on over 3 days now, with a top coat of course, and no chipping yet.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>The glitter colors are bright and fun to wear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I decided to buy this.</li>
            <li>I anticipate many cute manis using it.</li>
            <li>That being said, I WILL buy more colors but can&#x27;t afford to buy as many as I&#x27;d like to.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ll catch on clothes etc without top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This polish is ok.</li>
            <li>Then a top coat (or in my case, a gel finish)&lt;br</li>
            <li>The nail polish was cute, but it looked better in the picture than it did on my nails.</li>
            <li>It is more translucent than I thought so</li>
            <li>It makes my hands look fun and bright</li>
            <li>Love this polish.  </li>
            <li>then putting a glitter polish on top.</li>
            <li>so I am pleased with it&#x27;s durability and appearance, but I may have to reevaluate before reordering because of the price.</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t buy it in more colors.</li>
            <li>Love this nail polish.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more from this seller.</li>
            <li>This is now my favorite nail polish.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t explain how much I love this polish.</li>
            <li>I love this nail polish</li>
            <li>Love, love, love.</li>
            <li>Immediately became my favorite color.</li>
            <li>Glitter is not over the top and can be worn all the time.</li>
            <li>The girls website has more options listed.</li>
            <li>I used Essie &amp;#34;good to go!&amp;#34; top coat.</li>
            <li>I had to re-order it because I love it.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and a great product.  </li>
            <li>I have a 50/50 on this polish, I  had to apply 3 coats to be able to get the glitter look i wanted.</li>
            <li>So cute and will buy again when out.</li>
            <li>So I was pleased.</li>
            <li>Cute polish.  </li>
            <li>love this.  </li>
            <li>but I bet kids would love it too.  </li>
            <li>I thought this would be cute for Easter</li>
            <li>But - with a glitter topping it was better.</li>
            <li>I got this because I love the look and the colors</li>
            <li>I ordered this along with chromies and I love all three.  </li>
            <li>I love, love, love this nail polish.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>the more you apply the cooler</li>
            <li>Super cute nail polish!  </li>
            <li>I was not disappointed!</li>
            <li>It was quick to deliver and packaged nicely.</li>
            <li>It actually came with detailed instructions on how to care for and apply the product for best results.</li>
            <li>but it looks very cool on.</li>
            <li>These colors are actually very cool, but they just look nothing like the photos.</li>
            <li>love the polish, very fun for toes also.  </li>
            <li>It looks really cool!</li>
            <li>The sparkle colors are a little more saturated than the stock photo, but all in all I am very happy with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>Easy for me to take off as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a terrible polish, but I had to do 4 to 5 coats to have it look as nice as the picture, and even then there didn&#x27;t seem to be a lot of chunks of color in my polish (even after shaking it), so I had to hunt for color chunks to specifically add to the nails that didn&#x27;t have as much color as the others.  </li>
            <li>it apply easy</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>the formula is great and when you layer it, the effect looks very organic and pretty.</li>
            <li>Recommended for anyone who hasn&#x27;t tried indie polish and love painting your own nails!</li>
            <li>one Sally&#x27;s quick drying top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looks great, but because it requires so many layers, it took forever to dry.</li>
            <li>it goes on smooth and dries quickly!</li>
            <li>Very pretty!</li>
            <li>There were detailed instructions for applying the polish on the bottle.</li>
            <li>Looks great with about 2 coats total.</li>
            <li>Went on smooth</li>
            <li>I only need to use 2 coats and it stays on great.</li>
            <li>The white with the flecks looks great on my toes.  </li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s a bit pricier than most nail polishes, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>The polish applies smoothly (even with all the glitter) and layered well.</li>
            <li>This is just OK - I had to apply other glitter on top to get a really good effect.  </li>
            <li>3 coats and you get exactly in the photo!!</li>
            <li>This polish dries fast!!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very fun and girly and looks a lot like the picture.  </li>
            <li>The first layer will appear translucent as most light colored polished do.</li>
            <li>Very fun and unique.</li>
            <li>My new favorite nail polish!</li>
            <li>You don’t need to glop it on to get the glitter – it is easy to put on and is a super fun color!</li>
            <li>/&gt;LOVE this fun polish!</li>
            <li>I was so excited for this by the picture and couldn&#x27;t wait to order it.</li>
            <li>The first day alone at work I had so many people asking about this polish.</li>
            <li>They make some unique polish.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to receive this in the mail.</li>
            <li>Completely worth the price!</li>
            <li>It looks so chick and so clean.</li>
            <li>The only downside (that is kind of an upside too?) is that it needs more than one coat.</li>
            <li>did nit like this it just whit nail polish with glitter in it nothing special.. and cant return it..</li>
            <li>This,stayed on very well and really is beautiful, especially in the sun.</li>
            <li>it looked cool in the picture.</li>
            <li>I have never been much of one for chunky glitter nail polish or jelly polish, but I LOVE this.</li>
            <li>This product is really cool.</li>
            <li>It IS cool.</li>
            <li>This item was a present for my girlfriend, and she loved it.</li>
            <li>Cute but paid to much for the nail polish to pricey for me</li>
            <li>And I will probably buy more, but I compare this to fast food photos.</li>
            <li>Cool color.</li>
            <li>Although removing the glitter takes some time, if you follow the instructions it&#x27;s pretty easy.</li>
            <li>Great alone or with other colors.  </li>
            <li>I would give it 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t chip so quickly.</li>
            <li>I just wish the photos would be more realistic.    </li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li>Drying time was fairly quick.</li>
            <li>This polish is very pretty but it does not look like it does in the photo.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d say the name is pretty fit.</li>
            <li>It takes a good while to dry</li>
            <li>Definitely needs more color chunks and sparkles!  </li>
            <li>This nail polish is so pretty!</li>
            <li>I am definitely purchasing more nail polish from KBShimmer!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always being complemented on how pretty my nail polish is!</li>
            <li>Amazing shade with jelly white and glitter....</li>
            <li>Takes quite a few coats to get desired look but once you do it looks great</li>
            <li>Glitter girls have all the fun.</li>
            <li>This is such a nice polish.</li>
            <li>This is fun nail polish.  </li>
            <li>but I wear it sometimes for fun.</li>
            <li>painted my nails on a Tuesday evening (2 coats of the polish, 1 clear top coat)</li>
            <li>Definitely put a nice chip resistant topcoat on.</li>
            <li>I like the look of 3 thin coats best with 2 quick dry top coats.</li>
            <li>I put a solid white under and it looked great.</li>
            <li>VERY FAST DELIVERY.</li>
            <li>I think for the price I could definitely get a better polish.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s sooo pretty</li>
            <li>I got exactly what I paid for.</li>
            <li>I received compliments the first day I wore it to work; they said &amp;#34;oh</li>
            <li>By using a white basecoat, I was satisfied with just 2 coats.</li>
            <li>It looks exactly like the image</li>
            <li>Also recommend to do exactly three coats.  </li>
            <li>its pretty though</li>
            <li>The first time I used 3 coats plus the base/top coats and it lasted a week without chipping.  </li>
            <li>Really pretty polish.  </li>
            <li>I do like this product and am definitely going to buy more.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>it is so PRETTY  and FEMME.</li>
            <li>It is exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>I accidentally dropped and broke my first bottle of this polish.</li>
            <li>It was a trail and error at first to get the effect</li>
            <li>People at work have commented on how much they like it!</li>
            <li>I Instantly fell in love.</li>
            <li>Exactly like the photo.</li>
            <li>Wife fell in love with it instantly.</li>
            <li>This is also pretty in person</li>
            <li>The polish looks so cute in the pics, but it doesn&#x27;t look the same on.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I am most likely going to pass on trying their other tinted polishes, and stick with the clear ones, which are amazing!</li>
            <li>Got it very fast (3 days) would recommend but don&#x27;t expect too much.</li>
            <li>when I wear these, they look so pretty and are very attention getting.</li>
            <li>With a top coat to guard against chipping this wears a long time.</li>
            <li>I got many compliments on my nails, and it lasted a really long time.</li>
            <li>I have received SO many compliments on this particular white polish since wearing it.</li>
            <li>but it dried very fast and looks amazing.</li>
            <li>I will certainly order nail polish from this seller again.</li>
            <li>It reminds me a bit of a certain Easter egg candy.</li>
            <li>Almost $9 plus shipping, is very high priced.</li>
            <li>Sparkles were ruff &amp; hard to cover with top coat to make it smooth.</li>
            <li>it is also very affordable</li>
            <li>I thought the white was going to be cheap with glitter</li>
            <li>The ones with glitter in a colored polish, not so much.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>really like it just put it on my nails</li>
            <li>2 coats is really all you&#x27;ll need.</li>
            <li>This polish is very durable.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>&#x27;s very pretty,very sparkly.</li>
            <li>Just ok, not as expected</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s photoshopped, I really don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>I really likes this on.</li>
            <li>I applied like 5-6 coats for a very finish polished look.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>Touches up very well.  </li>
            <li>Very durable on toes.</li>
            <li>Not what I expected, the polish is more like water.</li>
            <li>Really looks like paint splattering on nails</li>
            <li>I really like this polish.  </li>
            <li>So far ive ordered 16 colors, currently have 3 with more coming from Amazon and their website.</li>
            <li>The white is not too sheer and the glitter shows up nicely.</li>
            <li>Mainly what comes out is the mini glitter flakes that you dont really even notice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never spent this much money on nail polish before and it was totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I did 3 thin layers and it looks amazing!</li>
            <li>nail polish requires base and top coats for the longest possible wear and best look.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Multiple coats are needed to get the full on look, as it appears in pic and bottle.</li>
            <li>I think this such a cool color.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;s super fun and easy to remove (at least the way i put them on!).</li>
            <li>Just paint your nails with a white nail polish first, let it dry and use this over it so that your finished nails are opaque. :)</li>
            <li>So no one really know what happened to the family that use to live there</li>
            <li>And even after putting a top coat on to protect it and have it last longer, it only lasted for 4 or so days before it chipped.</li>
            <li>It looks cute on but the white is not as vibrant as the pic; it&#x27;s actually a lil cloudy.</li>
            <li>I like the glitter but had to use multiple coats for the white to look okay.</li>
            <li>If you are lucky enough to get a nice pretty look on the first coat, when you put the 2nd coat on, the white paint is yet translucent but dark enough to cover up the glitter on the first coat.</li>
            <li>but,  it turned out as in light pink..</li>
            <li>great product, expensive</li>
            <li>Love this, but it doesn&#x27;t last long on the nails.</li>
            <li>So next time I applied a white basecoat before applying it and the result was pretty cool</li>
            <li>But polish is cute for a few days.</li>
            <li>You really have to let some of the polish drip back off your brush before you apply, or else the glitter effect will be largely covered up.</li>
            <li>It takes slightly longer to apply due to the glitter content, but if you follow the included instructions you&#x27;ll get good results.  </li>
            <li>Also, KBShimmer sent me this polish through the mail quickly, and it was packaged very well (compared to other items I&#x27;ve purchased through Amazon).</li>
            <li>I really only wear white in the summer, I love this polish, add alittle spice to white nail polish, highly recommended</li>
            <li>I love this polish so much, the only thing is it doesn&#x27;t last very long and peals off within a couple days.</li>
            <li>the white starts to cover up the glitter from first coat to the point where you can&#x27;t see it at all.  </li>
            <li>I usually paint my nails then add a top coat of glitter to it</li>
            <li>Such a pretty and effortless splatter design.</li>
            <li>ABSOLUTELY NO REGRETS!!!!</li>
            <li>The little specks of glitter is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I adore all of the KB Shimmer colors I have that are glitter in a clear polish.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyone who doesn&#x27;t use at least a top coat over the polish</li>
            <li>so you cannot really see the line like you would with a solid color.  </li>
            <li>However, you do have to use a couple coats to get near the look in the picture.  </li>
            <li>I also bought it in other colors and like the pink better.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to comment on wear, but I expect with a couple coats of Seche Vite topcoat, it&#x27;ll last just fine.</li>
            <li>Ordered the black already, purchasing the blue next :)</li>
            <li>definitely recommend buying this if you&#x27;re curious or think it looks cool.</li>
            <li>I have looked high and low for a nail polish like this.</li>
            <li>It stayed quite soft even days later</li>
            <li>Not in love with the price, but it&#x27;s the only nail polish I&#x27;ve reapplied a second time in a row, I usually I get bored with it quickly and change colors frequently.  </li>
            <li>I used a high quality base coat and three coats of this polish and two of a very high quality top coat.</li>
            <li>Would recommend with an opaque white base coat if you want the ultra bright white looking background, but I did it without the base coat and am very happy with how it looks.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t use a base or top coat and the polish lasted a little more than a week without chipping.</li>

            <li> It seems to be good quality as some of her nail polish starts chipping off after a day or two and this one has been on her nails for a week.</li>

            <li> The quality of the nail polish is really good.</li>
            <li> I was unfamiliar with this brand but decided to take my chances on it because I loved the look in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I was super impressed!</li>
            <li> Very pretty and PERFECT for Spring!</li>
            <li> I used 2 coats and it looks great, probably could&#x27;ve done 3 for even more of the glitter pieces.</li>

            <li> So very super cute!</li>
            <li> Great polish and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Great nail polish looks exactly like the picture</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments</li>
            <li> I would recommend putting on a top coat.</li>
            <li> I really love this glitter polish</li>
            <li> I will be buying more from KB shimmer.</li>
            <li> Oh Splat and Shipwreck look great in the bottle and not so much on my fingernails.</li>
            <li> Even with that step, I found myself wishing for more sparkle in the end.  </li>
            <li> Got many compliments on it while it lasted.</li>
            <li> It is interesting, but you need to have 2-3 layers to get it to look like the picture.</li>
            <li> I apply a top coat so it lasts longer.</li>
            <li> It has been on over 3 days now, with a top coat of course, and no chipping yet.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> The glitter colors are bright and fun to wear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I decided to buy this.</li>
            <li> I anticipate many cute manis using it.</li>
            <li> That being said, I WILL buy more colors but can&#x27;t afford to buy as many as I&#x27;d like to.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ll catch on clothes etc without top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This polish is ok.</li>
            <li> Then a top coat (or in my case, a gel finish)&lt;br</li>
            <li> The nail polish was cute, but it looked better in the picture than it did on my nails.</li>
            <li> It is more translucent than I thought so</li>
            <li> It makes my hands look fun and bright</li>
            <li> Love this polish.  </li>
            <li> then putting a glitter polish on top.</li>
            <li> so I am pleased with it&#x27;s durability and appearance, but I may have to reevaluate before reordering because of the price.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t buy it in more colors.</li>
            <li> Love this nail polish.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering more from this seller.</li>
            <li> This is now my favorite nail polish.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t explain how much I love this polish.</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish</li>
            <li> Love, love, love.</li>
            <li> Immediately became my favorite color.</li>
            <li> Glitter is not over the top and can be worn all the time.</li>
            <li> The girls website has more options listed.</li>
            <li> I used Essie &amp;#34;good to go!&amp;#34; top coat.</li>
            <li> I had to re-order it because I love it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and a great product.  </li>
            <li> I have a 50/50 on this polish, I  had to apply 3 coats to be able to get the glitter look i wanted.</li>
            <li> So cute and will buy again when out.</li>
            <li> So I was pleased.</li>
            <li> Cute polish.  </li>
            <li> love this.  </li>
            <li> but I bet kids would love it too.  </li>
            <li> I thought this would be cute for Easter</li>
            <li> But - with a glitter topping it was better.</li>
            <li> I got this because I love the look and the colors</li>
            <li> I ordered this along with chromies and I love all three.  </li>
            <li> I love, love, love this nail polish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> the more you apply the cooler</li>
            <li> Super cute nail polish!  </li>
            <li> I was not disappointed!</li>
            <li> It was quick to deliver and packaged nicely.</li>
            <li> It actually came with detailed instructions on how to care for and apply the product for best results.</li>
            <li> but it looks very cool on.</li>
            <li> These colors are actually very cool, but they just look nothing like the photos.</li>
            <li> love the polish, very fun for toes also.  </li>
            <li> It looks really cool!</li>
            <li> The sparkle colors are a little more saturated than the stock photo, but all in all I am very happy with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> Easy for me to take off as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a terrible polish, but I had to do 4 to 5 coats to have it look as nice as the picture, and even then there didn&#x27;t seem to be a lot of chunks of color in my polish (even after shaking it), so I had to hunt for color chunks to specifically add to the nails that didn&#x27;t have as much color as the others.  </li>
            <li> it apply easy</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> the formula is great and when you layer it, the effect looks very organic and pretty.</li>
            <li> Recommended for anyone who hasn&#x27;t tried indie polish and love painting your own nails!</li>
            <li> one Sally&#x27;s quick drying top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looks great, but because it requires so many layers, it took forever to dry.</li>
            <li> it goes on smooth and dries quickly!</li>
            <li> Very pretty!</li>
            <li> There were detailed instructions for applying the polish on the bottle.</li>
            <li> Looks great with about 2 coats total.</li>
            <li> Went on smooth</li>
            <li> I only need to use 2 coats and it stays on great.</li>
            <li> The white with the flecks looks great on my toes.  </li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s a bit pricier than most nail polishes, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> The polish applies smoothly (even with all the glitter) and layered well.</li>
            <li> This is just OK - I had to apply other glitter on top to get a really good effect.  </li>
            <li> 3 coats and you get exactly in the photo!!</li>
            <li> This polish dries fast!!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very fun and girly and looks a lot like the picture.  </li>
            <li> The first layer will appear translucent as most light colored polished do.</li>
            <li> Very fun and unique.</li>
            <li> My new favorite nail polish!</li>
            <li> You don’t need to glop it on to get the glitter – it is easy to put on and is a super fun color!</li>
            <li> /&gt;LOVE this fun polish!</li>
            <li> I was so excited for this by the picture and couldn&#x27;t wait to order it.</li>
            <li> The first day alone at work I had so many people asking about this polish.</li>
            <li> They make some unique polish.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to receive this in the mail.</li>
            <li> Completely worth the price!</li>
            <li> It looks so chick and so clean.</li>
            <li> The only downside (that is kind of an upside too?) is that it needs more than one coat.</li>
            <li> did nit like this it just whit nail polish with glitter in it nothing special.. and cant return it..</li>
            <li> This,stayed on very well and really is beautiful, especially in the sun.</li>
            <li> it looked cool in the picture.</li>
            <li> I have never been much of one for chunky glitter nail polish or jelly polish, but I LOVE this.</li>
            <li> This product is really cool.</li>
            <li> It IS cool.</li>
            <li> This item was a present for my girlfriend, and she loved it.</li>
            <li> Cute but paid to much for the nail polish to pricey for me</li>
            <li> And I will probably buy more, but I compare this to fast food photos.</li>
            <li> Cool color.</li>
            <li> Although removing the glitter takes some time, if you follow the instructions it&#x27;s pretty easy.</li>
            <li> Great alone or with other colors.  </li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t chip so quickly.</li>
            <li> I just wish the photos would be more realistic.    </li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li> Drying time was fairly quick.</li>
            <li> This polish is very pretty but it does not look like it does in the photo.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d say the name is pretty fit.</li>
            <li> It takes a good while to dry</li>
            <li> Definitely needs more color chunks and sparkles!  </li>
            <li> This nail polish is so pretty!</li>
            <li> I am definitely purchasing more nail polish from KBShimmer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always being complemented on how pretty my nail polish is!</li>
            <li> Amazing shade with jelly white and glitter....</li>
            <li> Takes quite a few coats to get desired look but once you do it looks great</li>
            <li> Glitter girls have all the fun.</li>
            <li> This is such a nice polish.</li>
            <li> This is fun nail polish.  </li>
            <li> but I wear it sometimes for fun.</li>
            <li> painted my nails on a Tuesday evening (2 coats of the polish, 1 clear top coat)</li>
            <li> Definitely put a nice chip resistant topcoat on.</li>
            <li> I like the look of 3 thin coats best with 2 quick dry top coats.</li>
            <li> I put a solid white under and it looked great.</li>
            <li> VERY FAST DELIVERY.</li>
            <li> I think for the price I could definitely get a better polish.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s sooo pretty</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I paid for.</li>
            <li> I received compliments the first day I wore it to work; they said &amp;#34;oh</li>
            <li> By using a white basecoat, I was satisfied with just 2 coats.</li>
            <li> It looks exactly like the image</li>
            <li> Also recommend to do exactly three coats.  </li>
            <li> its pretty though</li>
            <li> The first time I used 3 coats plus the base/top coats and it lasted a week without chipping.  </li>
            <li> Really pretty polish.  </li>
            <li> I do like this product and am definitely going to buy more.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> it is so PRETTY  and FEMME.</li>
            <li> It is exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> I accidentally dropped and broke my first bottle of this polish.</li>
            <li> It was a trail and error at first to get the effect</li>
            <li> People at work have commented on how much they like it!</li>
            <li> I Instantly fell in love.</li>
            <li> Exactly like the photo.</li>
            <li> Wife fell in love with it instantly.</li>
            <li> This is also pretty in person</li>
            <li> The polish looks so cute in the pics, but it doesn&#x27;t look the same on.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I am most likely going to pass on trying their other tinted polishes, and stick with the clear ones, which are amazing!</li>
            <li> Got it very fast (3 days) would recommend but don&#x27;t expect too much.</li>
            <li> when I wear these, they look so pretty and are very attention getting.</li>
            <li> With a top coat to guard against chipping this wears a long time.</li>
            <li> I got many compliments on my nails, and it lasted a really long time.</li>
            <li> I have received SO many compliments on this particular white polish since wearing it.</li>
            <li> but it dried very fast and looks amazing.</li>
            <li> I will certainly order nail polish from this seller again.</li>
            <li> It reminds me a bit of a certain Easter egg candy.</li>
            <li> Almost $9 plus shipping, is very high priced.</li>
            <li> Sparkles were ruff &amp; hard to cover with top coat to make it smooth.</li>
            <li> it is also very affordable</li>
            <li> I thought the white was going to be cheap with glitter</li>
            <li> The ones with glitter in a colored polish, not so much.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> really like it just put it on my nails</li>
            <li> 2 coats is really all you&#x27;ll need.</li>
            <li> This polish is very durable.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> &#x27;s very pretty,very sparkly.</li>
            <li> Just ok, not as expected</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s photoshopped, I really don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> I really likes this on.</li>
            <li> I applied like 5-6 coats for a very finish polished look.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> Touches up very well.  </li>
            <li> Very durable on toes.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, the polish is more like water.</li>
            <li> Really looks like paint splattering on nails</li>
            <li> I really like this polish.  </li>
            <li> So far ive ordered 16 colors, currently have 3 with more coming from Amazon and their website.</li>
            <li> The white is not too sheer and the glitter shows up nicely.</li>
            <li> Mainly what comes out is the mini glitter flakes that you dont really even notice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never spent this much money on nail polish before and it was totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I did 3 thin layers and it looks amazing!</li>
            <li> nail polish requires base and top coats for the longest possible wear and best look.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Multiple coats are needed to get the full on look, as it appears in pic and bottle.</li>
            <li> I think this such a cool color.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;s super fun and easy to remove (at least the way i put them on!).</li>
            <li> Just paint your nails with a white nail polish first, let it dry and use this over it so that your finished nails are opaque. :)</li>
            <li> So no one really know what happened to the family that use to live there</li>
            <li> And even after putting a top coat on to protect it and have it last longer, it only lasted for 4 or so days before it chipped.</li>
            <li> It looks cute on but the white is not as vibrant as the pic; it&#x27;s actually a lil cloudy.</li>
            <li> I like the glitter but had to use multiple coats for the white to look okay.</li>
            <li> If you are lucky enough to get a nice pretty look on the first coat, when you put the 2nd coat on, the white paint is yet translucent but dark enough to cover up the glitter on the first coat.</li>
            <li> but,  it turned out as in light pink..</li>
            <li> great product, expensive</li>
            <li> Love this, but it doesn&#x27;t last long on the nails.</li>
            <li> So next time I applied a white basecoat before applying it and the result was pretty cool</li>
            <li> But polish is cute for a few days.</li>
            <li> You really have to let some of the polish drip back off your brush before you apply, or else the glitter effect will be largely covered up.</li>
            <li> It takes slightly longer to apply due to the glitter content, but if you follow the included instructions you&#x27;ll get good results.  </li>
            <li> Also, KBShimmer sent me this polish through the mail quickly, and it was packaged very well (compared to other items I&#x27;ve purchased through Amazon).</li>
            <li> I really only wear white in the summer, I love this polish, add alittle spice to white nail polish, highly recommended</li>
            <li> I love this polish so much, the only thing is it doesn&#x27;t last very long and peals off within a couple days.</li>
            <li> the white starts to cover up the glitter from first coat to the point where you can&#x27;t see it at all.  </li>
            <li> I usually paint my nails then add a top coat of glitter to it</li>
            <li> Such a pretty and effortless splatter design.</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY NO REGRETS!!!!</li>
            <li> The little specks of glitter is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I adore all of the KB Shimmer colors I have that are glitter in a clear polish.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyone who doesn&#x27;t use at least a top coat over the polish</li>
            <li> so you cannot really see the line like you would with a solid color.  </li>
            <li> However, you do have to use a couple coats to get near the look in the picture.  </li>
            <li> I also bought it in other colors and like the pink better.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to comment on wear, but I expect with a couple coats of Seche Vite topcoat, it&#x27;ll last just fine.</li>
            <li> Ordered the black already, purchasing the blue next :)</li>
            <li> definitely recommend buying this if you&#x27;re curious or think it looks cool.</li>
            <li> I have looked high and low for a nail polish like this.</li>
            <li> It stayed quite soft even days later</li>
            <li> Not in love with the price, but it&#x27;s the only nail polish I&#x27;ve reapplied a second time in a row, I usually I get bored with it quickly and change colors frequently.  </li>
            <li> I used a high quality base coat and three coats of this polish and two of a very high quality top coat.</li>
            <li> Would recommend with an opaque white base coat if you want the ultra bright white looking background, but I did it without the base coat and am very happy with how it looks.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t use a base or top coat and the polish lasted a little more than a week without chipping.</li>
            <li> Best to start with a plain white base then 2-3 coats of Oh Splat.</li>
            <li> You barely get any of the glitters and it goes on super thin and makes you need several coats.</li>
            <li> If you do 2-3 thin coats, let it dry in between, and shake the bottle very well leaving it upside down for a couple minutes before you start, you get tons of glitter and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure what it really looks</li>
            <li> Adding some polish or a coat of protector will add a few days to the look before it starts peeling in chunks like a old paint chip on a 30,000 year old house that was abandoned in ancient times due to famine.</li>
            <li> However, at the end of the day that&#x27;s no different than painting your nails a mint green, soft pink, white, etc.</li>
            <li> Also dried decently quickly - I always have a problem keeping my hands still for so long and usually have to reapply one or two nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t it just turns out like clear polish with a few sparkles.</li>
            <li> and it lasts for a ridiculously long time under Seche Vite tope coat.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how long it lasts on my nails without chipping.</li>
            <li> my other nails either have a big glob of glitter or just one or two pieces of glitter.</li>
            <li> and it stays on for a long time!</li>
            <li> It does take a while to dry.</li>
            <li> The polish itself is pretty thin.</li>
            <li> So in reading some of the previous reviews, I was struck by the number of people who either neglected to or didn&#x27;t think of, using a WHITE basecoat with this.</li>
            <li> I thought at first it might be weird because it was white</li>
            <li> but ........ half my nails are just covered in white nail polish</li>
            <li> The little glitter spots are different sizes.  </li>
            <li> It reminds me of Angel Food Cake with the little colors mixed in!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been into a lot of confetti polishes lately and this one was far and away the easiest to apply.  </li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t get enough spattering and dimension and with the 4th coat I tried on a few nails</li>
            <li> And there is not nearly as much.</li>
            <li> when you paint over the wet polish you pick up all the glitter with the brush</li>
            <li> Once all the coats are on it dulls out the glitter.</li>
            <li> You need to use both a base and top coat in order to have it last longer than one day.  </li>
            <li> It does take 3 coats to achieve the look and just like with any other nail polish that has sparkles in it, removing it&#x27;s a pain.</li>
            <li> Due to cooking cleaning scrubbing.</li>
            <li> On the upside, you can use other color base coats that effect the tiny of this nail polish that will consistently make it look different.</li>
            <li> Lasts an average of 4-5 days.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth 12 dollars.</li>
            <li> You will need to use at least 2-3 applications if you are looking for the same look as the bottle.</li>
            <li> I kept my polish upside down as instructed, overnight.</li>
            <li> One exception to this is Band Geek, with metallic glitter in a medium black polish.</li>
            <li> This little party in a bottle will make you think it is though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Takes a little longer to remove, because of the glitter, but not a deal breaker.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already told a few other friends about it!!</li>
            <li> The polish doesn&#x27;t have a harsh nail polish smell which is a plus.</li>
            <li> The flecks make it not smooth</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> And even though it looks like it would go on like that, I consider it false advertising since it doesn&#x27;t actually look like that on.</li>
            <li> But not a cute little hand made product.    </li>
            <li> I used with the OPI Glitter off Base Coat to take it off quickly.</li>
            <li> When i tried &amp; got dried i was so disappointed &#x27;cause i was expecting white, white</li>
            <li> Since I have it I will use it again, but I am not sure how often.</li>
            <li> Worst part about it is the big pretty flakes of glitter that you see stay stuck to the sides of the bottle.</li>
            <li> My polish usually peels off after a day.</li>
            <li> Do use a solid white base coat for optimal effect.  </li>
            <li> I always have a hard time picking between the two polishes I bought</li>
            <li> The pieces are sparse and the color is rather dull.  </li>
            <li> Takes at the least, four layers to look like the picture.</li>
            <li> You need at least 2 coats.  </li>
            <li> Only negative thing is, sparkle pieces very difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> Expensive polish but</li>
            <li> reason it&#x27;s not 5 stars is because I think it&#x27;s too expensive.</li>
            <li> It goes with everything you wear, you can&#x27;t go wrong with it, weather u are going somewhere fancy or not..</li>
            <li> but chances are they died a horrible death due to non-existence.</li>
            <li> That makes me unhappy since I paid 12$ for it.</li>
            <li> My niece is crazy about it.</li>
            <li> My grandkids went crazy over all three.  </li>
            <li> Too bad</li>
            <li> If you are a fan of the whites, and you like glitter, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I used OPI base coast and OPI&#x27;s bunny polich</li>
            <li> /&gt;you have to put a base coat on, then, after that dries, you put on 3 coats of the polish.</li>
            <li> You can use a base coat and that will work, but for the price I&#x27;d prefer to just need one coat of this.</li>
            <li> Perhaps if I had a base coat on it would have helped.</li>
            <li> Looks terrible and impossible to use.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Bought this cause it looked cool in the picture. Reality is that you have to put about 5 coats on for you to get the white look and to get enough glitter on your nails. If you don&#x27;t it just turns out like clear polish with a few sparkles.</li>
            <li> Glitter girls have all the fun.</li>
            <li> Love love love this nail polish!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what people are talking about if they say it doesnt look like the pictures. I get so many compliments when I wear these, they look so pretty and are very attention getting. If you do 2-3 thin coats, let it dry in between, and shake the bottle very well leaving it upside down for a couple minutes before you start, you get tons of glitter and goes on smooth. I like the look of 3 thin coats best with 2 quick dry top coats. I  work at an animal hospital as a veterinary assistant and this nail polish stayed on for over a week before it started to chip. So far ive ordered 16 colors, currently have 3 with more coming from Amazon and their website. Best nail polish ive ever tried.</li>
            <li> I bought this polish looking for something different. I used a high quality base coat and three coats of this polish and two of a very high quality top coat. It looked amazing for about a day. Then it started cracking and chipping. I bought the purple one too and same problem. I think for the price I could definitely get a better polish.</li>
            <li> I have never been much of one for chunky glitter nail polish or jelly polish, but I LOVE this. the formula is great and when you layer it, the effect looks very organic and pretty.</li>
            <li> I really only wear white in the summer, I love this polish, add alittle spice to white nail polish, highly recommended</li>
            <li> People ask me where I got it! We all wish it was local!&lt;br /&gt;I will have to get some for them too.</li>
            <li> Works great it is also very affordable</li>
            <li> Just as described, paints just like in picture, although have to paint 2 to 3 coats. Still happy.</li>
            <li> Nice product.  Excellent seller.</li>
            <li> I saw this nail polish on a website and wanted to try it. I ordered it off of here and got it within a couple of days. It looks really cool! I did 3 thin layers and it looks amazing! It does take a while to dry. I would recommend putting on a top coat. But all in all, this is a very wonderful product! I do recommend it.</li>
            <li> I really love this glitter polish it looks like a painters drop.cloth if you put it over white polish it&#x27;s sooo pretty it just needs to be a bit cheaper 9 total would be excellant.</li>
            <li> It looks great, but because it requires so many layers, it took forever to dry. It stayed quite soft even days later and I could put fingernail dents in the surface.</li>
            <li> This is such a nice polish. I have looked high and low for a nail polish like this. It is white but it has2 multi colored glitters in it. I Love it! It looks so chick and so clean. I thought the white was going to be cheap with glitter and you&#x27;d pay for the bottle but it really is a great quality polish, I am impressed. I will be buying more from KB shimmer.</li>
            <li> This is fun nail polish.  The little glitter spots are different sizes.  Lasts an average of 4-5 days.</li>
            <li> I adore all of the KB Shimmer colors I have that are glitter in a clear polish.  The ones with glitter in a colored polish, not so much.  Maybe it&#x27;s just a personal taste thing, but Oh Splat and Shipwreck look great in the bottle and not so much on my fingernails. You really have to let some of the polish drip back off your brush before you apply, or else the glitter effect will be largely covered up. Even with that step, I found myself wishing for more sparkle in the end.  One exception to this is Band Geek, with metallic glitter in a medium black polish. That one&#x27;s a stunner, imo. Anyway, I am most likely going to pass on trying their other tinted polishes, and stick with the clear ones, which are amazing!</li>
            <li> This product is really cool. Gave it to a friend as a graduation gift and she loves it. Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> Very cute nail polish! Just paint your nails with a white nail polish first, let it dry and use this over it so that your finished nails are opaque. :)</li>
            <li> Everything was as it should be. I got exactly what I paid for. Everything was great.</li>
            <li> Expensive polish but definitely one of my favorites (and I have over 150 bottles of OPI, ESSIE, China Glaze and Zoya).  Goes on in 2 or 3 coats. Doesn&#x27;t chip. Perfect!</li>
            <li> love it! 3 coats and you get exactly in the photo!!</li>
            <li> Happy Birthday to me…Happy Birthday to me!  oh, wait…It&#x27;s not my birthday!!  ha ha ha!  This little party in a bottle will make you think it is though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE this fun polish!</li>
            <li> &lt;3 sooo happy!!! Reminds me of jawbreakers! And I&#x27;ve recieved a LOT of compliments! One of my favorite nail polishes for sure :) thank you again!!</li>
            <li> After multiple coats I just never managed to make it look like the picture.  A friend and I both purchased it and neither of us plan to use it regularly.</li>
            <li> Love this, but it doesn&#x27;t last long on the nails. Peels off very easily. Got many compliments on it while it lasted.</li>
            <li> This polish is great! It looks great it goes on smooth and dries quickly! Awesome I will buy this product again!</li>
            <li> I have gotten so many compliments on this nail polish! It is interesting, but you need to have 2-3 layers to get it to look like the picture. I apply a top coat so it lasts longer.</li>
            <li> It will look like the nails in the picture after... hmmm 10 applications, maybe.</li>
            <li> 3 coats applied just as advised, and voila! just like the swatches shown. Easy for me to take off as well. Recommended for anyone who hasn&#x27;t tried indie polish and love painting your own nails!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a terrible polish, but I had to do 4 to 5 coats to have it look as nice as the picture, and even then there didn&#x27;t seem to be a lot of chunks of color in my polish (even after shaking it), so I had to hunt for color chunks to specifically add to the nails that didn&#x27;t have as much color as the others.  Definitely needs more color chunks and sparkles!  And even after putting a top coat on to protect it and have it last longer, it only lasted for 4 or so days before it chipped.</li>
            <li> The second I saw this polish online I just knew I had to have it. I bought this white version [Oh splat] and the purple version [Iris My Case]. I put on this white one as soon as it arrived. It is so cute! Looks just like the picture. I used 2 coats and it looks great, probably could&#x27;ve done 3 for even more of the glitter pieces. I received compliments the first day I wore it to work; they said &amp;#34;oh did you go get your nails done?&amp;#34;. Awesome! It has been on over 3 days now, with a top coat of course, and no chipping yet. Get it!</li>
            <li> really like it just put it on my nails</li>
            <li> did nit like this it just whit nail polish with glitter in it nothing special.. and cant return it.. so there it sits..</li>
            <li> Although it appears white in the ad, it goes on a bit gray in actuality.  You need to use both a base and top coat in order to have it last longer than one day.  I also bought it in other colors and like the pink better.  There are a lot of &amp;#34;dots&amp;#34; of color, so each nail gets plenty of sparkle!  I would give it 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t chip so quickly.</li>
            <li> A bit on the pricey side for my taste.  Superfast  shipping though. :)</li>
            <li> Great color!  I get lots of compliments on when I wear this polish.  Speedy shipping and the product was packaged well.  I will certainly order nail polish from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like polish. Sparkles were ruff &amp; hard to cover with top coat to make it smooth. Plus company charged for two bottle when I only ordered one.Won&#x27;t deal with this company again.</li>
            <li> So in reading some of the previous reviews, I was struck by the number of people who either neglected to or didn&#x27;t think of, using a WHITE basecoat with this. By using a white basecoat, I was satisfied with just 2 coats. I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to comment on wear, but I expect with a couple coats of Seche Vite topcoat, it&#x27;ll last just fine. The glitter colors are bright and fun to wear. I&#x27;m glad I decided to buy this. I anticipate many cute manis using it.</li>
            <li> It looks exactly like the image shows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason it&#x27;s not 5 stars is because I think it&#x27;s too expensive. It&#x27;s awesome polish that does and looks like advertised, but it should be a bit cheaper. Almost $9 plus shipping, is very high priced. That being said, I WILL buy more colors but can&#x27;t afford to buy as many as I&#x27;d like to. If priced lower I&#x27;d buy them all, over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2-4 coats works great. Depending on how white you want the white to look. You can see the glitter (aka splatter) of each layer. Great look!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fyi...&lt;br /&gt;All nail polish requires base and top coats for the longest possible wear and best look.&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who doesn&#x27;t use at least a top coat over the polish will not have longevity (no matter which brand they use). Especially with such chunky glitter pieces in this type of polish. They&#x27;ll catch on clothes etc without top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend buying this if you&#x27;re curious or think it looks cool. It IS cool.</li>
            <li> It takes a good while to dry but it looks very cool on. Would make a great gift for someone who likes doing their nails.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I used OPI base coast and OPI&#x27;s bunny polich (it&#x27;s a clearish white polish). Then I did two coats of the glitter polish and one Sally&#x27;s quick drying top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend says it looks like jawbreakers and it kind of does! IT&#x27;s super fun and easy to remove (at least the way i put them on!).</li>
            <li> The polish doesn&#x27;t have a harsh nail polish smell which is a plus. It also has a gel-like consistency which is also a plus and it lasts for a ridiculously long time under Seche Vite tope coat. 2 coats is really all you&#x27;ll need.</li>
            <li> This polish is ok. It looks cute on but the white is not as vibrant as the pic; it&#x27;s actually a lil cloudy.</li>
            <li> I love this polish so much, the only thing is it doesn&#x27;t last very long and peals off within a couple days. Too bad but I wear it sometimes for fun.</li>
            <li> This nail polish is so pretty! I&#x27;ve been into a lot of confetti polishes lately and this one was far and away the easiest to apply.  I didn&#x27;t struggle at all to get the glitter pieces on my nails.  Would recommend with an opaque white base coat if you want the ultra bright white looking background, but I did it without the base coat and am very happy with how it looks.  Also recommend to do exactly three coats.  Any fewer and you don&#x27;t get enough spattering and dimension and with the 4th coat I tried on a few nails the white starts to cover up the glitter from first coat to the point where you can&#x27;t see it at all.  Very pretty and PERFECT for Spring!</li>
            <li> I love this color!  I usually paint my nails then add a top coat of glitter to it however this saves me that extra step!</li>
            <li> This item was a present for my girlfriend, and she loved it. It seems to be good quality as some of her nail polish starts chipping off after a day or two and this one has been on her nails for a week.</li>
            <li> 2-3 coats, not bad formula, goes on nicely, beautiful, i love it.</li>
            <li> you have to use 4 to 5 coat&#x27;s.or use a white under coat.</li>
            <li> This nail color is really great. I thought at first it might be weird because it was white but I decided to give it a try. The little specks of glitter is fantastic. It reminds me of dip n dots ice cream but it looks great on nails</li>
            <li> It does take 3 coats to achieve the look and just like with any other nail polish that has sparkles in it, removing it&#x27;s a pain. Ordered the black already, purchasing the blue next :)</li>
            <li> This polish came with a lengthy instruction sheet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you have to put a base coat on, then, after that dries, you put on 3 coats of the polish. Then a top coat (or in my case, a gel finish)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have the kind of time to do all of this. its pretty though</li>
            <li> The nail polish was cute, but it looked better in the picture than it did on my nails. There were detailed instructions for applying the polish on the bottle. Since I have it I will use it again, but I am not sure how often.</li>
            <li> So very super cute! Like funfetti cupcake frosting for your finger tips! Takes at the least, four layers to look like the picture.</li>
            <li> Buying nail polish online started with this color. Very fun and unique. Best to start with a plain white base then 2-3 coats of Oh Splat.</li>
            <li> I was so excited for this by the picture and couldn&#x27;t wait to order it. I got it home and it was ok, not great by any means! It is more translucent than I thought so 2 coats it a must. Worst part about it is the big pretty flakes of glitter that you see stay stuck to the sides of the bottle. I can&#x27;t seem to get them off the inside of the bottle and onto the brush. Mainly what comes out is the mini glitter flakes that you dont really even notice. If you are lucky enough to get a nice pretty look on the first coat, when you put the 2nd coat on, the white paint is yet translucent but dark enough to cover up the glitter on the first coat. It is a great idea for beautiful nail polish but has some glitches that need to be worked out.</li>
            <li> It goes with everything you wear, you can&#x27;t go wrong with it, weather u are going somewhere fancy or not..</li>
            <li> Great polish. Multiple coats are needed to get the full on look, as it appears in pic and bottle. The polish itself is pretty thin.</li>
            <li> loved it! Looks very interesting)</li>
            <li> Such a pretty and effortless splatter design. It makes my hands look fun and bright and I hope its never discontinued!</li>
            <li> This color is very cute - it looks like a candy shell when it dries (kind of like a gobstopper). Apply 3 layers for best results.</li>
            <li> Everybody compliments this polish</li>
            <li> This has become one of my favorites.  Love this polish.  Beautiful color and good coverage.  Do use a solid white base coat for optimal effect.  It takes slightly longer to apply due to the glitter content, but if you follow the included instructions you&#x27;ll get good results.  Takes a little longer to remove, because of the glitter, but not a deal breaker.  I found that Opi polish remover for gel nails does a great job.  With a top coat to guard against chipping this wears a long time.</li>
            <li> It has a really great, fun color. The only downside (that is kind of an upside too?) is that it needs more than one coat. You can use a base coat and that will work, but for the price I&#x27;d prefer to just need one coat of this. On the upside, you can use other color base coats that effect the tiny of this nail polish that will consistently make it look different. However, at the end of the day that&#x27;s no different than painting your nails a mint green, soft pink, white, etc. then putting a glitter polish on top.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing color! I tried it by itself and after three coats it was still transparent. So next time I applied a white basecoat before applying it and the result was pretty cool, it looked like a jaw breaker. I got many compliments on my nails, and it lasted a really long time.</li>
            <li> Not in love with the price, but it&#x27;s the only nail polish I&#x27;ve reapplied a second time in a row, I usually I get bored with it quickly and change colors frequently.  The first time I used 3 coats plus the base/top coats and it lasted a week without chipping.  The second time I used 2 coats with the base/top coat and I&#x27;m on day 10 with just one chip.  I do dishes, garden and all my regular activities so I am pleased with it&#x27;s durability and appearance, but I may have to reevaluate before reordering because of the price.</li>
            <li> Good product does just what it says</li>
            <li> I like the glitter but had to use multiple coats for the white to look okay. Wouldn&#x27;t buy it in more colors.</li>
            <li> Really pretty polish.  I used with the OPI Glitter off Base Coat to take it off quickly.</li>
            <li> Love this nail polish. Looks great on my toenails</li>
            <li> I have received SO many compliments on this particular white polish since wearing it. The first day alone at work I had so many people asking about this polish. VERY FAST DELIVERY. I was super impressed! Will be ordering more from this seller. This polish is very durable. Looks great with about 2 coats total. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Cute but paid to much for the nail polish to pricey for me</li>
            <li> I like it .It&#x27;s very pretty,very sparkly. It reminds me a bit of a certain Easter egg candy. I haven&#x27;t seen  polish anything like it in stores. Only negative thing is, sparkle pieces very difficult to remove. Perhaps if I had a base coat on it would have helped.</li>
            <li> Just ok, not as expected</li>
            <li> Great polish and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> This is now my favorite nail polish. I am definitely purchasing more nail polish from KBShimmer! They make some unique polish. I literally got compliments from everyone when I wore the Oh Splat!...Can&#x27;t explain how much I love this polish. Also, KBShimmer sent me this polish through the mail quickly, and it was packaged very well (compared to other items I&#x27;ve purchased through Amazon).</li>
            <li> When i tried &amp; got dried i was so disappointed &#x27;cause i was expecting white, white but,  it turned out as in light pink..</li>
            <li> Whoever photographed these should win an award. This polish is very pretty but it does not look like it does in the photo. Maybe it&#x27;s photoshopped, I really don&#x27;t know. I know that the glitter does not apply as evenly as it is shown in the photos. And there is not nearly as much. These colors are actually very cool, but they just look nothing like the photos. Nothing. I kept my polish upside down as instructed, overnight. Did 4 coats and my nails do not come even close to the photo. I think if you show a realistic photo it would be less misleading. I purchased over 10 colors, like a fool, based on the photos.    I like the colors. And I will probably buy more, but I compare this to fast food photos. The photos look nothing what you get when you get there.    That is something I would expect of a corporation. But not a cute little hand made product.    I do like this product and am definitely going to buy more. I just wish the photos would be more realistic.    Thanks! and keep on coming out with more amazing colors.    I have shared these with all of my friends too.  So when you get sales in Studio City or north Hollywood that is me or my friends.</li>
            <li> Big hit...everyone loved this...looks like the malted milk eggs at Easter. Went on smooth...awesome!</li>
            <li> This is really nice and would be perfect for a birthday or Easter.</li>
            <li> I really likes this on. But be warned that removing the glitter takes some elbow grease!</li>
            <li> Nice! I applied like 5-6 coats for a very finish polished look. I love this nail polish it is so PRETTY  and FEMME. It&#x27;s not clumpy and the after look resembles a glaze with sprinkles ....YUM!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love. Immediately became my favorite color. Glitter is not over the top and can be worn all the time. It is exactly as pictured. The white is not too sheer and the glitter shows up nicely. If you are a fan of the whites, and you like glitter, you will not be disappointed. Wears well. Just ordered a second bottle as back up. Polish arrived on time.</li>
            <li> We followed EVERY direction and even brought it to a nail salon in an attempt to use this nail polish. The paint comes out so watery that it just runs off the nail/finger.  Looks terrible and impossible to use.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this and she loved it.  All of her friends also seemed to like it b/c they kept complimenting her nails and asking what place had that polish.  She is happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is amazing! I too saw this nail polish on Pinterest and had to rush online to buy it. The girls website has more options listed. I&#x27;m going to purchase Elle and Band Geek next. I had to put three coats on but it dried very fast and looks amazing. I used Essie &amp;#34;good to go!&amp;#34; top coat. We&#x27;ll see how long it lasts on my nails without chipping. So far, I&#x27;m very pleased!!! I&#x27;ve already told a few other friends about it!!</li>
            <li> I accidentally dropped and broke my first bottle of this polish. lol, thought the name of it suited the action beautifully! I had to re-order it because I love it. It arrived quickly and well packaged. Would order from seller again.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and a great product.  Just as described and seen in the picture.  I think this such a cool color.</li>
            <li> I have a 50/50 on this polish, I  had to apply 3 coats to be able to get the glitter look i wanted.</li>
            <li> pretty, but you need to use a lot of layers rather than the usual to layers if you want it to look the way it does in the picture. when you paint over the wet polish you pick up all the glitter with the brush</li>
            <li> This,stayed on very well and really is beautiful, especially in the sun. Matches everything!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need anything else</li>
            <li> 4 stars today because after I ordered it, I found it for 1.50 at rue 21. That makes me unhappy since I paid 12$ for it. And even though it looks like it would go on like that, I consider it false advertising since it doesn&#x27;t actually look like that on. You barely get any of the glitters and it goes on super thin and makes you need several coats. Once all the coats are on it dulls out the glitter. I tried white under it. It doesn&#x27;t work very well. Definitely not worth 12 dollars. It was quick to deliver and packaged nicely. That&#x27;s why the 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Got this for the wife as a gift. It was a trail and error at first to get the effect but once she did she really loved it.</li>
            <li> Like birthday cupcakes on your fingertips. I like to paint one or two accent fingertips with this.</li>
            <li> Nice creamy polish with a gorgeous assortment of glitters. I wear it over white so the colors pop. Also over pastels - it looks like a glitter Easter egg. Very nice.</li>
            <li> Loved it. So cute and will buy again when out. I only need to use 2 coats and it stays on great. My polish usually peels off after a day. Due to cooking cleaning scrubbing. This one lasted 3 days. So I was pleased.</li>
            <li> Very pretty! You will need a couple of coats but it looks great!</li>
            <li> looks good with 2 or 3 coats. I put a solid white under and it looked great.</li>
            <li> Great nail polish.  The sparkle colors are a little more saturated than the stock photo, but all in all I am very happy with this purchase.  I&#x27;ve never spent this much money on nail polish before and it was totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I painted my nails on a Tuesday evening (2 coats of the polish, 1 clear top coat), it&#x27;s now Thursday and it has not chipped yet!  Definitely happy I splurged on this product.</li>
            <li> Cute polish.  Great alone or with other colors.  Draws attention to your hands or toes when wearing it.  My niece is crazy about it.</li>
            <li> Sent it as a gift to someone so I&#x27;m not sure what it really looks like but the recipient was happy so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> love this.  The white with the flecks looks great on my toes.  Not child like but I bet kids would love it too.  You need at least 2 coats.  Touches up very well.  As my nails grow out I can just fill in.  The flecks make it not smooth so you cannot really see the line like you would with a solid color.  Very durable on toes.</li>
            <li> The quality of the nail polish is really good. Although removing the glitter takes some time, if you follow the instructions it&#x27;s pretty easy.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife and she always wear this colour.  It looks so beautiful on her nails, I can&#x27;t help but stare.  The formula is very easy to apply no clumping or difficulty whatsoever.  This polish dries fast!!!  Amazing shade with jelly white and glitter....sooooo beautiful!!!! 💅🏼</li>
            <li> great product, expensive</li>
            <li> Some nail polishes with glitter and confetti in them you have to do layers and layers to get enough glitter on your nail.  Not this one - it apply easy and I only did two applications. Very nice</li>
            <li> This is a nice nail polish! It was easier to apply with all the glitter pieces than I anticipated. Also dried decently quickly - I always have a problem keeping my hands still for so long and usually have to reapply one or two nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t use a base or top coat and the polish lasted a little more than a week without chipping. People at work have commented on how much they like it!</li>
            <li> love it its a happy color</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cover as well as I thought it would</li>
            <li> I thought this would be cute for Easter - looks like an easter egg.  You need 4-5 coats to even come close to looking like this picture- don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in LOVE😍😍😍 I saw this online while browsing. I Instantly fell in love. I knew then and there that I had to have it. ABSOLUTELY NO REGRETS!!!! I recommend this.👍🏾👍🏽</li>
            <li> Super cute nail polish!  It&#x27;s very fun and girly and looks a lot like the picture.  Make sure to apply 2 coats for a great look!</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, the polish is more like water. I had to put 5 coats on my nails. I gave it to my niece to play dress up with.</li>
            <li> You would need to apply 2-3 coats of the polish in order for it to look like it does in the picture. Adding some polish or a coat of protector will add a few days to the look before it starts peeling in chunks like a old paint chip on a 30,000 year old house that was abandoned in ancient times due to famine. So no one really know what happened to the family that use to live there but chances are they died a horrible death due to non-existence. But polish is cute for a few days.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to receive this in the mail. It actually came with detailed instructions on how to care for and apply the product for best results.</li>
            <li> Exactly like the photo. I only use two coats to get the look in the pic. It reminds me of paintball so I&#x27;d say the name is pretty fit. My new favorite nail polish!</li>
            <li> Thist is a unique and attractive polish and I have gotten a lot of compliments.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always being complemented on how pretty my nail polish is! I always have a hard time picking between the two polishes I bought so I think that means I need more! Would and will recommend to friends and family.</li>
            <li> Looks as advertised in the pictures once applied. Wife fell in love with it instantly.</li>
            <li> Takes quite a few coats to get desired look but once you do it looks great</li>
            <li> This is just OK - I had to apply other glitter on top to get a really good effect.  The pieces are sparse and the color is rather dull.  But - with a glitter topping it was better.</li>
            <li> I found this polish on wanelo and instantly loved it! Shipping was fast and the polish looks great on my nails! I got so many compliments!</li>
            <li> Love this one!!!!! This is also pretty in person</li>
            <li> I got this because I love the look and the colors but ........ half my nails are just covered in white nail polish NO glitter my other nails either have a big glob of glitter or just one or two pieces of glitter. I have to fish out glitter and place them where I want them to make them look anything g like the picture shows.</li>
            <li> I ordered this along with chromies and I love all three.  My grandkids went crazy over all three.  It reminds me of Angel Food Cake with the little colors mixed in!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love it!</li>
            <li> I just can get enough of this polish,  compliments galore when ever I wear it.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color and it stays on for a long time!</li>
            <li> The polish looks so cute in the pics, but it doesn&#x27;t look the same on. Got it very fast (3 days) would recommend but don&#x27;t expect too much.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this nail polish. Even though it&#x27;s a bit pricier than most nail polishes, it&#x27;s worth it. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on it. It looks best with 2-3 coats. Definitely put a nice chip resistant topcoat on.</li>
            <li> It’s awesome! You don’t need to glop it on to get the glitter – it is easy to put on and is a super fun color!</li>
            <li> got it in perfect time! love the polish, very fun for toes also.  easter too. saw it on pintrest had to have it.</li>
            <li> Great nail polish looks exactly like the picture</li>
            <li> Cool color. Great formula. Really looks like paint splattering on nails</li>
            <li> I was unfamiliar with this brand but decided to take my chances on it because I loved the look in the bottle. I was not disappointed! The polish applies smoothly (even with all the glitter) and layered well. You will need to use at least 2-3 applications if you are looking for the same look as the bottle. The first layer will appear translucent as most light colored polished do. Drying time was fairly quick. I&#x27;m looking forward trying out different products from this brand!</li>
            <li> I found this on Pinterest months ago and was dying to try it. So glad it&#x27;s for sale on amazon now! I got it within 2 days of ordering it. Easy to apply. 2 coats will work but the more you apply the cooler it looks. Completely worth the price!</li>
            <li> I really like this polish.  However, you do have to use a couple coats to get near the look in the picture.  Very cute though.</li>
