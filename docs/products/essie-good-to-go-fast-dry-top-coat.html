            <li>This is by far one of the fastest drying top coats I have bought yet!!!!</li>

            <li>Essie super fast top coat works very very perfectly on my nails</li>
            <li>So glad my daughter in law turned me on to Essie.</li>
            <li>Will be buying more</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product as does everyone to whom I introduce it.  </li>
            <li>I love Essie polishes, so I decided to try their top coat to replace the goop.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d give Essie top coat a try since I have a couple of their nail colors.</li>
            <li>it does what it says thee best already on my second bottle!!!</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I always use this top coat and people ask me if it is Shellac all the time.</li>
            <li>Two days after applying, I will have chunks on the nail polish chipping off, I&#x27;ve never had problems with top coat before.</li>
            <li>Amazing price and my nails are so shiny and pretty!</li>
            <li>Other than that IM IN LOVE WITH IT!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Dries polish super quick and provides a nice shine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a pretty, glossy top coat that does have you sitting around waiting for thirty minutes (more like 5 to 10).</li>
            <li>I used this top coat for the first time and LOVE it.</li>
            <li>So it doesnt matter if something lightly brushes up against it...</li>
            <li>To Go Top Coat that was pictured with the blue label I was sent the Essie Good</li>
            <li>This top coat dries fast and is super shiny and strong.</li>
            <li>cause all my top coats wasn&#x27;t so fast drying.</li>
            <li>good product, as expected although seche-vite is a far superior product</li>
            <li>This polish dries super fast which is great, however, my polish ends up chipped the next day which is a bummer.  </li>
            <li>It dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Mine holds a week and no chips which is rare for my nails</li>
            <li>I love it :) and they dry super fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used it on top of a normal topcoat and its like a shield the polish lasts much longer.</li>
            <li>I use a much cheaper brand and it works faster and shines better will stick ti simple and cheap from now on</li>
            <li>This polish shines and drys super fast to touch (not to pressure).</li>
            <li>Dries really fast &amp; super shiny.</li>
            <li>I will look for a longer lasting top coat since this one didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to go throw the hassle of trying to return the product that I did not pay for especially when it would have cost me more money to pay for shipping.</li>
            <li>Seller ships fairly fast also!</li>
            <li>Love this product and actually dries your nails.</li>
            <li>and it is definitely fast drying and shiny!</li>
            <li>This is the only top coat I use.</li>
            <li>I put this top coat on and my nails haven&#x27;t split and actually feel stronger.</li>
            <li>High gloss, very protective finish and dries super fast!</li>
            <li>For my next bottle, I might try the Essie Good To Go Fast Dry High Gloss Top Coat for the extra shine.</li>
            <li>but it does not happen very often.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Essie top coat has a nice flat brush for application, whereas the Seche Vite is kind of round and hard to apply evenly.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s super SUPER fast drying and super long lasting.</li>
            <li>It dried so fast and leaves your nails shiny and smooth!</li>
            <li>I wish that the top coat were slight more long lasting.</li>
            <li>It really does dry quickly and it lasts.</li>
            <li>just wait at least 2 mins or so for the nail polish to dry a little just so the color wont smear and wont get on the&amp;#34; good to go top coat&#x27;s brush!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like 60 seconds if the other coats are dry.</li>
            <li>This helps the polish dry very fast.</li>
            <li>I was using Sally Hansen top coat previously and it took FOREVER to dry!</li>
            <li>Dries hard very quickly setting the polish underneath</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this one, being a mom of 2: a baby and a toddler life is busy, and with this I manage to polish my nails, and get them dry in no time!!!</li>
            <li>Up to this point, I was using Seche Vite and after a year of use, my bottle started getting super goopy, thick, and ruining the coats of polish.</li>

            <li> It definitely helps your nails dry quicker and gives a shiny coat...</li>
            <li> Product applies over WET polish and almost instantly bonds and dries.  </li>
            <li> To Go Rapid Dry &amp; Shine with the peach label.</li>
            <li> There is a difference between the process in how both of these products dry and finish.</li>
            <li> I have dry hands, cuticles, and nails.</li>
            <li> a few seconds later, but don&#x27;t go folding clothes or doing your hair after.</li>
            <li> My nails dried instantly and my nail polish has lasted longer than any other other nail polish/top coat I have tried.</li>
            <li> The product practically bypasses the tacky stage of the drying process and becomes quite hard in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> I just scratched a little one nail and nothing was dry!!!</li>
            <li> It does require touch ups every few days.</li>
            <li> I tried Sally Hansen top coats, they were very terrible and after hour of drying my nails</li>
            <li> A lot of my top coats in the past have gotten thick and nasty after a while.</li>
            <li> No more spa flipflops in the winter!  </li>
            <li> No more need to wait for drying nails!</li>
            <li> It works I usually allow 5 min if I&#x27;m expecting it to dry to the base coat.</li>
            <li> Essie also doesn&#x27;t have the nasty chemical smell that Seche Vite does, and I feel like it doesn&#x27;t require as much product.</li>
            <li> It says that you can put it on before the color polish dries and that it will dry all the way through to the base coat.</li>
            <li> Was sadly dissatisfied with this...</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because I was sent the wrong product.</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product! Dries extremely quickly and the gloss is perfect! I&#x27;ve had it on for a week and still no chips!</li>
            <li> Best I have ever used! So glad my daughter in law turned me on to Essie. Will be buying more</li>
            <li> This polish shines and drys super fast to touch (not to pressure). So it doesnt matter if something lightly brushes up against it...a few seconds later, but don&#x27;t go folding clothes or doing your hair after. Couple this with the Essie ridge filler &amp;#34;fill the gap&amp;#34; polish and your nails will have the perfect appearance.</li>
            <li> I was really impressed with this top coat. It really does dry quickly and it lasts. The product practically bypasses the tacky stage of the drying process and becomes quite hard in a short amount of time. I wish that the top coat were slight more long lasting. I have experienced some peeling with it but it does not happen very often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a pretty, glossy top coat that does have you sitting around waiting for thirty minutes (more like 5 to 10).</li>
            <li> I do my nails myself all the time, so  when I use this oil, it makes my nails look like I went to get them done.</li>
            <li> Always one of the best top coats out there. High gloss, very protective finish and dries super fast! The seller is always great and dependable and shipments always arrive on time.</li>
            <li> Dries polish super quick and provides a nice shine. It says that you can put it on before the color polish dries and that it will dry all the way through to the base coat. It works I usually allow 5 min if I&#x27;m expecting it to dry to the base coat. It&#x27;s more like 60 seconds if the other coats are dry. I&#x27;ve also used it on top of a normal topcoat and its like a shield the polish lasts much longer.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product as does everyone to whom I introduce it.  Product applies over WET polish and almost instantly bonds and dries.  You can polish your nails and head to bed without fear of smudges.  I introduced my salon to Good 2 Go for use with pedicures.  I can put shoes on without it marring the pedicure!  No more spa flipflops in the winter!  Only issue is that if you use infrequently, it will thicken before you use up the bottle.  But if you manicure weekly or more often you should be Good 2 Go!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this one, being a mom of 2: a baby and a toddler life is busy, and with this I manage to polish my nails, and get them dry in no time!!!</li>
            <li> I used this top coat for the first time and LOVE it. My nails dried instantly and my nail polish has lasted longer than any other other nail polish/top coat I have tried.</li>
            <li> WORKS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IM GETTING ANOTHER ONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! just wait at least 2 mins or so for the nail polish to dry a little just so the color wont smear and wont get on the&amp;#34; good to go top coat&#x27;s brush! Other than that IM IN LOVE WITH IT!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This polish dries super fast which is great, however, my polish ends up chipped the next day which is a bummer.  I will look for a longer lasting top coat since this one didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because I was sent the wrong product. Instead of sending me the Essie Good To Go Top Coat that was pictured with the blue label I was sent the Essie Good To Go Rapid Dry &amp; Shine with the peach label. There is a difference between the process in how both of these products dry and finish. I didn&#x27;t want to go throw the hassle of trying to return the product that I did not pay for especially when it would have cost me more money to pay for shipping.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the fastest drying top coats I have bought yet!!!! I&#x27;ve bought many!! It goes easily on top of all the coats without a hitch!  A must have in your nail care collection! Seller ships fairly fast also!</li>
            <li> definetly i recomend this product, is very good a does a good work in the nails, i always use it with all of my nail polish</li>
            <li> Was sadly dissatisfied with this...I use a much cheaper brand and it works faster and shines better will stick ti simple and cheap from now on</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this top coat! Up to this point, I was using Seche Vite and after a year of use, my bottle started getting super goopy, thick, and ruining the coats of polish. I love Essie polishes, so I decided to try their top coat to replace the goop. The Essie top coat has a nice flat brush for application, whereas the Seche Vite is kind of round and hard to apply evenly. Essie also doesn&#x27;t have the nasty chemical smell that Seche Vite does, and I feel like it doesn&#x27;t require as much product. It also doesn&#x27;t shrink the polish like the Seche does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that Seche Vite has on it is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to be as glossy. For my next bottle, I might try the Essie Good To Go Fast Dry High Gloss Top Coat for the extra shine.</li>
            <li> Love this product and actually dries your nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many top coats!! Nothing worked for my nails. I tried Sally Hansen top coats, they were very terrible and after hour of drying my nails I just scratched a little one nail and nothing was dry!!! Terrible. I discovered a nice top coat by Dior. loved it until I found this one!!! Essie super fast top coat works very very perfectly on my nails and it&#x27;s super SUPER fast drying and super long lasting. Mine holds a week and no chips which is rare for my nails cause all my top coats wasn&#x27;t so fast drying. Just give this one a try and you&#x27;ll love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> This helps the polish dry very fast. Will get it again. Definitely would recommend it to anyone. I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this! A lot of my top coats in the past have gotten thick and nasty after a while. This one hasn&#x27;t done that at all and has maintained a nice consistency and it is definitely fast drying and shiny! Recommend!</li>
            <li> good product, as expected although seche-vite is a far superior product and i only use that now, will do business again!</li>
            <li> I was using Sally Hansen top coat previously and it took FOREVER to dry! I would get dents and dings in the perfect paint job before it was able to set. I thought I&#x27;d give Essie top coat a try since I have a couple of their nail colors. It dried so fast and leaves your nails shiny and smooth! No more need to wait for drying nails! I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Good to go is a perfect name it does what it says thee best already on my second bottle!!! Love it Essie is awesome</li>
            <li> It definitely helps your nails dry quicker and gives a shiny coat...I&#x27;ll always buy this brand!! It was cheaper online than buying it at Ulta so I&#x27;ll probably just continue to buy it here!</li>
            <li> This top coat dries fast and is super shiny and strong. I always use this top coat and people ask me if it is Shellac all the time.</li>
            <li> Two days after applying, I will have chunks on the nail polish chipping off, I&#x27;ve never had problems with top coat before.</li>
            <li> i used this as directed, it does not protect my polish even a day.&lt;br /&gt;not happy with it and would have returned it if postage were not an issue.</li>
            <li> This is the only top coat I use. I&#x27;ve never had any problem with it. It dries quickly. It does require touch ups every few days.</li>
            <li> This is the best fast frying top coat I have ever used! Dries hard very quickly setting the polish underneath</li>
            <li> I have dry hands, cuticles, and nails. I purchased this product along with the Essie cuticle oil. I put this top coat on and my nails haven&#x27;t split and actually feel stronger. Not to mention, the shine is still in tact, even after a week of wear!</li>
            <li> Amazing price and my nails are so shiny and pretty! I love it :) and they dry super fast. I&#x27;m very pleased</li>
            <li> Skip this, it peels off.</li>
            <li> Dries really fast &amp; super shiny.</li>
