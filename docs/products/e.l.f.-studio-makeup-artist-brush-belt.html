            <li>cant wait perfect</li>
            <li>Keep up the great work ELF!!!!</li>
            <li>I am a traveling freelance make up artist and this belt is perfect for my job!</li>
            <li>Great for the price!!!</li>
            <li>I use this at beauty trade shows for my job and it came in real handy for me, when i do my client&#x27;s make up.</li>
            <li>she loved it!</li>
            <li>Because, My granddaughter loved it &amp; you said it would get here for Christmas, &amp; it did!!You did a good job!!</li>
            <li>it arrived on time, good quality has a lot of pockets even pockets for your cellphone!i am very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li>absolutely love love love!!!!</li>
            <li>Love the belt!</li>
            <li>Love the products so far...AND the prices!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s now my favorite brush belt!</li>
            <li>However, quality and durability is great and it has lots of pockets and seems strong but the smell is its biggest setback.</li>
            <li>They get lost in the holes but for the most part, it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very happy I bought it!</li>
            <li>I like it better than my MAC brush belt.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not quite sure what &amp;#34;terrible smell&amp;#34; there is.</li>
            <li>Once I opened the box I immediately got a head ache from the overwhelming smell of tar.</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for so if you want quality and durability and not have to deal with the smell pay more for a better product like a MAC brush belt, that&#x27;s what I did....</li>
            <li>You get what you paid for, but overall, this is a great product while it lasts!</li>
            <li>I am a pro MUA and I love these belts.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s adjustable, comfortable, and easy to use!</li>
            <li>And i can actually fit more brushes than i thought.</li>
            <li>Very nice and professional belt.</li>
            <li>its honestly an AMAZING buy for any MUA in training or anyone who wants storage for their brushes for travel!</li>
            <li>I also like that it&#x27;s lightweight &amp; easy to clean.</li>
            <li>have had to wash 2times and hanging in hot sun son have not been able to use yet</li>
            <li>Also, she was surprised how cheap they were and how many there was for that price!</li>
            <li>Check out your local Target for ELF cosmetics, good prices if you can&#x27;t wait to have it delivered.</li>
            <li>It lasted me a good couple of months, and recently broke on me.</li>
            <li>For the first two weeks I had it, it had a strong smell to it that I couldnt get off.</li>
            <li>it does smells for a while, but it looks great and the pockets are so enough for any professional makeup artist</li>
            <li>right off the bat</li>
            <li>THANKS!</li>
            <li>I recommend washing the product first because it can make ur brushes smell like chemicals as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comparable to another good brand but half the price!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m curvy so most if the belts had a very uncomfortable fit, but this belt have me plenty of strap and was super comfortable!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to people looking for quality product but only if your willing to take the time to clean and air out the product to ease the smell.</li>
            <li>Lot&#x27;s of space for brushes and it was delivered fairly fast.</li>
            <li>I gave it away to a friend who really needed a brush belt and wanted one regardless of the stink.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It holds medium brushes well but not small brushes.</li>
            <li>When it came in, I was thoroughly surprised!</li>
            <li>This was one of the cheapest that I could find, and after reading the other reviews, didn&#x27;t have super high hopes.</li>
            <li>I tried washing the brush belt with laundry detergent and water twice and then spraying it with alcohol twice and then stuffing dryer sheets in all the pockets and aired the product out for another week</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money</li>
            <li>what i have been looking for one that comes without brushes only draw back has a very chemical smell</li>
            <li>I am a professional makeup artist and actually received this brush belt as a gift.</li>

            <li> I am a professional makeup artist and actually received this brush belt as a gift.</li>
            <li> Initially when I ordered this product I thought it was going to be made of a shiny black PVC material like in the picture</li>
            <li> I mean it smelled a little strange because its new faux leather, so its going to have a slight smell but nothing unbearable.</li>
            <li> i wanna say it is a matte black finish brush belt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if some people got ones that smelled worse but it barely smelled unless i put my nose into the brush pockets!</li>
            <li> but what I ended up getting was a dull black faux leather brush belt.</li>
            <li> I even tried to air it out in my garage and it made the entire garage smell really bad.</li>
            <li> but the worse part was the smell.</li>
            <li> was poorly made the bristles fell out of some of the brushes.</li>
            <li> So I was a little disappointed on that</li>
            <li> this bag smells so bad like chemicals , whats going on?</li>
            <li> This smelled so awful &amp; gave me a headache.</li>
            <li> It had a horrible chemical smell.</li>
            <li> I never used it, I threw it out because it smelled so terrible.</li>
            <li> Smells horrible.</li>

            <li> Love the belt! Lot&#x27;s of space for brushes and it was delivered fairly fast. For the first two weeks I had it, it had a strong smell to it that I couldnt get off. But eventually went away, I believe it was from the factory and the material it is made out of. Just air out the belts outside or in open area, it will get on your clothes. Overall I am very happy I bought it! Keep up the great work ELF!!!! Love the products so far...AND the prices! Check out your local Target for ELF cosmetics, good prices if you can&#x27;t wait to have it delivered. THANKS!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now my favorite brush belt! I&#x27;m curvy so most if the belts had a very uncomfortable fit, but this belt have me plenty of strap and was super comfortable! I like it better than my MAC brush belt.</li>
            <li> right off the bat i wanna say it is a matte black finish brush belt. which i actually like. so its not shiny like the picture. And i can actually fit more brushes than i thought. and I&#x27;m not quite sure what &amp;#34;terrible smell&amp;#34; there is. I mean it smelled a little strange because its new faux leather, so its going to have a slight smell but nothing unbearable. I&#x27;m not sure if some people got ones that smelled worse but it barely smelled unless i put my nose into the brush pockets! its honestly an AMAZING buy for any MUA in training or anyone who wants storage for their brushes for travel! absolutely love love love!!!!</li>
            <li> Initially when I ordered this product I thought it was going to be made of a shiny black PVC material like in the picture but what I ended up getting was a dull black faux leather brush belt. So I was a little disappointed on that but the worse part was the smell. Even before I opened the box it was shipped in I could already smell a tar-like smell. Once I opened the box I immediately got a head ache from the overwhelming smell of tar. I tried airing the brush belt out for a week in my room but the smell ended up making my entire room smell like chemicals or tar. I tried washing the brush belt with laundry detergent and water twice and then spraying it with alcohol twice and then stuffing dryer sheets in all the pockets and aired the product out for another week and that seemed to help ease the smell. I recommend washing the product first because it can make ur brushes smell like chemicals as well. However, quality and durability is great and it has lots of pockets and seems strong but the smell is its biggest setback. I would recommend this to people looking for quality product but only if your willing to take the time to clean and air out the product to ease the smell.

            <li> My girlfriend does not have any complaints, would order from them again and would recommend this to my family &amp; friends. Also, she was surprised how cheap they were and how many there was for that price! Thank you again for everything!</li>
            <li> this bag smells so bad like chemicals , whats going on? the price explains it all. step it up e.l.f</li>
            <li> I am a professional makeup artist and actually received this brush belt as a gift. It lasted me a good couple of months, and recently broke on me. You get what you paid for, but overall, this is a great product while it lasts! Pockets are sturdy and big.</li>
            <li> I am a traveling freelance make up artist and this belt is perfect for my job! It&#x27;s adjustable, comfortable, and easy to use! I also like that it&#x27;s lightweight &amp; easy to clean. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very nice and professional belt. It holds medium brushes well but not small brushes. They get lost in the holes but for the most part, it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> This smelled so awful &amp; gave me a headache. It had a horrible chemical smell. It made everything that I ordered in the box smell too. I even tried to air it out in my garage and it made the entire garage smell really bad. DO NOT BUY. I never used it, I threw it out because it smelled so terrible. Do not waste your money</li>
            <li> Smells horrible. After a war of waiting for it to air out, washing it, drying it, disinfecting it, the smell stayed. I gave it away to a friend who really needed a brush belt and wanted one regardless of the stink.</li>
            <li> My Girlfriend asked for a makeup apron for her birthday. This was one of the cheapest that I could find, and after reading the other reviews, didn&#x27;t have super high hopes. When it came in, I was thoroughly surprised! Sturdy build, and she loved it!</li>
            <li> I have purchased 2 of these belts and use them every day. I am a pro MUA and I love these belts. I use one for my brushes and one for my face and body painting brushes as well. It&#x27;s comparable to another good brand but half the price!</li>
            <li> I use this at beauty trade shows for my job and it came in real handy for me, when i do my client&#x27;s make up.</li>
            <li> was poorly made the bristles fell out of some of the brushes.</li>
            <li> Great for the price!!!</li>
