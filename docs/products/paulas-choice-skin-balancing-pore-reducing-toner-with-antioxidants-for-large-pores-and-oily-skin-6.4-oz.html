            <li>price is rather steep, so I think I&#x27;ll have to go without it for a bit while I save up the cash after my bottle runs out (and to be fair</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a good sized bottle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I love this pore-reducing toner.  </li>
            <li>i love paula&#x27;s choice</li>
            <li>Although this toner might work well for most people it has not worked well for me.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I&#x27;m on a quest to find a favorite toner this is not the one.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m so in love with Paula&#x27;s Choice.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE what it has done to my face smooth.</li>
            <li>Strongly don&#x27;t recommend it</li>
            <li>I would have liked to know they have a referral program to save me $10 my first order</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this lightweight toner, I highly recommend it for anyone with sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I am huge Sephora customer</li>
            <li>This one is gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have fair skin or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I broke out with acne all over my face pretty soon after I started using it, and I suspect it&#x27;s because one of the top ingredients is glycerin.  </li>
            <li>Will continue to purchase this because my skin feels refreshed and clean after I use.</li>
            <li>My face feels clean</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if this product would really do what I wanted it to do for my skin.</li>
            <li>I was suffering from mild rosacea and switched to using Paula&#x27;s choice products.  </li>
            <li>I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It is fragrance free and gentle.</li>
            <li>I love this &amp; all the Paula&#x27;s Choice products I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>n fresh</li>
            <li>I rarely break out</li>
            <li>An absolutely fantastic toner that I don&#x27;t think I can live without.</li>
            <li>Since using my skin is clear and acne free.</li>
            <li>They really do work!</li>
            <li>This is the first review I&#x27;m leaving after buying probably 300 items on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I paired this with PC&#x27;s skin balancing oil-reducing cleanser, and it does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>Made me break out even more, in tiny pimples all over my face.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what its suppose too.</li>
            <li>Although satisfied with Paula&#x27;s Choice, after about 6-8 months, I decided to go back to the dermatologist&#x27;s product.  </li>
            <li>You will save $10 on your first order  http://goo.gl/ZeUIbO</li>
            <li>did exactly what it says</li>
            <li>Great product, really cleans out my pores without drying out my skin and no harsh additives from other ingredients.</li>
            <li>And thanks Amazon for carrying all my essentials and delivering them right to my door.</li>
            <li>I began using this product after my mom did some research and discovered that it (along with its face foam and moisture gel) is just as good as more expensive products, to include products</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had large pores.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Paula&#x27;s Choice for being affordable.</li>
            <li>Besides that...its gentle and doesn&#x27;t burn my skin.</li>
            <li>But it goes on very well,</li>
            <li>Otherwise I really like this toner</li>
            <li>It accomplished what I hoped it would do.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t pour out too readily</li>
            <li>The texture is just right, and it&#x27;s super calming even in dry</li>
            <li>Like most people, I think toner is pretty much a waste of money.</li>
            <li>My pores seem to be shrinking while the dry areas of my face have become silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>I thought this was totally normal until I found out about the ingredients that are causing my skin to do that.</li>
            <li>and I have moved my entire skin care over to Paula&#x27;s and Amazon which is saying alot considering the product is not expensive</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even gone without makeup a few times :) A definite new for me!</li>
            <li>... has clear up my face</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear and useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>all I can say is WOW.</li>
            <li>leaves your skin feeling soft, and not shiny.  </li>
            <li>It really makes my pores look smaller when I use it after I cleanse.  </li>
            <li>you want to save some money - copy and paste this referral code and it will take you directly to Paula&#x27;s Choice website.  </li>
            <li>I like this product - it&#x27;s non-drying, picks up what cleansing left behind and creates a nice surface for moisturizer/serum.</li>
            <li>The toner is alcohol free - which is hard to come by.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>Because i am using the whole she-bang - cleanser, toner, BHA 1% gel and the Resist BHA 9, it&#x27;s hard to pinpoint exactly which product is working</li>
            <li>My slight acne is much clearer, my pores smaller, and all in all...</li>

            <li> My slight acne is much clearer, my pores smaller, and all in all...</li>
            <li> So far this has not irritated my skin and has reduced the appearance of my pores slightly.</li>
            <li> I usually use Proactive + but decided to check out new products on a friend&#x27;s recommendation.</li>
            <li> Plus my dry spots no longer appear flaky and noticeable.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s normal/oily with dry spots here and there!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why it is so much more expensive on this site.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but my skin will usually turn red a little after applying toner and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I am in my sixties but still have an oily T-zone while the rest of my skin is very dry.  </li>
            <li> I have only used Paula&#x27;s Choice for a few days now, and</li>
            <li> but since i&#x27;ve been using this the last few weeks I have been breaking out a lot.</li>
            <li> Choice is a tad expensive but, for me, worth the cost.</li>
            <li> But due to the reviews of this product online at Paula&#x27;s website, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> -  never really used a toner before since I always found them to be too harsh.  </li>
            <li> so I can mean waiting extra to put on makeup.</li>
            <li> and I have noticeably less blackheads in that area.</li>
            <li> I have noticed my face is a little less oily</li>
            <li> I must admit that I&#x27;m usually a sucker for department store name brand skincare with sexy packaging, but always leaves me disappointed.</li>
            <li> also.does not feel harsh or drying...</li>
            <li> have tried a few toners in the past (Kiehls, Vichy, Clinique, etc.)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product made me break out in tiny little bumps all over my face.</li>
            <li> I admit I was not sure how this product was gonna work</li>
            <li> so you&#x27;re not in danger of wasting it as the opening is decently small.</li>
            <li> All other product lines &amp; systems I have used have failed.</li>
            <li> I used to never do anything to my face apart from washing it at night when I wasn&#x27;t too tired.</li>
            <li> I have to buy fairly expensive moisturizers because I think some humectants cause breakouts for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now and had to stop because I was breaking out so badly.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this product! Since using my skin is clear and acne free. My pores are smaller too!</li>
            <li> I love this &amp; all the Paula&#x27;s Choice products I&#x27;ve tried so far. I have the best skin of my life &amp; have struggled with multiple skin problems for years. All other product lines &amp; systems I have used have failed. At this rate I believe I&#x27;ll look younger in my 40&#x27;s than I do in my 30&#x27;s.  I do use multiple Paula&#x27;s Choice products to customize my skin care issues. They really do work!</li>
            <li> Love love love this. Works like a dream</li>
            <li> I am in my sixties but still have an oily T-zone while the rest of my skin is very dry.  I&#x27;ve only been using this toner for a couple of weeks but have already noticed a difference in my skin.  My pores seem to be shrinking while the dry areas of my face have become silky smooth.  I am so happy with this toner that I just ordered the cleanser and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> So far this has not irritated my skin and has reduced the appearance of my pores slightly. Will continue to purchase this because my skin feels refreshed and clean after I use. I use it twice daily with no drying.</li>
            <li> This is the first review I&#x27;m leaving after buying probably 300 items on Amazon. I tried the Paula&#x27;s Choice Skincare line after reading the great reviews in the book &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t Go To the Cosmetics Counter Without Me.&amp;#34; I had never heard of the brand! I must admit that I&#x27;m usually a sucker for department store name brand skincare with sexy packaging, but always leaves me disappointed. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but my skin will usually turn red a little after applying toner and moisturizer. I thought this was totally normal until I found out about the ingredients that are causing my skin to do that. I have only used Paula&#x27;s Choice for a few days now, and all I can say is WOW. This is what good quality skincare does to my face. My slight acne is much clearer, my pores smaller, and all in all... I have a healthier complexion. I&#x27;ve even gone without makeup a few times :) A definite new for me! Thanks Paula&#x27;s Choice for being affordable. I thought I had to pay $40 for a good cleanser. And thanks Amazon for carrying all my essentials and delivering them right to my door. Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Not one break out since using this product.  I love it.... I am huge Sephora customer and I have moved my entire skin care over to Paula&#x27;s and Amazon which is saying alot considering the product is not expensive and it does the job.</li>
            <li> This toner has transformed my face. I was suffering from mild rosacea and switched to using Paula&#x27;s choice products.  This toner is great and it closes the pores on my nose and I have noticeably less blackheads in that area. It is fragrance free and gentle. I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I paired this with PC&#x27;s skin balancing oil-reducing cleanser, and it does exactly what it says it does. It minimized my pores and made my skin softer after just one week. Plus my dry spots no longer appear flaky and noticeable. I&#x27;m very happy with this lightweight toner, I highly recommend it for anyone with sensitive skin that&#x27;s normal/oily with dry spots here and there!</li>
            <li> Love it ! I can see the results ! Lines fading brighter fresher skin .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like how there are no security seals on most of her products, someone could tamper and put something in the bottle. Besides that...its gentle and doesn&#x27;t burn my skin. Seems like a good product.</li>
            <li> Best toner I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;ve always had large pores.  But not anymore!  This toner does a beautiful job.</li>
            <li> It is a great toner! Doesn&#x27;t make your skin burn and leaves your skin feeling fresher/cleaner after use.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a few toners in the past (Kiehls, Vichy, Clinique, etc.) and this one shows the best results, by far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much more effective than a drugstore brand toner.  I trust the Paula&#x27;s Choice brand.  This toner does reduce oil and prevent breakouts.  Too soon to tell if it shrinks pores; will have to come back to you on that!  But it goes on very well, leaves your skin feeling soft, and not shiny.  And there&#x27;s no medicinal smell.</li>
            <li> I love this pore-reducing toner.  It really makes my pores look smaller when I use it after I cleanse.  I then exfoliate afterward with her 2% BHA for oil/combo skin.  This helps keep the blackheads at bay as well as any acne that may try to pop up.  However, on Paula&#x27;s website, I only pay $15 for this bottle.  I&#x27;m not sure why it is so much more expensive on this site.  Some of her products on this site are over $50 !!  When they are not, if you go to her site.</li>
            <li> Made me break out even more, in tiny pimples all over my face. However, it worked well for my friend, so I supposed it may just be me. I don&#x27;t have fair skin or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product made me break out in tiny little bumps all over my face.</li>
            <li> i love paula&#x27;s choice and i would love it even more if i could get them directly in my home country mexico , still best toner ever</li>
            <li> Would give is a 4.5 if I could. The only thing I am not over fond of is that while it is drying this can leave a tacky feeling. At night not a big deal since it fades away eventually, but I like to use toner in the AM to so I can mean waiting extra to put on makeup. Otherwise I really like this toner and I notice a definite improvement in my skin in color and texture.</li>
            <li> Although this toner might work well for most people it has not worked well for me.  I broke out with acne all over my face pretty soon after I started using it, and I suspect it&#x27;s because one of the top ingredients is glycerin.  I have to buy fairly expensive moisturizers because I think some humectants cause breakouts for me.  (I even break out when there is fabric softener on my clothes.)  Anyway, I&#x27;m on a quest to find a favorite toner this is not the one.</li>
            <li> An absolutely fantastic toner that I don&#x27;t think I can live without. The texture is just right, and it&#x27;s super calming even in dry weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is rather steep, so I think I&#x27;ll have to go without it for a bit while I save up the cash after my bottle runs out (and to be fair, it&#x27;s a good sized bottle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope my skin can handle the temporary deprivation!</li>
            <li> My face feels clean n fresh... has clear up my face also.does not feel harsh or drying...</li>
            <li> I like this product - it&#x27;s non-drying, picks up what cleansing left behind and creates a nice surface for moisturizer/serum. I&#x27;m not giving 5 stars as I&#x27;ve not seen a perceptible improvement.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t ever be without this product!</li>
            <li> I usually use Proactive + but decided to check out new products on a friend&#x27;s recommendation. I ordered this toner after reading the reviews and suggestions on skin care on their website. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now and had to stop because I was breaking out so badly. I know the website urges against using toners with astringents but I&#x27;ve found they tend to work best for me. Overall, there&#x27;s nothing &amp;#34;wrong&amp;#34; with the product - it just isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this product would really do what I wanted it to do for my skin. I began to notice a change in the appearance of my pores within a couple of days. Great product! It accomplished what I hoped it would do.</li>
            <li> This toner is awesome for my skin. I love it.</li>
            <li> decided to try this because it had mostly great reviews but it hasn&#x27;t been good. I rarely break out but since i&#x27;ve been using this the last few weeks I have been breaking out a lot. I have noticed my face is a little less oily but that&#x27;s about it</li>
            <li> Great addition to skincare regime -  never really used a toner before since I always found them to be too harsh.  This one is gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It does exactly what its suppose too.</li>
            <li> I began using this product after my mom did some research and discovered that it (along with its face foam and moisture gel) is just as good as more expensive products, to include products she and I had purchased from a dermatologist she&#x27;d been going to years ago.  Although satisfied with Paula&#x27;s Choice, after about 6-8 months, I decided to go back to the dermatologist&#x27;s product.  Once I received the product and began using it, I could tell the difference between Paula&#x27;s Choice and the dermatologic product and immediately went back to Paula&#x27;s Choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paula&#x27;s Choice is a tad expensive but, for me, worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Strongly don&#x27;t recommend it</li>
            <li> I used to never do anything to my face apart from washing it at night when I wasn&#x27;t too tired. I do not use makeup and therefore I thought I would be okay.One day I decided I needed a routine and found this company, ordered several products and have been using it since mid December 2014. I LOVE what it has done to my face smooth. I admit I was not sure how this product was gonna work but it does. It gets rid of the dirt inside the pores therefore allowing them to get smaller. I would have liked to know they have a referral program to save me $10 my first order so I decided to share this on my reviews. Get $10 off if you order here: http://goo.gl/J5uNbc.</li>
            <li> Like most people, I think toner is pretty much a waste of money. But due to the reviews of this product online at Paula&#x27;s website, I decided to give it a try. Because i am using the whole she-bang - cleanser, toner, BHA 1% gel and the Resist BHA 9, it&#x27;s hard to pinpoint exactly which product is working but when I use this, my skin feels lighter and not tacky feeling. It doesn&#x27;t pour out too readily so you&#x27;re not in danger of wasting it as the opening is decently small. I&#x27;m glad I am using it but I am still undecided if I will re-order it after it&#x27;s gone. *** Yup, I reordered it. It&#x27;s that good. Watch the prices on Paula products here. They might be cheaper at her website.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so in love with Paula&#x27;s Choice.  I&#x27;ve been using her products for the last three months and I am VERY impressed.  The toner is alcohol free - which is hard to come by.&lt;br /&gt;If you want to save some money - copy and paste this referral code and it will take you directly to Paula&#x27;s Choice website.  You will save $10 on your first order  http://goo.gl/ZeUIbO</li>
            <li> did exactly what it says</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear and useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good for face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pretty nice choice.</li>
            <li> Great product, really cleans out my pores without drying out my skin and no harsh additives from other ingredients.</li>
            <li> Excellent product !! Non-greasy and very good for the skin.</li>
