            <li>after it dries, i just don&#x27;t think it really held my makeup on.</li>
            <li>and so I really can&#x27;t complain.  </li>
            <li>:) Now I can look not so sloppy anymore after like... 1 or more hours pass by after I put on my make up</li>

            <li>the spray mist really allows it last a long time.</li>
            <li>wish it wasn&#x27;t in such an ugly container, but works great.  </li>
            <li>My face usually becomes very oily and by the end of the day my makeup is completely off.</li>

            <li> This is the worst product I have spent my money on and worse of all, I purchased the big bottle.</li>
            <li> My makeup did not budge in 100 degree weather, sweating at my son&#x27;s football game for two hours.</li>
            <li> Well I guess not SO randomly because I was getting really sick and tired of my makeup literally migrating around my eyes.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Urban Decay Makeup Setting Spray Really Works! Love it!  Your makeup will stay on all day and your skin will not feel sticky or dry!  One of my best finds ever!</li>
            <li> I love UD products but I was a skeptic. I have tried every primer I can find in hopes of finding something that would help my makeup last longer. My makeup has a tendency to almost melt off certain areas of my face, like around my nose. It will actually end up in the creases. I used this before work on 2 hot days and am completely hooked! The makeup didn&#x27;t run off even despite the hot &amp; humid weather, everything looked just as it had when I applied it in the morning &amp; after 12 hours it still looked good! This is a miracle in a bottle! The spray is a very light mist. I was worried it may leave my face sticky or dry but it doesn&#x27;t. Whether you are looking for something to help your makeup last through work, a night out or a special occasion, this will do the job! It&#x27;s a little pricey but based on the amount you have to use, it seems like it will last awhile, depending on how often you use it.</li>
            <li> Love it .....Love it.....Love it....This product is costly but it does what it says.  It is a performer and now I am hooked and feel that it is a must have staple in my makeup kit.  I definitely recommend it to all my friends who are looking for a product that will help makeup stay on longer and look fresh for the work day.  Love it ...Love it ... Love it.</li>
            <li> I used it to go to a party,  when I started to dance and sweet, my make up did not look good anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I have read many reviewers that this product is supposed to keep make up on for 24 hrs looking fresh.&lt;br /&gt;This  didn&#x27;t hasten on my case, I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product. I thought it would work better.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my eyeliner would run a little bit while I was at work. I use this everyday (I work in a gas station that serves food) I do notice that my makeup lasts a LOT longer but my eyeliner SOMETIMES runs, not always but sometimes. But I&#x27;d still purchase it again.</li>
            <li> My face usually becomes very oily and by the end of the day my makeup is completely off. After using this stuff, i realized it really does last ALL NIGHT! I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the product, it goes on easy, I do not feel sticky or tacky ~ it is a very natural feel after it dries, i just don&#x27;t think it really held my makeup on. I don&#x27;t wear alot of it so I perhaps did not use it as it was designed for heavy heavy makeup. It worked ok for my needs and I will use it for night time and special occasions when I use heavier make-up.</li>
            <li> About 6 months ago this girl I kinda knew used this and she said it worked great... And I just remembered it recently and very randomly might I add. Well I guess not SO randomly because I was getting really sick and tired of my makeup literally migrating around my eyes. It&#x27;d smudge and just look like a disaster. So I decided to get this and try it out myself. I got the bigger size just cause lol. So when I used it (last night before hanging out with a friend and this morning before going to work); it said to spray it 3-4 times like 8-10 Inches away from your face (I think??) but I sprayed it like... 5-6 (JUST to be sure haha XD) and seriously my makeup looks great. It stayed on and BARLEY smudged. The only \\&quot;smudge\\&quot; I noticed was sooo small and insignificant it was nothing to me because of how good my makeup still looked hours and hours after its application. So I would highly recommend this product, It really works and like most other people I had my doubts (saw bad reviews :O) But I gave it a shot and I&#x27;m glad I did :) Now I can look not so sloppy anymore after like... 1 or more hours pass by after I put on my make up lol... w00t!</li>
            <li> This was a christmas gift for my wife.  She has used it before and loves the product, so she asked for more.</li>
            <li> Love the all nighter makeup setting spray!  This stuff really works and I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting their makeup to stay on longer!!</li>
            <li> it really does exactly what it says--keeps your makeup on! I spray 2-3 times on my face and I think that&#x27;s about all you need.</li>
            <li> Literally one of my favorite products ever! My makeup did not budge in 100 degree weather, sweating at my son&#x27;s football game for two hours. Then went to work and it lasted throughout the night. I have normal skin for the most part and tend to get shiny in the t-zone. This product delivers! The only negative reviews I see are those with oily skin. Fortunately, Urban Decay has the same spray but formulated for oily skin!! It&#x27;s call De Slick...keep that in mind ladies. Worth every penny. You&#x27;ll love the product if you buy the correct one for your skin type. :)</li>
            <li> Perfect for hot humid summer days. Makeup stays put.  Do not have to worry half way through my day that my makeup has slid down my face.</li>
            <li> I bought this a while back after reading rave reviews of the product. But this doesn&#x27;t just work for me. I&#x27;ve tried to like the product but just can&#x27;t.I have a dry skin and I only get shiny towards evening when I apply only pressed powder on my face But with this spray, with /without foundation, I&#x27;m shiny in 1 hr. Terrible. I live in a very hot environment but even at that, i have a dry skin so why should I be shiny in 1 hr?Also, it just changes my look and I look depressed early in the morning. This is the worst product I have spent my money on and worse of all, I purchased the big bottle. Model in a bottle however works fine for me. Bought both at the same time and I&#x27;m about re-purchasing Model in a bottle as I have just a few sprays left. My face looks picture perfect all day long when I apply foundation and powder and set with MIAB.7 hours without blotting and 10-12 hrs when I blot.</li>
            <li> My mum who is 78 and I wear this daily (I&#x27;m 43) and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gives you a wet look at first, but keeps your makeup on all day.  I sometimes keep this in my purse to spritz my face during the day if I&#x27;m looking tired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it wasn&#x27;t in such an ugly container, but works great.  Also, I use mine daily and I&#x27;ve had this for at least 6 months, so the spray mist really allows it last a long time.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I was on my way to Sephora for another bottle when for some reason I decided to check Amazon to see if they sell this item.  I am so happy that not only do they sell it, but it&#x27;s actually cheaper than Sephora.  I have used many &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; setting spray and for some reason Urban Decay was always the best.  It kinda smells and feels like you&#x27;re spraying hair spray on your face,but it sets my makeup for at least 12 hours and so I really can&#x27;t complain.  I just wish it was cheaper.</li>
            <li> This kept my makeup on for about 8 hours, it didn&#x27;t run, I didn&#x27;t have to do touch ups, and after you spray it, it doesn&#x27;t even feel like it&#x27;s there. I highly recommend it for a night out or for summer days.</li>
            <li> I buy this ll the time. Never go without it during the summer months. Keeps makeup looking fresh longer, excluding lipstick.</li>
            <li> Worked well, about 8 hours. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This product truly works. I wore it on my wedding day and my makeup was flawless all evening and night.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t ever be without it!! It makes such a difference. Make up once a day and not every few hours</li>
            <li> I LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE THIS. My old friend had it and I was always borrowed it and FINALLY. i got mine. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY. HAPPY</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product I am always having problems with my make up! This product saves me from the panda eye look!</li>
