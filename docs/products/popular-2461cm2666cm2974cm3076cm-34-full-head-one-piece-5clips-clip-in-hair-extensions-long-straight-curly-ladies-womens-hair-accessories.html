            <li>I would need 5 more</li>
            <li>The hair is so pretty, the curls are amazing!</li>
            <li>now these extensions are really cute</li>
            <li>Glad I did.  </li>
            <li>so they&#x27;re heat safe.</li>
            <li>There is a bit of dolly-hair shine at the top which can be powdered, but is supposed to be covered when worn anyway.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>love this.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be more than one stand</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Its more of a Halloween wig quality then I had hoped.</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>I will pay more and go to Sally&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>, I love these extensions ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s okay with me.  </li>
            <li>Love them , &amp; they came from china to Cali in 3 Weeks .</li>
            <li>I could not wear it all day :)</li>
            <li>I love it .</li>
            <li>LOVE my extensionsðŸ˜¬</li>
            <li>weren&#x27;t truthful and most of them were.</li>
            <li>and I just wasn&#x27;t sure..</li>
            <li>I am in love with this hair extensions.</li>
            <li>Love love love.</li>
            <li>Pretty good.</li>
            <li>Natural looking and beautiful....</li>
            <li>If you want a nice full look,  buy 2 of these. ...</li>
            <li>Great shine and very soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with my purchase - the hair is very soft.  </li>
            <li>The texture is nice and they are very pretty.</li>
            <li>Bought for my sexy victorian vampire halloween costume and works fine for that.  </li>
            <li>also I was able to braid them and they just look wonderful, like I said be careful in brushing them!</li>
            <li>Great quality, color true, fast shipping</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t hold a curl very well either, so choose wisely if you want to get rid of the curls they come with.</li>
            <li>Also it has more volume on the bottom and straight on top!</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s an easy fix.</li>
            <li>but she says it gets tangled too easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to snap on.</li>
            <li>but it got tangled easy, i suggest softener and a brush for the untangling.</li>
            <li>Not tangled easy like a lot of people said .</li>
            <li>Easy to attach and style</li>
            <li>Arrived very quickly before arrival date.</li>
            <li>Tangled too easily and some of the stiches were lose.</li>
            <li>and they tangled wayyy to easily.</li>
            <li>It turned out to be fine.</li>
            <li>Comfortable to wear and easy to care for...</li>
            <li>tomorrow too cut off a couple inches after that it should look fine</li>
            <li>and it worked fine..</li>
            <li>Love it, quick delivery,  just as described</li>
            <li>Super excited to wear them!</li>
            <li>For as inexpensive as these are, I think they&#x27;re fantastic.</li>
            <li>Yes if you&#x27;re looking for cheap extensions.</li>
            <li>Cheap looking....</li>
            <li>I was happy with the hair, of course i&#x27;m Mixed</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re so cheap you can keep repurchasing.</li>
            <li>and they looked absolutely fabulous.</li>
            <li>Soooooo shiny and color is way too light.</li>
            <li>Think beautiful, long Arwen hair.  </li>
            <li>well i love the way the hair feels and looks i have continued to purchase mors as i love them so much.</li>
            <li>the quality is good although the clips on one of them are not perfect, one looks like it may fall off and the netting is a tad ripped but for the price I payed they are wonderful.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t wear it every day, but for special occasions, it would be fine.</li>
            <li>nice colour soft hair and easy wearing</li>
            <li>They are beautiful and long!!!</li>
            <li>Which BTW the color of these extensions is a rich chocolate brown.</li>
            <li>What a fun item!</li>
            <li>and I am pretty pleased</li>
            <li>It is heat friendly which I figured out..</li>
            <li>But the quality is cheap and super synthetic looking.</li>
            <li>Super comfortable, snap and go.</li>
            <li>I ordered this looking at the great pictures of reviews, I said ok, I want it for a few times, lets try.</li>
            <li>Shipping took about 3 weeks to Vegas, but overall I&#x27;m happy and plan on using these for the rare special occasion.</li>
            <li>Okay so I bought the deep brown color and it blends pretty good with my hair.</li>
            <li>I purchased it to add length for special nights out.  </li>
            <li>I really liked how the hair was soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>REALLY shiny and healthy looking and</li>
            <li>I love these so much.</li>
            <li>Says it was a full set of hair</li>
            <li>you need 2 or 3 orders to make it look full like the picture</li>
            <li>Good for the money mixed well with</li>
            <li>Its good for the money, but they should conceal the band at the top better because it is really thick and you have to cover it with a head band so that know one knows its a wig.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for daily wear or multiple uses but for my one time event they werw perfect.</li>
            <li>Perfect slow delivery from China but worth the wait</li>
            <li>The color is a little more light than my own color</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so very pretty</li>
            <li>Way too long, gets tangled really fast, easy too clip good for 1 time.</li>
            <li>I have fine stick straight hair</li>
            <li>but other wise it&#x27;s not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>When I had the whole weft in it was comfortable and didn&#x27;t pull on my hair like some others have.</li>
            <li>the clips were secure and gentle.</li>
            <li>nice and shiny, but my hair is too short to wear this.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>Honestly its a big difference from the pic here</li>
            <li>Looks and feels natural. :)</li>
            <li>This was fun</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price that I paid for.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know many people who have naturally purple hair...</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try for the price.</li>
            <li>so hope i put them right</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t even look right when I put them in.</li>
            <li>But, you get what you paid for right?</li>
            <li>otherwise it doesn&#x27;t look right.</li>
            <li>WASN&#x27;T THE RIGHT COLOR.</li>
            <li>Worn under your top layer of hair, I could barely notice it myself when checking in a mirror.</li>
            <li>However, my friend with medium thick (normal/typical) hair was able to blend it nicely.</li>
            <li>The extensions themselves looked very real.</li>
            <li>They really were eager help me and fix any problems asap!</li>
            <li>Thanks guys!</li>
            <li>well I&#x27;m pretty sure they will last you....</li>
            <li>Hot diggity dog</li>
            <li>its pretty bit sheds a lot if touch a lot....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap but it looks so natural.</li>
            <li>I most likely order more in the future.</li>
            <li>The color was an exact match.</li>
            <li>The length is exactly what it says, however it lacks substantially for thickness.</li>
            <li>First extensions I&#x27;ve ever gotten  </li>
            <li>The hair is exactly as described and how it looks.</li>
            <li>The extensions are too shiny and didnt even come close to matching my real hair!</li>
            <li>but this is better than some of the outer hairextensions that are low cost</li>
            <li>I was so bummed out, because they are pretty, but for my needs, they are just really impracticable.</li>
            <li>I just have to dye my own hair dark brown...</li>
            <li>It is kind of reddish for dark brown.</li>
            <li>I really love the extensions is real hair and very long with curls exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>It is nice and long, but is seen to be of synthetic material, it seems natural hair</li>
            <li>Great quality in both the hair itself and the clips.&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting it to be difficult to attached but was pleasantly surprised with how easy it clipped in as well as how well it held!&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>i love this hair washes and flat irons just like normal hair.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re nice and shed a little</li>
            <li>haha here&#x27;s a pic..</li>
            <li>I ordered these xmas day and received them 1/8 so it was much quicker than the estimated date.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see if it&#x27;s real hair</li>
            <li>For some reason, I like making my whole look over and post photos on Instagram.</li>
            <li>Jut like real iron-curled hair.</li>
            <li>Does NOT look real at all</li>
            <li>its very shiny and really lone because I am 4&amp;#34; its passed my butt</li>
            <li>It looks real and stuff.</li>
            <li>The one whole piece works out very well.</li>
            <li>they look so real and not at all as synthetic as I thought they were going to look.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so much easier than hours of curling and a money saver too....</li>
            <li>Got here fast.</li>
            <li>They feel and look like real hair.</li>
            <li>but after one wear, it got REALLY knotted, like a halloween wig</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t blend very well with your real hair.</li>
            <li>It does look like real hair though.</li>
            <li>Gets tangled fast.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better than what I expected for the price but would I get it again</li>
            <li>/&gt;Be aware that the &amp;#34;deep brown&amp;#34; is more like a dark auburn.  </li>
            <li>I finger-combed it gently, then set the piece very close to my hairline and pulled my own hair over it, clipping it in the back and pulling long tendrils in front over my shoulders.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, they are fabulous!  </li>
            <li>For the price they are WAY more beyond than what I expected!</li>
            <li>to trick on the days you need to look special or just want to try something different.</li>
            <li>The length and color were almost an exact match for my natural color.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried with many people&#x27;s dark hair but the purple cast makes them stand out.</li>
            <li>My hair is more of a medium brown, I ordered dark brown.</li>
            <li>Is very long but looks fabulous.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quality is quite decent for the price.</li>
            <li>So you will most likely get them earlier than listed.</li>
            <li>Very far from looking real.</li>
            <li>Nobody noticed I was wearing it (except my mother, who grabbed a ringlet as she was giving me a hug and commented how good my hair looked and realized it looked slightly too long and discreetly asked me if it was a clip-in.</li>
            <li>A little ratchet looking but ok.</li>
            <li>Hard to keep nice.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re really soft looks like real hair to me</li>
            <li>Soft &amp; they look real .</li>
            <li>Color is way darker than expected, it has clips that I have no Idea what to do with you cannot secure these to your hair ....</li>
            <li>Color was not as shown, is quite a few shades lighter but lovely product otherwise</li>
            <li>I received my extensions just two days into the approximate delivery dates..which was good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to cut it so it won&#x27;t be one big weft because I could not get it to clip quite right on my head</li>
            <li>if I have super long hair.</li>
            <li>It could be fuller, but is full enough, not too heavy for comfort and the color effect is a good medium dark brown #4.  </li>
            <li>new to extenstions so maybe just not for me</li>
            <li>I like my new extensions</li>
            <li>And very soft.</li>
            <li>this is my first time actually</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>The color was way off, like if I tried to dye my dark brown hair a cheap shade of purple tint.</li>
            <li>I have thick hair and these are a little thin, but with one more they&#x27;ll  be perfect.  </li>
            <li>Personal attention to problems, polite, professional and very helpful!</li>
            <li>For dark brown, there was also red in it :3</li>
            <li>They are long, soft, supple and worth the price.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super thick and it&#x27;s SO much freakin hair!!</li>
            <li>In short, if you have naturally shiny, long hair, it&#x27;ll probably be a good little go-</li>
            <li>The hair is a bit shiny, like doll hair, however with dry shampoo sprayed on it, it tones the shine down to be more realistic.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little shiny but other then that I love it!</li>
            <li>, yes, they straightened VERY well on a very low heat setting.  </li>
            <li>but these have a very noticeable red tint and undertone to it.</li>
            <li>This is the first time, however, that I tried a long wig (or extensions, thereof) just to see how I would look like</li>
            <li>The hair appeared natural and people couldn&#x27;t tell the difference.</li>
            <li>I rated this five stArs because the color matched exactly to my natural color</li>
            <li>my fiance can&#x27;t tell the difference from my natural hair and this hair extension.</li>
            <li>so they don&#x27;t blend in with my natural hair unless I wear a hat</li>
            <li>The hair feels so soft and they came packaged well in a plastic pouche.</li>
            <li>But doesn&#x27;t pull on your natural hair</li>
            <li>Pretty but really long.</li>
            <li>I do recommend them tho, no problems so far.</li>
            <li>I have longer hair naturally</li>
            <li>I love them, the bottom is SO THICK..</li>
            <li>hair looks fake, like a doll hair.&lt;br /&gt;4) good for a mermaid halloween party/ costume</li>
            <li>I ordered the dark brown and it oddly matches my hair color perfectly despite the little red tint in my hair.</li>
            <li>The quality is not bad, but it is not full head is just a piece, you will have to buy at lease 3 or 4 of them for your hair to look like the picture.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re nice but not as long and as thick.</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s true the piece is a bit shiny and the quality looks slightly less natural than my expensive pieces, it&#x27;s actually quite good.</li>
            <li>The hair extension is long and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>Too long to appear real.</li>
            <li>Kinda thin and a little shiny but over all very nice.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t quite the color I had heard in some of the other reviews, but it was the exact color as in the picture.  </li>
            <li>Black was more a dark brown</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall they were pretty, but because they don&#x27;t have the cover all the way down like</li>
            <li>Blends right in with my hair, but it was quite heavy.</li>
            <li>Way too heavy and extremely fake lol</li>
            <li>now you really have to be careful because this extensions are not human hair</li>
            <li>The quality is decent, but I can tell they likely won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>Fake, stringy, super super ridiculously long.</li>
            <li>The extensions are VERY full as I have thin hair.  </li>
            <li>These are so long and soft</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not long at all...</li>
            <li>Waaay too long to look natural.</li>
            <li>My friend with super thick hair couldn&#x27;t use them either...same blending issue.</li>
            <li>so I can put one of the halves on the nape of my neck, a full weft in the middle and the other half below the crown of my head.</li>
            <li>After taking it out, it was all tangled and impossible to brush, I would say really don&#x27;t buy and save for something better.</li>
            <li>When I ordered I didn&#x27;t realize exactly how long 29 inches was, but these extensions go down to my lower back!</li>

            <li> Easy to put in and blend with curly/wavy hair!</li>
            <li> Very easy to care for, I got so many compliments wearing this piece.</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 sets to add length and volume to my wedding day hair style and they blended in with my real hair beautifully.</li>
            <li> but the hair is very pretty and a good shiny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to brush, and the five clips are good quality and comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> But love them.</li>
            <li> I would need 5 more</li>
            <li> The hair is so pretty, the curls are amazing!</li>
            <li> now these extensions are really cute</li>
            <li> Glad I did.  </li>
            <li> so they&#x27;re heat safe.</li>
            <li> There is a bit of dolly-hair shine at the top which can be powdered, but is supposed to be covered when worn anyway.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> love this.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be more than one stand</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Its more of a Halloween wig quality then I had hoped.</li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> I will pay more and go to Sally&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> , I love these extensions ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li> and I love them.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s okay with me.  </li>
            <li> Love them , &amp; they came from china to Cali in 3 Weeks .</li>
            <li> I could not wear it all day :)</li>
            <li> I love it .</li>
            <li> LOVE my extensionsðŸ˜¬</li>
            <li> weren&#x27;t truthful and most of them were.</li>
            <li> and I just wasn&#x27;t sure..</li>
            <li> I am in love with this hair extensions.</li>
            <li> Love love love.</li>
            <li> Pretty good.</li>
            <li> Natural looking and beautiful....</li>
            <li> If you want a nice full look,  buy 2 of these. ...</li>
            <li> Great shine and very soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with my purchase - the hair is very soft.  </li>
            <li> The texture is nice and they are very pretty.</li>
            <li> Bought for my sexy victorian vampire halloween costume and works fine for that.  </li>
            <li> also I was able to braid them and they just look wonderful, like I said be careful in brushing them!</li>
            <li> Great quality, color true, fast shipping</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t hold a curl very well either, so choose wisely if you want to get rid of the curls they come with.</li>
            <li> Also it has more volume on the bottom and straight on top!</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s an easy fix.</li>
            <li> but she says it gets tangled too easy.</li>
            <li> Easy to snap on.</li>
            <li> but it got tangled easy, i suggest softener and a brush for the untangling.</li>
            <li> Not tangled easy like a lot of people said .</li>
            <li> Easy to attach and style</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly before arrival date.</li>
            <li> Tangled too easily and some of the stiches were lose.</li>
            <li> and they tangled wayyy to easily.</li>
            <li> It turned out to be fine.</li>
            <li> Comfortable to wear and easy to care for...</li>
            <li> tomorrow too cut off a couple inches after that it should look fine</li>
            <li> and it worked fine..</li>
            <li> Love it, quick delivery,  just as described</li>
            <li> Super excited to wear them!</li>
            <li> For as inexpensive as these are, I think they&#x27;re fantastic.</li>
            <li> Yes if you&#x27;re looking for cheap extensions.</li>
            <li> Cheap looking....</li>
            <li> I was happy with the hair, of course i&#x27;m Mixed</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re so cheap you can keep repurchasing.</li>
            <li> and they looked absolutely fabulous.</li>
            <li> Soooooo shiny and color is way too light.</li>
            <li> Think beautiful, long Arwen hair.  </li>
            <li> well i love the way the hair feels and looks i have continued to purchase mors as i love them so much.</li>
            <li> the quality is good although the clips on one of them are not perfect, one looks like it may fall off and the netting is a tad ripped but for the price I payed they are wonderful.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t wear it every day, but for special occasions, it would be fine.</li>
            <li> nice colour soft hair and easy wearing</li>
            <li> They are beautiful and long!!!</li>
            <li> Which BTW the color of these extensions is a rich chocolate brown.</li>
            <li> What a fun item!</li>
            <li> and I am pretty pleased</li>
            <li> It is heat friendly which I figured out..</li>
            <li> But the quality is cheap and super synthetic looking.</li>
            <li> Super comfortable, snap and go.</li>
            <li> I ordered this looking at the great pictures of reviews, I said ok, I want it for a few times, lets try.</li>
            <li> Shipping took about 3 weeks to Vegas, but overall I&#x27;m happy and plan on using these for the rare special occasion.</li>
            <li> Okay so I bought the deep brown color and it blends pretty good with my hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased it to add length for special nights out.  </li>
            <li> I really liked how the hair was soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> REALLY shiny and healthy looking and</li>
            <li> I love these so much.</li>
            <li> Says it was a full set of hair</li>
            <li> you need 2 or 3 orders to make it look full like the picture</li>
            <li> Good for the money mixed well with</li>
            <li> Its good for the money, but they should conceal the band at the top better because it is really thick and you have to cover it with a head band so that know one knows its a wig.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for daily wear or multiple uses but for my one time event they werw perfect.</li>
            <li> Perfect slow delivery from China but worth the wait</li>
            <li> The color is a little more light than my own color</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so very pretty</li>
            <li> Way too long, gets tangled really fast, easy too clip good for 1 time.</li>
            <li> I have fine stick straight hair</li>
            <li> but other wise it&#x27;s not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> When I had the whole weft in it was comfortable and didn&#x27;t pull on my hair like some others have.</li>
            <li> the clips were secure and gentle.</li>
            <li> nice and shiny, but my hair is too short to wear this.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> Honestly its a big difference from the pic here</li>
            <li> Looks and feels natural. :)</li>
            <li> This was fun</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price that I paid for.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know many people who have naturally purple hair...</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try for the price.</li>
            <li> so hope i put them right</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even look right when I put them in.</li>
            <li> But, you get what you paid for right?</li>
            <li> otherwise it doesn&#x27;t look right.</li>
            <li> WASN&#x27;T THE RIGHT COLOR.</li>
            <li> Worn under your top layer of hair, I could barely notice it myself when checking in a mirror.</li>
            <li> However, my friend with medium thick (normal/typical) hair was able to blend it nicely.</li>
            <li> The extensions themselves looked very real.</li>
            <li> They really were eager help me and fix any problems asap!</li>
            <li> Thanks guys!</li>
            <li> well I&#x27;m pretty sure they will last you....</li>
            <li> Hot diggity dog</li>
            <li> its pretty bit sheds a lot if touch a lot....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap but it looks so natural.</li>
            <li> I most likely order more in the future.</li>
            <li> The color was an exact match.</li>
            <li> The length is exactly what it says, however it lacks substantially for thickness.</li>
            <li> First extensions I&#x27;ve ever gotten  </li>
            <li> The hair is exactly as described and how it looks.</li>
            <li> The extensions are too shiny and didnt even come close to matching my real hair!</li>
            <li> but this is better than some of the outer hairextensions that are low cost</li>
            <li> I was so bummed out, because they are pretty, but for my needs, they are just really impracticable.</li>
            <li> I just have to dye my own hair dark brown...</li>
            <li> It is kind of reddish for dark brown.</li>
            <li> I really love the extensions is real hair and very long with curls exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> It is nice and long, but is seen to be of synthetic material, it seems natural hair</li>
            <li> Great quality in both the hair itself and the clips.&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting it to be difficult to attached but was pleasantly surprised with how easy it clipped in as well as how well it held!&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> i love this hair washes and flat irons just like normal hair.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re nice and shed a little</li>
            <li> haha here&#x27;s a pic..</li>
            <li> I ordered these xmas day and received them 1/8 so it was much quicker than the estimated date.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see if it&#x27;s real hair</li>
            <li> For some reason, I like making my whole look over and post photos on Instagram.</li>
            <li> Jut like real iron-curled hair.</li>
            <li> Does NOT look real at all</li>
            <li> its very shiny and really lone because I am 4&amp;#34; its passed my butt</li>
            <li> It looks real and stuff.</li>
            <li> The one whole piece works out very well.</li>
            <li> they look so real and not at all as synthetic as I thought they were going to look.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so much easier than hours of curling and a money saver too....</li>
            <li> Got here fast.</li>
            <li> They feel and look like real hair.</li>
            <li> but after one wear, it got REALLY knotted, like a halloween wig</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t blend very well with your real hair.</li>
            <li> It does look like real hair though.</li>
            <li> Gets tangled fast.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s better than what I expected for the price but would I get it again</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be aware that the &amp;#34;deep brown&amp;#34; is more like a dark auburn.  </li>
            <li> I finger-combed it gently, then set the piece very close to my hairline and pulled my own hair over it, clipping it in the back and pulling long tendrils in front over my shoulders.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, they are fabulous!  </li>
            <li> For the price they are WAY more beyond than what I expected!</li>
            <li> to trick on the days you need to look special or just want to try something different.</li>
            <li> The length and color were almost an exact match for my natural color.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried with many people&#x27;s dark hair but the purple cast makes them stand out.</li>
            <li> My hair is more of a medium brown, I ordered dark brown.</li>
            <li> Is very long but looks fabulous.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quality is quite decent for the price.</li>
            <li> So you will most likely get them earlier than listed.</li>
            <li> Very far from looking real.</li>
            <li> Nobody noticed I was wearing it (except my mother, who grabbed a ringlet as she was giving me a hug and commented how good my hair looked and realized it looked slightly too long and discreetly asked me if it was a clip-in.</li>
            <li> A little ratchet looking but ok.</li>
            <li> Hard to keep nice.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really soft looks like real hair to me</li>
            <li> Soft &amp; they look real .</li>
            <li> Color is way darker than expected, it has clips that I have no Idea what to do with you cannot secure these to your hair ....</li>
            <li> Color was not as shown, is quite a few shades lighter but lovely product otherwise</li>
            <li> I received my extensions just two days into the approximate delivery dates..which was good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to cut it so it won&#x27;t be one big weft because I could not get it to clip quite right on my head</li>
            <li> if I have super long hair.</li>
            <li> It could be fuller, but is full enough, not too heavy for comfort and the color effect is a good medium dark brown #4.  </li>
            <li> new to extenstions so maybe just not for me</li>
            <li> I like my new extensions</li>
            <li> And very soft.</li>
            <li> this is my first time actually</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> The color was way off, like if I tried to dye my dark brown hair a cheap shade of purple tint.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and these are a little thin, but with one more they&#x27;ll  be perfect.  </li>
            <li> Personal attention to problems, polite, professional and very helpful!</li>
            <li> For dark brown, there was also red in it :3</li>
            <li> They are long, soft, supple and worth the price.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re super thick and it&#x27;s SO much freakin hair!!</li>
            <li> In short, if you have naturally shiny, long hair, it&#x27;ll probably be a good little go-</li>
            <li> The hair is a bit shiny, like doll hair, however with dry shampoo sprayed on it, it tones the shine down to be more realistic.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little shiny but other then that I love it!</li>
            <li> , yes, they straightened VERY well on a very low heat setting.  </li>
            <li> but these have a very noticeable red tint and undertone to it.</li>
            <li> This is the first time, however, that I tried a long wig (or extensions, thereof) just to see how I would look like</li>
            <li> The hair appeared natural and people couldn&#x27;t tell the difference.</li>
            <li> I rated this five stArs because the color matched exactly to my natural color</li>
            <li> my fiance can&#x27;t tell the difference from my natural hair and this hair extension.</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t blend in with my natural hair unless I wear a hat</li>
            <li> The hair feels so soft and they came packaged well in a plastic pouche.</li>
            <li> But doesn&#x27;t pull on your natural hair</li>
            <li> Pretty but really long.</li>
            <li> I do recommend them tho, no problems so far.</li>
            <li> I have longer hair naturally</li>
            <li> I love them, the bottom is SO THICK..</li>
            <li> hair looks fake, like a doll hair.&lt;br /&gt;4) good for a mermaid halloween party/ costume</li>
            <li> I ordered the dark brown and it oddly matches my hair color perfectly despite the little red tint in my hair.</li>
            <li> The quality is not bad, but it is not full head is just a piece, you will have to buy at lease 3 or 4 of them for your hair to look like the picture.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re nice but not as long and as thick.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s true the piece is a bit shiny and the quality looks slightly less natural than my expensive pieces, it&#x27;s actually quite good.</li>
            <li> The hair extension is long and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> Too long to appear real.</li>
            <li> Kinda thin and a little shiny but over all very nice.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t quite the color I had heard in some of the other reviews, but it was the exact color as in the picture.  </li>
            <li> Black was more a dark brown</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall they were pretty, but because they don&#x27;t have the cover all the way down like</li>
            <li> Blends right in with my hair, but it was quite heavy.</li>
            <li> Way too heavy and extremely fake lol</li>
            <li> now you really have to be careful because this extensions are not human hair</li>
            <li> The quality is decent, but I can tell they likely won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Fake, stringy, super super ridiculously long.</li>
            <li> The extensions are VERY full as I have thin hair.  </li>
            <li> These are so long and soft</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not long at all...</li>
            <li> Waaay too long to look natural.</li>
            <li> My friend with super thick hair couldn&#x27;t use them either...same blending issue.</li>
            <li> so I can put one of the halves on the nape of my neck, a full weft in the middle and the other half below the crown of my head.</li>
            <li> After taking it out, it was all tangled and impossible to brush, I would say really don&#x27;t buy and save for something better.</li>
            <li> When I ordered I didn&#x27;t realize exactly how long 29 inches was, but these extensions go down to my lower back!</li>
            <li> Gets tangled a lot due to length and thickness but trim them up a little and they are well worth the price</li>
            <li> They are super long and thick though, so that&#x27;s why they got my two stars.</li>
            <li> Obviously these aren&#x27;t going to last as long</li>
            <li> Since the individual wefts are long I cut one in the middle</li>
            <li> I have longer and always fantasized of having short, pixied hair but just don&#x27;t seem to have the courage of permanently saying goodbye to my long locks.</li>
            <li> Just know if you&#x27;re short like me, they are going to be long and repunzel like on you too.</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick hair</li>
            <li> They are so long and pretty thick</li>
            <li> The hair came in a net as it should be and was very long in length!</li>
            <li> This piece came in a hair net as it should, furled in 7 long, loose silky spirals.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t wear it with my normal hair like my other extensions I have previously purchased.</li>
            <li> Agree too long</li>
            <li> your hair always been that long?</li>
            <li> Which is almost 2 weeks earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> its really long and gets tangly if not taken care of.</li>
            <li> My order also came earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> extremely long I thought it wouldn&#x27;t be that long</li>
            <li> They are really long.</li>
            <li> Being that they are so long she had to cut the length but ended up wearing it for her engagement photos</li>
            <li> Know that these are extemely long.</li>
            <li> I ordered two and together the cover my whole had and are suprisingly thick.</li>
            <li> please dont buy,it not what it says it is.its not full head,its only  enough for a pony tail!</li>
            <li> These do not have a net to cover the hair underneath them like most other extensions do, making them impossible to use with short hair.</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m not giving a five star rating is due to the shine it has and also one of the clips was not working as it should.  </li>
            <li> They came in much much earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> These are extremely long extensions!</li>
            <li> other (Hairdo for example) extensions do, I can&#x27;t wear them, because my hair is too short.</li>
            <li> If you hold these up to the sun they have a small chestnut red tint but nothing major.</li>
            <li> Appears to be well made and as I said very long.</li>
            <li> my hair is not so I might spray them with dry shampoo to get the shine out a bit.</li>
            <li> A spritz of dry shampoo dulled some of the sheen.</li>
            <li> Now my hair is extemely naturally curly frizzy big thick and damaged</li>
            <li> The only bad thing about it is that they were kind of heavy</li>
            <li> I bought them in deep brown thinking they&#x27;d match my dark brown hair</li>
            <li> I personally thought these were not worth buying at all.</li>
            <li> They are pretty thin</li>
            <li> Color was spot on but it&#x27;s pretty thin.</li>
            <li> and they literally go down to my butt, like mid butt</li>
            <li> They were VERY long!  </li>
            <li> BUT I think that if you have short hair you should buy two of these and cut one shorter and the other leave it as it is because in these way the hair and the extensions won&#x27;t look off from the length of each other.</li>
            <li> its only one small layer of hair, order multiple</li>
            <li> very poor quality.because its cheap to send it back will be a total waste of your money!!</li>
            <li> so I got my hair a little nervous because the reviews were very mixed</li>
            <li> Not What I Expected.</li>
            <li> so you have brush them really careful</li>
            <li> I was curious because of the price.</li>
            <li> Order two if you have thick natural hair</li>
            <li> when that one gets worn out I&#x27;ll use the other.</li>
            <li> and it didnt look synthetic like other extensions.</li>
            <li> Very very long! !!</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give five stars is because they actually do get really knotty :(</li>
            <li> , it was much of a red-brown, looks totally fake to my hair.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the peice.</li>
            <li> unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t match my hair color very well.</li>
            <li> I ordered dark brown and got a light-medium brown</li>
            <li> They actually are curly and perfectly thick.</li>
            <li> they come down to my butt.</li>
            <li> so I ordered them for the purpose of adding volume, but I&#x27;ll be trimming these down.</li>
            <li> , almost black.</li>
            <li> has a slight auburn tint....</li>
            <li> they will tangle a bit if you&#x27;re very active.  </li>
            <li> This was a mess.  </li>
            <li> Also, you cant brush them, because the hair all separates and it ends up looking like a mess.</li>
            <li> We did cut a few inches off because it went almost down to my belly button.</li>
            <li> Really thick and long!</li>
            <li> They are thick and very long</li>
            <li> Now my hair is a little longer than passing my shoulders</li>
            <li> so I may cut them a little bit.</li>
            <li> It was a little darker than what it looks like.</li>
            <li> ; I even shampooed it before I wore it &amp; it recurled as it dried.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really heavy, all the clip-ons are all together in one piece, and it&#x27;s all one length..</li>
            <li> a comb only makes it worse</li>
            <li> What a waste</li>
            <li> the hair is heavy</li>
            <li> Its alright though, looks like I&#x27;ll continue with the messy bun hair</li>
            <li> Not sure I would use for everyday as not adequately comfortable.</li>
            <li> They were ridiculously too long and you could definitely tell they were fake</li>
            <li> After a miserable hair salon visit that resulted in half my hair chopped off I was looking for something to make me feel better about my hair.</li>
            <li> The material is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> The length goes way past my hips</li>
            <li> Can definitely tell it&#x27;s fake.</li>
            <li> I am tall and the curls still reached well past my waist.</li>
            <li> Ill be ordering the lightest color next</li>
            <li> The clips are tricky and the hair piece is very heavy over all.</li>
            <li> It hurts my head to wear all day , very heavy.</li>
            <li> The reason I gave 2 stars, is because I hate sounds like too much!...</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re so long it&#x27;s almost fake</li>
            <li> Only thing it&#x27;s too long !!! :(</li>
            <li> also if you straighten, they are hard to brush.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t want to go crazy overall</li>
            <li> the only bad thing is the length- wish they were a few inches shorter.</li>
            <li> I suggest two for a thick head but</li>
            <li> I did have to order two since I have thick</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 based on reviews, because they weren&#x27;t thick</li>
            <li> They have had very little shedding also!  </li>
            <li> This is crazy long.</li>
            <li> Also the color is a little weird.</li>
            <li> The quality of the hair wasn&#x27;t bad, as long as you don&#x27;t add product.</li>
            <li> Awful, plastic and is a different color than what is shown for dark brown.</li>
            <li> I trimmed approximately 3 inches off, after I straightened them</li>
            <li> the clips were broken as well</li>
            <li> also one is to thin</li>
            <li> Not happy at all.</li>
            <li> and I have thin hair.</li>
            <li> I cut the length in half and it was still too ugly and fake looking</li>
            <li> It was difficult for me to put it on and keep it on.</li>
            <li> and it made it look obviously fake.</li>
            <li> looks and feels fake.</li>
            <li> I got the wrong colour</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fake hair.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong</li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s the price you pay for fake hair.</li>
            <li> they are difficult to blend.</li>
            <li> Not a perfect match, but close...</li>
            <li> Very thin.</li>
            <li> and I have very thick hair (they ARE very thin!), and even with 2 of them in, it was impossible to do anything</li>
            <li> Just bad quality.</li>
            <li> Too bad the seller discontinued it :</li>
            <li> So I ordered TWO of these extensions on June 29 and just received them today (July 12), which wasn&#x27;t bad at all considering my estimated delivery was between July</li>
            <li> have not found another one like it :(</li>
            <li> Just tried once to put it on my hair, and it was impossible, tried to brush it, and it was horrible.</li>
            <li> So disappointed!</li>
            <li> these five stars are fake reviews!!!</li>
            <li> horrible product.</li>
            <li> These were terrible.</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a little shiny but other then that I love it! All I need is one more and it will be good I will be buying another one!</li>
            <li> I received my extensions just two days into the approximate delivery dates..which was good.  The extensions are VERY full as I have thin hair.  It wasn&#x27;t quite the color I had heard in some of the other reviews, but it was the exact color as in the picture.  The hair is a bit shiny, like doll hair, however with dry shampoo sprayed on it, it tones the shine down to be more realistic.  They were VERY long!  I trimmed approximately 3 inches off, after I straightened them (I thought I&#x27;d throw that in there), yes, they straightened VERY well on a very low heat setting.  The only reason I&#x27;m not giving a five star rating is due to the shine it has and also one of the clips was not working as it should.  Other than that, they are fabulous!  I&#x27;ve wore them all day!  Keep a brush handy though...they will tangle a bit if you&#x27;re very active.  They have had very little shedding also!  Overall, for the price, you can NOT beat them!  Very happy!</li>
            <li> I have to start by saying that these are NOT real human hair extensions, therefore it cannot be dyed, colored, or styled with heated tools. I purchased 2 sets to add length and volume to my wedding day hair style and they blended in with my real hair beautifully. We did cut a few inches off because it went almost down to my belly button. The only bad thing about it is that they were kind of heavy and my scalp started to swea.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for daily wear or multiple uses but for my one time event they werw perfect.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t try running fingers or a brush through this hair, but it is lovely!</li>
            <li> This was a mess.  As soon as i took it out of the bag it knotted up. Nothing i could do to untangle it.  Just bad quality. I wouldnt recommend</li>
            <li> Thank u,I luv my items.</li>
            <li> AS EXPECTED, COLOR IS PERFECT LOOKS GREAT BRAIDED, GREAT FOR THE PRICE, CLIPS IN EASILY.</li>
            <li> This is crazy long. A little ratchet looking but ok.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy from these guys again and again! My friend loved them! Great product! Personal attention to problems, polite, professional and very helpful! They really were eager help me and fix any problems asap! Thanks guys!</li>
            <li> nice and shiny, but my hair is too short to wear this.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really soft looks like real hair to me im no expert on extentions this is my first time actually so hope i put them right lol haha here&#x27;s a pic..</li>
            <li> They came in much much earlier than expected! I ordered 2 and they are perfect. They are so long and pretty thick I&#x27;m only gonna use one then when that one gets worn out I&#x27;ll use the other. But love them. They are thick and very long</li>
            <li> new to extenstions so maybe just not for me but it wasnt as beautiful as the picture</li>
            <li> These are so long and soft they realy are nice extentions</li>
            <li> Perfect slow delivery from China but worth the wait</li>
            <li> Very thin. I would need 5 more</li>
            <li> Just got these. The color is beautiful! The hair is so pretty, the curls are amazing! I bought two of them. They came just in time because I have a company Christmas party on Monday to go to. Super excited to wear them! I just have to dye my own hair dark brown... Which BTW the color of these extensions is a rich chocolate brown. The only thing is it&#x27;s only 5 clips, not 6.... But I don&#x27;t care they are ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL!!!!</li>
            <li> Really good quality hair. I really liked how the hair was soft and manageable. It was difficult for me to put it on and keep it on. The clips are tricky and the hair piece is very heavy over all. You might need experience or to hire someone with experience to help you.</li>
            <li> I ordered these xmas day and received them 1/8 so it was much quicker than the estimated date. I have pretty thick hair so I thought I should order 2 but I think I&#x27;ll only use one. I&#x27;m going to cut it so it won&#x27;t be one big weft because I could not get it to clip quite right on my head and it made it look obviously fake. I bought them in deep brown thinking they&#x27;d match my dark brown hair but these have a very noticeable red tint and undertone to it. I might soak them in coffee and see if that&#x27;ll do anything or use the red/gold corrector from Sally&#x27;s. For as inexpensive as these are, I think they&#x27;re fantastic. REALLY shiny and healthy looking and my hair is not so I might spray them with dry shampoo to get the shine out a bit. When I had the whole weft in it was comfortable and didn&#x27;t pull on my hair like some others have. The clips on them are meh but useable. Would i recommend? Yes if you&#x27;re looking for cheap extensions.</li>
            <li> Did Not LIKE It At All...Not What I Expected. I guess it&#x27;s worth it&#x27;s price for quality</li>
            <li> I really love the extensions is real hair and very long with curls exactly like the picture. If you have short hair you would need extra extensions cuz it could tell that you have extensions on.</li>
            <li> Great price, but need to keep in place after wearing it, or else it will get tangle.</li>
            <li> Not what I expect it and comes with no instructions on how to used best.</li>
            <li> Too fake...horrible quality</li>
            <li> It is nice and long, but is seen to be of synthetic material, it seems natural hair</li>
            <li> Okay so I bought the deep brown color and it blends pretty good with my hair. Now my hair is a little longer than passing my shoulders and I&#x27;m 5 feet so it&#x27;s not long at all...now these extensions are really cute BUT I think that if you have short hair you should buy two of these and cut one shorter and the other leave it as it is because in these way the hair and the extensions won&#x27;t look off from the length of each other. I&#x27;m definitely going to buy another set of this extensions so that I can wear them...now you really have to be careful because this extensions are not human hair so you have brush them really careful but if you take care of them well I&#x27;m pretty sure they will last you....also I was able to braid them and they just look wonderful, like I said be careful in brushing them!</li>
            <li> Um I almost didn&#x27;t want to say how good these extensions are on here by fear that manufacturer will hike up the price. Hot diggity dog they&#x27;re nice!!! I didn&#x27;t see if it&#x27;s real hair I just assumed it wasn&#x27;t. The material is unbelievable. Agree too long but that&#x27;s an easy fix. Bought two wefts and it was perfect for my daughters hair. Will buy more!</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and these are a little thin, but with one more they&#x27;ll  be perfect.  Amazing quality with very secure clips. The length goes way past my hips and I&#x27;m 5&#x27;7&amp;#34;. Great shine and very soft. I love these so much. I am very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> These extensions sucked!!!</li>
            <li> horrible product. looks and feels fake. Not the amount of hair described. the clips were broken as well</li>
            <li> I loved this product. Too bad the seller discontinued it :(&lt;br /&gt;I have not found another one like it :(</li>
            <li> The package arrived a lot faster than I anticipated, always a good thing.  The hair extension is long and I really like it.  I have not yet worn it out but I will.  I purchased it to add length for special nights out.  Appears to be well made and as I said very long.</li>
            <li> I was curious because of the price. I got what I paid for.Don&#x27;t bother unless you need it for a costume or gag gift.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter and she likes it but she says it gets tangled too easy.</li>
            <li> For some reason, I like making my whole look over and post photos on Instagram. I have longer and always fantasized of having short, pixied hair but just don&#x27;t seem to have the courage of permanently saying goodbye to my long locks. This is the first time, however, that I tried a long wig (or extensions, thereof) just to see how I would look like if I have super long hair. It turned out to be fine. The extensions themselves looked very real. Jut like real iron-curled hair. It&#x27;s quality is quite decent for the price. Easy to snap on.</li>
            <li> Cheap looking....when I took out of the package I had about 5 or 6 hairs come off and that was just with me opening the plastic it came wrapped in! Does NOT look real at all</li>
            <li> The best extensions ever ! Thank you</li>
            <li> Wore this at a costume party for work - people thought it was my own hair &amp; kept asking: &amp;#34;Has your hair always been that long? - I never noticed...&amp;#34; I even shampooed it before I wore it &amp; it recurled as it dried.</li>
            <li> Way too long, gets tangled really fast, easy too clip good for 1 time.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these for prom and i think theyre perfect length! they come down to my butt. They actually are curly and perfectly thick. I got the wrong colour so i couldnt wear them but theyre still nice.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews I ordered 2.  Glad I did.  Kinda thin and a little shiny but over all very nice.</li>
            <li> Too shiny. Can definitely tell it&#x27;s fake. Didn&#x27;t even look right when I put them in.</li>
            <li> Very far from looking real.</li>
            <li> Honestly its a big difference from the pic here but I think u should buy a shade darker then your hair because it come lighter also one is to thin I suggest two for a thick head but its very shiny and really lone because I am 4&amp;#34; its passed my butt so I cut about 7&amp;#34; inch&#x27;s because I am going in to middle school and my friends already know I have short hair so I didn&#x27;t want to go crazy overall its pretty bit sheds a lot if touch a lot....</li>
            <li> Love it, quick delivery,  just as described</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Really thick and long! They&#x27;re nice and shed a little but it wasn&#x27;t noticable. I straightened mine also so they&#x27;re heat safe. Reall great product!</li>
            <li> This piece came in a hair net as it should, furled in 7 long, loose silky spirals.  I finger-combed it gently, then set the piece very close to my hairline and pulled my own hair over it, clipping it in the back and pulling long tendrils in front over my shoulders.  I am tall and the curls still reached well past my waist. Think beautiful, long Arwen hair.  It could be fuller, but is full enough, not too heavy for comfort and the color effect is a good medium dark brown #4.  There is a bit of dolly-hair shine at the top which can be powdered, but is supposed to be covered when worn anyway.  It looks just like the photo, I got exactly what I had been expecting and am very happy. For the price, I consider it an excellent bargain!</li>
            <li> Awesome price, fast shipping, looks amazing, easy to wear! Very easy to care for, I got so many compliments wearing this piece.</li>
            <li> I received my hair in just 10 days!! Which is almost 2 weeks earlier than expected. Came in plastic. Black was more a dark brown but the hair is very pretty and a good shiny. I couldn&#x27;t be happier for the price!!</li>
            <li> Pretty good. It looks real and stuff. But you may need two for thickness. Also the color is a little weird. For dark brown, there was also red in it :3 but other wise it&#x27;s not bad for the price. It actually stays in</li>
            <li> No! It&#x27;s fake hair. It&#x27;s really heavy, all the clip-ons are all together in one piece, and it&#x27;s all one length.. Also it has more volume on the bottom and straight on top!</li>
            <li> The quality is not bad, but it is not full head is just a piece, you will have to buy at lease 3 or 4 of them for your hair to look like the picture.</li>
            <li> I was happy with the hair, of course i&#x27;m Mixed so i needed two of these. The one whole piece works out very well. i&#x27;m very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> I wore extensions during the time being while I was waiting for my hair to grow. I used Phytoworx products while I my hAir was braided and used extensions. The hair appeared natural and people couldn&#x27;t tell the difference. Of course now my own hair has grown I know longer need them. The quality of the hair wasn&#x27;t bad, as long as you don&#x27;t add product. I rated this five stArs because the color matched exactly to my natural color and it didnt look synthetic like other extensions.</li>
            <li> For the price they are WAY more beyond than what I expected! After reading reviews I purchased two and I&#x27;m glad I did. They&#x27;re super thick and it&#x27;s SO much freakin hair!! I have purchased remy real human hair extentions before for over $100 about 3 times and yeah they&#x27;re nice but not as long and as thick. Obviously these aren&#x27;t going to last as long but they&#x27;re so cheap you can keep repurchasing. Since the individual wefts are long I cut one in the middle so I can put one of the halves on the nape of my neck, a full weft in the middle and the other half below the crown of my head. I love them, the bottom is SO THICK..they look so real and not at all as synthetic as I thought they were going to look. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give five stars is because they actually do get really knotty :( but nothing a brush can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> This piece has been great. I know there are mixed reviews on this product, but for the price, I had nothing to lose, and I tried it. While it&#x27;s true the piece is a bit shiny and the quality looks slightly less natural than my expensive pieces, it&#x27;s actually quite good. The length and color were almost an exact match for my natural color. A spritz of dry shampoo dulled some of the sheen. It&#x27;s easy to brush, and the five clips are good quality and comfortable to wear. Worn under your top layer of hair, I could barely notice it myself when checking in a mirror. Nobody noticed I was wearing it (except my mother, who grabbed a ringlet as she was giving me a hug and commented how good my hair looked and realized it looked slightly too long and discreetly asked me if it was a clip-in. Later, when I took it out, she didn&#x27;t notice and asked if it was still in ... ) I wouldn&#x27;t wear it every day, but for special occasions, it would be fine. In short, if you have naturally shiny, long hair, it&#x27;ll probably be a good little go-to trick on the days you need to look special or just want to try something different.</li>
            <li> Nice quality and looks good on my wife.</li>
            <li> awesome and its great for this weather</li>
            <li> really good quality. its really long and gets tangly if not taken care of. Over all I liked and will prob buy another one so it looks fuller.</li>
            <li> Natural looking and beautiful....my fiance can&#x27;t tell the difference from my natural hair and this hair extension. Comfortable to wear and easy to care for...it&#x27;s so much easier than hours of curling and a money saver too....love this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with my purchase - the hair is very soft.  I did have to order two since I have thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware that the &amp;#34;deep brown&amp;#34; is more like a dark auburn.  Definite shades of red/orange that are VERY obvious in the sunlight.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be more than one stand but I was wrong how can you blend one in only</li>
            <li> havent figured out how to get the extentions to actually stay in my hair. Can someone please tell me how its done?</li>
            <li> Wow! I received these today, and I am SO impressed. I was able to cut and iron them and they still look so amazing! No frying on the ends and no melting. I didn&#x27;t even use low heat! Can&#x27;t wait to wear them (:</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with the hair extensions I bought them for my mother&#x27;s birthday and she loved them! The hair came in a net as it should be and was very long in length! My order also came earlier than expected. I would recommend people to buy this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. Too long to appear real.</li>
            <li> They are beautiful and long!!! And very soft. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars was because I tried to dye then my color and the hair didn&#x27;t take so it was a bummer but still beautiful! Wish I could&#x27;ve worn them</li>
            <li> What a fun item! Great quality in both the hair itself and the clips.&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting it to be difficult to attached but was pleasantly surprised with how easy it clipped in as well as how well it held!&lt;br /&gt;Now, if only my hair was brown.....lol.</li>
            <li> Got here fast. Looks and feels natural. :)</li>
            <li> They got so nappy &amp; gross after one day. Hard to keep nice. I guess that&#x27;s the price you pay for fake hair.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to this weft. But the quality is cheap and super synthetic looking. Its more of a Halloween wig quality then I had hoped. But, you get what you paid for right? I&#x27;ll probably save it for dress up circumstances. I won&#x27;t wear it with my normal hair like my other extensions I have previously purchased. They are super long and thick though, so that&#x27;s why they got my two stars.</li>
            <li> i love it but it got tangled easy, i suggest softener and a brush for the untangling. a comb only makes it worse</li>
            <li> Great hair extension! It&#x27;s cheap but it looks so natural. Love it!</li>
            <li> Will never buy again. Says it was a full set of hair only got one piece and the color is not deep brown it&#x27;s reddish brown. Not happy at all.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like never buying it again</li>
            <li> Worth the money very nice!</li>
            <li> Did not like it at all...I will pay more and go to Sally&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Beautiful hair extremely long I thought it wouldn&#x27;t be that long but it&#x27;s so very pretty I love it.</li>
            <li> So disappointed! Waited weeks for an item that wasnt as described! It doesnt adhere to my hair.</li>
            <li> Great quality for the price, just don&#x27;t brush it.</li>
            <li> Look so nice very easy to use !!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product!!!  Easy to put in and blend with curly/wavy hair!</li>
            <li> Great quality, color true, fast shipping</li>
            <li> The color is a little more light than my own color</li>
            <li> Very pretty, very good quality. Gets tangled a lot due to length and thickness but trim them up a little and they are well worth the price, I love these extensions ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li> Very natural and fits perfect!</li>
            <li> Looks not as same as picture .</li>
            <li> Really nice extensions! They feel and look like real hair. They are pretty thin so I would order two or three sets of these if you want a fuller look.</li>
            <li> I just got this today and I love them. I ordered two and together the cover my whole had and are suprisingly thick. I have really short hair so they don&#x27;t blend in with my natural hair unless I wear a hat but that&#x27;s okay with me.  I most likely order more in the future.</li>
            <li> Soft &amp; they look real . Not tangled easy like a lot of people said . Love them , &amp; they came from china to Cali in 3 Weeks .</li>
            <li> Awful, plastic and is a different color than what is shown for dark brown.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality.  Very happy with this purchase.  The color was an exact match. Easy to attach and style</li>
            <li> This was fun but after one wear, it got REALLY knotted, like a halloween wig</li>
            <li> I love it!!!!!! The hair feels so soft and they came packaged well in a plastic pouche. It didn&#x27;t have a chemical smell which is excellent and they looked absolutely fabulous. They are really long. But doesn&#x27;t pull on your natural hair the clips were secure and gentle. I would definetly buy from these sellers again.</li>
            <li> Color was not as shown, is quite a few shades lighter but lovely product otherwise</li>
            <li> Color is way darker than expected, it has clips that I have no Idea what to do with you cannot secure these to your hair ....&lt;br /&gt;Get what you pay for I guess.</li>
            <li> Color was spot on but it&#x27;s pretty thin. Order two if you have thick natural hair otherwise it doesn&#x27;t look right. Nice length though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price that I paid for. Blended in well with my hair color. It is kind of reddish for dark brown. Super comfortable, snap and go. I am super happy and satisfied!</li>
            <li> It doesnt look like the picture.&lt;br /&gt;1) i ordered brown, it came with some redish in between&lt;br /&gt;2) you need 2 or 3 orders to make it look full like the picture&lt;br /&gt;3) hair looks fake, like a doll hair.&lt;br /&gt;4) good for a mermaid halloween party/ costume</li>
            <li> I thought it was very good for the price. Blends right in with my hair, but it was quite heavy. I could not wear it all day :)</li>
            <li> These extensions are nice but have a purple color to them. I don&#x27;t know many people who have naturally purple hair...they are difficult to blend. We&#x27;ve tried with many people&#x27;s dark hair but the purple cast makes them stand out. The texture is nice and they are very pretty. Wish they would not be purple-ish.</li>
            <li> This hair is awesome !! So beautiful exactly what I was looking for ! The price is unbeatable too! They make my hair look full just with one piease !! I love it . Only thing it&#x27;s too long !!! :( but I&#x27;m making a appt at the salon tomorrow too cut off a couple inches after that it should look fine</li>
            <li> These are extremely long extensions! They don&#x27;t blend very well with your real hair. I have fine stick straight hair and they did not work for me at all. I asked a couple friends to try them out to see if they could use them. My friend with super thick hair couldn&#x27;t use them either...same blending issue. However, my friend with medium thick (normal/typical) hair was able to blend it nicely. Being that they are so long she had to cut the length but ended up wearing it for her engagement photos and you couldn&#x27;t tell they were extensions at all. So, depending on your hair type these may or may not be a great product! Definitely worth a try for the price.</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly before arrival date. Packaged well i love the way the hair feels and looks i have continued to purchase mors as i love them so much. Good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> please dont buy,it not what it says it is.its not full head,its only  enough for a pony tail! very poor quality.because its cheap to send it back will be a total waste of your money!! these five stars are fake reviews!!!</li>
            <li> These do not have a net to cover the hair underneath them like most other extensions do, making them impossible to use with short hair. Also, you cant brush them, because the hair all separates and it ends up looking like a mess. I ordered 2 based on reviews, because they weren&#x27;t thick and I have very thick hair (they ARE very thin!), and even with 2 of them in, it was impossible to do anything with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall they were pretty, but because they don&#x27;t have the cover all the way down like other (Hairdo for example) extensions do, I can&#x27;t wear them, because my hair is too short. You can&#x27;t style them, you can&#x27;t pull them up, you can&#x27;t do anything with them. I was so bummed out, because they are pretty, but for my needs, they are just really impracticable.</li>
            <li> These were terrible. Fake, stringy, super super ridiculously long. I couldn&#x27;t get it to stay in nor did I want to. The color was way off, like if I tried to dye my dark brown hair a cheap shade of purple tint. I could buy a nicer wig at a 99 cent store costume shop. I cut the length in half and it was still too ugly and fake looking so I just threw it away. What a waste</li>
            <li> Good for the money mixed well with my hair friends didn&#x27;t believe the price just that the you have to use extra pins the hair is heavy</li>
            <li> I ordered this looking at the great pictures of reviews, I said ok, I want it for a few times, lets try. Well,  ordered brown, and color was not as in the picture, it was much of a red-brown, looks totally fake to my hair.  Just tried once to put it on my hair, and it was impossible, tried to brush it, and it was horrible. After taking it out, it was all tangled and impossible to brush, I would say really don&#x27;t buy and save for something better. The reason I gave 2 stars, is because I hate sounds like too much!...</li>
            <li> Horrible. Soooooo shiny and color is way too light.</li>
            <li> Horrible. Tangled too easily and some of the stiches were lose. Not worth the peice.</li>
            <li> The length is exactly what it says, however it lacks substantially for thickness. I was hesitant about reviewing because i haven&#x27;t actually worn it yet. After a miserable hair salon visit that resulted in half my hair chopped off I was looking for something to make me feel better about my hair. Buuut I would need like 6 of these......and I have thin hair. It comes packaged in a hair net and a lot of the hair came out of the weft. Its alright though, looks like I&#x27;ll continue with the messy bun hair</li>
            <li> Pretty but really long.</li>
            <li> its only one small layer of hair, order multiple</li>
            <li> So I ordered TWO of these extensions on June 29 and just received them today (July 12), which wasn&#x27;t bad at all considering my estimated delivery was between July 24- august 11. So you will most likely get them earlier than listed. When I received these they were packaged nice and I was happy, the quality is good although the clips on one of them are not perfect, one looks like it may fall off and the netting is a tad ripped but for the price I payed they are wonderful. They are long, soft, supple and worth the price. Now my hair is extemely naturally curly frizzy big thick and damaged so I had to straighten and curl my ends but they&#x27;re still beautiful extensions. HOWEVER. Know that these are extemely long. I&#x27;m only 5&#x27;2 and they literally go down to my butt, like mid butt they&#x27;re so long it&#x27;s almost fake so I may cut them a little bit. But they really are beautiful and good quality for the price you&#x27;re paying. Just know if you&#x27;re short like me, they are going to be long and repunzel like on you too. I ordered the dark brown and it oddly matches my hair color perfectly despite the little red tint in my hair. If you hold these up to the sun they have a small chestnut red tint but nothing major. I do recommend them tho, no problems so far. First extensions I&#x27;ve ever gotten  and I am pretty pleased</li>
            <li> GOOD QUALITY GOOD LENGTH</li>
            <li> i asked 4 items and just received 2</li>
            <li> unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t match my hair color very well. it is a lot darker., almost black.</li>
            <li> Good quality and you can&#x27;t beat that price. Excellent Customer Service. Prompt and very courteous. Very pleased !!!</li>
            <li> Way too heavy and extremely fake lol</li>
            <li> Came in one week from China to NYC! So impressed with the service. The hair is exactly as described and how it looks. However, I would say it&#x27;s best for length and some volume.</li>
            <li> Bought for my sexy victorian vampire halloween costume and works fine for that.  Not sure I would use for everyday as not adequately comfortable. It does look like real hair though.</li>
            <li> the thickness and weight is spectacular! the only bad thing is the length- wish they were a few inches shorter. also if you straighten, they are hard to brush. they don&#x27;t hold a curl very well either, so choose wisely if you want to get rid of the curls they come with.</li>
            <li> This was ordered for my Daughter to match her brown hair, when received it was brown with red highlights.. I guess you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality hair. Perfect color..</li>
            <li> Its good for the money, but they should conceal the band at the top better because it is really thick and you have to cover it with a head band so that know one knows its a wig.</li>
            <li> Excellent! LOVE my extensionsðŸ˜¬</li>
            <li> I personally thought these were not worth buying at all. They were ridiculously too long and you could definitely tell they were fake and they tangled wayyy to easily. The extensions are too shiny and didnt even come close to matching my real hair! And when I tried ironing them the hair just fell out.</li>
            <li> Received on time and great product</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it at all it got naught the 1st day I liked it please don&#x27;t buy it because I was one of the people who wanted to pretend the reviews weren&#x27;t truthful and most of them were.</li>
            <li> so I got my hair a little nervous because the reviews were very mixed and I just wasn&#x27;t sure.. But for the price I thought why not.. so I bought these with low expectations but when I received my piece of hair I was very pleased.. It is heat friendly which I figured out.. Lower heat obviously and it worked fine.. I like my new extensions and they look like my hair so all in all I would suggest them for anyone who is a bit nervous I think this is a good buy And it is what it says it is</li>
            <li> When I ordered I didn&#x27;t realize exactly how long 29 inches was, but these extensions go down to my lower back! Waaay too long to look natural. I have longer hair naturally so I ordered them for the purpose of adding volume, but I&#x27;ll be trimming these down. The quality is decent, but I can tell they likely won&#x27;t last long. My hair is more of a medium brown, I ordered dark brown. Not a perfect match, but close... For the price they&#x27;re a good deal though! Shipping took about 3 weeks to Vegas, but overall I&#x27;m happy and plan on using these for the rare special occasion.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this hair extensions. Perfect color and size</li>
            <li> Sending back. Color wasn&#x27;t close to the description</li>
            <li> Beautiful. . Very very long! !! If you want a nice full look,  buy 2 of these. ... has a slight auburn tint....but very nice.</li>
            <li> WASN&#x27;T THE RIGHT COLOR. It hurts my head to wear all day , very heavy. Gets tangled fast.</li>
            <li> Awesome, beautiful and natural looking.</li>
            <li> Is very long but looks fabulous. It was a little darker than what it looks like. That is why only 4 stars</li>
            <li> Ill be ordering the lightest color next i love this hair washes and flat irons just like normal hair. I get four peices everytime. Love love love.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s better than what I expected for the price but would I get it again no you do get what you paid for I cuz but this is better than some of the outer hairextensions that are low cost it&#x27;s good for a fewdays are so</li>
            <li> I ordered dark brown and got a light-medium brown</li>
            <li> nice colour soft hair and easy wearing</li>
            <li> Great product. My daughter is happy with them.</li>
