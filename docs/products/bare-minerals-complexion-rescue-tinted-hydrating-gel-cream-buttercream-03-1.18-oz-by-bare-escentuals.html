            <li>I didn&#x27;t always feel like the powder blended into my skin but instead sort of sat on top of it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I ordered it.</li>

            <li>O my..I love this stuff.</li>

            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>LOve this stuff</li>
            <li>so smooth and silky looks great really makes skin hydrated!</li>
            <li>I loved this when I first put it on.</li>
            <li>I was happy when I saw the ads for this new product</li>
            <li>It works great with any foundation (tried it with my old one).</li>
            <li>It feels light on my skin, goes on smoothly and provides sunscreen coverage all day!</li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly, soaks right in, feels light on my skin, and adds moisture without being greasy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely comfortable on my face.  </li>
            <li>If you want a light to medium coverage</li>
            <li>This is a tinted moisturizer, and has a broad-spectrum SPF 30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lightweight gel cream smoothes on very easily, a light stroke with the brush will bring a light coverage.</li>
            <li>Its a hydrating cc-bb cream-gel light cover foundation.</li>
            <li>My new favorite!</li>
            <li>so you can only imagine how excited I was when I found it available on Amazon for way less than in stores and the fact that it was prime eligible made it even more awesome.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving this so far.</li>
            <li>Good for people who need light coverage and have dry skin.</li>
            <li>It looks very natural and for me this is important!  </li>
            <li>But overall I love this product!</li>
            <li>I wear this foundation in Natural and love it.</li>
            <li>Leaves your  skin fresh and moist.</li>
            <li>Other than the color, she loved how it felt on, as do I.</li>
            <li>I stopped using it, and the breakouts ceased right away, so I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li>I do love the light coverage, how it evens out my skin without being heavy &amp; feels smooth and dewy without being oily.</li>
            <li>A little oily and comes off easily, but good on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I think the shades are pretty flexible.  </li>
            <li>In sunlight it definitely looks more toward the &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; spectrum on her-- should probably have gone with Opal.</li>
            <li>Unless I come across something better in the future, I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really looking forward to using this during the hot summer months.  </li>
            <li>I pretty much just use it now for the SPF that hopefully does something.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin &amp; this might make me break out a bit.</li>
            <li>It is light as a tinted moisturizer, so you don&#x27;t really feel like you are wearing makeup, yet it gives enough coverage to even out skin tone.  </li>
            <li>Really wanted to like it</li>
            <li>This product has a very lucid quality that I desire.</li>
            <li>It made my skin really oily and after a couple of hours it looked like I had nothing on.</li>
            <li>I kept some of my other make-up in case I have a day that I feel I need to use more cover.  </li>
            <li>I was excited because the vanilla will last me through winter and summer because it basically color corrects.</li>
            <li>Day to day I stick with just this, but for special occasions I will apply this and use my bare minerals powder to really complete my look.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m getting older, so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Bare Minerals for years, but just recently  noticed that it was working its way into my fine lines, then I spotted this and decided to give&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li>It can also be layered where you might need more coverage without looking heavy.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping it might be a better summer makeup option for my tempermental skin than my usual foundation.</li>
            <li>I love the way this looks on my face, but it clogs my pores within a few hours.</li>
            <li>These are things I could&#x27;ve accepted if it hadn&#x27;t clogged up my pores pretty badly and if the coverage had been better / more uniform; I feel like this formula emphasizes rather than blurs my imperfections.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s weightless and keeps my skin clear!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light coverage, so if you are looking for heavy coverage, this product will not be for you.  </li>
            <li>My complexion looks soft with a healthy-looking glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a 63 year old woman with Scandinavian skin and hair.</li>
            <li>its a soft toner foundation bb cream like hides skin imperfection  </li>
            <li>(Hard to say, thanks to the super sensitive skin part.)</li>
            <li>It is easily applied and does not feel heavy, but provides just enough coverage.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it, but my skin is dry</li>
            <li>Barely seems like makeup is there .</li>
            <li>When I heard bare minerals was coming out with this complexion rescue gel cream, it immediately sounded like something I wanted to try.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s Bare Minerals, why would I break out?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s marketed as oil free, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t contain ingredients that clog pores.</li>
            <li>The one positive thing I can say is that it didn&#x27;t feel heavy on my skin.</li>
            <li>Might work for someone with mature and/or less sensitive skin.</li>

            <li> The tube lasts a long time-- 2 small pea-sized drops is all I need to cover my whole face.</li>
            <li> For a few days I played around with different application techniques and amounts of product, hoping I was just using too little or too much.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and need something that I can use without using powder, this is that product.</li>
            <li> Such a let down.</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry</li>
            <li> This is a bit buildable if you simply want a little redness to disappear.</li>
            <li> It has a sheer coverage but covers the little spider veins.  </li>
            <li> So when my bf let me order it as part of a birthday present, I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out; unfortunately, that excitement was very short-lived.</li>
            <li> One of the few tints I can actually wear!  </li>
            <li> I like the 30spf in it, but it&#x27;s not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I wish the price was a little less, but maybe over time it will come down.  </li>
            <li> My sister which is a little tanner than me also wears vanilla.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I should have purchased mefium not light.  </li>
            <li> whatever tool you like) and has a subtle sheen that is flattering.</li>
            <li> But fi n d it mediocre.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this stuff! Makes my skin look great!</li>
            <li> Okay product.  Really wanted to like it alot.  Maybe I should have purchased mefium not light.  But fi n d it mediocre.</li>
            <li> I really love this tint.  I&#x27;m a bit older now and don&#x27;t like or need heavy make-ups....thank goodness, the days of covering up acne are gone.  I purchased the brush to put it on with, as well.  It&#x27;s light coverage, so if you are looking for heavy coverage, this product will not be for you.  I wish the price was a little less, but maybe over time it will come down.  I plan on continuing using this.  I kept some of my other make-up in case I have a day that I feel I need to use more cover.  I&#x27;m really looking forward to using this during the hot summer months.  It&#x27;s extremely comfortable on my face.  I love the brush, too.  I&#x27;ve never used one for foundation before, but it was definitely a great investment.  It works great with any foundation (tried it with my old one).</li>
            <li> My new favorite! Paraben free, blends easily, dewy finish, great shade selections for warm/neutral/cool tones, SPF 30. Awesome.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It&#x27;s weightless and keeps my skin clear!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Bare Minerals for years, but just recently  noticed that it was working its way into my fine lines, then I spotted this and decided to give&lt;br /&gt;it a try......LOVE IT!!!  Mine is Vanilla.</li>
            <li> This product has become a staple for my makeup bag so you can only imagine how excited I was when I found it available on Amazon for way less than in stores and the fact that it was prime eligible made it even more awesome.  It is easily applied and does not feel heavy, but provides just enough coverage.  It looks very natural and for me this is important!  Day to day I stick with just this, but for special occasions I will apply this and use my bare minerals powder to really complete my look. It has not caused me to have any breakouts nor oily face.  My sister which is a little tanner than me also wears vanilla.  I think the shades are pretty flexible.  I was excited because the vanilla will last me through winter and summer because it basically color corrects.</li>
            <li> I wear this foundation in Natural and love it. Bought this in  Vanilla for my mother who is lighter skinned with cooler tones. In sunlight it definitely looks more toward the &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; spectrum on her-- should probably have gone with Opal. Other than the color, she loved how it felt on, as do I. It is light as a tinted moisturizer, so you don&#x27;t really feel like you are wearing makeup, yet it gives enough coverage to even out skin tone.  It can also be layered where you might need more coverage without looking heavy. The tube lasts a long time-- 2 small pea-sized drops is all I need to cover my whole face.</li>
            <li> A fan of most of Bare Mineral products, and this is superb. If you want a light to medium coverage this is for you. The color choices have changed names, so you need to find the coverage that fits you best. This is a tinted moisturizer, and has a broad-spectrum SPF 30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lightweight gel cream smoothes on very easily, a light stroke with the brush will bring a light coverage. By the way I purchased this at QVC and a brush came with it. My complexion looks soft with a healthy-looking glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I squeezed a pea-size amount onto the brush, and applied on to my skin in a buffing motion. You can layer for additional coverage with more moisturizer or a foundation. You can also use fingertips to apply to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Lovely coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 02-24-15</li>
            <li> literally does nothing and doesn&#x27;t look any different on skin nor does it make your skin look different. I pretty much just use it now for the SPF that hopefully does something.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! It feels light on my skin, goes on smoothly and provides sunscreen coverage all day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Bare Minerals powder for a long time and I really like it, but my skin is dry and I&#x27;m getting older, so I didn&#x27;t always feel like the powder blended into my skin but instead sort of sat on top of it. I was happy when I saw the ads for this new product and I&#x27;m glad I ordered it. It goes on very smoothly, soaks right in, feels light on my skin, and adds moisture without being greasy.</li>
            <li> This product has a very lucid quality that I desire. I am a 63 year old woman with Scandinavian skin and hair.</li>
            <li> Meh. It&#x27;s streaky and stays that way.  I like the 30spf in it, but it&#x27;s not worth the price.</li>
            <li> This product blends well, smooths on with finger tips or a brush (or whatever tool you like) and has a subtle sheen that is flattering. I wear it alone or with a moisturizer underneath.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great on coverage and very light. My skin is very dry so I wanted something more than just the powder foindation. I use this on top of my moisturizer and dust some powder on my redder areas. I love it, will buy again.</li>
            <li> Nice finish and easy to apply and like the ingredients</li>
            <li> This product is a plus. Leaves your  skin fresh and moist. Barely seems like makeup is there .</li>
            <li> When I heard bare minerals was coming out with this complexion rescue gel cream, it immediately sounded like something I wanted to try. I was really hoping it might be a better summer makeup option for my tempermental skin than my usual foundation. So when my bf let me order it as part of a birthday present, I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out; unfortunately, that excitement was very short-lived. The gel cream oxidized to an overly tan, almost orange color on my skin and had an immediately greasy (not just &#x27;dewy&#x27;) looking finish that required numerous powder touchups throughout the day, even on my dry-ish skin. These are things I could&#x27;ve accepted if it hadn&#x27;t clogged up my pores pretty badly and if the coverage had been better / more uniform; I feel like this formula emphasizes rather than blurs my imperfections. For a few days I played around with different application techniques and amounts of product, hoping I was just using too little or too much. No such luck for this girl. The one positive thing I can say is that it didn&#x27;t feel heavy on my skin. Might work for someone with mature and/or less sensitive skin. My search continues for a makeup unicorn..</li>
            <li> O my..I love this stuff.I obtained a sample in December from Macy&#x27;s and immediately fell in love. Its a hydrating cc-bb cream-gel light cover foundation. I use it under my make up and use a medium cover on top. This is a bit buildable if you simply want a little redness to disappear. I do love it..</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and need something that I can use without using powder, this is that product. It has a sheer coverage but covers the little spider veins.  I do use their cover up as well when needed. But overall I love this product!</li>
            <li> Great makeup won&#x27;t use anything else</li>
            <li> I loved this when I first put it on. LOVED it. It evened out my skin tone, color was perfect, it stayed put, looked air brushed all day. Then the breakouts started. I couldn&#x27;t figure out what happened with my skin, I hadn&#x27;t changed my routine except for adding this product. But it&#x27;s Bare Minerals, why would I break out? Second ingredient on the list in this product - coconut alkanes. A great pore clogger. And since it&#x27;s the second ingredient listed, there&#x27;s a lot of it in there. I&#x27;m so disappointed. I love the way this looks on my face, but it clogs my pores within a few hours. Such a let down. It&#x27;s marketed as oil free, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t contain ingredients that clog pores. Such a shame. I stopped using it, and the breakouts ceased right away, so I won&#x27;t be buying this again. I&#x27;ve switched to Clinique CC Cream.</li>
            <li> its a soft toner foundation bb cream like hides skin imperfection  loved it</li>
            <li> Excellent, mid coverage. Love this.</li>
            <li> One of the few tints I can actually wear!  Looks great and has great coverage, especially for people like me with rosacea!!!</li>
            <li> Hydrating yes, but did not offer the coverage I needed.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin &amp; this might make me break out a bit. (Hard to say, thanks to the super sensitive skin part.) I do love the light coverage, how it evens out my skin without being heavy &amp; feels smooth and dewy without being oily.</li>
            <li> Good for people who need light coverage and have dry skin. It made my skin really oily and after a couple of hours it looked like I had nothing on. Not for me.</li>
            <li> A little oily and comes off easily, but good on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> LOve this stuff so smooth and silky looks great really makes skin hydrated!</li>
            <li> Very impressed! I&#x27;m loving this so far. Unless I come across something better in the future, I will purchase this again.</li>
