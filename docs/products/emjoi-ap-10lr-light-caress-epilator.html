            <li>RECOMMENDATIONS FOR BEST RESULTS:  1.</li>
            <li>Probably one of the best epilators out there.  </li>
            <li>all males looking to do some body grooming this is a great product to have!</li>
            <li>But for my problem areas, it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>The company&#x27;s service is excellent.</li>
            <li>A wonderful product.</li>
            <li>This product works great!</li>
            <li>This one is the best on the market to date!</li>
            <li>over all the cordless/corded aspect is perfect for travel and at home use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>

            <li>but this one is quite good!</li>
            <li>Loved this product!</li>
            <li>Indeed, the fact it is battery operated is a great feature.  </li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this one for that purpose, although it does great with legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Works great for armpit too; it takes about two minutes and the result lasted longer than from shaving.  </li>
            <li>This works great for my legs.</li>
            <li>I also use this on my underarms and bikini and it works great.  </li>
            <li>also used the Emjoi on my legs without any pain, just great results.  </li>
            <li>I got the Emjoi on the recommendation of my cousin who was telling me how great it worked.</li>
            <li>It works great, I would recommend this to all friends and family.</li>
            <li>But this device did a great job getting into the grove of things.</li>
            <li>Great buy.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I am happy with this product for that purpose.</li>
            <li>Also customer service is great.</li>
            <li>The Emoji works great</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, it works great and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>It is very nice that this can be used plugged in or unplugged.  </li>
            <li>This item is amazing works like a charm!</li>
            <li>Very handy, cute, and it works!</li>
            <li>If you can&#x27;t take a fair amount of pain then do not try this product.  </li>
            <li>is a good idea after all.  </li>
            <li>wise.</li>
            <li>This is especially true in summer when you wear shorts or bathing suits.  </li>
            <li>I promise I can sit over one area for a good couple of minutes</li>
            <li>Product arrived in good condition &amp; on time.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m guessing it works just as good as the rest of my body.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also good news.  </li>
            <li>My underarms have never looked so good.</li>
            <li>i just didn&#x27;t have a good experience with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this and have recommened it to my daughter and daughter-in-law.</li>
            <li>It has two powerful settings, and after some shopping around this has the best comfort, power, and convenience of all hair removers.</li>
            <li>but once i used it i was very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>Now the good news, this device works great and is a huge time saver.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle device and thought that some reviews may have been over the top, but this product is amazing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to lie; the first time I used it, it wasn&#x27;t the best feeling in the world.  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this epilator!  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any issues with ingrowns, but exfoliation just helps to prepare the Skin for hair removal and gives great, smooth results.  </li>
            <li>The pain was greatly reduced and my pitties are smooth as silk.  </li>
            <li>The device works great and is comfortable in the hand.</li>
            <li>Love it on my underarms (don&#x27;t be scared, it feels so good to get rid of all the hair).</li>
            <li>This curve is nice for the legs, but a problem in the bikini area.  </li>
            <li>when I started reading about these handy things.  </li>
            <li>I also find the sort of vibration from the motor feels nice on the skin and helps alleviate pain.   </li>
            <li>I can get the job done much faster and with great results!</li>
            <li>Just kind of scares you..</li>
            <li>but please do your own research,</li>
            <li>And effective.</li>
            <li>And then, I experienced in grown hairs even though I clean the areas thoroughly after epilating.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to all looking for a great epilator!</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and the storage bag rocks!!!</li>
            <li>This product make it very easy for me to get rid  of unwanted hair.</li>
            <li>I figured since they were highlighting it and most reviews were pretty good that it must be a great product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best so far.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize the newer ones are so effective and much better speed and comfort</li>
            <li>This is a great product and makes it so easy and painless to have silky smooth skin everywhere, all the time.</li>
            <li>The hair has not been cut off, so the end is very fine as it grows</li>
            <li>This one didn&#x27;t win my experimental competition, but it was a good product nevertheless.</li>
            <li>The best description I&#x27;ve read aptly describes the sensation as thousands of tiny electrical shocks all at once.</li>
            <li>All told, it is a great piece of equipment, easy to use, easy to keep clean and quite efficient.  </li>
            <li>I have been using an epilator for more than 30 years</li>
            <li>Was looking to replace the one I had because I love it and will reorder</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>Make sure you exfoliate your skin or else you get will ingrown hair.   </li>
            <li>I like the option of being able to move around without having to worry on whether there is an outlet for my cord.  </li>
            <li>Have had more issues with ingrown hairs since using this.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad it started to work.</li>
            <li>sure you exfoliate often.&lt;br /&gt;Hold</li>
            <li>Better do it in a bath tub</li>
            <li>but now I&#x27;m thinking this machine is more like a 2/5.</li>
            <li>Which is okay,</li>
            <li>I might have to go over them a couple of times, but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>The longer the hairs, the more it hurts.</li>
            <li>even more quickly.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now that I know how much I love epilators, I might invest in one with more tweezers to use on my legs.   </li>
            <li>so be nice! ;-)</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>and I cover more of my face in that time.</li>
            <li>NO, it doesn&#x27;t, and the more you use it, the more tolerant you will become.</li>
            <li>What I like most is that this product does not lose power once uncorded.  </li>
            <li>- I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>After all the pain in optimizing how to use it, I give it a 4 out of 5... :)</li>
            <li>I obviously love this product or why would I keep buying it?  </li>
            <li>Yes, I had more hairs, but it didn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li>If you love pain, torture and skin irritation, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li>I really love this epilator.</li>
            <li>so everyone knows, I haven&#x27;t ever used another model/brand, so I can&#x27;t say for certainty that there isn&#x27;t a better epilator out there.  </li>
            <li>This emjoi is the fastest and picks up the most hair per minute out of any brand.</li>
            <li>Buy this product you will love it.</li>
            <li>I use it on my armpits and they turn out nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I mostly use it plugged in anyway</li>
            <li>but I wanted something better than shaving.</li>
            <li>It will sting more than a prickly pinch feeling.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>it feels so much better after you put this on&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>I really do enjoy this product!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt &amp; get most hairs in one or two swipes.</li>
            <li>This one is lighter and more slim.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better to have purchased a laser hair removal package or just wax</li>
            <li>I am really glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it can be used either corded or cordless.</li>
            <li>I cannot yet speak to that, but so far, so good!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best to shower and exfoliate first, then it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much.</li>
            <li>If you are interested in a good epilator, this is not it.</li>
            <li>I loved my emjoi for the first 3 months until it stopped turning on while plugged into the wall.</li>
            <li>The battery is pretty good, I charge it every two weeks.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited when I even heard about epilators!  </li>
            <li>The price of the Emjoi is like 1 wax session, so I consider that to be verrrry cheap- since I will be able to use it many times  5.</li>
            <li>I also love how it comes with a light and the pink/salmon color is cute.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t find a suitable replacement for my original one.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had many ingrown hairs yet and my legs still are smooth a week out</li>
            <li>Make sure the side with the light is facing outward</li>
            <li>I love the light it has and that it fits in my hand.</li>
            <li>It comes with a nice exfoliator to prevent ingrown hairs and was worth the money.</li>
            <li>Works awesome compare to the other three brands I have used.</li>
            <li>Believe it or not, NOT a bad feeling!</li>
            <li>Although it does not deliver on the cordless usage capacity, it still works great at removing hair once it is at a proper length, and the addition of the light helps pick out hairs more easily and see them better under any light conditions...</li>
            <li>Since its cordless, it is relatively easy to manoeuvre.  </li>
            <li>Easy to handle.</li>
            <li>some pluses this had over my old epilator is a great battery life and built it light.</li>
            <li>It is compact, easy to travel with, take it anywhere.</li>
            <li>The main reason I posted this was to say that this DOES NOT WORK WHILE PLUGGED IN, which was surprising to me.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>I own another older model and this one has more tweezers and seems to have been improved.  </li>
            <li>It did not work so well on fine hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s light, easy to use.</li>
            <li>I also have one of those tiny Emjoi epilators, which works great for the face.</li>
            <li>but this Emjoi is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>So not only is this great that it is cordless</li>
            <li>or somewhere you can clean up easily.</li>
            <li>So, the electric shaver isn&#x27;t as smooth a shave as a Razor.</li>
            <li>Overall I think this is a great product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used an epilator until I bought the Emjoi Light Caress Cord &amp; cordless.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let EMJOY scare you away from using this for smooth cheeks and chin, ladies.</li>
            <li>So I went with the EMJOY Caress Light.</li>
            <li>so I did my research and ended up purchasing the Emjoi AP-10LR Light Caress.</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth to the touch</li>
            <li>I use this on my legs and it works fantastic.</li>
            <li>I do like the way it makes my legs smooth.  </li>
            <li>The Emjoi is extremely comfortable to hold and use all over.</li>
            <li>the light and the cleaning brush and the scrubber</li>
            <li>It keeps my legs smooth for weeks on end.</li>
            <li>Hair does go everywhere but its easy to clean compared to sticky wax.</li>
            <li>I like that it has a light so that hair is easier to see.  </li>
            <li>Light Caress,</li>
            <li>My skin is so smooth.</li>
            <li>I loved my old one but after over 7 years it wore out.  </li>
            <li>As I read in forums I found out that this one and another epilator does a good job on sensitive areas</li>
            <li>I used to have an Emjoi which I bought from the Sharper Image which was better and used to catch more short hairs, but this is pretty good too.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was so quick and easy.</li>
            <li>Is much better than new model and seems to work more efficiently.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first one, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>So far I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>OK, it does hurt at first.  </li>
            <li>body hair is quite fine and sparse and this epilator does a GREAT job removing all hairs with minimal skin irritation.</li>
            <li>the male sensitive parts, it does a GREAT job, again!</li>
            <li>So far, I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>It has cut the occasional hair but most of the time it pulls all of them out pretty good.</li>
            <li>I took special care to exfoliate before and after.</li>
            <li>so I gave it the full 5.</li>
            <li>so they last a good while.  </li>
            <li>This product is actually quite good.</li>
            <li>You can really see the difference and also feel the difference, my underarm is a lot more smoother</li>
            <li>Just more maintenance that I don&#x27;t really want to do......</li>
            <li>The product is not the best to say the least.</li>
            <li>in all, not a bad product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty easy.</li>
            <li>when i first got the epilator it came with directions which were easy to follow.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;It removes all the hair quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d suggest going for a super strength one.</li>
            <li>The reason I didnt give it five stars is that the battery on mine seems to go out quick.</li>
            <li>but you quickly get used to it.</li>
            <li>I was just too excited and tried it out right away.</li>
            <li>I Love this product and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I mostly wanted it for the hair that was starting to show up on my upper lip but got really brave and decided to do my underarms.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I am very, very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Hope this helps!the light though if I had known better, can&#x27;t really see much more with it than with regular lights.  </li>
            <li>Epilating hurts more than shaving, but compared to the other brands out there, this epilator is much more smooth against the skin.</li>
            <li>The new braun models seemed to have way too many bells and whistles for my taste.  </li>
            <li>Of course it hurts, but not as much as most electrologists do, and it&#x27;s a small price to pay for good hair removal.</li>
            <li>and I thought I would not be able to handle it anymore, but surprisingly after a few seconds you don&#x27;t even feel the pain anymore!</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and pull the hair out fast.</li>
            <li>I have a high pain tolerance and this was killing me!!!</li>
            <li>At first I was sooooo scared!  </li>
            <li>I have to admit it is intimidating looking at all those spinning gold tweezers and placing it to your skin the first time!  </li>
            <li>At first it hurt!</li>
            <li>After reading several positive reviews, I thought epilating would be a good way to rid my hair</li>
            <li>But other than that I am pretty happy with this product.</li>
            <li>And even the legs where I didn&#x27;t wax experienced little pain.  </li>
            <li>I think this Emjoi works great, although it seems it could hold a charge a little longer.  </li>
            <li>The light is very helpful in getting the finer hairs; also the dual speed really helps getting the fine &amp; courser hairs.</li>
            <li>The light is a very convenient feature.  </li>
            <li>So I read so many reviews on so many different epilators, but I chose this one because it is rechargeable, has a moderate amount of tweezing heads, and had mostly satisfactory reviews.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>While the product is exactly as shown and does exactly what it says it will do - the key to your happiness with this product is to pay attention to the reviews.  </li>
            <li>If you are a shaver it will take some getting used to - but worth it -</li>
            <li>Useful.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get the added top piece to fit, but don&#x27;t find it necessary.    </li>
            <li>Each have been worth their weight in gold.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that big of a difference, but I prefer the tweezers to spin as fast as possible; I find that&#x27;s best for me.</li>
            <li>and it is worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still worth the price.</li>
            <li>Def worth it for the money.</li>
            <li>The ouch factor doesn&#x27;t make this product worth it</li>
            <li>This new one is even better, very gentle.  </li>
            <li>, right?</li>
            <li>I use Gigi Post Epilation Lotion right after, makes my legs feel all silkyyy.</li>
            <li>price of beauty and smooth skin is high.</li>
            <li>This device is great--I highly recommend it for keeping underarms smooth.  </li>
            <li>If you can get through the first time, you&#x27;ll be golden.  </li>
            <li>The hair grows slowly back very fine.  </li>
            <li>However, if you don&#x27;t mind providing external light, then save the money and get the one without the light.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t have paid extra for the light though if I had known better, can&#x27;t really see much more with it than with regular lights.  </li>
            <li>The fact that you can charge it and use it cordless is also plus, but the light on this device (and on others) really isn&#x27;t that much of a benefit.     </li>
            <li>It would probably be very smart to have someone wax you first then</li>
            <li>For me it was very much the \\&quot;prickling\\&quot; sensation described in the manual.  </li>
            <li>and I like them very much.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to pay a lot for something I might not even use, but the price for this one was very reasonable</li>
            <li>When stubble starts to return, I can easily remove new growth - so I can always be really neatly groomed.    </li>
            <li>Overall, love this product.  </li>
            <li>It hurts for the first minute or so</li>
            <li>It does hurt at first, but then you get used to it.</li>
            <li>This was my first epilator use and purchase.  </li>
            <li>I showered and scrubbed my legs a bit in the shower first, which is supposed to help with pain and preventing ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>I had my first Emjoi for about 4 years</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care if the product says its the fastest, gentlest, most dynamic invention yet</li>
            <li>Of course if this is your first time pulling hair out</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t get it at first.  </li>
            <li>This is the first electric shaver I purchased, hoping that it would work better than a regular shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, this is my first epilator</li>
            <li>- it doesn&#x27;t work that great if you try to \\&quot;shave\\&quot; like you would with a razor; you have to go slow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking a bigger epilator with more tweezers might be faster, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on one until I tested it to see if I could tolerate the pain and how my skin would react.</li>
            <li>I tried it out on my mother first</li>
            <li>(This is my first Amazon review</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator.</li>
            <li>and wow are they smooth.  </li>
            <li>Okay, maybe I was expecting to much, but apparently there is nothing caressing about a hair removal system.</li>
            <li>I have been using EMJOY epilators on my face for 12+ years, with no ill effects.</li>
            <li>The first one was not rechargeable and the adapter gave up the ghost.</li>
            <li>The second was rechargeable - love it  - and seemed that the battery wasn&#x27;t holding a charge well after about 5 years.</li>
            <li>This paticular model is not totally painless, but it is much better than my first one.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>It removes the tiniest of stubble leaving soft, smooth skin.</li>
            <li>Love my epilator - the last one i had was a braun</li>
            <li>I first started using it like a week ago</li>
            <li>At first it hurt a lot</li>
            <li>Have only used this product twice since purchasing, but very pleased so far.  </li>
            <li>Just be aware that it will hurt the first time you use it.  </li>
            <li>If this isn&#x27;t your first time with an epilator-</li>
            <li>First time epilating hurt a lot, so be prepared.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it states.....</li>
            <li>I have been using epilators for about 10 years now and have tried many different brands.</li>
            <li>Yes it hurts the first time but after that its nothing.</li>
            <li>I have done my arms, underarms, stomach, legs and pubic area and am baby smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>This epilator is the first one I have ever used or bought.</li>
            <li>It does hurt at first.</li>
            <li>Much smoother results too!</li>
            <li>Perhaps because it is a smaller surface area and the hairs are finer, the pain is much more tolerable.  </li>
            <li>I lost the first one.</li>
            <li>It works really well and took all the hair out from it&#x27;s roots!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s curved perfectly for legs but since underarms curve in not out like your legs its difficult to get this to grab my hairs.  </li>
            <li>This is not near as good as the old unit it replaced.</li>
            <li>After not being able to put my arms down comfortably for two days, I decided to let those hairs grow longer, as well as the leg hair...</li>
            <li>Painless, no mess, fast and easy to use everywhere.</li>
            <li>The advantage that the other brand had was that it had an interchangeable head that allowed me to trim or shave instead of epilating - which was a really nice feature to have.</li>
            <li>Have used this product for a long time so there is no discomfort any more.</li>
            <li>Other brands, like the Braun Silk-Epil have massaging rollers, that make sure that the tweezers are kept at a safe distance from the skin and can pull out the hair when it is smaller than with the Emjoi.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very intimidating at first because of the spinning pinchers and you think, \\&quot;I don&#x27;t really want to put this on my face\\&quot; but just try it</li>
            <li>A regular shaver removes leg hair VERY quickly.</li>
            <li>big down side is the hair will fly everywhere.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t know how that would be for a large area like legs.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t pull hair out, but it certainly hurt.  </li>
            <li>I am also getting obsessed with using it more and more!</li>
            <li>My older version I have had for years and its still working!</li>
            <li>It has been almost a week since I have done anything, and my legs are still smoother than the first hour of the old shaving!!</li>
            <li>So much so that I gave up and went on to waxing.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really too much work to do the legs.  </li>
            <li>It is as fast as you want it to be too, so</li>
            <li>conclude, I find a Razor to be much easier than an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>Important to actually pay attention when a review says it hurts,</li>
            <li>really how much could it hurt.  </li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t found another that I really like.</li>
            <li>My skin wasn&#x27;t pulled and the Emjoi just glided over the skin on my legs, gently removing the hair as I proceeded.  </li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t know why they bother with two settings, I went straight to \\&quot;2\\&quot;</li>
            <li>it is cordless - very convenient - without sacrificing power.</li>
            <li>The tweezer discs are recessed into the appliance so much that they don&#x27;t reach the hair.</li>
            <li>This version has a light on it to supposedly make seeing the smaller hairs easier.</li>
            <li>I learned of it from a french exchange student, it is primarily what they use in Europe.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>The only complain I have about this model is that I wish there was a way to shut off that light.</li>
            <li>It works really well.  </li>
            <li>The question is, does it hurt so much that you cannot use this product?  </li>
            <li>It works very well</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really recommend for because it doesn&#x27;t work very will as you expect.</li>
            <li>I found it much easier to remove the hair on both legs, bikini area and under arms.</li>
            <li>This Emoji, once you get used to it, doesn&#x27;t really hurt to much.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really pull the hairs</li>
            <li>and it REALLY HURTS</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>From what I&#x27;ve read online, you need a prescription to get the stuff that really works</li>
            <li>but I have tried everything to get rid of my underarm hair, I loved the results from waxing, but it can get really messy and you need more than just a few minutes to wax your underarm hair.</li>
            <li>no worse than waxing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t reach very well an</li>
            <li>This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve used since the old days of the first EpiLady.  </li>
            <li>The light is not very powerful or useful in my opinion.</li>
            <li>The battery does run out pretty quickly so it doesn&#x27;t have enough power as I would like</li>
            <li>, it is noticibly less powerful when not plugged in and running, more so than I recall it being when new.</li>
            <li>Cleaning the epilator is not very fun either, but still much better than waxing/</li>
            <li>Generally like it and am happy with my purchase, but I have trouble getting my knees clear.</li>
            <li>Now, should you spend a little more on the one with light or save some money and get the one without the little light?  </li>
            <li>I had an older model of emjoi  (gently gold caress, I believe.)  </li>
            <li>gross part was when I opened up the cover to clean it out with the included brush.  </li>
            <li>It takes time to epilate correctly and you do have to go over areas more than once, but I found that it really helps if you go super slow to allow it to work</li>
            <li>I tried low and fast on my arms and by far faster is better as far aspain</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t compare to any other ones, but this thing works very well and is much easier and more comfortable to use than I expected!  </li>
            <li>If you exfoliate and use either one of those products and can stand some pain initially it is definately worth it to have such smooth skin with no stubble and save your time and money from having to wax.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe it is not more popular.</li>
            <li>I have had this for a week now and, so far, I really like it!</li>
            <li>But now it is not bad at all as the hairs do come back in finer</li>
            <li>and I would more call it slight discomfort as opposed to PAIN.  </li>
            <li>The main reason I always backed off was the warnings about the \\&quot;pain\\&quot; of using one.  </li>
            <li>Personally, even though the light is tiny, it is very helpful when it comes to detecting the light color or short hair.  </li>
            <li>My first thought of the sensation is probably comparable to when your leg falls asleep and is waking up again, but not as prolonged and only in that exact spot in which the hairs are being pulled.  </li>
            <li>I bought it mainly for my underarms</li>
            <li>The main reason i got this product was for my bikini line.</li>
            <li>The cord for it is a decent length.  </li>
            <li>My main use for the epilator is for my underarm hairs.</li>
            <li>Of course, it is not pain-free, but I didn&#x27;t find it to be intolerable and I don&#x27;t consider myself to have a high pain tolerance.</li>
            <li>I have a high tolerance for pain</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a pretty good epilator and while the extra guard and loufa-type pad are of no use to me, I bought this anyway because of my previous Emjoi which was very similar to this one.    </li>
            <li>and I need to keep it plugged in the whole time and that it&#x27;s really loud.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this one is worth the expense though as I bought a Braun overseas and it worked about the same and was about $30.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you exfoliate!!!!I had a big problem again on my legs pretty much only with red bumps and ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>After regularly waxing, this product was a breath of fresh air.</li>
            <li>Be sure to use it everyday, to get adjusted to the feeling.</li>
            <li>I have found it useful for the hairs along my jawline and on my upper lip.  </li>
            <li>It hurts to use, but all epilators do I am told, and with time you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I notice that when I use the epilator, the skin in my underarms lightens to its normal shade (It tends to darken when I shave).</li>
            <li>overall, a very simple and easy product to use</li>
            <li>This person must have magical hairs, then, because I find that stubble grows back within the next couple of days, which is, I guess, better than a regular shaver&#x27;s standard of lasting one day.</li>
            <li>My charger didn&#x27;t work right, didn&#x27;t give me enough power</li>
            <li>I was very happy when I first used this product and found out that it not only stays fully charged through at least one full epilating (legs, bikini, arm pits), but also worked much more quickly and was less painful than my old epilator.  </li>
            <li>and i wanted to treat myself to a new (and improved) one.</li>
            <li>I bought this one because I wanted the new design.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t live without mine.</li>
            <li>The underarms was a new area for hair removal for me,(usually just shave the pits)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to this</li>
            <li>so I called the company &amp; they sent me a new one that I received in a couple days.</li>
            <li>Decided it was time to get a new one as the one I had</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for busy women who want to be well-groomed without spending hours at it.</li>
            <li>Start with a bikini wax, so that the first time you use Emjoi, you&#x27;re not trying to remove hair from the entire area, just the regrowth.  </li>
            <li>All I can say is now is WOW!</li>
            <li>The instructions say to use small brush strokes, but I found that using a circular motion seemed to get the hairs better.  </li>
            <li>What helped me the first time is that I didn&#x27;t do my entire leg at once.  </li>
            <li>I also noticed that it stopped hurting after the first time, so if you can make it past that, you&#x27;re golden!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>I will not lie, it hurts on the first and second treatments, but after that it&#x27;s a breeze!!</li>
            <li>(The first one still works after six years; I bought the second one for the vacation home.)</li>
            <li>I like my emjoi so far!</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, on my first try, I used it under my arms hoping for the same results I had gotten used to with my Braun epilator...</li>
            <li>After the first time, they grow in at different rates and you will have fewer hairs to yank out.  </li>
            <li>I dry exfoliate before my shower and after my shower I use tea tree oil and coconut oil, which makes my skin super soft and helps prevent ingrowns.   </li>
            <li>a handful of times; my own fault for not waiting until my skin was 1000% dry and pulled tight.</li>
            <li>I bought it because I have extremely sensitive skin and wanted to try a new option.</li>
            <li>I used the epilator in cordless mode to epilate my legs, it only lasted about 10 min, before losing charge and slowing down to where the tweezing head would not rotate any more...</li>
            <li>Plus it makes a huge mess wherever you are using it.</li>
            <li>and I only got done with half but over the course of 2 more days I finished; now there&#x27;s no hair</li>
            <li>The light does help to see little hairs, but I can see how it may annoy some people.  </li>
            <li>but they added a little light to it.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely loved it, it felt a bit weird at first when using due to the plucking of the hair, but it didn&#x27;t hurt as much (disclaimer:</li>
            <li>It works so much better, and there is hardly any pain.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t developed my technique-</li>
            <li>Since waxing is relatively \\&quot;quick\\&quot;, you will feel the \\&quot;pain\\&quot; for a much shorter time and it will make Emjoi an easier experience.  </li>
            <li>This unit caught all the hairs that my professional wax job missed on my legs and around the knees.  </li>
            <li>The old one died after about 8 years.</li>
            <li>I have battled with embarrassing facial hair since puberty really</li>
            <li>All the hair removal creams, even the ones for sensitive skin, burned my skin or wouldn&#x27;t remove all the hair.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste money buying this model with the light</li>
            <li>I have had no problems so far.  </li>
            <li>As far as pain goes, of course it will hurt...</li>
            <li>This is the second gentle caress model I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>I do think if you really want to have no hair (and are brunette and fair-skinned, not blonde) you need to do this every week or so.  </li>
            <li>It does take some time to get every hair but the pain is nothing compared to waxing and it is definitely not as messy.</li>
            <li>I really think the pain factor is grossly blown out of proportion.</li>
            <li>I recommend it completely.</li>
            <li>Plus it is so loud - like a lawnmower loud</li>
            <li>but well worth the investment for facial, hand, feel and back use.</li>
            <li>The first time I touched the epilator to my leg, it really hurt, so I didn&#x27;t torture myself, I just did part of my leg and started with areas that are less sensitive.</li>
            <li>The contour of the epilator is makes it comfortable to hold, but I found it a bit difficult to get areas where skin isn&#x27;t flat.. for lack of better description.. like around the knees and ankles.</li>
            <li>(1) this is the real reason I bought this; for my bikini area, (2) I have thick dark hair down there, and (3) I have a pretty good tolerance for pain.</li>
            <li>only other thing to add is that the one I received isn&#x27;t red like in the picture; it&#x27;s more of a hot pink color.  </li>
            <li>The added light is very small, and I first viewed it as a gimmick, but it actually does help to see missed areas.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been going to an electrologist since high school, but she moved away several months ago</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to buy the same old braun model as the one I had owned, but rather decided to try something new.  </li>
            <li>It was not NEARLY as painful as when I tried waxing my legs, and not as messy, either.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been epilating with the same epilator for about 5 years and just got this new one because I needed something that could be used when not plugged in.</li>
            <li>you go over in one pass, move the epilator a slight bit to the left or right in the next pass over the same area because I&#x27;ve found that if it missed the hair it&#x27;s because the hair was right on the line of the seperators between the tweezers!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It kind of feels like the prickly sensation you get when your leg goes numb except it&#x27;s just in the area you&#x27;re working on, not the whole leg.</li>
            <li>and hopefully this will last as long as my first one.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no coarse stubble, the hair grows much more slowly</li>
            <li>This one says right on the package not to use on facial hair unless it&#x27;s a single hair (which, in my opinion is what a tweezer would be for!)</li>
            <li>I was really surprised at how easy that was and how slow the return growth came back.  </li>
            <li>I also have a couple of tattoos, so I&#x27;m not afraid of a little pulling and tugging on my legs.</li>
            <li>Lol .. painful</li>
            <li>I  have generally needed to replace my epilators about every 2-3 years</li>
            <li>I got the product sooner than expected, but I really don&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li>was researching these epilators and can&#x27;t find one for sensitive areas for the male body.</li>
            <li>You have to be very patient and careful.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m trying to remove stubble, though, it barely hurts.</li>
            <li>though I didn&#x27;t have this reaction on my upper lip, so it could just be my sensitive skin.   </li>
            <li>The negatives are that it barely holds a charge</li>
            <li>and I can barely feel it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Armpits are a bit better but hurts worse than legs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, you&#x27;ll only have a little hair to remove and it&#x27;s quick.    </li>
            <li>I had quite a few hairs left behind after the first time, but it&#x27;s probably more my error as a new user.  </li>
            <li>I was rather surprised to find that the pain, IMHO, is really less than waxing and, certainly, no worse.  </li>
            <li>Batty died after about year and a half on first one</li>
            <li>For other part of the body sometimes you can gently press into skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>you won&#x27;t miss them as much as with other epilators that do not have this feature...</li>
            <li>I wish that I had had the patience to have a professional waxing and then just use the epilator on the new growth as other users have suggested.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is the light.</li>
            <li>I use it mostly on my arms and underarms, but Im not brave enough to do it on my legs yet..</li>
            <li>At first the epilator was a little intimidating with the spinning head and buzzing noise</li>
            <li>I had the first one for a few years.</li>
            <li>The only downside to this particular unit is occasionally, if I am working on an area with loose skin, it will catch the skin if I don&#x27;t pull it taut (as the directions tell me to).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hoping that over time this will help get rid of the black spots on my legs from hairs that grew very coarse.&lt;br</li>
            <li>yet it did not even epilate a whole leg before the previously fully charged battery died.</li>
            <li>I think it is great for the armpits and bikini line but the other reviewers are right when they say it is very painful for legs and for this reason I am not giving five stars.</li>
            <li>The first bits that it pulled out did hurt pretty bad, but even in that first time, I got used to it.  </li>
            <li>and it is fast and efficient without the mess and preparation of waxing.  </li>
            <li>These all had either poor results or were too time consuming or expensive but this little device has saved me really and given me a confidence boost and makes me feel the most comfortable</li>
            <li>If you are thinking of getting this item, I have good news and bad news.  </li>
            <li>I followed the prep steps the next morning and tried it again - call me stupid or brave, you decide.  </li>

            <li> Indeed, the fact it is battery operated is a great feature.  </li>
            <li> lol.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this one for that purpose, although it does great with legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Works great for armpit too; it takes about two minutes and the result lasted longer than from shaving.  </li>
            <li> This works great for my legs.</li>
            <li> I also use this on my underarms and bikini and it works great.  </li>
            <li> also used the Emjoi on my legs without any pain, just great results.  </li>
            <li> I got the Emjoi on the recommendation of my cousin who was telling me how great it worked.</li>
            <li> It works great, I would recommend this to all friends and family.</li>
            <li> But this device did a great job getting into the grove of things.</li>
            <li> Great buy.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product for that purpose.</li>

            <li> The Emoji works great</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, it works great and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> lol</li>
            <li> It is very nice that this can be used plugged in or unplugged.  </li>
            <li> This item is amazing works like a charm!</li>
            <li> Very handy, cute, and it works!</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t take a fair amount of pain then do not try this product.  </li>
            <li> is a good idea after all.  </li>
            <li> wise.</li>
            <li> This is especially true in summer when you wear shorts or bathing suits.  </li>
            <li> I promise I can sit over one area for a good couple of minutes</li>
            <li> Product arrived in good condition &amp; on time.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m guessing it works just as good as the rest of my body.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also good news.  </li>
            <li> My underarms have never looked so good.</li>
            <li> i just didn&#x27;t have a good experience with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this and have recommened it to my daughter and daughter-in-law.</li>
            <li> It has two powerful settings, and after some shopping around this has the best comfort, power, and convenience of all hair removers.</li>
            <li> but once i used it i was very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> Now the good news, this device works great and is a huge time saver.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle device and thought that some reviews may have been over the top, but this product is amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie; the first time I used it, it wasn&#x27;t the best feeling in the world.  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this epilator!  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any issues with ingrowns, but exfoliation just helps to prepare the Skin for hair removal and gives great, smooth results.  </li>
            <li> The pain was greatly reduced and my pitties are smooth as silk.  </li>
            <li> The device works great and is comfortable in the hand.</li>
            <li> Love it on my underarms (don&#x27;t be scared, it feels so good to get rid of all the hair).</li>
            <li> This curve is nice for the legs, but a problem in the bikini area.  </li>
            <li> when I started reading about these handy things.  </li>
            <li> I also find the sort of vibration from the motor feels nice on the skin and helps alleviate pain.   </li>
            <li> I can get the job done much faster and with great results!</li>
            <li> Just kind of scares you..</li>
            <li> but please do your own research,</li>
            <li> And effective.</li>
            <li> And then, I experienced in grown hairs even though I clean the areas thoroughly after epilating.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to all looking for a great epilator!</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and the storage bag rocks!!!</li>
            <li> This product make it very easy for me to get rid  of unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> I figured since they were highlighting it and most reviews were pretty good that it must be a great product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best so far.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize the newer ones are so effective and much better speed and comfort</li>
            <li> This is a great product and makes it so easy and painless to have silky smooth skin everywhere, all the time.</li>
            <li> The hair has not been cut off, so the end is very fine as it grows</li>
            <li> This one didn&#x27;t win my experimental competition, but it was a good product nevertheless.</li>
            <li> The best description I&#x27;ve read aptly describes the sensation as thousands of tiny electrical shocks all at once.</li>
            <li> All told, it is a great piece of equipment, easy to use, easy to keep clean and quite efficient.  </li>
            <li> I have been using an epilator for more than 30 years</li>
            <li> Was looking to replace the one I had because I love it and will reorder</li>
            <li> LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Make sure you exfoliate your skin or else you get will ingrown hair.   </li>
            <li> I like the option of being able to move around without having to worry on whether there is an outlet for my cord.  </li>
            <li> Have had more issues with ingrown hairs since using this.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad it started to work.</li>
            <li> sure you exfoliate often.&lt;br /&gt;Hold</li>
            <li> Better do it in a bath tub</li>
            <li> but now I&#x27;m thinking this machine is more like a 2/5.</li>
            <li> Which is okay,</li>
            <li> I might have to go over them a couple of times, but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> The longer the hairs, the more it hurts.</li>
            <li> even more quickly.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now that I know how much I love epilators, I might invest in one with more tweezers to use on my legs.   </li>
            <li> so be nice! ;-)</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> and I cover more of my face in that time.</li>
            <li> NO, it doesn&#x27;t, and the more you use it, the more tolerant you will become.</li>
            <li> What I like most is that this product does not lose power once uncorded.  </li>
            <li> - I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> After all the pain in optimizing how to use it, I give it a 4 out of 5... :)</li>
            <li> I obviously love this product or why would I keep buying it?  </li>
            <li> Yes, I had more hairs, but it didn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li> If you love pain, torture and skin irritation, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> I really love this epilator.</li>
            <li> so everyone knows, I haven&#x27;t ever used another model/brand, so I can&#x27;t say for certainty that there isn&#x27;t a better epilator out there.  </li>
            <li> This emjoi is the fastest and picks up the most hair per minute out of any brand.</li>
            <li> Buy this product you will love it.</li>
            <li> I use it on my armpits and they turn out nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I mostly use it plugged in anyway</li>
            <li> but I wanted something better than shaving.</li>
            <li> It will sting more than a prickly pinch feeling.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> it feels so much better after you put this on&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I really do enjoy this product!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt &amp; get most hairs in one or two swipes.</li>
            <li> This one is lighter and more slim.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s better to have purchased a laser hair removal package or just wax</li>
            <li> I am really glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it can be used either corded or cordless.</li>
            <li> I cannot yet speak to that, but so far, so good!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best to shower and exfoliate first, then it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much.</li>
            <li> If you are interested in a good epilator, this is not it.</li>
            <li> I loved my emjoi for the first 3 months until it stopped turning on while plugged into the wall.</li>
            <li> The battery is pretty good, I charge it every two weeks.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited when I even heard about epilators!  </li>
            <li> The price of the Emjoi is like 1 wax session, so I consider that to be verrrry cheap- since I will be able to use it many times  5.</li>
            <li> I also love how it comes with a light and the pink/salmon color is cute.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t find a suitable replacement for my original one.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had many ingrown hairs yet and my legs still are smooth a week out</li>
            <li> Make sure the side with the light is facing outward</li>
            <li> I love the light it has and that it fits in my hand.</li>
            <li> It comes with a nice exfoliator to prevent ingrown hairs and was worth the money.</li>
            <li> Works awesome compare to the other three brands I have used.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, NOT a bad feeling!</li>
            <li> Although it does not deliver on the cordless usage capacity, it still works great at removing hair once it is at a proper length, and the addition of the light helps pick out hairs more easily and see them better under any light conditions...</li>
            <li> Since its cordless, it is relatively easy to manoeuvre.  </li>
            <li> Easy to handle.</li>
            <li> some pluses this had over my old epilator is a great battery life and built it light.</li>
            <li> It is compact, easy to travel with, take it anywhere.</li>
            <li> The main reason I posted this was to say that this DOES NOT WORK WHILE PLUGGED IN, which was surprising to me.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> I own another older model and this one has more tweezers and seems to have been improved.  </li>
            <li> It did not work so well on fine hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s light, easy to use.</li>
            <li> I also have one of those tiny Emjoi epilators, which works great for the face.</li>
            <li> but this Emjoi is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> So not only is this great that it is cordless</li>
            <li> or somewhere you can clean up easily.</li>
            <li> So, the electric shaver isn&#x27;t as smooth a shave as a Razor.</li>
            <li> Overall I think this is a great product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used an epilator until I bought the Emjoi Light Caress Cord &amp; cordless.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let EMJOY scare you away from using this for smooth cheeks and chin, ladies.</li>
            <li> So I went with the EMJOY Caress Light.</li>
            <li> so I did my research and ended up purchasing the Emjoi AP-10LR Light Caress.</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth to the touch</li>
            <li> I use this on my legs and it works fantastic.</li>
            <li> I do like the way it makes my legs smooth.  </li>
            <li> The Emjoi is extremely comfortable to hold and use all over.</li>
            <li> the light and the cleaning brush and the scrubber</li>
            <li> It keeps my legs smooth for weeks on end.</li>
            <li> Hair does go everywhere but its easy to clean compared to sticky wax.</li>
            <li> I like that it has a light so that hair is easier to see.  </li>
            <li> Light Caress,</li>
            <li> My skin is so smooth.</li>
            <li> I loved my old one but after over 7 years it wore out.  </li>
            <li> As I read in forums I found out that this one and another epilator does a good job on sensitive areas</li>
            <li> I used to have an Emjoi which I bought from the Sharper Image which was better and used to catch more short hairs, but this is pretty good too.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was so quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Is much better than new model and seems to work more efficiently.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first one, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> So far I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> OK, it does hurt at first.  </li>
            <li> body hair is quite fine and sparse and this epilator does a GREAT job removing all hairs with minimal skin irritation.</li>
            <li> the male sensitive parts, it does a GREAT job, again!</li>
            <li> So far, I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> It has cut the occasional hair but most of the time it pulls all of them out pretty good.</li>
            <li> I took special care to exfoliate before and after.</li>
            <li> so I gave it the full 5.</li>
            <li> so they last a good while.  </li>
            <li> This product is actually quite good.</li>
            <li> You can really see the difference and also feel the difference, my underarm is a lot more smoother</li>
            <li> Just more maintenance that I don&#x27;t really want to do......</li>
            <li> The product is not the best to say the least.</li>
            <li> in all, not a bad product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty easy.</li>
            <li> when i first got the epilator it came with directions which were easy to follow.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It removes all the hair quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d suggest going for a super strength one.</li>
            <li> The reason I didnt give it five stars is that the battery on mine seems to go out quick.</li>
            <li> but you quickly get used to it.</li>
            <li> I was just too excited and tried it out right away.</li>
            <li> I Love this product and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I mostly wanted it for the hair that was starting to show up on my upper lip but got really brave and decided to do my underarms.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I am very, very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Hope this helps!the light though if I had known better, can&#x27;t really see much more with it than with regular lights.  </li>
            <li> Epilating hurts more than shaving, but compared to the other brands out there, this epilator is much more smooth against the skin.</li>
            <li> The new braun models seemed to have way too many bells and whistles for my taste.  </li>
            <li> Of course it hurts, but not as much as most electrologists do, and it&#x27;s a small price to pay for good hair removal.</li>
            <li> and I thought I would not be able to handle it anymore, but surprisingly after a few seconds you don&#x27;t even feel the pain anymore!</li>
            <li> They are easy to use and pull the hair out fast.</li>
            <li> I have a high pain tolerance and this was killing me!!!</li>
            <li> At first I was sooooo scared!  </li>
            <li> I have to admit it is intimidating looking at all those spinning gold tweezers and placing it to your skin the first time!  </li>
            <li> At first it hurt!</li>
            <li> After reading several positive reviews, I thought epilating would be a good way to rid my hair</li>
            <li> But other than that I am pretty happy with this product.</li>
            <li> And even the legs where I didn&#x27;t wax experienced little pain.  </li>
            <li> I think this Emjoi works great, although it seems it could hold a charge a little longer.  </li>
            <li> The light is very helpful in getting the finer hairs; also the dual speed really helps getting the fine &amp; courser hairs.</li>
            <li> The light is a very convenient feature.  </li>
            <li> So I read so many reviews on so many different epilators, but I chose this one because it is rechargeable, has a moderate amount of tweezing heads, and had mostly satisfactory reviews.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> While the product is exactly as shown and does exactly what it says it will do - the key to your happiness with this product is to pay attention to the reviews.  </li>
            <li> If you are a shaver it will take some getting used to - but worth it -</li>
            <li> Useful.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get the added top piece to fit, but don&#x27;t find it necessary.    </li>
            <li> Each have been worth their weight in gold.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that big of a difference, but I prefer the tweezers to spin as fast as possible; I find that&#x27;s best for me.</li>
            <li> and it is worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still worth the price.</li>
            <li> Def worth it for the money.</li>
            <li> The ouch factor doesn&#x27;t make this product worth it</li>
            <li> This new one is even better, very gentle.  </li>
            <li> , right?</li>
            <li> I use Gigi Post Epilation Lotion right after, makes my legs feel all silkyyy.</li>
            <li> price of beauty and smooth skin is high.</li>
            <li> This device is great--I highly recommend it for keeping underarms smooth.  </li>
            <li> If you can get through the first time, you&#x27;ll be golden.  </li>
            <li> The hair grows slowly back very fine.  </li>
            <li> However, if you don&#x27;t mind providing external light, then save the money and get the one without the light.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have paid extra for the light though if I had known better, can&#x27;t really see much more with it than with regular lights.  </li>
            <li> The fact that you can charge it and use it cordless is also plus, but the light on this device (and on others) really isn&#x27;t that much of a benefit.     </li>
            <li> It would probably be very smart to have someone wax you first then</li>
            <li> For me it was very much the \\&quot;prickling\\&quot; sensation described in the manual.  </li>
            <li> and I like them very much.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to pay a lot for something I might not even use, but the price for this one was very reasonable</li>
            <li> When stubble starts to return, I can easily remove new growth - so I can always be really neatly groomed.    </li>
            <li> Overall, love this product.  </li>
            <li> It hurts for the first minute or so</li>
            <li> It does hurt at first, but then you get used to it.</li>
            <li> This was my first epilator use and purchase.  </li>
            <li> I showered and scrubbed my legs a bit in the shower first, which is supposed to help with pain and preventing ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> I had my first Emjoi for about 4 years</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care if the product says its the fastest, gentlest, most dynamic invention yet</li>
            <li> Of course if this is your first time pulling hair out</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t get it at first.  </li>
            <li> This is the first electric shaver I purchased, hoping that it would work better than a regular shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, this is my first epilator</li>
            <li> - it doesn&#x27;t work that great if you try to \\&quot;shave\\&quot; like you would with a razor; you have to go slow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking a bigger epilator with more tweezers might be faster, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on one until I tested it to see if I could tolerate the pain and how my skin would react.</li>
            <li> I tried it out on my mother first</li>
            <li> (This is my first Amazon review</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator.</li>
            <li> and wow are they smooth.  </li>
            <li> Okay, maybe I was expecting to much, but apparently there is nothing caressing about a hair removal system.</li>
            <li> I have been using EMJOY epilators on my face for 12+ years, with no ill effects.</li>
            <li> The first one was not rechargeable and the adapter gave up the ghost.</li>
            <li> The second was rechargeable - love it  - and seemed that the battery wasn&#x27;t holding a charge well after about 5 years.</li>
            <li> This paticular model is not totally painless, but it is much better than my first one.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> It removes the tiniest of stubble leaving soft, smooth skin.</li>
            <li> Love my epilator - the last one i had was a braun</li>
            <li> I first started using it like a week ago</li>
            <li> At first it hurt a lot</li>
            <li> Have only used this product twice since purchasing, but very pleased so far.  </li>
            <li> Just be aware that it will hurt the first time you use it.  </li>
            <li> If this isn&#x27;t your first time with an epilator-</li>
            <li> First time epilating hurt a lot, so be prepared.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it states.....</li>
            <li> I have been using epilators for about 10 years now and have tried many different brands.</li>
            <li> Yes it hurts the first time but after that its nothing.</li>
            <li> I have done my arms, underarms, stomach, legs and pubic area and am baby smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> This epilator is the first one I have ever used or bought.</li>
            <li> It does hurt at first.</li>
            <li> Much smoother results too!</li>
            <li> Perhaps because it is a smaller surface area and the hairs are finer, the pain is much more tolerable.  </li>
            <li> I lost the first one.</li>
            <li> It works really well and took all the hair out from it&#x27;s roots!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s curved perfectly for legs but since underarms curve in not out like your legs its difficult to get this to grab my hairs.  </li>
            <li> This is not near as good as the old unit it replaced.</li>
            <li> After not being able to put my arms down comfortably for two days, I decided to let those hairs grow longer, as well as the leg hair...</li>
            <li> Painless, no mess, fast and easy to use everywhere.</li>
            <li> The advantage that the other brand had was that it had an interchangeable head that allowed me to trim or shave instead of epilating - which was a really nice feature to have.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for a long time so there is no discomfort any more.</li>
            <li> Other brands, like the Braun Silk-Epil have massaging rollers, that make sure that the tweezers are kept at a safe distance from the skin and can pull out the hair when it is smaller than with the Emjoi.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very intimidating at first because of the spinning pinchers and you think, \\&quot;I don&#x27;t really want to put this on my face\\&quot; but just try it</li>
            <li> A regular shaver removes leg hair VERY quickly.</li>
            <li> big down side is the hair will fly everywhere.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know how that would be for a large area like legs.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t pull hair out, but it certainly hurt.  </li>
            <li> I am also getting obsessed with using it more and more!</li>
            <li> My older version I have had for years and its still working!</li>
            <li> It has been almost a week since I have done anything, and my legs are still smoother than the first hour of the old shaving!!</li>
            <li> So much so that I gave up and went on to waxing.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really too much work to do the legs.  </li>
            <li> It is as fast as you want it to be too, so</li>
            <li> conclude, I find a Razor to be much easier than an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Important to actually pay attention when a review says it hurts,</li>
            <li> really how much could it hurt.  </li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t found another that I really like.</li>
            <li> My skin wasn&#x27;t pulled and the Emjoi just glided over the skin on my legs, gently removing the hair as I proceeded.  </li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t know why they bother with two settings, I went straight to \\&quot;2\\&quot;</li>
            <li> it is cordless - very convenient - without sacrificing power.</li>
            <li> The tweezer discs are recessed into the appliance so much that they don&#x27;t reach the hair.</li>
            <li> This version has a light on it to supposedly make seeing the smaller hairs easier.</li>
            <li> I learned of it from a french exchange student, it is primarily what they use in Europe.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> The only complain I have about this model is that I wish there was a way to shut off that light.</li>
            <li> It works really well.  </li>
            <li> The question is, does it hurt so much that you cannot use this product?  </li>
            <li> It works very well</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really recommend for because it doesn&#x27;t work very will as you expect.</li>
            <li> I found it much easier to remove the hair on both legs, bikini area and under arms.</li>
            <li> This Emoji, once you get used to it, doesn&#x27;t really hurt to much.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really pull the hairs</li>
            <li> and it REALLY HURTS</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> From what I&#x27;ve read online, you need a prescription to get the stuff that really works</li>
            <li> but I have tried everything to get rid of my underarm hair, I loved the results from waxing, but it can get really messy and you need more than just a few minutes to wax your underarm hair.</li>
            <li> no worse than waxing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t reach very well an</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve used since the old days of the first EpiLady.  </li>
            <li> The light is not very powerful or useful in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The battery does run out pretty quickly so it doesn&#x27;t have enough power as I would like</li>
            <li> , it is noticibly less powerful when not plugged in and running, more so than I recall it being when new.</li>
            <li> Cleaning the epilator is not very fun either, but still much better than waxing/</li>
            <li> Generally like it and am happy with my purchase, but I have trouble getting my knees clear.</li>
            <li> Now, should you spend a little more on the one with light or save some money and get the one without the little light?  </li>
            <li> I had an older model of emjoi  (gently gold caress, I believe.)  </li>
            <li> gross part was when I opened up the cover to clean it out with the included brush.  </li>
            <li> It takes time to epilate correctly and you do have to go over areas more than once, but I found that it really helps if you go super slow to allow it to work</li>
            <li> I tried low and fast on my arms and by far faster is better as far aspain</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t compare to any other ones, but this thing works very well and is much easier and more comfortable to use than I expected!  </li>
            <li> If you exfoliate and use either one of those products and can stand some pain initially it is definately worth it to have such smooth skin with no stubble and save your time and money from having to wax.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it is not more popular.</li>
            <li> I have had this for a week now and, so far, I really like it!</li>
            <li> But now it is not bad at all as the hairs do come back in finer</li>
            <li> and I would more call it slight discomfort as opposed to PAIN.  </li>
            <li> The main reason I always backed off was the warnings about the \\&quot;pain\\&quot; of using one.  </li>
            <li> Personally, even though the light is tiny, it is very helpful when it comes to detecting the light color or short hair.  </li>
            <li> My first thought of the sensation is probably comparable to when your leg falls asleep and is waking up again, but not as prolonged and only in that exact spot in which the hairs are being pulled.  </li>
            <li> I bought it mainly for my underarms</li>
            <li> The main reason i got this product was for my bikini line.</li>
            <li> The cord for it is a decent length.  </li>
            <li> My main use for the epilator is for my underarm hairs.</li>
            <li> Of course, it is not pain-free, but I didn&#x27;t find it to be intolerable and I don&#x27;t consider myself to have a high pain tolerance.</li>
            <li> I have a high tolerance for pain</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a pretty good epilator and while the extra guard and loufa-type pad are of no use to me, I bought this anyway because of my previous Emjoi which was very similar to this one.    </li>
            <li> and I need to keep it plugged in the whole time and that it&#x27;s really loud.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this one is worth the expense though as I bought a Braun overseas and it worked about the same and was about $30.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you exfoliate!!!!I had a big problem again on my legs pretty much only with red bumps and ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> After regularly waxing, this product was a breath of fresh air.</li>
            <li> Be sure to use it everyday, to get adjusted to the feeling.</li>
            <li> I have found it useful for the hairs along my jawline and on my upper lip.  </li>
            <li> It hurts to use, but all epilators do I am told, and with time you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I notice that when I use the epilator, the skin in my underarms lightens to its normal shade (It tends to darken when I shave).</li>
            <li> overall, a very simple and easy product to use</li>
            <li> This person must have magical hairs, then, because I find that stubble grows back within the next couple of days, which is, I guess, better than a regular shaver&#x27;s standard of lasting one day.</li>
            <li> My charger didn&#x27;t work right, didn&#x27;t give me enough power</li>
            <li> I was very happy when I first used this product and found out that it not only stays fully charged through at least one full epilating (legs, bikini, arm pits), but also worked much more quickly and was less painful than my old epilator.  </li>
            <li> and i wanted to treat myself to a new (and improved) one.</li>
            <li> I bought this one because I wanted the new design.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without mine.</li>
            <li> The underarms was a new area for hair removal for me,(usually just shave the pits)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to this</li>
            <li> so I called the company &amp; they sent me a new one that I received in a couple days.</li>
            <li> Decided it was time to get a new one as the one I had</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for busy women who want to be well-groomed without spending hours at it.</li>
            <li> Start with a bikini wax, so that the first time you use Emjoi, you&#x27;re not trying to remove hair from the entire area, just the regrowth.  </li>
            <li> All I can say is now is WOW!</li>
            <li> The instructions say to use small brush strokes, but I found that using a circular motion seemed to get the hairs better.  </li>
            <li> What helped me the first time is that I didn&#x27;t do my entire leg at once.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed that it stopped hurting after the first time, so if you can make it past that, you&#x27;re golden!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> I will not lie, it hurts on the first and second treatments, but after that it&#x27;s a breeze!!</li>
            <li> (The first one still works after six years; I bought the second one for the vacation home.)</li>
            <li> I like my emjoi so far!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, on my first try, I used it under my arms hoping for the same results I had gotten used to with my Braun epilator...</li>
            <li> After the first time, they grow in at different rates and you will have fewer hairs to yank out.  </li>
            <li> I dry exfoliate before my shower and after my shower I use tea tree oil and coconut oil, which makes my skin super soft and helps prevent ingrowns.   </li>
            <li> a handful of times; my own fault for not waiting until my skin was 1000% dry and pulled tight.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I have extremely sensitive skin and wanted to try a new option.</li>
            <li> I used the epilator in cordless mode to epilate my legs, it only lasted about 10 min, before losing charge and slowing down to where the tweezing head would not rotate any more...</li>
            <li> Plus it makes a huge mess wherever you are using it.</li>
            <li> and I only got done with half but over the course of 2 more days I finished; now there&#x27;s no hair</li>
            <li> The light does help to see little hairs, but I can see how it may annoy some people.  </li>
            <li> but they added a little light to it.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely loved it, it felt a bit weird at first when using due to the plucking of the hair, but it didn&#x27;t hurt as much (disclaimer:</li>
            <li> It works so much better, and there is hardly any pain.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t developed my technique-</li>
            <li> Since waxing is relatively \\&quot;quick\\&quot;, you will feel the \\&quot;pain\\&quot; for a much shorter time and it will make Emjoi an easier experience.  </li>
            <li> This unit caught all the hairs that my professional wax job missed on my legs and around the knees.  </li>
            <li> The old one died after about 8 years.</li>
            <li> I have battled with embarrassing facial hair since puberty really</li>
            <li> All the hair removal creams, even the ones for sensitive skin, burned my skin or wouldn&#x27;t remove all the hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money buying this model with the light</li>
            <li> I have had no problems so far.  </li>
            <li> As far as pain goes, of course it will hurt...</li>
            <li> This is the second gentle caress model I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> I do think if you really want to have no hair (and are brunette and fair-skinned, not blonde) you need to do this every week or so.  </li>
            <li> It does take some time to get every hair but the pain is nothing compared to waxing and it is definitely not as messy.</li>
            <li> I really think the pain factor is grossly blown out of proportion.</li>
            <li> I recommend it completely.</li>
            <li> Plus it is so loud - like a lawnmower loud</li>
            <li> but well worth the investment for facial, hand, feel and back use.</li>
            <li> The first time I touched the epilator to my leg, it really hurt, so I didn&#x27;t torture myself, I just did part of my leg and started with areas that are less sensitive.</li>
            <li> The contour of the epilator is makes it comfortable to hold, but I found it a bit difficult to get areas where skin isn&#x27;t flat.. for lack of better description.. like around the knees and ankles.</li>
            <li> (1) this is the real reason I bought this; for my bikini area, (2) I have thick dark hair down there, and (3) I have a pretty good tolerance for pain.</li>
            <li> only other thing to add is that the one I received isn&#x27;t red like in the picture; it&#x27;s more of a hot pink color.  </li>
            <li> The added light is very small, and I first viewed it as a gimmick, but it actually does help to see missed areas.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been going to an electrologist since high school, but she moved away several months ago</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to buy the same old braun model as the one I had owned, but rather decided to try something new.  </li>
            <li> It was not NEARLY as painful as when I tried waxing my legs, and not as messy, either.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been epilating with the same epilator for about 5 years and just got this new one because I needed something that could be used when not plugged in.</li>
            <li> you go over in one pass, move the epilator a slight bit to the left or right in the next pass over the same area because I&#x27;ve found that if it missed the hair it&#x27;s because the hair was right on the line of the seperators between the tweezers!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It kind of feels like the prickly sensation you get when your leg goes numb except it&#x27;s just in the area you&#x27;re working on, not the whole leg.</li>
            <li> and hopefully this will last as long as my first one.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no coarse stubble, the hair grows much more slowly</li>
            <li> This one says right on the package not to use on facial hair unless it&#x27;s a single hair (which, in my opinion is what a tweezer would be for!)</li>
            <li> I was really surprised at how easy that was and how slow the return growth came back.  </li>
            <li> I also have a couple of tattoos, so I&#x27;m not afraid of a little pulling and tugging on my legs.</li>
            <li> Lol .. painful</li>
            <li> I  have generally needed to replace my epilators about every 2-3 years</li>
            <li> I got the product sooner than expected, but I really don&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li> was researching these epilators and can&#x27;t find one for sensitive areas for the male body.</li>
            <li> You have to be very patient and careful.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m trying to remove stubble, though, it barely hurts.</li>
            <li> though I didn&#x27;t have this reaction on my upper lip, so it could just be my sensitive skin.   </li>
            <li> The negatives are that it barely holds a charge</li>
            <li> and I can barely feel it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Armpits are a bit better but hurts worse than legs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, you&#x27;ll only have a little hair to remove and it&#x27;s quick.    </li>
            <li> I had quite a few hairs left behind after the first time, but it&#x27;s probably more my error as a new user.  </li>
            <li> I was rather surprised to find that the pain, IMHO, is really less than waxing and, certainly, no worse.  </li>
            <li> Batty died after about year and a half on first one</li>
            <li> For other part of the body sometimes you can gently press into skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t miss them as much as with other epilators that do not have this feature...</li>
            <li> I wish that I had had the patience to have a professional waxing and then just use the epilator on the new growth as other users have suggested.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the light.</li>
            <li> I use it mostly on my arms and underarms, but Im not brave enough to do it on my legs yet..</li>
            <li> At first the epilator was a little intimidating with the spinning head and buzzing noise</li>
            <li> I had the first one for a few years.</li>
            <li> The only downside to this particular unit is occasionally, if I am working on an area with loose skin, it will catch the skin if I don&#x27;t pull it taut (as the directions tell me to).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hoping that over time this will help get rid of the black spots on my legs from hairs that grew very coarse.&lt;br</li>
            <li> yet it did not even epilate a whole leg before the previously fully charged battery died.</li>
            <li> I think it is great for the armpits and bikini line but the other reviewers are right when they say it is very painful for legs and for this reason I am not giving five stars.</li>
            <li> The first bits that it pulled out did hurt pretty bad, but even in that first time, I got used to it.  </li>
            <li> and it is fast and efficient without the mess and preparation of waxing.  </li>
            <li> These all had either poor results or were too time consuming or expensive but this little device has saved me really and given me a confidence boost and makes me feel the most comfortable</li>
            <li> If you are thinking of getting this item, I have good news and bad news.  </li>
            <li> I followed the prep steps the next morning and tried it again - call me stupid or brave, you decide.  </li>
            <li> Many years ago I purchased one, but did not use it very long as it was pretty painful.  </li>
            <li> and it was very hard to clean.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if you want to remove hair on your upper lip/chin/jaw/neck area and don&#x27;t mind mind a little discomfort.    </li>
            <li> The sound of those little tweezers spinning can be a bit intimidating but the only way to get past that is to just use it.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and is not as painful as my old Emjoi epilator was.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it loses it&#x27;s charge very fast.</li>
            <li> The results are so long lasting (close to a month) that I actually just epilate under my underarms now instead of waxing.  </li>
            <li> With the electric shaver, I have to focus on running the machine over certain patches of hair, usually a couple of times, to get all the hair out.</li>
            <li> Shaving and depilitory creams just don&#x27;t leave long lasting results-</li>
            <li> Overall, because it takes a bit long - I wanted to give it 4 1/2, but that doesn&#x27;t exist</li>
            <li> It was slightly more difficult than I thought it would be because I expected dry hair, not dry hair with roots attached that clung to everything.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever used one of these products and while I did read the reviews about the pain, I blew it off, I mean</li>
            <li> the skin was a little red and sore for a little while but not as much as when I got waxed.</li>
            <li> It loses power sort of fast when unplugged, though.</li>
            <li> I wish I had bought one of these long ago.</li>
            <li> It takes SOOOOO long and still doesn&#x27;t get all the hair.  </li>
            <li> the negatives saying it takes a long time, well hold your breath and gooo for it</li>
            <li> how long I let my skin soak before shaving.</li>
            <li> I had an Emjoi epilator before that lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the hair on your legs get too long before you use this.</li>
            <li> so it takes a long time to do the job.</li>
            <li> now i have spent all this money on something that left a rash on my calf and under thigh.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Irish with coarse black hair and this has had no problem removing hair from my lower leg and face (haven&#x27;t tried any place else yet)</li>
            <li> I am disabled, and do not have good use of my hands, making shaving impossible.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This makes it extremely difficult to epilate as the unit never has enough strength when not plugged in to do an adequate hair removal job.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product was fast, easy to use, and is less painful.</li>
            <li> The only reason that I bought this one is that I accidentally broke the other one (by plugging it into a 220V outlet).  </li>
            <li> I saw the Emjoy AL-10LR and decided to try it after reading the reviews and comparing it to other similar products.    </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll never go back to shaving my legs every other day.</li>
            <li> Long story short...buy it!</li>
            <li> You may know this but definitely do not use it on your face at all, I dared to try it on my chin and got a little cut that left a scar that took months to fade away.</li>
            <li> Ok, aside from the cheesy title!</li>
            <li> Once you know the specifics on how to use it properly, and in corded mode, this machine can perform great work and help remove all those unwanted hairs efficiently, and with little hair left behind by mistake, and without just cutting them at the root...</li>
            <li> Have purchased and used for very long time.  </li>
            <li> but i have to wait till my skin gets really dry before using it.</li>
            <li> (That last part sounds worse than it really is.)</li>
            <li> Before this epilator, I would shave my underarm hair every morning and the hair would always grow back by the end of the day, which left my underarms with a grayish dark color due to the hairs underneath the surface of my underarm.</li>
            <li> For sensitive areas you might want to do small patch at a time.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that even though I charged it overnight before using it the first time, I was never able to go cordless.  </li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t get the rashy looking little red bumps.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also extremely helpful because my hair grows in multiple directions, so waxing usually wouldn&#x27;t get them all unless I went over the same section 4-5 times, which would then pull off my skin.  </li>
            <li> It takes half the time, and the results last just as long as waxing, without all the mess.  </li>
            <li> It was painful, but I&#x27;m okay with that</li>
            <li> You do have to go over the same spot a few times to get all the hairs.</li>
            <li> But really if you give this product a poor rating because it hurts then you aren&#x27;t the brightest crayon in the box.  </li>
            <li> One thing to be careful is don&#x27;t press into the skin while doing these parts.</li>
            <li> and I have only had the thing for a few weeks, so</li>
            <li> Hair grows in cycles so if you use it often, you will only have a few hairs and won&#x27;t even notice any pain or discomfort in removing them.  </li>
            <li> I have to say it was money well spent.</li>
            <li> I should also add that a few times my fingers slipped because I was trying to get at the back of my legs</li>
            <li> and I like pink, so</li>
            <li> and I did have to touch up a few times; I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s because I missed some or just because hairs grow at different rates.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few kinds of epilators in the last 27 yrs.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a problem with thick, coarse hair on my upper lip, jawline, chin, and neck.</li>
            <li> I also think that so far I have gotten less ingrown hairs than usual using this product.</li>
            <li> I had a small braun silk-epil for the last 4 years or so, and it finally got a little &amp;#34;tired&amp;#34; so I decided to replace it.  </li>
            <li> The pain can be a little intense (especially on the face) but not much more irritating than waxing in the long run.</li>
            <li> Waxing hurt and left my underarms raw.</li>
            <li> and it went much better and was already less painful.  </li>
            <li> the more you use it, the less painful it becomes.  </li>
            <li> So simple to use and less messy than waxing.</li>
            <li> I have explored buying one of these epilators several times in the past and was intrigued by the fact that this one had the option to be cordless.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> you will feel extreme pain..:)&lt;br</li>
            <li> It can cause ingrowns, just like shaving or waxing or any other hair removal technique.</li>
            <li> I used to spend 15 min on average tweezing dark and/or heavy hairs several times a week.</li>
            <li> I usually shave these areas but had recently noticed a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow effect showing up during my day.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t shaved since I received this and have I used the product every other day for a week.</li>
            <li> It might seem uncomfortable for the first couple of times, but after awhile your skin gets used to it</li>
            <li> Originally, as soon as I used it for the first time, I had a terrible experience.</li>
            <li> and I have to shave like every other day.</li>
            <li> Just know that the other reviews aren&#x27;t</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit skeptical</li>
            <li> maybe other people might like this product...</li>
            <li> WILL give ingrown hairs if not extremely meticulous...and maybe even then.&lt;br /&gt;Use only for bikini line and arm pits after failed attempts to keep ingrown hairs from my legs.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> I almost send mine back after the first try because it was so painful.</li>
            <li> No more long showers.  </li>
            <li> I wish there was a way Amazon could delete the irrelevant/unhelpful reviews so that they are not included in the average stars.  </li>
            <li> Somehow I heard about them again and decided I needed one because my underarm hair is too dark</li>
            <li> My only reason for not giving it five stars was that it is a slow process</li>
            <li> I had similar problems with waxing, not to mention that it is expensive for a professional wax and messy and time consuming to wax at home.  </li>
            <li> it just pluck maybe a couple after a went over that same area over 6 times slowly</li>
            <li> was starting to go slow.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much less painful than waxing, and that&#x27;s only a concern the first time you use it.</li>
            <li> Been waxing for a few years due to regulations and later transformed to my personal preference, I am getting little bit too tired cleaning up all the mess from waxing/</li>
            <li> With this one I have to play around with the angle to get the hairs and if I press down it stops the blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use this one, but am not sure I&#x27;ll keep it very long.</li>
            <li> I originally heard about epilators from a YouTube video about a year ago and thought about buying one, but never did because it sounded way too painful.</li>
            <li> No pain, just a slight pulling sensation.  </li>
            <li> So I previously gave this one star because I wasn&#x27;t angling it correctly to pick up the hairs.</li>
            <li> This has not been an issue with me with this or my previous model of Emjoi, so decided to stick with what I know.</li>
            <li> Then again, I use it three times a week for less than 15 min.  </li>
            <li> but it ends up hurting less and less as you continue to use it.</li>
            <li> So a slight difference in speed does make a difference to me.</li>
            <li> ( sometimes doesn&#x27;t even pull out but cuts in half) pinches skin all the time.</li>
            <li> With my previous epilator I was done in a minute.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention I couldn&#x27;t wax my bikini line because I would always mess up and end up yanking my skin with the hair (OW!)&lt;br</li>
            <li> For some reason it hurt A LOT less just by giving myself a little break.</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that I can pull this little guy out any time I see a need</li>
            <li> Relatively little or no pain compared to waxing.</li>
            <li> The product itself is made well, but the concept is a little shot.</li>
            <li> I use this on my chin and under my chin and a little on my neck and even on those practically invisible hairs on the cheek and side burn area, and this device takes care of both the course and finer hairs.  </li>
            <li> This way, I never have the \\&quot;virgin\\&quot; experience again and can get any little hairs that were missed or have grown.</li>
            <li> I did not buy this epilator from Amazon, but from another site that had it a little cheaper (about $50).</li>
            <li> This little emjoy gave me skin rashes, if you press it on the skin</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not use to waxing, or using an epilator, then your first time will be, depending on your pain threshold, just a little uncomfortable to \\&quot;OMG!</li>
            <li> I waited to the 6th day for little pinches on my legs?  </li>
            <li> works well, hurts a little but it works</li>
            <li> Just a few things..  </li>
            <li> With the machine it takes a few minutes twice a week</li>
            <li> I have used this product quite a few times.  </li>
            <li> It has also helped me get rid of my dark underarms which is not sexy at all.</li>
            <li> I usually wax, but even after waxing, there&#x27;s normally a few rogue hairs that always are left behind.  </li>
            <li> It did not cause pain, just a very odd sensation.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m back to my old one :(</li>
            <li> But it yanked those hairs out no problem with a few spots that seemed to slow down the epilator.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because the battery life has worn down, or if it has something to do with me usually using it while plugged</li>
            <li> (Unless you don&#x27;t hold your skin tight like they tell you to....OUUUUCH!)  </li>
            <li> The results were okay, but the mess and the contortionist moves I would have to do to wax myself was terrible.  </li>
            <li> I am a woman cursed with medium to heavy hair in small patches around my chin.</li>
            <li> &amp; remember you control the stopping point, if its too painful for you, turn it off and come back to it later.</li>
            <li> I have thick, black hair that cream hair removers do not even work on.</li>
            <li> LITTLE PINCHES?!</li>
            <li> If anyone who has already tried this product, and felt that it deserved more than three stars, and that anything I&#x27;ve written here is in any way untrue, please reply and tell me what I&#x27;m doing wrong!!!</li>
            <li> Very little pain on the underarms.  </li>
            <li> I think once you get used to the feeling, it really isn&#x27;t that bad.  </li>
            <li> With that said, it really isn&#x27;t too too painful.  </li>
            <li> but it was much too painful for me.  </li>
            <li> I have to do it EVERYSINGLEDAY on my legs and they usually feel like</li>
            <li> This was not okay with me</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid that it will cut yourself since there&#x27;s no sharp blades.</li>
            <li> I think the hairs grow back a bit quicker than waxing as well, but it is super-easy and a lot less painful than waxing.</li>
            <li> When you use the epilator your hair will grow back softer and finer and therefore hair removal is less painful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finding it really hard to get my knees done with</li>
            <li> I like that the head is slanted so you can get the hard to reach spots.  </li>
            <li> But it can certainly be time consuming and annoyingly so at some points.</li>
            <li> Yeah I&#x27;m late,</li>
            <li> I give this sucker 5 stars all the way.  </li>
            <li> (so you can see it in the mirror),  common sense and in the instructions</li>
            <li> I should probably point out that I am crazy when it comes to finding and getting rid of each individual leg hair.</li>
            <li> At least it doesn&#x27;t cut my legs, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I was surprised that it wasn&#x27;t painful.</li>
            <li> I hated plucking my underarm hair one by one because not only did it strained my neck and eyes, it was definitely time consuming!</li>
            <li> Epilation hurts at least until you are used to it.  </li>
            <li> It CAN work faster, so don&#x27;t blame the darn machine for your opt out for a slow process.  </li>
            <li> Do not try the emjoi emagine as its slow and doesn&#x27;t pick up the hair.</li>
            <li> No more hairy arms!  </li>
            <li> The first couple of times that you use it, whether it&#x27;s your legs or armpits, it will be very painful.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, it&#x27;s like the tiniest of pinpricks</li>
            <li> It left my leg with red bumps and in pain, the hair was gone but it looked so ugly that I wouldn&#x27;t dare show my leg!!</li>
            <li> I have been epilating for almost 6 months now with a less expensive epilator</li>
            <li> looked at the scary little tweezer monster</li>
            <li> I regularly tweeze, but epilating hurts so bad.</li>
            <li> It is NOT good for the face.</li>
            <li> It was painful especially on my legs as I had never waxed them before.</li>
            <li> The epilator is quiet, and I don&#x27;t find it to be painful at all - even when it catches my skin.  </li>
            <li> with lots of painful facial expressions.   </li>
            <li> The Emjoi is SO much easier than plucking individul hairs with tweezers, which is VERY painful.  </li>
            <li> I use to wax, and this is a lot less painful and messy.</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s useless - get the plain Caress !</li>
            <li> Read a number of reviews that stated these things crap out after a short time.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my underarms without taking the recommended \\&quot;prep\\&quot; steps and literally got nauseated by the pain and had to stop midway.  </li>
            <li> I always end up with itchy razor bumps from shaving, no matter what products I used afterwards (like Bikini Zone, helped a lil, but I still had itchy, red annoying bumps) or</li>
            <li> I did get them waxed like 2 weeks ago to thin the hair, but this is what I&#x27;m going to use for now on.</li>
            <li> That part is extremely frustrating.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as quick as waxing (although if you factor in transit time to the salon &amp; wait time - maybe it&#x27;s not that bad).  </li>
            <li> I previously had the Braun silk epil and while it worked it was painful.  </li>
            <li> it is less painful.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since my hair is weakened from years of waxing, I found this thing is less painful.</li>
            <li> and I started it on the 1st setting and on my leg since I figured that would be less painful.</li>
            <li> I only use an epilator for my underarms and this thing sucks horribly.  </li>
            <li> The pain is not that bad at all, it just feels like little pins in the beginning</li>
            <li> had an unfortunate moment yesterday when it tried (unsuccessfully) to take a chunk out of my underarm skin.</li>
            <li> wrong.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have any ill effect.  </li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work and is entirely useless.</li>
            <li> Sadly, it&#x27;s going in the garbage.</li>
            <li> This was very frustrating...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t broken out on my face in years, but after going along my chin to get those few strays, I had the worst breakout since 7th grade..</li>
            <li> Then I started shaving, which I hated because I would get stubble in less than 24hours</li>
            <li> I must say that it is not a joy as I found it to be a bit painful and time consuming.  </li>
            <li> Worst of all, it grabbed my skin in a few places and left me with nasty bruises.  </li>
            <li> and it drove me crazy.  </li>
            <li> I was so afraid to use this from everything I had read.</li>
            <li> and she thought I was mad at her for some reason.  </li>
            <li> This proved to be a very expensive option</li>
            <li> I was very, very wrong.</li>
            <li> Very weird...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so bad on your legs but anywhere else be prepared for some pain.</li>
            <li> Let start with the bad news.</li>
            <li> Well, it turns out it was a bad idea.  </li>
            <li> Bad.  </li>
            <li> Really bad.  </li>
            <li> So bad news...</li>
            <li> this product hurt too bad to use and would not even pull all the hair out.  </li>
            <li> I would say it removed about 50% of the hair and that was after about 1 1/2hrs of painful leg shaving.</li>
            <li> I hope it will not be as painful as I continue to use it.  </li>
            <li> However, it wasn&#x27;t so painful that I felt the need to stop.  </li>
            <li> Getting around my ankles was extremely painful.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s painful but what hair removal product isn&#x27;t?</li>
            <li> It was crap.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely HATE this.</li>
            <li> I was startled to find that it isn&#x27;t that bad!  </li>
            <li> This product was very painful and did not remove the hairs well.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed!</li>
            <li> I got horrible rashes everywhere</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used epilators for 20+ years and this is the worst I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li> Oh gosh it&#x27;s painful!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This thing hurts horribly.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I got the product sooner than expected, but I really don&#x27;t like it.  I have been using an epilator for more than 30 years and I can&#x27;t find a suitable replacement for my original one.  My issue is not with the seller but with the product.  If you are interested in a good epilator, this is not it.</li>
            <li> Read a number of reviews that stated these things crap out after a short time. I cannot yet speak to that, but so far, so good!</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and is not as painful as my old Emjoi epilator was. It did not sting while the hair was being pulled out. I wish I had bought one of these long ago.</li>
            <li> I have explored buying one of these epilators several times in the past and was intrigued by the fact that this one had the option to be cordless.  The main reason I always backed off was the warnings about the \\&quot;pain\\&quot; of using one.  I was rather surprised to find that the pain, IMHO, is really less than waxing and, certainly, no worse.  After all, pulling out hairs by the roots by epilation or waxing is the same only with the epilator you have some measure of control.  I also like the fact that I can pull this little guy out any time I see a need and it is fast and efficient without the mess and preparation of waxing.  Indeed, the fact it is battery operated is a great feature.  I mostly wanted it for the hair that was starting to show up on my upper lip but got really brave and decided to do my underarms.  I was really surprised at how easy that was and how slow the return growth came back.  All told, it is a great piece of equipment, easy to use, easy to keep clean and quite efficient.  My only reason for not giving it five stars was that it is a slow process and I don&#x27;t know how that would be for a large area like legs.</li>
            <li> No more hairy arms!  Lol .. painful but nothing you can&#x27;t handle</li>
            <li> I have waxed my bikini line for years, and because of the expense, I have been looking for a product to replace waxing.  Shaving and depilitory creams just don&#x27;t leave long lasting results- so i decided to try Emjoi.  Received it on time as promised all items intact.    PROS:   1. Since its cordless, it is relatively easy to manoeuvre.  2. Relatively little or no pain compared to waxing. Seriously, it&#x27;s like the tiniest of pinpricks and I would more call it slight discomfort as opposed to PAIN.  3. Yields longer lasting results (smoothness/Hairlessness) than shaving or creams. Re-growth time is Similar to waxing.  4. The price of the Emjoi is like 1 wax session, so I consider that to be verrrry cheap- since I will be able to use it many times  5. When stubble starts to return, I can easily remove new growth - so I can always be really neatly groomed.    CONS:  1. Not nearly as quick as waxing (although if you factor in transit time to the salon &amp; wait time - maybe it&#x27;s not that bad).  I haven&#x27;t developed my technique- so I will keep practicing so I can increase my speed.  2.  You do have to go over the same spot a few times to get all the hairs. It&#x27;s not a \\&quot;one-pass\\&quot; deal.  3.  Leaves redness - from the hair plucking (just like waxing), but I think the redness goes away quicker.    RECOMMENDATIONS FOR BEST RESULTS:  1. Start with a bikini wax, so that the first time you use Emjoi, you&#x27;re not trying to remove hair from the entire area, just the regrowth.  Since waxing is relatively \\&quot;quick\\&quot;, you will feel the \\&quot;pain\\&quot; for a much shorter time and it will make Emjoi an easier experience.  2.  I haven&#x27;t had any issues with ingrowns, but exfoliation just helps to prepare the Skin for hair removal and gives great, smooth results.  3.  Have a bit of pain relieving cream (another reviewer recommended products), so that you can get rid of the redness that results.    Overall, because it takes a bit long - I wanted to give it 4 1/2, but that doesn&#x27;t exist so I gave it the full 5.</li>
            <li> Works like a champ. I&#x27;m just a wuss lol. It hurts like the dickens however it works like a champ! It&#x27;s not so bad on your legs but anywhere else be prepared for some pain.</li>
            <li> Had to send back because it would not work without being plug in  it is rechargeable  it may be a defect  Was looking to replace the one I had because I love it and will reorder</li>
            <li> Easy to handle. No ingrown hairs after using it on my upper lip! Works awesome compare to the other three brands I have used.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a model that would take out an occasional unwanted hair or two on the face. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this one for that purpose, although it does great with legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had an unfortunate moment yesterday when it tried (unsuccessfully) to take a chunk out of my underarm skin. I won&#x27;t use it again for that area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually bought 3 different models to compare. I also have one of those tiny Emjoi epilators, which works great for the face. This one didn&#x27;t win my experimental competition, but it was a good product nevertheless.</li>
            <li> I previously had the Braun silk epil and while it worked it was painful.  So much so that I gave up and went on to waxing. This proved to be a very expensive option so I&#x27;ve had to dial that back. Now I don&#x27;t know if it helped that I got used to the waxing but this Emjoi is fantastic.  Very little pain on the underarms.  And even the legs where I didn&#x27;t wax experienced little pain.  So not only is this great that it is cordless it is less painful.  All I can say is now is WOW!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I saw it on the \\&quot;Today Show\\&quot;. I figured since they were highlighting it and most reviews were pretty good that it must be a great product. I was very, very wrong. I followed all the directins to a T. It was painful, but I&#x27;m okay with that if it works, but it does NOT!  I would say it removed about 50% of the hair and that was after about 1 1/2hrs of painful leg shaving. Plus it makes a huge mess wherever you are using it. All the hair just falls to the floor, if you do buy this I recommend placing a towel under the area you are shaving. It did NOT work on my underarms at all and I was too scared to try my bikini area since it didn&#x27;t work any where else. I have sent it back to Amazon for a refund, that was about 3wks ago and I haven&#x27;t herd back from them yet. Hopefully I didn&#x27;t just throw away $73.</li>
            <li> It works well enough but it&#x27;s really too much work to do the legs.  It takes SOOOOO long and still doesn&#x27;t get all the hair.  I have to do it EVERYSINGLEDAY on my legs and they usually feel like its two days after I&#x27;ve shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Armpits are a bit better but hurts worse than legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price of beauty and smooth skin is high.</li>
            <li> If you are thinking of getting this item, I have good news and bad news.  Let start with the bad news. The first couple of times that you use it, whether it&#x27;s your legs or armpits, it will be very painful.  I almost send mine back after the first try because it was so painful. However, after a couple times, you can&#x27;t even feel the pain.  Now the good news, this device works great and is a huge time saver.  You can take care of your legs while you watch tv.  No more long showers.  Works great for armpit too; it takes about two minutes and the result lasted longer than from shaving.  LOVE IT. Make sure you exfoliate your skin or else you get will ingrown hair.   Now, should you spend a little more on the one with light or save some money and get the one without the little light?  Personally, even though the light is tiny, it is very helpful when it comes to detecting the light color or short hair.  However, if you don&#x27;t mind providing external light, then save the money and get the one without the light.  Cord or cordless?  Mine is cordless. I like the option of being able to move around without having to worry on whether there is an outlet for my cord.  Overall, love this product.  Can&#x27;t ever go back to shaving.</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve used since the old days of the first EpiLady.  This unit caught all the hairs that my professional wax job missed on my legs and around the knees.  It hurts for the first minute or so and then you get used to it and it almost starts to feel soothing.  I tried it on my underarms without taking the recommended \\&quot;prep\\&quot; steps and literally got nauseated by the pain and had to stop midway.  I followed the prep steps the next morning and tried it again - call me stupid or brave, you decide.  The pain was greatly reduced and my pitties are smooth as silk.  Don&#x27;t forget to use an exfoliator regularly to avoid ingrown hairs as the hair starts to grow back.</li>
            <li> This works great for my legs. It did not cause pain, just a very odd sensation. It did not work so well on fine hair.</li>
            <li> The product itself is made well, but the concept is a little shot. After reading several positive reviews, I thought epilating would be a good way to rid my hair....wrong. I have a high pain tolerance and this was killing me!!! I regularly tweeze, but epilating hurts so bad. And then, I experienced in grown hairs even though I clean the areas thoroughly after epilating. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Like this epilator. It&#x27;s my first one, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. It does hurt at first, but then you get used to it. I am also getting obsessed with using it more and more! Love it on my underarms (don&#x27;t be scared, it feels so good to get rid of all the hair). Also-use the loofah before in the shower, it helps prevent ingrowns. Generally like it and am happy with my purchase, but I have trouble getting my knees clear.</li>
            <li> This was my first epilator use and purchase.  I bought this epilator, hoping I could work my way starting with legs, then moving on to bikini and underarms after getting used to it.  I also bought the Emjoi AP-9L for facial hair at the same time.  This one says right on the package not to use on facial hair unless it&#x27;s a single hair (which, in my opinion is what a tweezer would be for!), so don&#x27;t buy this one for facial hair.  I started out on my legs. I shaved a couple days beforehand.  I showered and scrubbed my legs a bit in the shower first, which is supposed to help with pain and preventing ingrown hairs.  The first bits that it pulled out did hurt pretty bad, but even in that first time, I got used to it.  It was not NEARLY as painful as when I tried waxing my legs, and not as messy, either.  My first thought of the sensation is probably comparable to when your leg falls asleep and is waking up again, but not as prolonged and only in that exact spot in which the hairs are being pulled.  The instructions say to use small brush strokes, but I found that using a circular motion seemed to get the hairs better.  I had quite a few hairs left behind after the first time, but it&#x27;s probably more my error as a new user.  I used it again two days later to get the strays and it went much better and was already less painful.  I haven&#x27;t had many ingrown hairs yet and my legs still are smooth a week out (they&#x27;d be needing a shave after a couple days if I were still shaving!)  I tried to use it on my bikini area, but the tweezer area curves in to a point that there is a gap made where my leg meets my body, so it can&#x27;t even reach the hairs.  I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different ways and angles, but it just couldn&#x27;t reach.  This curve is nice for the legs, but a problem in the bikini area.  It is very nice that this can be used plugged in or unplugged.  It loses power sort of fast when unplugged, though.</li>
            <li> This is not near as good as the old unit it replaced.The old one died after about 8 years. I&#x27;ll use this one, but am not sure I&#x27;ll keep it very long. Have had more issues with ingrown hairs since using this.</li>
            <li> Probably one of the best epilators out there.  I used to have an Emjoi which I bought from the Sharper Image which was better and used to catch more short hairs, but this is pretty good too.  The only reason that I bought this one is that I accidentally broke the other one (by plugging it into a 220V outlet).  I had my first Emjoi for about 4 years so they last a good while.  I don&#x27;t know if this one is worth the expense though as I bought a Braun overseas and it worked about the same and was about $30.  It didn&#x27;t have a battery though.      The main reason I posted this was to say that this DOES NOT WORK WHILE PLUGGED IN, which was surprising to me.  Other than that, it&#x27;s a pretty good epilator and while the extra guard and loufa-type pad are of no use to me, I bought this anyway because of my previous Emjoi which was very similar to this one.    EDIT:  I checked again about a week ago and it started to work while plugged in! Very weird...but I&#x27;m glad it started to work.</li>
            <li> I had an older model of emjoi  (gently gold caress, I believe.)  I loved my old one but after over 7 years it wore out.  This new one is even better, very gentle.  I am disabled, and do not have good use of my hands, making shaving impossible.  This product make it very easy for me to get rid  of unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> OMG.  I was so excited when I even heard about epilators!  I have a stubble like WHILE I&#x27;m shaving!  The slightest goosebumps and bam work undone.  So I was *stoked* when I started reading about these handy things.  Yeah I&#x27;m late, whatever.  So I read so many reviews on so many different epilators, but I chose this one because it is rechargeable, has a moderate amount of tweezing heads, and had mostly satisfactory reviews.  I wish there was a way Amazon could delete the irrelevant/unhelpful reviews so that they are not included in the average stars.  I give this sucker 5 stars all the way.  At first I was sooooo scared!  I have to admit it is intimidating looking at all those spinning gold tweezers and placing it to your skin the first time!  But really if you give this product a poor rating because it hurts then you aren&#x27;t the brightest crayon in the box.  People! You are pulling hair out from the root.  I don&#x27;t care if the product says its the fastest, gentlest, most dynamic invention yet--you are just silly if you think such a process could be pain free!  With that said, it really isn&#x27;t too too painful.  Its like getting a tattoo.  (Unless you don&#x27;t hold your skin tight like they tell you to....OUUUUCH!)  It is as fast as you want it to be too, so the negatives saying it takes a long time, well hold your breath and gooo for it sister if you&#x27;re in a hurry!  It CAN work faster, so don&#x27;t blame the darn machine for your opt out for a slow process.  This thing gets all the hair good!&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you exfoliate often.&lt;br /&gt;Hold the skin tight.&lt;br /&gt;When you go over in one pass, move the epilator a slight bit to the left or right in the next pass over the same area because I&#x27;ve found that if it missed the hair it&#x27;s because the hair was right on the line of the seperators between the tweezers!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t compare to any other ones, but this thing works very well and is much easier and more comfortable to use than I expected!  I wouldn&#x27;t have paid extra for the light though if I had known better, can&#x27;t really see much more with it than with regular lights.  Hope this helps!the light though if I had known better, can&#x27;t really see much more with it than with regular lights.  Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best to shower and exfoliate first, then it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much. some of the hairs were too short to grab so i had to run over it the next day. overall, a very simple and easy product to use</li>
            <li> Been waxing for a few years due to regulations and later transformed to my personal preference, I am getting little bit too tired cleaning up all the mess from waxing/sugaring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was researching these epilators and can&#x27;t find one for sensitive areas for the male body. As I read in forums I found out that this one and another epilator does a good job on sensitive areas so I decided to purchase this since this is still being made, and cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my hair is weakened from years of waxing, I found this thing is less painful. Of course if this is your first time pulling hair out you will feel extreme pain..:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My body hair is quite fine and sparse and this epilator does a GREAT job removing all hairs with minimal skin irritation. You have to be very patient and careful. Always study the direction of your hair growth. For sensitive areas you might want to do small patch at a time. Also study the direction of your hair growth! I have no troubles doing hard-to-reach areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the male sensitive parts, it does a GREAT job, again! Don&#x27;t be afraid that it will cut yourself since there&#x27;s no sharp blades. One thing to be careful is don&#x27;t press into the skin while doing these parts. For other part of the body sometimes you can gently press into skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One big down side is the hair will fly everywhere. Better do it in a bath tub or somewhere you can clean up easily. Cleaning the epilator is not very fun either, but still much better than waxing/sugaring!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all males looking to do some body grooming this is a great product to have!</li>
            <li> I loved my emjoi for the first 3 months until it stopped turning on while plugged into the wall. I have the corded/cordless combo unit and now it only works when the unit is not plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This makes it extremely difficult to epilate as the unit never has enough strength when not plugged in to do an adequate hair removal job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I also don&#x27;t know who to contact about a warranty, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Might have been a 4.5/5, but now I&#x27;m thinking this machine is more like a 2/5.</li>
            <li> I have battled with embarrassing facial hair since puberty really and I&#x27;ve tried waxing, chemicals, laser treatments and have even had to resort to shaving in a pinch.  These all had either poor results or were too time consuming or expensive but this little device has saved me really and given me a confidence boost and makes me feel the most comfortable I&#x27;ve ever felt when it&#x27;s come to my face.  It&#x27;s very intimidating at first because of the spinning pinchers and you think, \\&quot;I don&#x27;t really want to put this on my face\\&quot; but just try it and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised.  I use this on my chin and under my chin and a little on my neck and even on those practically invisible hairs on the cheek and side burn area, and this device takes care of both the course and finer hairs.  Make sure the side with the light is facing outward (so you can see it in the mirror),  common sense and in the instructions but I didn&#x27;t get it at first.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> This is the first electric shaver I purchased, hoping that it would work better than a regular shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For legs: A regular shaver removes leg hair VERY quickly. One glide, and the hair&#x27;s gone, right? With the electric shaver, I have to focus on running the machine over certain patches of hair, usually a couple of times, to get all the hair out. Which is okay, I guess...just takes a LOT longer. With a regular shaver, I took five to ten minutes maybe. With this, I take hours. I should probably point out that I am crazy when it comes to finding and getting rid of each individual leg hair. That being said, I usually go back to find that there are some hairs that I just didn&#x27;t see earlier with this electric shaver. So, the electric shaver isn&#x27;t as smooth a shave as a Razor. At least it doesn&#x27;t cut my legs, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For underarms: I&#x27;ll start by saying that I prefer the electric shaver for underarms. It&#x27;s pretty easy. I might have to go over them a couple of times, but that&#x27;s okay. It also eliminates the hairs pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pain of this electric shaver depends on the length of the hairs. The longer the hairs, the more it hurts. When I&#x27;m trying to remove stubble, though, it barely hurts. Which brings me on to my next point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe that the product details for this electric shaver claimed that a person can go six weeks without having to shave again. This person must have magical hairs, then, because I find that stubble grows back within the next couple of days, which is, I guess, better than a regular shaver&#x27;s standard of lasting one day. *And no, I don&#x27;t immediately electrically shave the next day, because if I did, I believe the hairs would grow back even more quickly.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To conclude, I find a Razor to be much easier than an electric shaver. It&#x27;s just that the electric shaver DOES seem to rip from the roots, which I like for underarm shaving. If anyone who has already tried this product, and felt that it deserved more than three stars, and that anything I&#x27;ve written here is in any way untrue, please reply and tell me what I&#x27;m doing wrong!!!</li>
            <li> So, this is my first epilator and I have to say, I wish I would&#x27;ve bought it years ago. I bought it because I have extremely sensitive skin and wanted to try a new option. I always end up with itchy razor bumps from shaving, no matter what products I used afterwards (like Bikini Zone, helped a lil, but I still had itchy, red annoying bumps) or how long I let my skin soak before shaving. All the hair removal creams, even the ones for sensitive skin, burned my skin or wouldn&#x27;t remove all the hair. I had similar problems with waxing, not to mention that it is expensive for a professional wax and messy and time consuming to wax at home.  With the epilator I have no razor bumps or irritated skin at all, which I never thought possible!!    Of course, it is not pain-free, but I didn&#x27;t find it to be intolerable and I don&#x27;t consider myself to have a high pain tolerance. What helped me the first time is that I didn&#x27;t do my entire leg at once.  The first time I touched the epilator to my leg, it really hurt, so I didn&#x27;t torture myself, I just did part of my leg and started with areas that are less sensitive. For some reason it hurt A LOT less just by giving myself a little break. I also noticed that it stopped hurting after the first time, so if you can make it past that, you&#x27;re golden! As for me, I&#x27;m using everywhere, including underarms and bikini area and I have only had the thing for a few weeks, so I think once you get used to the feeling, it really isn&#x27;t that bad.  I also find the sort of vibration from the motor feels nice on the skin and helps alleviate pain.   Just a few things..  It takes time to epilate correctly and you do have to go over areas more than once, but I found that it really helps if you go super slow to allow it to work - it doesn&#x27;t work that great if you try to \\&quot;shave\\&quot; like you would with a razor; you have to go slow. I&#x27;m thinking a bigger epilator with more tweezers might be faster, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on one until I tested it to see if I could tolerate the pain and how my skin would react. Now that I know how much I love epilators, I might invest in one with more tweezers to use on my legs.   It is NOT good for the face. I haven&#x27;t broken out on my face in years, but after going along my chin to get those few strays, I had the worst breakout since 7th grade.. though I didn&#x27;t have this reaction on my upper lip, so it could just be my sensitive skin.   The contour of the epilator is makes it comfortable to hold, but I found it a bit difficult to get areas where skin isn&#x27;t flat.. for lack of better description.. like around the knees and ankles. This could be just me getting used to an epilator though.  Even though it says it lasts for weeks, I&#x27;ve been using it just about every day. This way, I never have the \\&quot;virgin\\&quot; experience again and can get any little hairs that were missed or have grown. Hair grows in cycles so if you use it often, you will only have a few hairs and won&#x27;t even notice any pain or discomfort in removing them.  It can cause ingrowns, just like shaving or waxing or any other hair removal technique. I dry exfoliate before my shower and after my shower I use tea tree oil and coconut oil, which makes my skin super soft and helps prevent ingrowns.   Overall I think this is a great product &amp; I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> While the product is exactly as shown and does exactly what it says it will do - the key to your happiness with this product is to pay attention to the reviews.  Important to actually pay attention when a review says it hurts, becuase, it hurts.  This is the first time I have ever used one of these products and while I did read the reviews about the pain, I blew it off, I mean really how much could it hurt.  Well, actually, alot.  If you can&#x27;t take a fair amount of pain then do not try this product.  I tried it out on my mother first and she thought I was mad at her for some reason.  I used it one time on me and now it is packed away.</li>
            <li> I got this epilator a couple of months ago and waited to write my review. Here&#x27;s what I discoverd:  1. It was painful especially on my legs as I had never waxed them before. But now it is not bad at all as the hairs do come back in finer and you get used to it. I also use this on my underarms and bikini and it works great.  2. Make sure you exfoliate!!!!I had a big problem again on my legs pretty much only with red bumps and ingrown hairs. After speaking to my mom (who is an esthitician) she recomended using a product call Tend Skin. There is also another one called Solution 2 that I found that works well also. If you exfoliate and use either one of those products and can stand some pain initially it is definately worth it to have such smooth skin with no stubble and save your time and money from having to wax. By the way you can get either one of those products on Amazon. Hope this helps..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a problem with thick, coarse hair on my upper lip, jawline, chin, and neck. I&#x27;ve been going to an electrologist since high school, but she moved away several months ago and I haven&#x27;t found another that I really like. I saw the Emjoy AL-10LR and decided to try it after reading the reviews and comparing it to other similar products.    I have to say it was money well spent. I can&#x27;t comment on how well it works on legs, bikini area, underarms, etc. as I don&#x27;t plan to use it on those areas. But for my problem areas, it works wonderfully. Of course it hurts, but not as much as most electrologists do, and it&#x27;s a small price to pay for good hair removal. I&#x27;ve always taken ibuprofen before my appointments and took it before using the Emjoi, and the pain is quite bearable and doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.    I highly recommend this product if you want to remove hair on your upper lip/chin/jaw/neck area and don&#x27;t mind mind a little discomfort.    (This is my first Amazon review so be nice! ;-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used an epilator until I bought the Emjoi Light Caress Cord &amp; cordless.  I received my Emjoi, read the intrustions, then proceeded to work on my upper lip.  What a breeze.  No pain, just a slight pulling sensation.  I didn&#x27;t prepare my upper lip by washing or exfoliating -- just went to work on the upper lip.  The Emjoi is SO much easier than plucking individul hairs with tweezers, which is VERY painful.  That&#x27;s how I used to remove the hair from my upper lip - Never Again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used the Emjoi on my legs without any pain, just great results.  My skin wasn&#x27;t pulled and the Emjoi just glided over the skin on my legs, gently removing the hair as I proceeded.  Next I will try the Emjoi on my armpits.  I don&#x27;t foresee any problems - but do hold the skin taut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I ever need another epilator, I will look to Emjoi.</li>
            <li> This product was very painful and did not remove the hairs well. I ended up purchasing a Remington Silk Epil 5 for legs and body and I love it.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator. Wow! So simple to use and less messy than waxing. I&#x27;m Irish with coarse black hair and this has had no problem removing hair from my lower leg and face (haven&#x27;t tried any place else yet) Easy to clean and the storage bag rocks!!!</li>
            <li> This device is great--I highly recommend it for keeping underarms smooth.  I&#x27;ve found that when I use it on my legs, a week later I&#x27;ve got a bunch of ingrown hairs, especially around my knees.  I think the hairs grow back a bit quicker than waxing as well, but it is super-easy and a lot less painful than waxing.</li>
            <li> I used to use  Nair but I started breaking out in a rash after using it.  Then I started shaving, which I hated because I would get stubble in less than 24hours and it drove me crazy.  Then I started waxing.  The results were okay, but the mess and the contortionist moves I would have to do to wax myself was terrible.  Not to mention I couldn&#x27;t wax my bikini line because I would always mess up and end up yanking my skin with the hair (OW!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did try an epilator briefly after the Nair reaction.  That was about 6 years ago.  I bought an Epilady Legend Plus.  It was crap.  It didn&#x27;t pull hair out, but it certainly hurt.  I threw it out.  I was scared to try an epilator again because of that experience.  I bit the bullet and bought this after research.  I was scare out of my mind about the \\&quot;IT HURTS!\\&quot; reviews.  I was startled to find that it isn&#x27;t that bad!  For me it was very much the \\&quot;prickling\\&quot; sensation described in the manual.  I had both my legs done in 20mins and wow are they smooth.  I decided I wanted to play with my newfound gadget longer so I used it on my arms which are covered in peach fuzz that I was too scared to shave for fear of coarseness.  WOW!  I&#x27;m not even red nor did I take aspirin ahead of time.  I did tempt it on my bikini line.  Yeah, that was when I decided aspirin is a good idea after all.  But it yanked those hairs out no problem with a few spots that seemed to slow down the epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gross part was when I opened up the cover to clean it out with the included brush.  It was slightly more difficult than I thought it would be because I expected dry hair, not dry hair with roots attached that clung to everything.  I should also add that a few times my fingers slipped because I was trying to get at the back of my legs and I didn&#x27;t have any ill effect.  And I don&#x27;t know why they bother with two settings, I went straight to \\&quot;2\\&quot; which is the faster mode.  I tried low and fast on my arms and by far faster is better as far aspain goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hoping that over time this will help get rid of the black spots on my legs from hairs that grew very coarse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it WORKS.</li>
            <li> Okay, maybe I was expecting to much, but apparently there is nothing caressing about a hair removal system. It left my leg with red bumps and in pain, the hair was gone but it looked so ugly that I wouldn&#x27;t dare show my leg!! I can&#x27;t say this product doesn&#x27;t remove the hair, but don&#x27;t be fooled it does hurt!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using epilators to remove hair on my legs, bikini area, and arm pits for about 10 years.  I  have generally needed to replace my epilators about every 2-3 years - this is my fourth one.  It&#x27;s the best so far.  it is cordless - very convenient - without sacrificing power. The light is a very convenient feature.  The only downside to this particular unit is occasionally, if I am working on an area with loose skin, it will catch the skin if I don&#x27;t pull it taut (as the directions tell me to).  The epilator is quiet, and I don&#x27;t find it to be painful at all - even when it catches my skin.  Overall, I am very, very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let EMJOY scare you away from using this for smooth cheeks and chin, ladies. I have been using EMJOY epilators on my face for 12+ years, with no ill effects. I used to spend 15 min on average tweezing dark and/or heavy hairs several times a week. With the machine it takes a few minutes twice a week and I cover more of my face in that time. I just bought my third one. The first one was not rechargeable and the adapter gave up the ghost. The second was rechargeable - love it  - and seemed that the battery wasn&#x27;t holding a charge well after about 5 years. So I went with the EMJOY Caress Light. Don&#x27;t waste money buying this model with the light - it&#x27;s useless - get the plain Caress ! The device works great and is comfortable in the hand. I have never used it anywhere else on my body.</li>
            <li> So I previously gave this one star because I wasn&#x27;t angling it correctly to pick up the hairs. I eventually got the hang of it. It does save you time rather than individually plucking your hair or taking time out of your schedule to get it waxed. The battery does run out pretty quickly so it doesn&#x27;t have enough power as I would like so I always have it plugged into an outlet.</li>
            <li> The tweezer discs are recessed into the appliance so much that they don&#x27;t reach the hair. This product doesn&#x27;t work and is entirely useless. I have not had this problem with an epilator before.</li>
            <li> I got the Emjoi on the recommendation of my cousin who was telling me how great it worked. I tried an Epilady 20+ years ago and swore I would never try something like that again, but this time it was a totally different experience. I Love this product and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the second epilator that I have ever used.  Many years ago I purchased one, but did not use it very long as it was pretty painful.  This paticular model is not totally painless, but it is much better than my first one.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this and have recommened it to my daughter and daughter-in-law.</li>
            <li> I am a woman cursed with medium to heavy hair in small patches around my chin. I usually shave these areas but had recently noticed a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow effect showing up during my day. This was not okay with me so I did my research and ended up purchasing the Emjoi AP-10LR Light Caress. So far I am very pleased. I wish that I had had the patience to have a professional waxing and then just use the epilator on the new growth as other users have suggested. I was just too excited and tried it out right away. I used the product and it worked as described. The sound of those little tweezers spinning can be a bit intimidating but the only way to get past that is to just use it. The pain can be a little intense (especially on the face) but not much more irritating than waxing in the long run. I took special care to exfoliate before and after. I also steamed my pores open to help lessen the pain before removal. All in all the results are as I had hoped. My skin is smooth to the touch and I don&#x27;t feel as self-conscious. The convenience of having a corded/cordless product is also a thumbs up in my book. I can truly use it anywhere.  My only complaint is the light. This version has a light on it to supposedly make seeing the smaller hairs easier. The light is not very powerful or useful in my opinion. Had I known that I would have probably gone with an unlighted version to save a couple bucks.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle device and thought that some reviews may have been over the top, but this product is amazing! I will not lie, it hurts on the first and second treatments, but after that it&#x27;s a breeze!! Nothing us women can&#x27;t handle! I use this on my legs and it works fantastic. However, I tried under the arms and I would NOT recommend it unless you are tolerate to a lot of pain! I haven&#x27;t shaved since I received this and have I used the product every other day for a week. It has been almost a week since I have done anything, and my legs are still smoother than the first hour of the old shaving!! I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I have been epilating for almost 6 months now with a less expensive epilator and i wanted to treat myself to a new (and improved) one. I was very disappointed! I had to go over each area numerous times before the epilator actually caught the hair and it was very hard to clean. some pluses this had over my old epilator is a great battery life and built it light. Either way- i&#x27;m back to my old one :(</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t remove hair as well as wax.  The company&#x27;s service is excellent.</li>
            <li> Have purchased and used for very long time.  Bought one for mom who loves it and uses it in place of tweezer.  Is much better than new model and seems to work more efficiently.  Batty died after about year and a half on first one but well worth the investment for facial, hand, feel and back use.</li>
            <li> I must say that it is not a joy as I found it to be a bit painful and time consuming.  I hope it will not be as painful as I continue to use it.  I do like the way it makes my legs smooth.  The hair does not grow back in a stubble.</li>
            <li> After regularly waxing, this product was a breath of fresh air. Painless, no mess, fast and easy to use everywhere. I learned of it from a french exchange student, it is primarily what they use in Europe. I can&#x27;t believe it is not more popular. It may take some getting used to especially if you don&#x27;t wax regularly. I recommend having a couple waxing sessions before you start, the only time you will have pain is from the thicker stubble hair. The hair grows slowly back very fine.  The Emjoi is extremely comfortable to hold and use all over. And the fact that it is rechargeable is invaluable compared to having a cord. It is compact, easy to travel with, take it anywhere. It has two powerful settings, and after some shopping around this has the best comfort, power, and convenience of all hair removers. This is a great product and makes it so easy and painless to have silky smooth skin everywhere, all the time. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Works really well. I had an Emjoi epilator before that lasted a long time. The only complain I have about this model is that I wish there was a way to shut off that light. Sometimes it can annoy you. But other than that I am pretty happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd cordless Emjoi in 10 years and I&#x27;ll never go back to shaving my legs every other day. There&#x27;s no coarse stubble, the hair grows much more slowly and I only have to epilate once a week. It might seem uncomfortable for the first couple of times, but after awhile your skin gets used to it and you don&#x27;t get the rashy looking little red bumps.  I highly recommend it for busy women who want to be well-groomed without spending hours at it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product quite a few times.  It works really well.  I have had no problems so far.  The light does help to see little hairs, but I can see how it may annoy some people.  I definately recommend exfoliating, it does help a lot.  As far as pain goes, of course it will hurt...you are pulling hair out of your body.  The question is, does it hurt so much that you cannot use this product?  NO, it doesn&#x27;t, and the more you use it, the more tolerant you will become. What I like most is that this product does not lose power once uncorded.  Hope this helps  Anne</li>
            <li> This is the second gentle caress model I&#x27;ve had. I had the first one for a few years. I bought this one because I wanted the new design.  &lt;br /&gt;It removes all the hair quickly. It removes the tiniest of stubble leaving soft, smooth skin. I couldn&#x27;t live without mine. I especially like the fact that you can use this one with the cord or keep it charged up and go cordless. I use to wax, and this is a lot less painful and messy. It&#x27;s no problem doing underarms or bikini line. Skin stays hairless for weeks, and I am a person who has to shave every day if I use a razor. I have thick, black hair that cream hair removers do not even work on. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> This is my third epilator and my second Emjoi. (The first one still works after six years; I bought the second one for the vacation home.) Epilating hurts more than shaving, but compared to the other brands out there, this epilator is much more smooth against the skin. Thus, I found it easier to use on the bikini area. The fact that you can charge it and use it cordless is also plus, but the light on this device (and on others) really isn&#x27;t that much of a benefit.     The advantage that the other brand had was that it had an interchangeable head that allowed me to trim or shave instead of epilating - which was a really nice feature to have.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for a long time so there is no discomfort any more. Not for wimps. If you are a shaver it will take some getting used to - but worth it - no stubble - I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Love my epilator - the last one i had was a braun and i bought it about 10 years back. I didn&#x27;t realize the newer ones are so effective and much better speed and comfort wise. I like my emjoi so far! I haven&#x27;t used a newer braun so i cannot compare but this one is quite good!</li>
            <li> This product is actually quite good. Originally, as soon as I used it for the first time, I had a terrible experience. It is lacking a protective barrier between the tweezers and your skin... Other brands, like the Braun Silk-Epil have massaging rollers, that make sure that the tweezers are kept at a safe distance from the skin and can pull out the hair when it is smaller than with the Emjoi. Unfortunately, on my first try, I used it under my arms hoping for the same results I had gotten used to with my Braun epilator... the Emjoi burnt my skin as the rollers continued rotating and pulling at my skin without pulling out the hairs. This was very frustrating... After not being able to put my arms down comfortably for two days, I decided to let those hairs grow longer, as well as the leg hair... I used the epilator in cordless mode to epilate my legs, it only lasted about 10 min, before losing charge and slowing down to where the tweezing head would not rotate any more... I bought this machine because it was cordless and would provide flexibility... yet it did not even epilate a whole leg before the previously fully charged battery died. Although it does not deliver on the cordless usage capacity, it still works great at removing hair once it is at a proper length, and the addition of the light helps pick out hairs more easily and see them better under any light conditions... you won&#x27;t miss them as much as with other epilators that do not have this feature... Once you know the specifics on how to use it properly, and in corded mode, this machine can perform great work and help remove all those unwanted hairs efficiently, and with little hair left behind by mistake, and without just cutting them at the root... After all the pain in optimizing how to use it, I give it a 4 out of 5... :)</li>
            <li> I have had several of these - they last a year or two and while they still work at that point, they don&#x27;t work quite as well as they did.  Also they don&#x27;t recharge as well.    That said...  I obviously love this product or why would I keep buying it?  I haven&#x27;t shaved in years.  The people who talked about pain - basically, the first time you use it you usually have a lot of hairs showing.  After the first time, they grow in at different rates and you will have fewer hairs to yank out.  I don&#x27;t notice pain at all - even when I went 4 weeks without using it.  Yes, I had more hairs, but it didn&#x27;t hurt.  I do my underarms and legs, everything.  No big deal.    I do think if you really want to have no hair (and are brunette and fair-skinned, not blonde) you need to do this every week or so.  This is especially true in summer when you wear shorts or bathing suits.  However, you&#x27;ll only have a little hair to remove and it&#x27;s quick.    The hair has not been cut off, so the end is very fine as it grows and it doesn&#x27;t show the way shaving stubble does.    This seems to be the same product that they used to make but they added a little light to it.  It works very well and I have no reason to switch.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement purchase. I have been using this brand of ladies razor for 10 plus years. It works great, I would recommend this to all friends and family. It delivers on its promise to rid body of hair. Very easy to use and clean. A wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely HATE this. Used it once and threw it in a draw; where it will remain before going in the garbage. I got horrible rashes everywhere I used it and the rashes took forever to go away. If you love pain, torture and skin irritation, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> I originally heard about epilators from a YouTube video about a year ago and thought about buying one, but never did because it sounded way too painful. Somehow I heard about them again and decided I needed one because my underarm hair is too dark and I have to shave like every other day. I did not buy this epilator from Amazon, but from another site that had it a little cheaper (about $50). So far, I absolutely love it! I bought it mainly for my underarms but I&#x27;m going to use it on my legs too. I first started using it like a week ago and I started it on the 1st setting and on my leg since I figured that would be less painful. At first it hurt a lot and I thought I would not be able to handle it anymore, but surprisingly after a few seconds you don&#x27;t even feel the pain anymore! Today I used it on my underarms and it went well. I did get them waxed like 2 weeks ago to thin the hair, but this is what I&#x27;m going to use for now on. the skin was a little red and sore for a little while but not as much as when I got waxed. Long story short...buy it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really recommend for because it doesn&#x27;t work very will as you expect. The short hair can&#x27;t remove by Emjoi.</li>
            <li> Useful. WILL give ingrown hairs if not extremely meticulous...and maybe even then.&lt;br /&gt;Use only for bikini line and arm pits after failed attempts to keep ingrown hairs from my legs.&lt;br /&gt;Like the light and the cleaning brush and the scrubber</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used epilators for 20+ years and this is the worst I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I had a small braun silk-epil for the last 4 years or so, and it finally got a little &amp;#34;tired&amp;#34; so I decided to replace it.  The new braun models seemed to have way too many bells and whistles for my taste.  I didn&#x27;t want to buy the same old braun model as the one I had owned, but rather decided to try something new.  Well, it turns out it was a bad idea.  This little emjoy gave me skin rashes, if you press it on the skin it stops running, if you don&#x27;t press it, it glides 1mm-2mm above the skin and it doesn&#x27;t grab the hairs.  Worst of all, it grabbed my skin in a few places and left me with nasty bruises.  I wish I could return it, but I can&#x27;t.  Sadly, it&#x27;s going in the garbage.</li>
            <li> This is my second epilator and I like them very much. They are easy to use and pull the hair out fast.</li>
            <li> Have only used this product twice since purchasing, but very pleased so far.  I own another older model and this one has more tweezers and seems to have been improved.  I found it much easier to remove the hair on both legs, bikini area and under arms. The added light is very small, and I first viewed it as a gimmick, but it actually does help to see missed areas.  I couldn&#x27;t get the added top piece to fit, but don&#x27;t find it necessary.    I was going to consider a Braun model, but was disturbed about all the ingrown hair problems people talked about with that manufacturer&#x27;s products.  This has not been an issue with me with this or my previous model of Emjoi, so decided to stick with what I know.</li>
            <li> Just be aware that it will hurt the first time you use it.  The battery is pretty good, I charge it every two weeks.  Then again, I use it three times a week for less than 15 min.  I do like the fact that its not cordless because I can always connect it in case it has low battery.  I&#x27;ve had this epilator for over a year and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> Let me begin by saying I&#x27;m the type who gets a Brazilian done regularly. I also have a couple of tattoos, so I&#x27;m not afraid of a little pulling and tugging on my legs. This Emoji, once you get used to it, doesn&#x27;t really hurt to much. Yes, you can feel it prickling the skin- but it ends up hurting less and less as you continue to use it. So that&#x27;s a plus, especially for beginners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars is for it&#x27;s ability to actually grab my hairs. I promise I can sit over one area for a good couple of minutes and it&#x27;s only grabbing one or two. I am constantly go back over patches that should&#x27;ve been gone 5 minutes ago. That part is extremely frustrating. I&#x27;m just like grab the dang hairs emoji!! Also, the contour shape- I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m a fan. I&#x27;m finding it really hard to get my knees done with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, not a bad product. But it can certainly be time consuming and annoyingly so at some points. If this isn&#x27;t your first time with an epilator- I&#x27;d suggest going for a super strength one.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really pull the hairs it just pluck maybe a couple after a went over that same area over 6 times slowly and it REALLY HURTS</li>
            <li> priced well. shipped well</li>
            <li> This product works great! I have had a couple before epilators that have died. Each have been worth their weight in gold. It keeps my legs smooth for weeks on end. This product was fast, easy to use, and is less painful. I can get the job done much faster and with great results!</li>
            <li> I really love this epilator. I usually wax, but even after waxing, there&#x27;s normally a few rogue hairs that always are left behind.  Instead of tweezing them all individually, I bought this.  I&#x27;m not going to lie; the first time I used it, it wasn&#x27;t the best feeling in the world.  However, it wasn&#x27;t so painful that I felt the need to stop.  Just know that the other reviews aren&#x27;t lying-- the more you use it, the less painful it becomes.  I can now use it whenever I see a stray hair, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt one bit.  The results are so long lasting (close to a month) that I actually just epilate under my underarms now instead of waxing.  It takes half the time, and the results last just as long as waxing, without all the mess.  It&#x27;s also extremely helpful because my hair grows in multiple directions, so waxing usually wouldn&#x27;t get them all unless I went over the same section 4-5 times, which would then pull off my skin.  But with the epilator, all I do is switch the direction I&#x27;m going and I can go over the same section several times.  It also doesn&#x27;t leave my skin red or inflamed like waxing and even shaving did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other thing to add is that the one I received isn&#x27;t red like in the picture; it&#x27;s more of a hot pink color.  But, it had everything listed in the picture and I like pink, so no complaints here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just so everyone knows, I haven&#x27;t ever used another model/brand, so I can&#x27;t say for certainty that there isn&#x27;t a better epilator out there.  But with how well this one works, I don&#x27;t see the need to try to find it!</li>
            <li> Product arrived in good condition &amp; on time. If you&#x27;re not use to waxing, or using an epilator, then your first time will be, depending on your pain threshold, just a little uncomfortable to \\&quot;OMG! WHAT I&#x27;M I DOING!!!\\&quot;. I have been waxing for over 20 years on my legs &amp; bikini area, so I&#x27;m use to the feeling of ripping out hairs by the roots. (That last part sounds worse than it really is.) The underarms was a new area for hair removal for me,(usually just shave the pits) so it did make me have goosebumps. After just a couple of minutes the feeling was the same as doing my legs or bikini area. The light is very helpful in getting the finer hairs; also the dual speed really helps getting the fine &amp; courser hairs.</li>
            <li> Loved this product! First time epilating hurt a lot, so be prepared. But this device did a great job getting into the grove of things. The buffer pad is a must for anyone using any epilator. I didn&#x27;t use the rubber glide ever.</li>
            <li> This item is amazing works like a charm! Definitely would recommend! Great buy. Does exactly what it states.....buy it now!</li>
            <li> I have been using epilators for about 10 years now and have tried many different brands. This emjoi is the fastest and picks up the most hair per minute out of any brand. My older version I have had for years and its still working! Do not try the emjoi emagine as its slow and doesn&#x27;t pick up the hair. This one is the best on the market to date!</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this purchase. I keep wondering why I didn&#x27;t buy one years ago. I have to say I would definitely recommend this product to others. I have been telling all my friends about it.   Its not a product for those who can&#x27;t tolerate some pain. Yes it hurts the first time but after that its nothing. I can use my epilator now and not feel a thing. When you use the epilator your hair will grow back softer and finer and therefore hair removal is less painful. I have done my arms, underarms, stomach, legs and pubic area and am baby smooth and soft. It has also helped me get rid of my dark underarms which is not sexy at all. Buy this product you will love it.</li>
            <li> OK, it does hurt at first.  Bad.  Really bad.  Getting around my ankles was extremely painful.  However, it totally works.  If you can get through the first time, you&#x27;ll be golden.  I use it on my armpits and they turn out nice and smooth.  I never had the courage to try my bikini area so can&#x27;t speak to that but I&#x27;m guessing it works just as good as the rest of my body.  My only complaint is that even though I charged it overnight before using it the first time, I was never able to go cordless.  I probably should have exchanged it for another one but I just didn&#x27;t want the hassle.  Using it with the cord is no big deal.</li>
            <li> I think it is great for the armpits and bikini line but the other reviewers are right when they say it is very painful for legs and for this reason I am not giving five stars. You may know this but definitely do not use it on your face at all, I dared to try it on my chin and got a little cut that left a scar that took months to fade away.</li>
            <li> This epilator is the first one I have ever used or bought. Read reviews online so decided to try it out. I love it. I use it mostly on my arms and underarms, but Im not brave enough to do it on my legs yet..It does hurt at first. It has cut the occasional hair but most of the time it pulls all of them out pretty good. I have gotten pinched with it twice in the underarm area but it doesnt hurt at all. Just kind of scares you..haha. This seems to happen when the skin is too moist. They tell you to use it after the shower but i have to wait till my skin gets really dry before using it. It is a bit loud but not really a problem for me. The reason I didnt give it five stars is that the battery on mine seems to go out quick. I mostly use it plugged in anyway though so its not too big of a deal. I love the light it has and that it fits in my hand. I would definantly recommend this product. I will never shave my arms again!</li>
            <li> when i first got the epilator it came with directions which were easy to follow. The main reason i got this product was for my bikini line. Waxing hurt and shaving never lasted. At first the epilator was a little intimidating with the spinning head and buzzing noise but once i used it i was very satisfied with the results. It does take some time to get every hair but the pain is nothing compared to waxing and it is definitely not as messy. Hair does go everywhere but its easy to clean compared to sticky wax. over all the cordless/corded aspect is perfect for travel and at home use. It comes with a nice exfoliator to prevent ingrown hairs and was worth the money.</li>
            <li> I agonized over which epilator to get. I&#x27;m new to this but I wanted something better than shaving. Waxing hurt and left my underarms raw. I talked to someone who has used this model for two years and she loves it. I didn&#x27;t want to pay a lot for something I might not even use, but the price for this one was very reasonable so I decided to try it. I love it! I really think the pain factor is grossly blown out of proportion. It&#x27;s much less painful than waxing, and that&#x27;s only a concern the first time you use it. The best description I&#x27;ve read aptly describes the sensation as thousands of tiny electrical shocks all at once. Believe it or not, NOT a bad feeling! I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> The Emjoi works well for hair removal.  I like that it has a light so that hair is easier to see.  The cord for it is a decent length.  The negatives are that it barely holds a charge and I need to keep it plugged in the whole time and that it&#x27;s really loud.  It&#x27;s painful but what hair removal product isn&#x27;t?</li>
            <li> This is the best emjoi I have owned. It works so much better, and there is hardly any pain. Much smoother results too!</li>
            <li> Day 1 with Epilator- turned the thing on, turned it off and walked away.Too intimidated. Especially after watching demo&#x27;s of girls epilating on youtube..with lots of painful facial expressions.   Day 2 with Epilator- rubbed on numbing cream on legs, turned it on again, put it 10 inches away from my skin, turned it off and walked away.  Day 3 with Epilator- looked at the scary little tweezer monster..wimped out for the 3rd time.   Day 4 with Epilator- Tweezed hairs off of one leg with a regular tweezer to get adjusted to the feeling.  Day 5 with Epilator- Watched my boyfriend epilate the hair off of his hands.  Day 6 with Epilator- If my sissy boyfriend can do it, so can i! Turned it on and ran it across one of my legs on the highest speed. LITTLE PINCHES?! Really? That&#x27;s all? I waited to the 6th day for little pinches on my legs?  Advice: Don&#x27;t let the hair on your legs get too long before you use this. It will sting more than a prickly pinch feeling. See for yourself by trimming a hair and epilating it, and then epilating a longer hair. This baby can get really short hairs. Be sure to use it everyday, to get adjusted to the feeling. &amp; remember you control the stopping point, if its too painful for you, turn it off and come back to it later. Motivate yourself! Your saving money on razors, no stubble, razor bumps, razor burns, nicks, cuts. You can go longer with smooooothe legs. Why not?  I use Gigi Post Epilation Lotion right after, makes my legs feel all silkyyy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for over a year and I love it. The only downside is that it loses it&#x27;s charge very fast. I actually keep the AC adapter nearby on a shelf so I can have it plugged in while using it. If you charge it for a day and then use it, as soon as you unplug it, you notice a difference. It&#x27;s not that big of a difference, but I prefer the tweezers to spin as fast as possible; I find that&#x27;s best for me. So a slight difference in speed does make a difference to me. Maybe not to you though, so I do recommend this epilator. It gets the job done and I&#x27;ve only had it pinch my armpit skin a handful of times; my own fault for not waiting until my skin was 1000% dry and pulled tight.</li>
            <li> works well, hurts a little but it works</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my step mother, and when she used it on her face it did not remove the hair and actually scraped and cut her chin. It stated it was for facial hair removal, but left the hair and removed the skin. Would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have had this for a week now and, so far, I really like it! I started out on my legs just to get a feel for it and I was surprised that it wasn&#x27;t painful. It kind of feels like the prickly sensation you get when your leg goes numb except it&#x27;s just in the area you&#x27;re working on, not the whole leg. It did take some time to get both legs done (an hour maybe) and I did have to touch up a few times; I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s because I missed some or just because hairs grow at different rates.&lt;br /&gt;Because it went so well with my legs I moved on up to my bikini area. I have to let you know (1) this is the real reason I bought this; for my bikini area, (2) I have thick dark hair down there, and (3) I have a pretty good tolerance for pain. At first it hurt! and I only got done with half but over the course of 2 more days I finished; now there&#x27;s no hair (yes, no hair at all) around my lady parts. And I have to say it does get easier and it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Things you might want to consider if you are going to use this on your bikini area and underarms (I haven&#x27;t tried my underarms)...&lt;br /&gt;1. buy Emjoi After Epilation Cream With Hair Growth Inhibitor-  it feels so much better after you put this on&lt;br /&gt;2. It would probably be very smart to have someone wax you first then use this as the hairs grow back&lt;br /&gt;3. If you can&#x27;t do #2, and you want to get rid of all your hair, try to get your hands on some numbing cream. From what I&#x27;ve read online, you need a prescription to get the stuff that really works but please do your own research, as I am not a doctor!&lt;br /&gt;As time goes on I will try to remember to update this.</li>
            <li> I tried using this on my legs and underarms several times but it was much too painful for me.  I have found it useful for the hairs along my jawline and on my upper lip.  Perhaps because it is a smaller surface area and the hairs are finer, the pain is much more tolerable.  I am happy with this product for that purpose.</li>
            <li> Ok, aside from the cheesy title! I really do enjoy this product! I heard about the emjoi epilator through a youtube makeup artist guru. My main use for the epilator is for my underarm hairs. At first I was a bit skeptical but I have tried everything to get rid of my underarm hair, I loved the results from waxing, but it can get really messy and you need more than just a few minutes to wax your underarm hair. I hated plucking my underarm hair one by one because not only did it strained my neck and eyes, it was definitely time consuming! Before this epilator, I would shave my underarm hair every morning and the hair would always grow back by the end of the day, which left my underarms with a grayish dark color due to the hairs underneath the surface of my underarm. After being introduced to this epilator, I was so amazed with the results! You can really see the difference and also feel the difference, my underarm is a lot more smoother not having to deal with the underneath surface hair poking out from shaving. I absolutely loved it, it felt a bit weird at first when using due to the plucking of the hair, but it didn&#x27;t hurt as much (disclaimer: I tolerate pain well). All in all, I would definitely recommend this product! Very handy, cute, and it works! I also love how it comes with a light and the pink/salmon color is cute.</li>
            <li> I think this Emjoi works great, although it seems it could hold a charge a little longer.  All you have to do is plug it in then and can use it fully charged that way.</li>
            <li> So bad news... using this hurts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good news.... no worse than waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also good news.  It&#x27;s a fraction of the cost of waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light, easy to use. And effective.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I bought this. I lost the first one. It&#x27;s still worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been epilating with the same epilator for about 5 years and just got this new one because I needed something that could be used when not plugged in. I was very happy when I first used this product and found out that it not only stays fully charged through at least one full epilating (legs, bikini, arm pits), but also worked much more quickly and was less painful than my old epilator.  I also think that so far I have gotten less ingrown hairs than usual using this product. I recommend it completely.</li>
            <li> Just more maintenance that I don&#x27;t really want to do......The product works, but you have to go back over again....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few kinds of epilators in the last 27 yrs.  This is my second Caress. I like that the head is slanted so you can get the hard to reach spots.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt &amp; get most hairs in one or two swipes.This time I got the rechargable so i didn&#x27;t have to sit in one spot. Def worth it for the money. Also customer service is great. My charger didn&#x27;t work right, didn&#x27;t give me enough power so I called the company &amp; they sent me a new one that I received in a couple days.</li>
            <li> The product is not the best to say the least. It doesn&#x27;t reach very well an it misses a lot so it takes a long time to do the job. Plus it is so loud - like a lawnmower loud😞. Shipping was sloooow. FedEx is slower than USPS. Will keep it because do not want to deal with return . Did not get an invoice in the shipping.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Epilation hurts at least until you are used to it.  The Emoji works great and I can barely feel it.  Yes there are the occasional hairs that do hurt but this isn’t anything like my former epilator.  I would consider reordering this when the time comes.</li>
            <li> My friend uses an epilator and insisted I should try it. So, I searched around the internet and settled on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After owning it for about a year, it is noticibly less powerful when not plugged in and running, more so than I recall it being when new. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because the battery life has worn down, or if it has something to do with me usually using it while plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, it works great and gets the job done. It hurts to use, but all epilators do I am told, and with time you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I notice that when I use the epilator, the skin in my underarms lightens to its normal shade (It tends to darken when I shave). My underarms have never looked so good. I never used to want to wear sleeveless tops because I was always self-conscious of it, but now it&#x27;s no problem!</li>
            <li> I had one before about twenty years.  Decided it was time to get a new one as the one I had was starting to go slow.  I would recommend it and hopefully this will last as long as my first one.  This one is lighter and more slim.  Guess you could say I may have had the antique.</li>
            <li> Oh gosh it&#x27;s painful!!!!!!!!!! I have a high tolerance for pain but this is like torture lol it&#x27;s better to have purchased a laser hair removal package or just wax but this thing pulls out hair one by one ( sometimes doesn&#x27;t even pull out but cuts in half) pinches skin all the time. The ouch factor doesn&#x27;t make this product worth it</li>
            <li> I love this epilator!  I did a lot of online research before choosing the one I wanted, and this epilator has exceeded my expectations.  I don&#x27;t shave my legs anymore and they look great!</li>
            <li> I received my Emjoi Epilator, Emjoi AP-10LR Light Caress, Cordless / Corded within 3 days after ordering. Shipping was so quick and easy. As soon as I received it, I plugged it in and tried the epilator. It works really well and took all the hair out from it&#x27;s roots! I highly recommend this product to everyone. The pain is not that bad at all, it just feels like little pins in the beginning but you quickly get used to it. I highly recommend this product to all looking for a great epilator!</li>
            <li> I ordered this on Friday and received it Monday. Excellent seller! I was so afraid to use this from everything I had read. I&#x27;m not going to lie, it hurts but it is bearable. My skin is so smooth. I am really glad I bought this. I love the fact that it can be used either corded or cordless.</li>
            <li> this product hurt too bad to use and would not even pull all the hair out.  now i have spent all this money on something that left a rash on my calf and under thigh.  maybe other people might like this product...i just didn&#x27;t have a good experience with it.</li>
            <li> I only use an epilator for my underarms and this thing sucks horribly.  It&#x27;s curved perfectly for legs but since underarms curve in not out like your legs its difficult to get this to grab my hairs.  With my previous epilator I was done in a minute.  With this one I have to play around with the angle to get the hairs and if I press down it stops the blades.</li>
            <li> What would I do with out this device?  Do not ever want to find out!!</li>
            <li> This thing hurts horribly. No thanx. Even on the legs it hurts. And dont even think about arm pits. NOO..</li>
