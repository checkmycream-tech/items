    <ol>
            <li>;-  Best of luck and stay beautiful!</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>I have to say; this product is wonderful for my skin.  </li>
            <li>AND IT IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>The results are not that great every day but there is still an improvement over time as well.</li>
            <li>With how great the cost was, I figured I&#x27;d have nothing to lose if it didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>The surface of my skin is smoother, looks healthier and I am incredibly happy.  </li>
            <li>Really great product.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as the XL version.</li>
            <li>I love the lip products from this line and this creme is good too!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say the &amp;#34;just like botox&amp;#34; claim is true, nothing works as good as botox, but at this price this cream is good!  </li>
            <li>I guess I better stock up !</li>
            <li>but it is a nice gloss so my wifes says.</li>
            <li>The container is a nice size and aesthetically appealing.  </li>
            <li>I love FusionBeauty LiftFusion.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I love the product I used to sell it when I worked for Sephora they carred it ....</li>
            <li>Therefore, we have more surface area for wrinkles and lines.  </li>
            <li>I am giving this 5 stars based upon initial opinion and the impressive ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I buy as many as 30-80 items a month from Amazon using Prime 2 or 1 day shipping UPS.  </li>
            <li>Even when UPS delivers I try and make sure to get the items from the porch  asap , as the deliver person does not ring the bell anymore, just leaves the packages, which is ok.  </li>
            <li>I Love this product .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to find it again</li>
            <li>CAN NOT WAIT TO TRY MORE FUSION ITEMS</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I first usded Lift Fusion in 2007, and though I loved the results, backed off at the $140 price tag..</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed!  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and I can feel it working.  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>We are in the mountains but easily accessible, but that&#x27;s how it is.</li>
            <li>Best of all, in many places (like Amazon, for example) you can purchase it for far less than the original $140 price tag..</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say enough good things about XL LIP FUSION.</li>
            <li>looking at some women&#x27;s hands, they look very aged, and I&#x27;m trying this on my hands, and LOVE the results!!</li>
            <li>This makes a visible difference right away and lasts for hours.  </li>
            <li>It is a pretty good moisturizer for the neck area but other than that, it doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li>First of all, I have to say..</li>
            <li>I think I will save my $ for BOTOX while Mom spends hers on LIFTFUSION ;)</li>
            <li>I am one to try many different products</li>
            <li>It more than worked and I am truly shocked and impressed at how well and how fast this has made a difference in my skin, the texture, and the wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>So many products make the claims their products work, but not all have the ingredients to back it up.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I first used it out of a subscription box and the estimated cost of 140 bucks had me wishing it didn&#x27;t work , but it did.</li>
            <li>I would love to get my money back.</li>
            <li>I first bought the Fusion Primer</li>
            <li>She did not notice much improvement.  </li>
            <li>It really has smoothed my wrinkles</li>
            <li>On a positive note, it didn&#x27;t break out my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This appears to be a high grade product.</li>
            <li>If it actually helps some, it will be worth it.  </li>
            <li>Normally this product cost is around $140.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do as advertised, but for the low price I was willing to try it.</li>
            <li>The one I received is fresh and not old smelling like the one another viewer received.  </li>
            <li>just so others know the smell was exactly the same in the 140 dollar bottle n</li>
            <li>Smooth and less stressful looking hands.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin tight, smooth and glowing.</li>
            <li>It really does diminish those hair line creases we develop above our lips and at the corners of our mouths as we age.</li>
            <li>My only Problam was it was all ready opened and leaked all over the box...</li>
            <li>I am 37 and really hoped this was my answer to future BOTOX.</li>
            <li>, this she thought was much better, and seemed to think it at least had a noticeable  effect.</li>
            <li>Comes off like old makeup. . .</li>
            <li>I think I got an old and expired batch.</li>
            <li>At the young age of 32, I&#x27;ve had several plastic surgeons tell me that my face looks older because of those wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>However, even Botox, particularly when you get to a certain age, needs a little help..</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find it here at this price, but I hope it doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s being discontinued !!</li>
            <li>I have used it only once, so far.  </li>
            <li>It does have a &#x27;different&#x27; scent to it, but not offensive or old smelling.</li>
            <li>I wonder if those who get funny smelling products, if it has to do with the products sitting outside in extreme temperatures for a period of time?  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I tried Fusion Beauty lift for the first time after I had been trying another expensive product, I was greatly surprised but the results!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t smell old, tingles a little, but saw no visible change on my lil wrinkles.</li>
            <li> The  extreme temperatures could affect his product, in a metal container, sitting in a outside PO box when it gets in the 20&#x27;s at night now.</li>
            <li> If there is anyone out there who is educated in this realm, I would appreciate your take on this issue,  if the extreme temperatures really do affect the cosmetic, food, dog food and other products in a negative way.  </li>
            <li> I really do not see that this made any difference.  </li>
            <li> &quot; tall and 1 1/2\\&quot; wide and is 1.7 oz.  </li>
            <li> am including these next few words</li>
            <li> and I ordered the first mentioned one, so I am a little confused on this.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for something to keep the small wrinkles under my eyes from getting bigger...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to say- the containers were not sealed, and there was product dried all over the outside of the packaging, but not much inside.</li>
            <li> DOn&#x27;t hate it, don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> The problem for me with this shipping is that the Carrier does not bring it to my door but delivers it to my box 1/2 mile down the road.  </li>
            <li> I tried it on half of my face, to judge the difference...</li>
            <li> and I purchased it here, on Amazon, for less than 20.00.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Botox done for a little over 11 years now</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money.  </li>
            <li> In the few weeks that I&#x27;ve been using this product, the lines are almost invisible.  </li>
            <li> The thing I am concerned about on all my Amazon USPS shipments is that I am not able to drive down to the box (health problems) sometimes, for 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> (BAD funny) and does not provide the results that the cream is designed to create.</li>
            <li> Not really sure what it is I put on my face.</li>
            <li> the small scent that it does have smells clinical</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it works as promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I swear the half I used it on looked WORSE than the untreated side.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about it.</li>
            <li> Not good at all.</li>
            <li> However, I ordered the product from this seller and whatever is inside the container is terrible - smells funny</li>
            <li> but I really hate dealing with sending products back.....</li>
            <li> so it helps to know the approximate  items get here.  </li>
            <li> Too me, with the Botox, I didn&#x27;t notice anything immediately dramatic.  </li>
            <li> I was not impressed with the result for the price that was paid.</li>
            <li> One of the worst 15$ ever spent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to know.</li>
            <li> The smell is so bad I cannot stand it.  </li>
            <li> Smelled terrible, did nothing for me after 3 weeks and felt slimy.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This can&#x27;t be what they are charging over $100 for? Smelled terrible, did nothing for me after 3 weeks and felt slimy.</li>
            <li> I noticed results from this product immediately!!  The results are not that great every day but there is still an improvement over time as well.</li>
            <li> I love FusionBeauty LiftFusion. However, I ordered the product from this seller and whatever is inside the container is terrible - smells funny (BAD funny) and does not provide the results that the cream is designed to create. Not really sure what it is I put on my face. I&#x27;m afraid to know.</li>
            <li> First of all, I have to say.. I&#x27;ve had Botox done for a little over 11 years now.. am 47, and nothing beats it.  However, even Botox, particularly when you get to a certain age, needs a little help.. it&#x27;s a help, not a miracle! I first usded Lift Fusion in 2007, and though I loved the results, backed off at the $140 price tag.. however, after trying it again recently was astounded by the results.  Too me, with the Botox, I didn&#x27;t notice anything immediately dramatic.  However, in one week of using the product again.. have received multiple compliments, was carded in a restaurant (hey, at 47 that is a big thing!), and now can definitely see a difference.  Best of all, in many places (like Amazon, for example) you can purchase it for far less than the original $140 price tag.. hope they don&#x27;t catch on! ;-  Best of luck and stay beautiful!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to say- the containers were not sealed, and there was product dried all over the outside of the packaging, but not much inside.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for years. I LOVE IT. It really does diminish those hair line creases we develop above our lips and at the corners of our mouths as we age. I use it every morning, and I use it every night just before going to bed, plus I have often added it just before putting my lipstick on before going out.....can&#x27;t say enough good things about XL LIP FUSION.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do as advertised, but for the low price I was willing to try it. It is a pretty good moisturizer for the neck area but other than that, it doesn&#x27;t do anything. On a positive note, it didn&#x27;t break out my sensitive skin so I gave it an extra star for that.</li>
            <li> I love the product I used to sell it when I worked for Sephora they carred it .... My only Problam was it was all ready opened and leaked all over the box... I know I could have sent it back.... but I really hate dealing with sending products back..... so I would next time go to Fusion Beauty and get it from them....Thank you for asking</li>
            <li> My mother who is 60 swears by this product. She claims she sees a big difference as the product states. I am 37 and really hoped this was my answer to future BOTOX. I was not impressed with the result for the price that was paid. I think I will save my $ for BOTOX while Mom spends hers on LIFTFUSION ;)</li>
            <li> The reviews and the price sold this product. I was looking for something to keep the small wrinkles under my eyes from getting bigger...we I am one to try many different products and I have found a face product that I like and I am using this on my HANDS... looking at some women&#x27;s hands, they look very aged, and I&#x27;m trying this on my hands, and LOVE the results!! Smooth and less stressful looking hands. I will be buying this again...for either my hands or face. Great product!</li>
            <li> Got this for  my wife.  She did not notice much improvement.  She also got L&#x27;Oreal  Paris Youth code  day/night cream, this she thought was much better, and seemed to think it at least had a noticeable  effect.</li>
            <li> Not good at all. Comes off like old makeup. . . All flaky. One of the worst 15$ ever spent. It didn&#x27;t smell old, tingles a little, but saw no visible change on my lil wrinkles. Don&#x27;t waste your time and money.  Kim kardashian was the face of fusion beauty but don&#x27;t think anymore, probably cause the product is s***!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say the &amp;#34;just like botox&amp;#34; claim is true, nothing works as good as botox, but at this price this cream is good!  I love the lip products from this line and this creme is good too!</li>
            <li> I really do not see that this made any difference.  The smell is so bad I cannot stand it.  I used this product years ago and back them it did work.  I think I got an old and expired batch.</li>
            <li> Started using it today.  It is easy to use and I can feel it working.  I feel I will have to apply it again before the end of the day.</li>
            <li> this product does not - at all - do what it claims. I tried it on half of my face, to judge the difference... I swear the half I used it on looked WORSE than the untreated side.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d take a chance and order this product.  With how great the cost was, I figured I&#x27;d have nothing to lose if it didn&#x27;t work.  Well, it worked.  It more than worked and I am truly shocked and impressed at how well and how fast this has made a difference in my skin, the texture, and the wrinkles.  My sister and I joke that we don&#x27;t have foreheads, we have fiveheads....they&#x27;re that big.  Therefore, we have more surface area for wrinkles and lines.  Since I&#x27;m an expressionistic individual/speaker, I have a lot of lines.  At the young age of 32, I&#x27;ve had several plastic surgeons tell me that my face looks older because of those wrinkles.  Injectables and fillers have been on my mind and I&#x27;ve scheduled several consultations.  Hesitancy outweighs everything and I never follow through with it.  In the few weeks that I&#x27;ve been using this product, the lines are almost invisible.  The surface of my skin is smoother, looks healthier and I am incredibly happy.  I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This appears to be a high grade product. It is a boxed  item. The container is a nice size and aesthetically appealing.  It is 6 1/2\\&quot; tall and 1 1/2\\&quot; wide and is 1.7 oz.  I have used it only once, so far.  The one I received is fresh and not old smelling like the one another viewer received.  It does have a &#x27;different&#x27; scent to it, but not offensive or old smelling. I ordered this because it has proven ingredients and such a tiny price on Amazon. The retail price on this is $140.00 and I purchased it here, on Amazon, for less than 20.00. I would never pay 140.00 for it or even close to that.  If it actually helps some, it will be worth it.  I am watching closely to see if it works, even have \\&quot;before\\&quot; photos, and will update my review after using this for a longer period of time. So many products make the claims their products work, but not all have the ingredients to back it up. I am giving this 5 stars based upon initial opinion and the impressive ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, on the Amazon product page, it calls this FUSION BEAUTY LIFT FUSION. On the box it says it is M-TOX FACELIFT.  I thought these were two different products and I ordered the first mentioned one, so I am a little confused on this.  I will research it. They could be one in the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I only wish this was shipped Amazon Prime. When shipped that way it is delivered by UPS to my door.  I buy as many as 30-80 items a month from Amazon using Prime 2 or 1 day shipping UPS.  I try to only buy products with the Amazon prime shipping but sometimes it is not possible to get some items that way. This was shipped USPS. The problem for me with this shipping is that the Carrier does not bring it to my door but delivers it to my box 1/2 mile down the road.  We are in the mountains but easily accessible, but that&#x27;s how it is. The thing I am concerned about on all my Amazon USPS shipments is that I am not able to drive down to the box (health problems) sometimes, for 3 weeks.  The  extreme temperatures could affect his product, in a metal container, sitting in a outside PO box when it gets in the 20&#x27;s at night now. Part of one day  outside could affect the quality and integrity of the product.  Even when UPS delivers I try and make sure to get the items from the porch  asap , as the deliver person does not ring the bell anymore, just leaves the packages, which is ok.  95% of the time the UPS person comes before 10:30 in the morning so it helps to know the approximate  items get here.  I wonder if those who get funny smelling products, if it has to do with the products sitting outside in extreme temperatures for a period of time?  If there is anyone out there who is educated in this realm, I would appreciate your take on this issue,  if the extreme temperatures really do affect the cosmetic, food, dog food and other products in a negative way.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Not as good as the XL version. but it is a nice gloss so my wifes says. she gave the rest of it to a friend.</li>
            <li> I Love this product . I first used it out of a subscription box and the estimated cost of 140 bucks had me wishing it didn&#x27;t work , but it did. It really has smoothed my wrinkles n my face just looks n feels smoother n younger . I was thrilled to find it here at this price, but I hope it doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s being discontinued !! I guess I better stock up ! The only lil thing is the smell , there is nothing n the small scent that it does have smells clinical but because of what it does for me I can ignore that !! N just so others know the smell was exactly the same in the 140 dollar bottle n this is the same stuff I have been using !</li>
            <li> DOn&#x27;t hate it, don&#x27;t love it. I&#x27;m not sure it works as promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am including these next few words becasue Amazon requires it. That needs to be changed.</li>
            <li> I only received this product today. I just now applied it to my face. It smells like a musty basement. I will disregard the smell to see if the product has any benefits...for now.</li>
            <li> I tried Fusion Beauty lift for the first time after I had been trying another expensive product, I was greatly surprised but the results!</li>
            <li> Really great product.  I&#x27;m glad to find it again and at such a deal.</li>
            <li> I AM ALREADY USING IT AND IT IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT. CAN NOT WAIT TO TRY MORE FUSION ITEMS&lt;br /&gt;2 THUMBS UP</li>
            <li> I used this product before and purchased from a department store.  This product  from Amazon looked the same but  it&lt;br /&gt;was inferior. I would love to get my money back.</li>
            <li> This is not Botox but for 15 bucks, it does brighten my face and soften wrinkles. I&#x27;ll always use this in my daily regimen.</li>
            <li> I first bought the Fusion Primer and I love it so I thought I would try this.  I was not disappointed!  This makes a visible difference right away and lasts for hours.  It may not be permanent but it noticeably reduces the look of wrinkles.  Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I paid for this product $10. Normally this product cost is around $140. I was a little skeptical about it. I have to say; this product is wonderful for my skin.  It makes my skin tight, smooth and glowing.</li>
