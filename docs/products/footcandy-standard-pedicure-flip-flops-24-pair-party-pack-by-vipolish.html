            <li> great for public showers and then I throw it away.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect to get any color shown in picture, it said color may vary but it wasn&#x27;t one the various colors shown, don&#x27;t buy based on color</li>
            <li> These worked well, but fell apart pretty quickly. We used them for a birthday party. About half the kids had them torn up by the end of the party.</li>
            <li> Awful quality, I bought a large quantity for my new nail spa. These fit flops fall apart in about 30 seconds, if not less. My expectations weren&#x27;t very high. I just wanted them to last about half an hour walking about ten steps on a smooth floor.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the use of one time use flip flops!</li>
            <li> I purchased these flip flops for a health fair in which we were doing free foot assessments, and shoe fittings for diabetic patients. These little flip flops came in quite handy when going from one station to another.  They were easy to put on and take off. Once they were finished with them they could be thrown away. No worries about getting someone else&#x27;s foot fungus!</li>
            <li> Thank You, Item as promised!</li>
            <li> As the other 1 star review indicated that these slippers last less than 30 seconds. In my case they lasted less than 5 seconds before they fell apart. I would not recommend this cheap and low quality product to anyone. I bought 24 pairs and still have 22 pairs left. Don&#x27;t know what to do with them. They are absolutely good for nothing.</li>
            <li> Very nice pedi slippers</li>
            <li> Wore these around the house after washing my feet while trying to treat athlete&#x27;s foot. Since I didn&#x27;t want to spread it and I didn&#x27;t want to wear shoes that I would need to throw out I got these for around the house and they help up really well for that purpose. I never had them break on me like some of the reviews say.</li>
            <li> I used these for my daughters spa party...they lasted the whole day.</li>
            <li> poorly made.  The material comes apart too easily.  The stitching is not strong enough . The clients do not like them.</li>
            <li> I am a cosmetologist that is just working on getting on my feet and these slippers was apart of my  first order and that work great. Nice vibrant colors. Definitely serves their purpose.</li>
            <li> Looks to be a very good quality of flip flops. Very strong and durable.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for a co-worker&#x27;s 50 birthday - she loves flip flops - and we used them to decorate her office.</li>
            <li> Does the job.  They are decent.</li>
            <li> They are just what I wanted!</li>
            <li> This was a big bang for the bucks.....it was a great deal...brand new and lovely colors.  i would recommend that anyone thinking of pedicure slippers, try these firlst .</li>
