    <ol>
            <li>Very good product!</li>
            <li>After trying a variety of non-toxic products to treat the eczema patches on my legs--this one has worked the best.</li>
            <li>Not too impressed.  </li>
            <li>Amazing stuff!!!</li>
            <li>I think it is wonderful and has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>Works great as a hair oil.</li>
            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>This is a great all around product to have in the medicine cabinet.  </li>
            <li>This was a great price for the quantity and the quality is great too.</li>
            <li>This combination of ingredients is like magic!!</li>
            <li>Neem body butter is so good for my hands.</li>
            <li>I find it works best for me when I put a &amp;#34;dollop&amp;#34; in the palm of my hand and rub together until it &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34;- then applies smoothly.</li>
            <li>The smell is not so good but whatâ€</li>
            <li>be ordering again, when your on to good thing stick to it.</li>
            <li>Does a good job of moisturizing your skin and helps for ecxema but doesn&#x27;t heal&lt;br /&gt;Stilla</li>
            <li>good product even though a bit pricey.</li>
            <li>I do combine this product with a good lifestyle of no fragrance in my soap or lotion</li>
            <li>Neem is safe effective and works great for your pets scrapes and soars without irritation, and its OK if they lick it off.</li>
            <li>&amp; It is highly effective.</li>
            <li>This is excellent cream and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I had a sore area from a rash that resolved nicely with this cream.  </li>
            <li>Iâ€™ve been reading about neem and even thought of making my own cream</li>
            <li>Good neem product, more like a salve than a body butter.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying more.</li>
            <li>I like the Theraneem Naturals Neem Cream much better.  </li>
            <li>This product is more waxy and doesn&#x27;t moisturize my skin like the Theraneem.</li>
            <li>The smell of this product initially turned me off, but it works absolutely great!</li>
            <li>but it will cost me more</li>
            <li>important is that the cream works!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Neem - Simply the best &#x27;curative&#x27;</li>
            <li>Could be in a bigger jar but the oil blend is awesome.</li>
            <li>am I glad I did.</li>
            <li>Very good hydrator especially for winter hands and face.  </li>
            <li>three weeks I am seeing the sandpaper skin becoming supple and the appearance has improved four</li>
            <li>I am no longer embarrassed, am pain free, have resumed many of the activities that I had to give up and can once again hold the hands of my patients and their families knowing that my touch will be comforting instead of feeling like sandpaper.</li>
            <li>very good thanks much</li>
            <li>improved the health of my skin dramatically and relatively easily</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my skin originally but my husband uses it for his hair.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a creamy body butter style lotion, this is not it, however if you are looking for a product that contains neem for your skin conditions, then definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>It works great for winter time and dry conditions.</li>
            <li>Yes, it may not have a sweet fragrance but guess what?</li>
            <li>The smell wears off overnight, luckily, and my skin is the softest and smoothest its ever been.</li>
            <li>It is several months later and the change in my skin is beyond amazing!!!</li>
            <li>One jar lasts well over a month even though I apply it liberally multiple times a day, plus everyone else wants to try it out because they have seen the amazing results I&#x27;ve had!</li>
            <li>It was very moisturizing and made my skin smooth</li>
            <li>This has helped to calm the eczema on hands.  </li>
            <li>I began using a bit on my face as a daily moisturizer during the winter, and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>Now I only use it a couple of times a week after baths to prevent flare-ups, but have not needed to do anything more.</li>
            <li>At first grainy but dissolves rapidly to soften skin.</li>
            <li>This is a good moisturizer - if you can get over the heavy odor of the coconut oil and beeswax.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite product to use for my dry, eczema-prone skin.  </li>
            <li>so I bought some in it&#x27;s pure form.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>No &#x27;greasy&#x27; after application issues and a very healing effect.</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t handle the smell was really hoping It wouldn&#x27;t bother me</li>
            <li>very hydration and soothing</li>
            <li>This product really contribute to the well being of my skin</li>
            <li>I initially found the Neem Body Butter by Naked Organix (which is almost completely odorless) at my local Better Health and thought I would give Neem one more chance and boy</li>
            <li>/&gt;Paste consistency is a little thick in cooler seasons, but perfect in Spring/Summer here in Texas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Recommend them and the product highly.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>While I can&#x27;t guarantee that everyone will have the same results, it&#x27;s definitely worth the time and money to give it a try.</li>
            <li>But compared to everything that I have tried this is the most success I have had AND surprisingly, the least expensive product I have used.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re new to Neem, give this a shot.  </li>
            <li>If you want something that is simply a great mosquito repellent, gives your skin a natural glow and softness, as well as keep from having unsightly nail fungus, it&#x27;s a worthwhile investment.</li>
            <li>I applied the cream daily for the first week and it has done wonders to soothe and heal her skin.  </li>
            <li>Meh as far as the moisturizing goes.</li>
            <li>the whole following day.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my mother-in-law who is 87 years old and having issues with the skin on her legs.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve come across for my psioriasis&lt;br /&gt;100% natural ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Has</li>
            <li>Next I tried a Neem lotion with citrus in it (to mask the smell I imagine) and it actually dried out my hands even more.</li>
            <li>My psoriasis began to show significant improvement within a few days of use.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin especially on my face.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to others with dry skin.</li>
            <li>Try some other products, but I think you&#x27;ll find Naked Organix is a solid product and worth the price tag.  </li>
            <li>Over the years I saw multiple Doctors and Dermatologist and spent a ton of money on both prescription and over the counter remedies, none of which offered much relief.</li>
            <li>A little greasy when first applied</li>
            <li>It is a fantastic product and I use it every day, no more dry skin in the winter.</li>
            <li>so I guess if you&#x27;re looking to treat extreme cases of dry skin and aren&#x27;t interested in how it smells then by all means give it a try.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to buy this product, wondering why it was twice as much for almost half the price of a similar cream I had bought.  </li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t find the smell of it particularly strong or unpleasant, but my husband absolutely hates it.  </li>
            <li> Works for all cuts scrapes and general dry skin hydration.  </li>
            <li> Elbows and other rough skin on heels are made soft with regular use.</li>
            <li> Keeps the skin moisturized for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> I suffer from eczema for as long as I know and living in Texas does not help my situation.</li>
            <li> Just the other day my husband was bitten several times by mosquitos</li>
            <li> has saved my husbands really dry skin</li>
            <li> Softens very dry skin and has helped in healing cracks in my feet.  </li>
            <li> but that is not really bothersome.</li>
            <li> because when I was home I spent all of my time trying to repair my hands</li>
            <li> I will probably try some of the other Organix body butters to find one that works just as well but doesn&#x27;t have the funky smell.</li>
            <li> My arms and neck are sun damaged due to a life outdoors and living at 7 degrees north of the equator.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> The psoriasis was (yes I said \\&quot;was\\&quot;) unsightly, cracked, bled and peeled constantly, caused horrible pain, loss of fine motor ability and even limited sensation at times.</li>
            <li> I was having trouble with my feet, -- they tingled at night and were restless  </li>
            <li> I had very little success with it and the smell was so bad (think rotting garlic) that it literally made me nauseous.</li>
            <li> and it did the trick, -- no more trouble.  </li>
            <li> but within a few hours that you couldn&#x27;t even tell he had been bit!</li>
            <li> I use Been everything, and this is the only product I have ever been unhappy with.</li>
            <li> Did nothing to help with my eczema and unhealthy bits of skin.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the consistency of this cream</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d god awful...</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> They need to put essential oil or something. It was very moisturizing and made my skin smooth but I couldn&#x27;t stomach how it smells and I definitely wouldn&#x27;t want to rub on my body. I know neem is beneficial for a variety of skin problems so I guess if you&#x27;re looking to treat extreme cases of dry skin and aren&#x27;t interested in how it smells then by all means give it a try.</li>
            <li> Meets all the expectations!  It mixes well with the essential oils and extracts.  Softens very dry skin and has helped in healing cracks in my feet.  I would highly recommend it to others with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Smells like peanut butter and Worcestershire sauce. Meh as far as the moisturizing goes. I plan on sticking to coconut oil. Did nothing to help with my eczema and unhealthy bits of skin.</li>
            <li> Jojoba is said to clog  pores......It did.</li>
            <li> I have used this body butter for: my lips, hair, skin, toenails, and face. Yes, it may not have a sweet fragrance but guess what? You can use it before you go to sleep at night &amp; It is highly effective. If you want something that is simply a great mosquito repellent, gives your skin a natural glow and softness, as well as keep from having unsightly nail fungus, it&#x27;s a worthwhile investment. I bought this about 3 months ago, and still have a lot left because just a bit will do. I also get the Nature&#x27;s Way Neem capsules as well, so I am definitely a fan.</li>
            <li> Very good product! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is excellent cream and very moisturizing. I will definitely buy it again.  Organix south has got a winner.  thanks</li>
            <li> It is a fantastic product and I use it every day, no more dry skin in the winter.</li>
            <li> This has helped to calm the eczema on hands.  I think it is wonderful and has a pleasant smell. I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Neem body butter is so good for my hands. No &#x27;greasy&#x27; after application issues and a very healing effect. Recommend them and the product highly.</li>
            <li> After trying a variety of non-toxic products to treat the eczema patches on my legs--this one has worked the best. I began using a bit on my face as a daily moisturizer during the winter, and my skin has never looked better. Will continue to buy!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this product, wondering why it was twice as much for almost half the price of a similar cream I had bought.  I was not disappointed.  I use it on my daughter&#x27;s eczema, which she scratches at to the point of drawing blood.  I applied the cream daily for the first week and it has done wonders to soothe and heal her skin.  Now I only use it a couple of times a week after baths to prevent flare-ups, but have not needed to do anything more.</li>
            <li> I had a sore area from a rash that resolved nicely with this cream.  Elbows and other rough skin on heels are made soft with regular use.</li>
            <li> has saved my husbands really dry skin</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t handle the smell was really hoping It wouldn&#x27;t bother me but it just nauseates me</li>
            <li> Not too impressed.  I like the Theraneem Naturals Neem Cream much better.  This product is more waxy and doesn&#x27;t moisturize my skin like the Theraneem.</li>
            <li> The smell of this product initially turned me off, but it works absolutely great! I apply it at night before I go to bed and my skin stays moisturized the whole following day. The smell wears off overnight, luckily, and my skin is the softest and smoothest its ever been. I will probably try some of the other Organix body butters to find one that works just as well but doesn&#x27;t have the funky smell.</li>
            <li> very hydration and soothing</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother-in-law who is 87 years old and having issues with the skin on her legs.  She loves it and says she has seen definite improvement with it&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> This is a good moisturizer - if you can get over the heavy odor of the coconut oil and beeswax. It did nothing for my psoriasis, though. This product  feels gritty- not what I think of when I hear the word butter.  I find it works best for me when I put a &amp;#34;dollop&amp;#34; in the palm of my hand and rub together until it &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34;- then applies smoothly.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin especially on my face. I&#x27;ve tried every lotion there is out there and this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t burn my face. It works great for winter time and dry conditions.</li>
            <li> Iâ€™ve been reading about neem and even thought of making my own cream but it will cost me more so I thought of trying this out. I bought this for my husband who has severe eczema on one of his foot. After 3 weeks of continued use, we saw a difference. I wish I can post pictures but it will be gross. The smell is not so good but whatâ€™s important is that the cream works!</li>
            <li> My arms and neck are sun damaged due to a life outdoors and living at 7 degrees north of the equator.&lt;br /&gt;After three weeks I am seeing the sandpaper skin becoming supple and the appearance has improved four fold.&lt;br /&gt;Another plus is that it lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;Will be ordering again, when your on to good thing stick to it.</li>
            <li> Works great as a hair oil. It has improved the texture of my daughter&#x27;s hair after three months of use.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the consistency of this cream I&#x27;d god awful... I use Been everything, and this is the only product I have ever been unhappy with.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my skin originally but my husband uses it for his hair. This is the only thing he uses! Great product</li>
            <li> Good neem product, more like a salve than a body butter.  If you are looking for a creamy body butter style lotion, this is not it, however if you are looking for a product that contains neem for your skin conditions, then definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> very good thanks much</li>
            <li> Very good hydrator especially for winter hands and face.  I would definitely purchase again.  At first grainy but dissolves rapidly to soften skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great all around product to have in the medicine cabinet.  Works for all cuts scrapes and general dry skin hydration.  Neem is safe effective and works great for your pets scrapes and soars without irritation, and its OK if they lick it off. My dog actually used to eat my Neem tree leaves to settle her stomach and it always works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Russ</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using neem for some time but ran out. This was a great price for the quantity and the quality is great too. Just the other day my husband was bitten several times by mosquitos and he put neem on them and it wasn&#x27;t but within a few hours that you couldn&#x27;t even tell he had been bit! Amazing stuff!!!</li>
            <li> Feels soothing on skin, no burning or tingling even on open sores (like eczema). Keeps the skin moisturized for a long period of time. Seemed to also help heal my cellulitis (infected pore) faster.</li>
            <li> A little greasy when first applied but it has been helping me with my issues.</li>
            <li> Does a good job of moisturizing your skin and helps for ecxema but doesn&#x27;t heal&lt;br /&gt;Stilla good product even though a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t do without this cream  I was having trouble with my feet, -- they tingled at night and were restless  I put this cream on,  rubbing it all over and it did the trick, -- no more trouble.  I did a test thinking that it didn&#x27;t make a difference.  I skipped the Neem  cream  and my feet started to bother me and I got up and applied the Neem..  And then I knew it was the Neem that made the difference.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neem - Simply the best &#x27;curative&#x27; I&#x27;ve come across for my psioriasis&lt;br /&gt;100% natural ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Has improved the health of my skin dramatically and relatively easily&lt;br /&gt;Good bang for the buck&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paste consistency is a little thick in cooler seasons, but perfect in Spring/Summer here in Texas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re new to Neem, give this a shot.  Try some other products, but I think you&#x27;ll find Naked Organix is a solid product and worth the price tag.  For me it has been part of a game-changer with my testing out of Neem.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite product to use for my dry, eczema-prone skin.  I don&#x27;t find the smell of it particularly strong or unpleasant, but my husband absolutely hates it.  I&#x27;ve taken to applying it only when he&#x27;s not around and I&#x27;ll have a couple of hours to let the smell fade.</li>
            <li> Product delivered as promised. Could be in a bigger jar but the oil blend is awesome.</li>
            <li> For the last five years of my life I have had debilitating psoriasis on the palms of my hands and fingers. I have it on my knees and elbows as well but that is not really bothersome. I am a nurse and provide medical care and comforting touch with my hands constantly. The psoriasis was (yes I said \\&quot;was\\&quot;) unsightly, cracked, bled and peeled constantly, caused horrible pain, loss of fine motor ability and even limited sensation at times. In addition, it was embarrassing and I had to give up all of my hobbies (crafting, gardening, etc) because when I was home I spent all of my time trying to repair my hands so I could continue to work. Over the years I saw multiple Doctors and Dermatologist and spent a ton of money on both prescription and over the counter remedies, none of which offered much relief. A co-worker recommended that I try Neem so I bought some in it&#x27;s pure form. I had very little success with it and the smell was so bad (think rotting garlic) that it literally made me nauseous. Next I tried a Neem lotion with citrus in it (to mask the smell I imagine) and it actually dried out my hands even more. I initially found the Neem Body Butter by Naked Organix (which is almost completely odorless) at my local Better Health and thought I would give Neem one more chance and boy am I glad I did. This combination of ingredients is like magic!! My psoriasis began to show significant improvement within a few days of use. It is several months later and the change in my skin is beyond amazing!!! I am no longer embarrassed, am pain free, have resumed many of the activities that I had to give up and can once again hold the hands of my patients and their families knowing that my touch will be comforting instead of feeling like sandpaper. However, you should know that this is not a cure. I do have to use the product regularly or I notice my skin starting to crack and peel all over again. But compared to everything that I have tried this is the most success I have had AND surprisingly, the least expensive product I have used. One jar lasts well over a month even though I apply it liberally multiple times a day, plus everyone else wants to try it out because they have seen the amazing results I&#x27;ve had! While I can&#x27;t guarantee that everyone will have the same results, it&#x27;s definitely worth the time and money to give it a try. For me, it&#x27;s been life changing!</li>
            <li> I suffer from eczema for as long as I know and living in Texas does not help my situation. This product really contribute to the well being of my skin but I do suggest that you do not diagnose yourself and go visit your Dermatologist or Allergist as necessary. I do combine this product with a good lifestyle of no fragrance in my soap or lotion and I do not use perfumes either. I also take \\&quot;immune boosting\\&quot; pills and that adds to the well being of my skin too.</li>
