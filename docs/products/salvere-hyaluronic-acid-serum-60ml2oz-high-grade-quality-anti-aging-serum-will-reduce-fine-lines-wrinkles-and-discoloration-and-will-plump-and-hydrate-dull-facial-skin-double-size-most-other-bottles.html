            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Also have learned how important Vitamin K2 is to help prevent/improve wrinkles, so the combination of everything I&#x27;m using ought to prepare me for Hollywood...not!  </li>
            <li>Will update this review as appropriate.</li>
            <li>I love this serum.</li>
            <li>I love using hyaluronic acid serum every night.  </li>
            <li>I am sure I will buy again.</li>
            <li>I love the touch of the smoothness after using the product.</li>
            <li>I like using an eye dropper and being able to control the amount of liquid dispensed.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, I am pleased with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I use it morning &amp; night &amp; you can put a moisturizer on top of it.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my skin feel after applying.  </li>
            <li>My makeup goes on better too.</li>
            <li>It came well packaged and the build quality is outstanding.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for years and will stay with it for many more.</li>
            <li>I love Salvere products.</li>
            <li>It has a nice consistency and feels silky smooth going on, not slimy or sticky.  </li>
            <li>Historically, I could consider my skin to not be the best.</li>
            <li>Despite the fact that It was first time when I used that kind of serum, it felt it is nice to</li>
            <li>product is high quality at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>Got my money&#x27;s worth and more !</li>
            <li>make sure your skin and pores are clean to readily absorb the vitamins in the serum; it&#x27;s always best to exfoliate at least once a week for the best absorption of serums.</li>
            <li>My skin is always clear and happy looking if that makes any sense...  </li>
            <li>She said it does good for wrinkle absolutely.</li>
            <li>This high grade quality serum provides your skin with intense hydration, that also promotes great anti-aging properties that are proven to reduce fine lines, wrinkles, discoloration of your skin and more!</li>
            <li>You see your skin becoming plumper, more hydrated and visibly more youthful with the first application.</li>
            <li>How many products is that true for?  </li>
            <li>and I have had NO luck in reducing fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Even my fine lines have smoothened!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this serum, it&#x27;s easy absorbed</li>
            <li>I get more and consistent compliments on my skin that I ever have!  </li>
            <li>After the Salvere C/Hyaluronic Serum stopped being available, I ordered this.</li>
            <li>It is fantastic.</li>
            <li>This Hyaluronic serum is velvety smooth and absorbs immediately.  </li>
            <li>it makes my skin so smooth and no wrinkle</li>
            <li>You might end up loving this brand so much.</li>
            <li>Great product that I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>my face skin have been changed shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>However, the serum has helped hydrate, smooth, and even out the tone.</li>
            <li>I was provided a sample for review; however, I think the price of the serum is a good value since you get twice as much as most others for about the same price.  </li>
            <li>, i can still feel it next day morning without applying lotion afterwards, amazing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve this product for several months now and the difference in every aspect of my skin is remarkable...  </li>
            <li>And the price is right!</li>
            <li>good amount of product that will last for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;totally</li>
            <li>Good product, I&#x27;ll come back to buy it again.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to have them make good on this prior to posting.</li>
            <li>My skin feels very smooth And appears more plump.facial lines not as deep as before.^</li>
            <li>super moisturizing serum</li>
            <li>I like how quickly my skin absorbs the liquid without leaving it sticky.  </li>
            <li>This serum is extremely quick and easy to use, so I&#x27;m able to effortlessly incorporate it into my daily skin care regimen.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the product!!</li>
            <li>Instead this makes your moisturizer more effective and allows your skin to retain moisture; one reason why you should apply it on slightly damp skin.</li>
            <li>worth a try.</li>
            <li>but this was definitely worth the money</li>
            <li>it was well worth to me.</li>
            <li>I think this product is probably better than many highly promoted &amp;#34;wrinkle elixirs&amp;#34; going for $50 to 100, although I haven&#x27;t actually tried any of these &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; formulas.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good serum, however, it seems thinner than other products.</li>
            <li>Price is right too.</li>
            <li>Personally, I have experienced such fantastic, lasting results, and have fallen in love with this serum.</li>
            <li>I apply the Hyaluronic Acid serum once in the morning, and once at night, by gently massaging it onto my damp, clean face, after using my cleanser.</li>
            <li>Seems like a very pure preparation since even when used around the eyes and accidentally gets in them, causes no stinging or irritation.  </li>
            <li>so you really want to take full advantage of that by prepping your skin.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping for this product.</li>
            <li>I love all Salvere products due to their fast absorption and feels very smooth after applying to the skin, no greasy feeling and very watery.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first thing I apply after cleaning and toner...</li>
            <li>I will check back in two more weeks.</li>
            <li>My skin has felt softer and looked smoother almost from the first week or so.  </li>
            <li>Might upload more when I get back to my place.</li>
            <li>No weird smell.  </li>
            <li>First time with this company.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got this at a discounted rate, and I thought I got a good deal, but it turns out a waste of money.</li>
            <li>It will take several weeks to notice reduced fine lines, but you will get the softening and hydrating effects the first day you use it.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent and has a dropper to easily get just enough product to (one drop) to cover your entire face and neck.  </li>
            <li>Starting to see fewer fine lines and skin is smoother.</li>
            <li>very moisturize and doesn&#x27;t have any smells.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>Fast absorbing .</li>
            <li>I go out in the sun a lot and get sunburn very often because i forget sun block all the time.</li>
            <li>If used sparingly, works well, but use VERY sparingly.</li>
            <li>Bought for my wife and she really likes it.</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>Works really well.  </li>
            <li>I also really love that Salvere offers this product in a larger bottle, at 2oz, which is twice the size of all of the competitor products.</li>
            <li>So soft!!!  </li>
            <li>Clean and simple.</li>
            <li>Plus, the product is half the price of most 1oz bottles.</li>
            <li>Consistency is perfect, not so thin that it ends up all over my sink, and stays on my skin while it dries down...  </li>
            <li>Dropper delivers just the right amount I need for my face, neck, and back of my hands...  </li>
            <li>In addition, my face has also stopped drying out, is now hydrated and feels incredibly soft!</li>
            <li>The product comes in a pretty blue  2 oz, bottle with an eyedropper in the lid.  </li>
            <li>Feels very light on your skin and the end result is far above average.</li>
            <li>So far I like this product, but I have not used it long enough to make an accurate review.  </li>
            <li>I did a comparison of my moisturizer using this on one half of my face and none on the other, and the serum side definitely looked fresher and the skin looked firmer with fine lines temporarily filled</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a natural solution that reverses the signs of aging, and has earned its nickname as &#x27;the fountain of youth&#x27;.</li>
            <li>feels soft.</li>
            <li>It keep my skin soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for almost 2 weeks and it makes my face feel hydrated and soft.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I got their vitamin C serum which is fabulous, but this is a waste of money.</li>
            <li>This stuff works very deep into your skin and makes it very moistured.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li>Every time i used it that felt skin is soft , I like it</li>
            <li>At 66 years old, my skin needs some help.</li>
            <li>weird smell but otherwise good</li>
            <li>I normally didnt give out the low rate like this.</li>
            <li>Before I bought this product, my use of Hyaluronic Acid was very inconsistent and never really knew if it was in any of the serums I was using...  </li>
            <li>I received it in exchange for my unbiased, honest opinion, and stand behind this product in every way!</li>
            <li>Not only does the serum absorb right into my face â€“ itâ€™s also lightening up a couple of dark spots on my face.  </li>
            <li>the crows feet in the corner of my right eye are SIGNIFICANTLY less noticeable, as is the bag under the same eye.  </li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s completely natural, and pure, you don&#x27;t have to worry about harsh chemicals or side effects that can permanently damage your skin.</li>
            <li>Also a tremendous bargain at $16.00 for a 2-3 month supply; a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I opened the package today, and found a large amount of black mold growing in the stopper.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about one month now, and before I started using it, I had incredibly dark and noticeable circles under my eyes, and also very un-even splotchy red skin.</li>
            <li>If you use even a tiny bit too much, your skin will feel a little tacky.</li>
            <li>Quality is okay, a little too thick and sticky.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love Salvere products.</li>
            <li> It has a nice consistency and feels silky smooth going on, not slimy or sticky.  </li>
            <li> Historically, I could consider my skin to not be the best.</li>
            <li> Despite the fact that It was first time when I used that kind of serum, it felt it is nice to</li>
            <li> product is high quality at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> Got my money&#x27;s worth and more !</li>
            <li> make sure your skin and pores are clean to readily absorb the vitamins in the serum; it&#x27;s always best to exfoliate at least once a week for the best absorption of serums.</li>
            <li> My skin is always clear and happy looking if that makes any sense...  </li>
            <li> She said it does good for wrinkle absolutely.</li>
            <li> This high grade quality serum provides your skin with intense hydration, that also promotes great anti-aging properties that are proven to reduce fine lines, wrinkles, discoloration of your skin and more!</li>
            <li> You see your skin becoming plumper, more hydrated and visibly more youthful with the first application.</li>
            <li> How many products is that true for?  </li>
            <li> and I have had NO luck in reducing fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Even my fine lines have smoothened!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this serum, it&#x27;s easy absorbed</li>
            <li> I get more and consistent compliments on my skin that I ever have!  </li>
            <li> After the Salvere C/Hyaluronic Serum stopped being available, I ordered this.</li>
            <li> It is fantastic.</li>
            <li> This Hyaluronic serum is velvety smooth and absorbs immediately.  </li>
            <li> it makes my skin so smooth and no wrinkle</li>
            <li> You might end up loving this brand so much.</li>
            <li> Great product that I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> my face skin have been changed shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> However, the serum has helped hydrate, smooth, and even out the tone.</li>
            <li> I was provided a sample for review; however, I think the price of the serum is a good value since you get twice as much as most others for about the same price.  </li>
            <li> , i can still feel it next day morning without applying lotion afterwards, amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve this product for several months now and the difference in every aspect of my skin is remarkable...  </li>
            <li> And the price is right!</li>
            <li> good amount of product that will last for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;totally</li>
            <li> Good product, I&#x27;ll come back to buy it again.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to have them make good on this prior to posting.</li>
            <li> My skin feels very smooth And appears more plump.facial lines not as deep as before.^</li>
            <li> super moisturizing serum</li>
            <li> I like how quickly my skin absorbs the liquid without leaving it sticky.  </li>
            <li> This serum is extremely quick and easy to use, so I&#x27;m able to effortlessly incorporate it into my daily skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the product!!</li>
            <li> Instead this makes your moisturizer more effective and allows your skin to retain moisture; one reason why you should apply it on slightly damp skin.</li>
            <li> worth a try.</li>
            <li> but this was definitely worth the money</li>
            <li> it was well worth to me.</li>
            <li> I think this product is probably better than many highly promoted &amp;#34;wrinkle elixirs&amp;#34; going for $50 to 100, although I haven&#x27;t actually tried any of these &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; formulas.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good serum, however, it seems thinner than other products.</li>
            <li> Price is right too.</li>
            <li> Personally, I have experienced such fantastic, lasting results, and have fallen in love with this serum.</li>
            <li> I apply the Hyaluronic Acid serum once in the morning, and once at night, by gently massaging it onto my damp, clean face, after using my cleanser.</li>
            <li> Seems like a very pure preparation since even when used around the eyes and accidentally gets in them, causes no stinging or irritation.  </li>
            <li> so you really want to take full advantage of that by prepping your skin.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping for this product.</li>
            <li> I love all Salvere products due to their fast absorption and feels very smooth after applying to the skin, no greasy feeling and very watery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first thing I apply after cleaning and toner...</li>
            <li> I will check back in two more weeks.</li>
            <li> My skin has felt softer and looked smoother almost from the first week or so.  </li>
            <li> Might upload more when I get back to my place.</li>
            <li> No weird smell.  </li>
            <li> First time with this company.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got this at a discounted rate, and I thought I got a good deal, but it turns out a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It will take several weeks to notice reduced fine lines, but you will get the softening and hydrating effects the first day you use it.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent and has a dropper to easily get just enough product to (one drop) to cover your entire face and neck.  </li>
            <li> Starting to see fewer fine lines and skin is smoother.</li>
            <li> very moisturize and doesn&#x27;t have any smells.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Fast absorbing .</li>
            <li> I go out in the sun a lot and get sunburn very often because i forget sun block all the time.</li>
            <li> If used sparingly, works well, but use VERY sparingly.</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife and she really likes it.</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> Works really well.  </li>
            <li> I also really love that Salvere offers this product in a larger bottle, at 2oz, which is twice the size of all of the competitor products.</li>
            <li> So soft!!!  </li>
            <li> Clean and simple.</li>
            <li> Plus, the product is half the price of most 1oz bottles.</li>
            <li> Consistency is perfect, not so thin that it ends up all over my sink, and stays on my skin while it dries down...  </li>
            <li> Dropper delivers just the right amount I need for my face, neck, and back of my hands...  </li>
            <li> In addition, my face has also stopped drying out, is now hydrated and feels incredibly soft!</li>
            <li> The product comes in a pretty blue  2 oz, bottle with an eyedropper in the lid.  </li>
            <li> Feels very light on your skin and the end result is far above average.</li>
            <li> So far I like this product, but I have not used it long enough to make an accurate review.  </li>
            <li> I did a comparison of my moisturizer using this on one half of my face and none on the other, and the serum side definitely looked fresher and the skin looked firmer with fine lines temporarily filled</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a natural solution that reverses the signs of aging, and has earned its nickname as &#x27;the fountain of youth&#x27;.</li>
            <li> feels soft.</li>
            <li> It keep my skin soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost 2 weeks and it makes my face feel hydrated and soft.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I got their vitamin C serum which is fabulous, but this is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This stuff works very deep into your skin and makes it very moistured.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li> Every time i used it that felt skin is soft , I like it</li>
            <li> At 66 years old, my skin needs some help.</li>
            <li> weird smell but otherwise good</li>
            <li> I normally didnt give out the low rate like this.</li>
            <li> Before I bought this product, my use of Hyaluronic Acid was very inconsistent and never really knew if it was in any of the serums I was using...  </li>
            <li> I received it in exchange for my unbiased, honest opinion, and stand behind this product in every way!</li>
            <li> Not only does the serum absorb right into my face â€“ itâ€™s also lightening up a couple of dark spots on my face.  </li>
            <li> the crows feet in the corner of my right eye are SIGNIFICANTLY less noticeable, as is the bag under the same eye.  </li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s completely natural, and pure, you don&#x27;t have to worry about harsh chemicals or side effects that can permanently damage your skin.</li>
            <li> Also a tremendous bargain at $16.00 for a 2-3 month supply; a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I opened the package today, and found a large amount of black mold growing in the stopper.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about one month now, and before I started using it, I had incredibly dark and noticeable circles under my eyes, and also very un-even splotchy red skin.</li>
            <li> If you use even a tiny bit too much, your skin will feel a little tacky.</li>
            <li> Quality is okay, a little too thick and sticky.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and it completely delivered (past tense - for the first 6 weeks).</li>
            <li> From several other identical reviews in April &amp; May of 2015</li>
            <li> I let it dry before going on with the rest of my skin care routine...  </li>
            <li> I use this product every, single day; morning and night...  </li>
            <li> the lines are really less deep</li>
            <li> It doesnt have any smells or anything weird, Worthy to give it a try.</li>
            <li> This is a very high quality product that works very hard to fight again wrinkles and helps repair sun damaged skin.</li>
            <li> Softens and hydrates the skin, as expected.  </li>
            <li> Decent product a little to thick and sticky</li>
            <li> I had since seen other consistency issues.</li>
            <li> After four weeks, the dark circles under my eyes have reduced by over 50% and my skin tone has also started to even out.</li>
            <li> Over the two years of use, my skin is noticeably smoother, and the dark spots on my face are lighter in color.</li>
            <li> so haven&#x27;t noticed my dark circles diminishing</li>
            <li> Works as well as any average HA out there</li>
            <li> No more dry skin.</li>
            <li> BLACK MOLD in all</li>
            <li> I used over half the bottle</li>
            <li> Purchased in May and open it on 7/13/15, as you can see something inside the tube, I believe this company has serious quality control issue.</li>
            <li> I noticed a slight burning on my cheeks with it (it is an acid,)</li>
            <li> My complexion, although not severe, typically has a blemish or two.</li>
            <li> Then, one day, i found that there was green stuff in my dripper part, so I looked into the bottle.</li>
            <li> I feel results after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Since the bottle is blueish, it was hard to see it through, but I got some since there were Tons of green stuff in the bottle!!!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sorry to say...........don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I use this hyaluronic acid as a base under my facial moisturizer after my morning shower, and I could not be happier with the results.</li>
            <li> but nothing distracting or irritating.  </li>
            <li> but this  serum has not caused any ill affects</li>
            <li> What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I believe this is part of a bad batch and is also a health issue.</li>
            <li> ive altered some of my bad habits</li>
            <li> This brand really disappointed me.</li>
            <li> there is black floccule in the product!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It was really disgusting!</li>

            <li> This high grade quality serum provides your skin with intense hydration, that also promotes great anti-aging properties that are proven to reduce fine lines, wrinkles, discoloration of your skin and more! Hyaluronic Acid serum will plump, moisturize and hydrate your face all in one. It&#x27;s a natural solution that reverses the signs of aging, and has earned its nickname as &#x27;the fountain of youth&#x27;. Because it&#x27;s completely natural, and pure, you don&#x27;t have to worry about harsh chemicals or side effects that can permanently damage your skin. I have been using this product for about one month now, and before I started using it, I had incredibly dark and noticeable circles under my eyes, and also very un-even splotchy red skin. After four weeks, the dark circles under my eyes have reduced by over 50% and my skin tone has also started to even out. In addition, my face has also stopped drying out, is now hydrated and feels incredibly soft! This serum is extremely quick and easy to use, so I&#x27;m able to effortlessly incorporate it into my daily skin care regimen. I apply the Hyaluronic Acid serum once in the morning, and once at night, by gently massaging it onto my damp, clean face, after using my cleanser. Plus, after using it, I&#x27;m still able to apply my moisturizer, make-up and sunscreen. I also really love that Salvere offers this product in a larger bottle, at 2oz, which is twice the size of all of the competitor products. Plus, the product is half the price of most 1oz bottles. Personally, I have experienced such fantastic, lasting results, and have fallen in love with this serum. I received it in exchange for my unbiased, honest opinion, and stand behind this product in every way! I hope you decide to give it a try, as I know you&#x27;ll be happy you did!</li>
            <li> Definitely. You see your skin becoming plumper, more hydrated and visibly more youthful with the first application. You don&#x27;t want to use this in lieu of a moisturizer (serums are meant to be applied underneath serum). Instead this makes your moisturizer more effective and allows your skin to retain moisture; one reason why you should apply it on slightly damp skin. make sure your skin and pores are clean to readily absorb the vitamins in the serum; it&#x27;s always best to exfoliate at least once a week for the best absorption of serums. The vitamins in this are ideal for promoting skin cell turnover and diminishing free radical damage so you really want to take full advantage of that by prepping your skin. I did a comparison of my moisturizer using this on one half of my face and none on the other, and the serum side definitely looked fresher and the skin looked firmer with fine lines temporarily filled in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this at a discount as a blogger, however all opinions expressed are 100% my own</li>
            <li> did brighten my face a lot which I loved and felt great, love this product and will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> very good for skin. feels soft.</li>
            <li> I see a difference already!</li>
            <li> Definitely love this serum! Soaks right into my skin &amp; leaves me feeling &amp; looking great!!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Use it morning and night and on my hands too. Working great.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It keep my skin soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I like it, used it almost two weeks, this is my 2nd order.</li>
            <li> I tried this product at a greatly discounted rate and Iâ€™m so glad I did.  I have been using this product for almost 2 weeks and it makes my face feel hydrated and soft.  Not only does the serum absorb right into my face â€“ itâ€™s also lightening up a couple of dark spots on my face.  I have also been using this on my hands and I have noticed the skin on my hands is looking younger.  Great product that I will continue to use</li>
            <li> I use this product every, single day; morning and night...  It&#x27;s the first thing I apply after cleaning and toner...I let it dry before going on with the rest of my skin care routine...  Before I bought this product, my use of Hyaluronic Acid was very inconsistent and never really knew if it was in any of the serums I was using...  I&#x27;ve this product for several months now and the difference in every aspect of my skin is remarkable...  It&#x27;s why I keep using is on such a rigid basis!  My skin is always clear and happy looking if that makes any sense...  I get more and consistent compliments on my skin that I ever have!  That&#x27;s another reason I use it so religiously...  Consistency is perfect, not so thin that it ends up all over my sink, and stays on my skin while it dries down...  No scent to complicate things...  Dropper delivers just the right amount I need for my face, neck, and back of my hands...  Will continue using, and have a backup bottle on standby!  Thanks for the product!!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. I notice it also tightens my skin as well.</li>
            <li> So far I like this product, but I have not used it long enough to make an accurate review.  I will check back in two more weeks.</li>
            <li> Serum is silky smooth and leaves my skin feeling great. And the price is right!</li>
            <li> BLACK MOLD in all ****THREE**** of the bottles I ordered. Sending back promptly. From several other identical reviews in April &amp; May of 2015 I believe this is part of a bad batch and is also a health issue. Manufacturer, please provide feedback.</li>
            <li> After the Salvere C/Hyaluronic Serum stopped being available, I ordered this. I opened the package today, and found a large amount of black mold growing in the stopper. MAKES ME WANT TO SCREAM!!!! Incredible. I&#x27;m returning.</li>
            <li> Have been using Salvere Hyaluronic Acid Serum for 12 or 13 days.  Faithfully applying it twice daily after I have washed my face with CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser with hyaluronic acid.  Also using CeraVe Eye Repair Cream.  Not kidding...the crows feet in the corner of my right eye are SIGNIFICANTLY less noticeable, as is the bag under the same eye.  And when I wake up in the morning, I can tell that my face still feels hydrated.  Also have learned how important Vitamin K2 is to help prevent/improve wrinkles, so the combination of everything I&#x27;m using ought to prepare me for Hollywood...not!  Very pleased and excited to watch the continuing improvement.  Will update this review as appropriate. Update May 18, 2017.  Over the two years of use, my skin is noticeably smoother, and the dark spots on my face are lighter in color. I use this hyaluronic acid as a base under my facial moisturizer after my morning shower, and I could not be happier with the results.</li>
            <li> very moisturize and doesn&#x27;t have any smells.&lt;br /&gt;A good amount of product that will last for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;totally worth a try.</li>
            <li> Great Value!&lt;br /&gt;very good!!</li>
            <li> I think I gave this a fair chance to see if it would work and I&#x27;m sorry to say...........don&#x27;t waste your money. I used over half the bottle and I have had NO luck in reducing fine lines and wrinkles. Guess I will keep searching for a product that works!!!</li>
            <li> there is black floccule in the product!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> super moisturizing serum, i can still feel it next day morning without applying lotion afterwards, amazing!</li>
            <li> I have been using the serum for about two weeks now and my skin is brighter and smoother than it has been in years. I have sensitive skin but this  serum has not caused any ill affects thus I will continue to use it along with my regular skin regimen.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast. Despite the fact that It was first time when I used that kind of serum, it felt it is nice to me.&lt;br /&gt;also, I recommended it to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this serum. it doesnt irritate my face like others do.</li>
            <li> Great product! My skin feels very smooth And appears more plump.facial lines not as deep as before.^</li>
            <li> It is fantastic. Clean and simple.</li>
            <li> What a wonderful prodcut at a great and affordable price.  I love using hyaluronic acid serum every night.  This one just goes in to my skin in second.  I am sure I will buy again.</li>
            <li> love this skin feels so great</li>
            <li> I love the touch of the smoothness after using the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about a week, and my skin feels smoother and firmer.  I like how quickly my skin absorbs the liquid without leaving it sticky.  I was delighted to purchase this product through a promotional launch, and am more than happy to share my experience through a review.  The product comes in a pretty blue  2 oz, bottle with an eyedropper in the lid.  I like using an eye dropper and being able to control the amount of liquid dispensed.</li>
            <li> Very good.  Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> This Hyaluronic serum is velvety smooth and absorbs immediately.  No grease or cream, just a wonderful absorbing liquid that makes your face feel so good and smooth.  I love using Hyaluronic serum and this one is very nice.  It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent and has a dropper to easily get just enough product to (one drop) to cover your entire face and neck.  I was given this product to try to give and honest opinion. I do recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using hyaluronic acid for about four months, and I like the way it makes my skin look and feel.  My skin has felt softer and looked smoother almost from the first week or so.  I was hoping it would also lighten age spots, but I can&#x27;t say I have seen a noticeable change.  Nor does it seem to plump my skin.  Nevertheless, I am pleased with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> it makes my skin so smooth and no wrinkle</li>
            <li> I love all Salvere products due to their fast absorption and feels very smooth after applying to the skin, no greasy feeling and very watery. The smell of the product is acceptable.</li>
            <li> I also purchased the vitamin C serum from the same company. Both feels great. I like the feeling of both serum on my hands and faces. They provide the great hydration and moist on your skin. It doesnt have any smells or anything weird, Worthy to give it a try. You might end up loving this brand so much.I received this at a discount in exchanged for my honest and unbiased review.  Updated. So here is the story. I got this at a discounted rate, and I thought I got a good deal, but it turns out a waste of money. Yes, at the beginning, it worked well. I kept using it for 3 months occasionally and give out 5 stars. Then, one day, i found that there was green stuff in my dripper part, so I looked into the bottle. Since the bottle is blueish, it was hard to see it through, but I got some since there were Tons of green stuff in the bottle!!! I could not believe I kept using this on my face. Obviously, they were contaminated. I could not return the bottle anymore after 2 to 3 months. Thus, i contacted them via the website for support, but they never replied my email!!! I got their vitamin C serum which is fabulous, but this is a waste of money. DONT BUY IT. I normally didnt give out the low rate like this. This brand really disappointed me. I didn&#x27;t have the bottle now with me, so I cannot show the pix. It was really disgusting! Might upload more when I get back to my place.</li>
            <li> When I see the word &amp;#34;acid&amp;#34; in a product name-it kind of scares me!  But I googled Hyaluronic Acid.&amp; it turns out it is needed for plumping skin out  &amp; softening it!  I definitely need something like this!  It feels good after being on your skin &amp; is not smelly &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling tacky.  I use it morning &amp; night &amp; you can put a moisturizer on top of it.  I have just started using it so haven&#x27;t noticed my dark circles diminishing but I have great hopes for this serum. Nothing happens overnight so I guess I&#x27;ll be patient!  I received this at a reduced price for an honest opinion. Right now on Amazon, this is at a wonderful price, Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It has definitely helped the lines around my eyes and forehead.  I love the way it makes my skin feel after applying.  So soft!!!  No weird smell.  I use it morning and night on my face after my regular routine like the instructions say.  Will definitely continue using this product and will recommend it to others.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> weird smell but otherwise good</li>
            <li> I am using this in the morning and it is a very nice product. my skin feels tighter and smoother. My makeup goes on better too.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome Serum. It came well packaged and the build quality is outstanding. I feel results after a few uses. Great day.</li>
            <li> This stuff works very deep into your skin and makes it very moistured. No more dry skin. Even my fine lines have smoothened!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing product, great brand.</li>
            <li> I have been using  Hyaluronic Acid Serum for about a year now. First time with this company.&lt;br /&gt;This product is high quality at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use morning and night. Fast absorbing . Leaves skin soft and supple. fine lines and pores are minimized.&lt;br /&gt;Happy customer here!</li>
            <li> Every time i used it that felt skin is soft , I like it</li>
            <li> Good product, I&#x27;ll come back to buy it again.</li>
            <li> I gifted my best girlfriend this Serum. She said it does good for wrinkle absolutely.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping for this product. Great product that I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> added it to my yalmeh products and my perricone moisturizer in about three days I saw some difference in my forehead  a lot smoother and the lines are really less deep im in my 60s and a smoker who also loved coffee and tho ive altered some of my bad habits the damaged to my skin is a challenge and I like this stuff it doesn&#x27;t burn or cause any rosacea outbreaks but that&#x27;s me you don&#x27;t know what effects you until you buy it but this was definitely worth the money</li>
            <li> When I opened the bottle there was a foul smell and something (bacteria or fungi) in the dropper.</li>
            <li> I noticed it made my skin feel hydrated after I used it and also very healthy. This is a very high quality product that works very hard to fight again wrinkles and helps repair sun damaged skin. I go out in the sun a lot and get sunburn very often because i forget sun block all the time.</li>
            <li> What a terrific product! At 66 years old, my skin needs some help. This serum hydrates and has made such an improvement in my skin&#x27;s appearance. Softened lines, smoother, brighter skin. Will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Quality is okay, a little too thick and sticky. If used sparingly, works well, but use VERY sparingly. If you use even a tiny bit too much, your skin will feel a little tacky. Go very easy with it. Works as well as any average HA out there I guess. Sort of underwhelming. Nothing to gush about. You might try the  &amp;#34;BabyFace&amp;#34;  brand. I&#x27;ve used it for years and will stay with it for many more. Feels very light on your skin and the end result is far above average. Price is right too. I have no idea what made me go to a different brand.  Remember :::  BabyFace :::</li>
            <li> Decent product a little to thick and sticky</li>
            <li> Possibly order again!</li>
            <li> Purchased in May and open it on 7/13/15, as you can see something inside the tube, I believe this company has serious quality control issue.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product about 2 months ago as I was looking for a pure/clean Hylauronic Acid serum. All you need is one drop each time you use it. I followed the instructions and it completely delivered (past tense - for the first 6 weeks). Then it seems that the actual hyaluronic acid had disappeared and it was only deionized water left. What a disappointment. I had since seen other consistency issues. I could find no way to contact the company and they do not answer their phone. I was hoping to have them make good on this prior to posting. So take this as a warning.</li>
            <li> Great  product, performed exactly as advertised . Got my money&#x27;s worth and more !</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife and she really likes it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good serum, however, it seems thinner than other products.</li>
            <li> just started using this every day. I really like it</li>
            <li> Works really well.  Starting to see fewer fine lines and skin is smoother.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good.. I&#x27;m very happy</li>
            <li> my face skin have been changed shiny and smooth. it was well worth to me.</li>
            <li> Really  great For  my  skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wellmade stuff.</li>
            <li> I love Salvere products. This serum is really nice...</li>
            <li> Very excellent product. Softens and hydrates the skin, as expected.  Seems like a very pure preparation since even when used around the eyes and accidentally gets in them, causes no stinging or irritation.  How many products is that true for?  Also a tremendous bargain at $16.00 for a 2-3 month supply; a little goes a long way.  I think this product is probably better than many highly promoted &amp;#34;wrinkle elixirs&amp;#34; going for $50 to 100, although I haven&#x27;t actually tried any of these &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; formulas.</li>
            <li> It will take several weeks to notice reduced fine lines, but you will get the softening and hydrating effects the first day you use it.  The dropper dispenses a good size drop.  It has a nice consistency and feels silky smooth going on, not slimy or sticky.  Your skin should immediately feel softer.  I noticed a slight burning on my cheeks with it (it is an acid,) but nothing distracting or irritating.  I was provided a sample for review; however, I think the price of the serum is a good value since you get twice as much as most others for about the same price.  This size bottle will last several months of daily use.</li>
            <li> It would be five stars if it came with a box</li>
            <li> I love this serum, it&#x27;s easy absorbed</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for a month now and have begun noticing clearer skin. Historically, I could consider my skin to not be the best. However, the serum has helped hydrate, smooth, and even out the tone. My complexion, although not severe, typically has a blemish or two. But the serum has prevented blemishes from returning. I would recommend added this to your nighttime routine.</li>
