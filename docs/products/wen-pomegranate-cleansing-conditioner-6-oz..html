            <li>Good seller.</li>

            <li>it makes your hair feel and smell good</li>
            <li>it may not be good for everyones hair type..</li>
            <li>and I want it to still look good at night.</li>
            <li>I loved the results from Wen</li>
            <li>I have used the Original Mint, but this is the best.</li>
            <li>Hair One Cleanser is pretty good, if on a budget, but this is the best.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d say WEN works on me for about 4-5 hours, and looks best right away.</li>
            <li>Besides that, it&#x27;s the best thing going for hair right now in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Smells very strong like cherry cough syrup, not in a good way.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Still love the WEN!</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and gives a clean tingle, I loved it!</li>
            <li>but it was amazing as advertised.</li>
            <li>I tried Wen thinking it would do amazing things to my hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this since thinking something amazing was going to happen....</li>
            <li>so I knew what a nice product it is.</li>
            <li>To me it smells kind of like cherry cough syrup.  </li>
            <li>The Gardenia is my favorite, it smells so good.</li>
            <li>I used this sparingly &amp; liked the results.</li>
            <li>In fairness to the manufacturer, it does a very nice job on my fine, color treated hair.</li>
            <li>excellent product, leaves hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m never going to have amazing hair, but this is an improvement for sure.</li>
            <li>I have very fine baby hair-</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair.</li>
            <li>Chaz Dean should get the Noble Prize for his extensive work in creating these wonderful products.  </li>
            <li>It is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Just when I think my hair cannot get any softer and tangle free Mr. Dean comes up with another winner!  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;personally love both the mint and the pomegranate products.</li>
            <li>but I find myself having to wash my hair a bit more often.</li>
            <li>I have a Pomengranate Shampoo that smells better than this product.</li>
            <li>Love Wen and</li>
            <li>and you will never be able to rinse it out.</li>
            <li>and I have never been able to do that.</li>
            <li>I know some people love it, but I will never use it again.  </li>
            <li>Do not buy you can go on the Wen site or Qvc and get a better value</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m tempted to try WEN styling products to see if the combination would work better.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re much better than this product.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love WEN, I have since bought the Mango Coconut and Gardenia.</li>
            <li>if this product was cheaper i&#x27;d be more dedicated to it.</li>
            <li>I never have processed my hair and have always taken care of it but thought it could look even better.  </li>
            <li>Well I believed her and thought about those commercials and let me tell you there was so much more hair that I lost</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>the first day I liked it!</li>
            <li>So I just take the top off and dump it out.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a magic potion.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to like, love love the Pomegranate Cleansing.  </li>
            <li>I love Wen products.</li>
            <li>My hair is very soft, has great shine, looks healthy &amp; feels bouncy, something I&#x27;ve never felt.</li>
            <li>WEN makes my curls soft and beautiful with no frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product made my hair feel very soft and smelled great, but it did nothing for the frizz.  </li>
            <li>but by about day 12, I noticed that most of the descriptions in the tv ad/infomercial were beginning to be accurate for me.</li>
            <li>My hair was brittle, and as a result I had more breakage and damage than I&#x27;ve ever seen while using cheap shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>this Wen product conditioner really does your head good.</li>
            <li>Sometimes when it gets to the bottom of the container it doe snot come out as easy.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is not too strong either.</li>
            <li>I have fine wavy hair, and since this is supposed to work on ALL hair types, i figured i would give it a try.  </li>
            <li>Would not recommend this for fine hair at all...  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair and swear by it now</li>
            <li>I need just over 1 to saturate my hair -- that&#x27;s how fine it is.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that tends to be oily at the scalp and dryer on the ends.  </li>
            <li>HUGE PERK.  </li>
            <li>I love the Cleansing conditioner,But must of missed the size I was paying for I do not feel the size was worth the price I paid for 6 oz  </li>
            <li>While it did smooth out my hair, I noticed a lot of hair in my drain.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner is great, and only needed once a week</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s truely a dream come true for my hair!</li>
            <li>At first, I thought I&#x27;d love this because I&#x27;m growing my hair out to donate</li>
            <li>and i am so glad i did not waste any more on it then</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like ANY of the scents, and it kind of &#x27;burns&#x27; or &#x27;tingles&#x27; too much the first time you use it.</li>
            <li>i do like this product but have learned that to fully get the effect of it, you do need to use a good amount &amp; my hair is short.</li>
            <li>But as I&#x27;ve always said, wen products are way overpriced and they can&#x27;t get a 5 star rating from me until the price is more reasonable.</li>
            <li>liked that I didn&#x27;t need a seperate conditioner, but didn&#x27;t feel the results were significant enough to repurchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works okay as a styling gel, although it leaves your hair with the sticky, hard residue that most gels do if you use more than one pump.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely silky smooth now.</li>
            <li>Glad I don&#x27;t have to buy it direct.</li>
            <li>It smells good (and not like chemicals), which is really the only bonus about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not crazy about the smell though.  </li>
            <li>but it was old hair coming out and to continue because it would get better.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I liked about this product was the smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth trying to see if it work s for you.</li>
            <li>Of course I discontinued right away</li>
            <li>I dropped a star for this one because the pomegranate has a very strong smell especially once in the steamy shower.</li>
            <li>hair is very fine and soft by nature, so it didn&#x27;t benefit much from this.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The seller was very fast in the processing and delivery.</li>
            <li>It took about 2 weeks consistent use of this for me hair to &amp;#34;adapt&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>so essentially my hair is pretty healthy, not heat damaged and not chemically over processed.</li>
            <li>Stick to the higher quality shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love this product but presently out of work and can&#x27;t afford it</li>
            <li>Recently fell in love with WEN products.  </li>
            <li>Finally ordered after seeing so many commercials on this product.  </li>
            <li>I will use more as a deep conditioning treatment on occasion.</li>
            <li>The smell is divine but the way it treats my hair is more then i could imagine i have been using WEN for aprox 2 months and never ever wanna go back to shampoo again....</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t smell nice like the other Wen cleansing conditioners that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>My daughters have very thick, curly hair and liked it ok as a leave-in conditioner but didn&#x27;t like it as a shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have normal, healthy hair and will stick to maybe using this once a month as a deep conditioner until it runs out.</li>
            <li>you do use Wen for a while and then switch back to your normal shampoo, you WILL be able to tell a difference.</li>
            <li>I am of a mixed race &amp; have fine frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with this product it came rather quickly and lasted so much long than I had expected.</li>
            <li>I finally figured out that adding 1-2 pumps was way too much for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>It might be good if you have very dry hair overall, but I don&#x27;t recommend otherwise.</li>
            <li>The Pomegranate smells absolutely heavenly.  </li>
            <li>I have very stubborn unruly hair</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even use the whole bottle</li>
            <li>I like Wen&#x27;s products, but I just don&#x27;t much care for the smell of this one.  </li>
            <li>way to much one jar was one wash</li>
            <li>I have washed my hair twice with Wen and noticed my hair is much softer with shine.</li>
            <li>I had seen this on T.V and so much want to try it</li>
            <li>I have very frizzy, curly hair.</li>
            <li>I just wish it lasted longer and didn&#x27;t cost so much.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work and made my hair frizzy</li>
            <li>However, I did notice that after using it for a week or two my hair will start to look really greasy</li>
            <li>and I need to leave the house and go straight there.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work for my hair...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why they charge so much for it.</li>
            <li>Not so much...</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s just too much.</li>
            <li>I saw this WEN in tv and wanted it but was too much.</li>
            <li>It does not fall out as much as before, I really like</li>
            <li>and I use a flat iron lightly every day;</li>
            <li>I would love to know if there are any other discounts on hair treatment cleansing conditioner</li>
            <li>It did feel very clean after the first use, but after a week...same old thing, frizzy, and not what I expected.  </li>
            <li>i recommend for those who want to try wenn to do so but get some true blue and use a tad on just ur scalp to get the icth out then apply wenn.</li>
            <li>I love pomegranates but the WEN smelled odd.</li>
            <li>Works good on the frizzies also does what it says ,hair color last loaner and way less hair comes out when I brush it or shower!</li>
            <li>but it really does make your hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>Started using it a few months ago and I love it.  </li>
            <li>It might be good for people with thin hair.</li>
            <li>Seems ok when I get out of the shower, but about 4-6 hours later, my hair is super greasy and limp!</li>
            <li>I called the company right away and the girl I spoke with told me she had the same thing happen to her</li>
            <li>It is super soft after Wen, so I do have to add a texturizing spray (love Rusk Thick), but the combo is helping!</li>
            <li>Even my daughter will say that my highlights looks brand new after I use Wen.</li>
            <li>i normally wash my hair every other day &amp; by second day, my hair has gotten more oilier than the norm after using this.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t invest in a larger more expensive size.</li>
            <li>At first, I was skeptical about Wen since I have oily hair, but after using it for a while, I love it!</li>
            <li>there were so many other people experiencing the same thing.  </li>
            <li>I only wished I would have checked first to save my hair and my stress.</li>
            <li>but I noticed that my ends felt a little straw-like and not silky smooth.</li>
            <li>That really surprised me-</li>
            <li>let it fade to my natural medium brown color</li>
            <li>makes ur hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I use it as a conditioner for my hair instead of as directed and it still leaves my hair silky and soft.</li>
            <li>It worked well for her also, the only difference is that they had to leave it in longer than normal because we are black Bahamian, which was fine.</li>
            <li>I was washing my hair too much and just drying it out further.  </li>
            <li>It also took a lot of my natural color away</li>
            <li>It may work better for people with course thick hair.</li>
            <li>My hair was easy to comb through without tangleling and it left my hair soft,  but it left hair with a dry feeling after it dries.  </li>
            <li>Regarding WEN cleansing conditioner... I read the review and really wanted to believe the negative reviews weren&#x27;t true.</li>
            <li>My hair is usually really dry, but I&#x27;m positive it will work on oily hair as well.</li>
            <li>The roots of my hair were very greasy, the ends of my hair were still dry feeling.</li>
            <li>I was really hopeful trying this product, especially after seeing multiple infomercials and presentations on QVC.</li>
            <li>i had to use regular shampoo just to get my hair back to normal.  </li>
            <li>My hair is normal, my scalp isn&#x27;t dry or greasy.</li>
            <li>just a conditioner does not clean hair at all in fact a lot ofhair fell out every time i used it 5 times just wanted to make sure it was the product and not anything else waste of money and ......</li>
            <li>and I no longer have to use a straight iron to get the fly-aways to stay down.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s the right</li>
            <li>So it has its place, but I&#x27;ve had the same small container for months and rarely choose to use it.</li>
            <li>I had very dry hair over processed 46 year old hair and noe</li>

            <li> Do not buy you can go on the Wen site or Qvc and get a better value</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tempted to try WEN styling products to see if the combination would work better.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re much better than this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love WEN, I have since bought the Mango Coconut and Gardenia.</li>
            <li> if this product was cheaper i&#x27;d be more dedicated to it.</li>
            <li> I never have processed my hair and have always taken care of it but thought it could look even better.  </li>
            <li> Well I believed her and thought about those commercials and let me tell you there was so much more hair that I lost</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> the first day I liked it!</li>
            <li> So I just take the top off and dump it out.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a magic potion.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to like, love love the Pomegranate Cleansing.  </li>
            <li> I love Wen products.</li>
            <li> My hair is very soft, has great shine, looks healthy &amp; feels bouncy, something I&#x27;ve never felt.</li>
            <li> WEN makes my curls soft and beautiful with no frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product made my hair feel very soft and smelled great, but it did nothing for the frizz.  </li>
            <li> but by about day 12, I noticed that most of the descriptions in the tv ad/infomercial were beginning to be accurate for me.</li>
            <li> My hair was brittle, and as a result I had more breakage and damage than I&#x27;ve ever seen while using cheap shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> this Wen product conditioner really does your head good.</li>
            <li> Sometimes when it gets to the bottom of the container it doe snot come out as easy.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is not too strong either.</li>
            <li> I have fine wavy hair, and since this is supposed to work on ALL hair types, i figured i would give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Would not recommend this for fine hair at all...  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair and swear by it now</li>
            <li> I need just over 1 to saturate my hair -- that&#x27;s how fine it is.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that tends to be oily at the scalp and dryer on the ends.  </li>
            <li> HUGE PERK.  </li>
            <li> I love the Cleansing conditioner,But must of missed the size I was paying for I do not feel the size was worth the price I paid for 6 oz  </li>
            <li> While it did smooth out my hair, I noticed a lot of hair in my drain.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner is great, and only needed once a week</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s truely a dream come true for my hair!</li>
            <li> At first, I thought I&#x27;d love this because I&#x27;m growing my hair out to donate</li>
            <li> and i am so glad i did not waste any more on it then</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like ANY of the scents, and it kind of &#x27;burns&#x27; or &#x27;tingles&#x27; too much the first time you use it.</li>
            <li> i do like this product but have learned that to fully get the effect of it, you do need to use a good amount &amp; my hair is short.</li>
            <li> But as I&#x27;ve always said, wen products are way overpriced and they can&#x27;t get a 5 star rating from me until the price is more reasonable.</li>
            <li> liked that I didn&#x27;t need a seperate conditioner, but didn&#x27;t feel the results were significant enough to repurchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works okay as a styling gel, although it leaves your hair with the sticky, hard residue that most gels do if you use more than one pump.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely silky smooth now.</li>
            <li> Glad I don&#x27;t have to buy it direct.</li>
            <li> It smells good (and not like chemicals), which is really the only bonus about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the smell though.  </li>
            <li> but it was old hair coming out and to continue because it would get better.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I liked about this product was the smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth trying to see if it work s for you.</li>
            <li> Of course I discontinued right away</li>
            <li> I dropped a star for this one because the pomegranate has a very strong smell especially once in the steamy shower.</li>
            <li> hair is very fine and soft by nature, so it didn&#x27;t benefit much from this.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The seller was very fast in the processing and delivery.</li>
            <li> It took about 2 weeks consistent use of this for me hair to &amp;#34;adapt&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> so essentially my hair is pretty healthy, not heat damaged and not chemically over processed.</li>
            <li> Stick to the higher quality shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love this product but presently out of work and can&#x27;t afford it</li>
            <li> Recently fell in love with WEN products.  </li>
            <li> Finally ordered after seeing so many commercials on this product.  </li>
            <li> I will use more as a deep conditioning treatment on occasion.</li>
            <li> The smell is divine but the way it treats my hair is more then i could imagine i have been using WEN for aprox 2 months and never ever wanna go back to shampoo again....</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t smell nice like the other Wen cleansing conditioners that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> My daughters have very thick, curly hair and liked it ok as a leave-in conditioner but didn&#x27;t like it as a shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have normal, healthy hair and will stick to maybe using this once a month as a deep conditioner until it runs out.</li>
            <li> you do use Wen for a while and then switch back to your normal shampoo, you WILL be able to tell a difference.</li>
            <li> I am of a mixed race &amp; have fine frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product it came rather quickly and lasted so much long than I had expected.</li>
            <li> I finally figured out that adding 1-2 pumps was way too much for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> It might be good if you have very dry hair overall, but I don&#x27;t recommend otherwise.</li>
            <li> The Pomegranate smells absolutely heavenly.  </li>
            <li> I have very stubborn unruly hair</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even use the whole bottle</li>
            <li> I like Wen&#x27;s products, but I just don&#x27;t much care for the smell of this one.  </li>
            <li> way to much one jar was one wash</li>
            <li> I have washed my hair twice with Wen and noticed my hair is much softer with shine.</li>
            <li> I had seen this on T.V and so much want to try it</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I just wish it lasted longer and didn&#x27;t cost so much.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work and made my hair frizzy</li>
            <li> However, I did notice that after using it for a week or two my hair will start to look really greasy</li>
            <li> and I need to leave the house and go straight there.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for my hair...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why they charge so much for it.</li>
            <li> Not so much...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just too much.</li>
            <li> I saw this WEN in tv and wanted it but was too much.</li>
            <li> It does not fall out as much as before, I really like</li>
            <li> and I use a flat iron lightly every day;</li>
            <li> I would love to know if there are any other discounts on hair treatment cleansing conditioner</li>
            <li> It did feel very clean after the first use, but after a week...same old thing, frizzy, and not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> i recommend for those who want to try wenn to do so but get some true blue and use a tad on just ur scalp to get the icth out then apply wenn.</li>
            <li> I love pomegranates but the WEN smelled odd.</li>
            <li> Works good on the frizzies also does what it says ,hair color last loaner and way less hair comes out when I brush it or shower!</li>
            <li> but it really does make your hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> Started using it a few months ago and I love it.  </li>
            <li> It might be good for people with thin hair.</li>
            <li> Seems ok when I get out of the shower, but about 4-6 hours later, my hair is super greasy and limp!</li>
            <li> I called the company right away and the girl I spoke with told me she had the same thing happen to her</li>
            <li> It is super soft after Wen, so I do have to add a texturizing spray (love Rusk Thick), but the combo is helping!</li>
            <li> Even my daughter will say that my highlights looks brand new after I use Wen.</li>
            <li> i normally wash my hair every other day &amp; by second day, my hair has gotten more oilier than the norm after using this.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t invest in a larger more expensive size.</li>
            <li> At first, I was skeptical about Wen since I have oily hair, but after using it for a while, I love it!</li>
            <li> there were so many other people experiencing the same thing.  </li>
            <li> I only wished I would have checked first to save my hair and my stress.</li>
            <li> but I noticed that my ends felt a little straw-like and not silky smooth.</li>
            <li> That really surprised me-</li>
            <li> let it fade to my natural medium brown color</li>
            <li> makes ur hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I use it as a conditioner for my hair instead of as directed and it still leaves my hair silky and soft.</li>
            <li> It worked well for her also, the only difference is that they had to leave it in longer than normal because we are black Bahamian, which was fine.</li>
            <li> I was washing my hair too much and just drying it out further.  </li>
            <li> It also took a lot of my natural color away</li>
            <li> It may work better for people with course thick hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was easy to comb through without tangleling and it left my hair soft,  but it left hair with a dry feeling after it dries.  </li>
            <li> Regarding WEN cleansing conditioner... I read the review and really wanted to believe the negative reviews weren&#x27;t true.</li>
            <li> My hair is usually really dry, but I&#x27;m positive it will work on oily hair as well.</li>
            <li> The roots of my hair were very greasy, the ends of my hair were still dry feeling.</li>
            <li> I was really hopeful trying this product, especially after seeing multiple infomercials and presentations on QVC.</li>
            <li> i had to use regular shampoo just to get my hair back to normal.  </li>
            <li> My hair is normal, my scalp isn&#x27;t dry or greasy.</li>
            <li> just a conditioner does not clean hair at all in fact a lot ofhair fell out every time i used it 5 times just wanted to make sure it was the product and not anything else waste of money and ......</li>
            <li> and I no longer have to use a straight iron to get the fly-aways to stay down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s the right</li>
            <li> So it has its place, but I&#x27;ve had the same small container for months and rarely choose to use it.</li>
            <li> I had very dry hair over processed 46 year old hair and noe</li>
            <li> I will say that it did make my hair very soft, however, it made my scalp extremely itchy and coated, no matter how long I rinsed for.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft and silky without weighing it down</li>
            <li> I have long hair.</li>
            <li> and I have lots of grey&#x27;s which I didn&#x27;t before.  </li>
            <li> I love the Sweet Almond Mint, but this was terrible on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t done anything different other than using this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I am black-American and my hair can get ver dry even after adding moisturizer.</li>
            <li> ; I let my hair air dry with occassional blow drying</li>
            <li> It also made my hair feel dry.</li>
            <li> and I am mixed (half african american and half caucasian).  </li>
            <li> If money is no object, you must use this every single time you &#x27;wash&#x27; your hair.</li>
            <li> it weighed my hair down and it made my hair feel absolutely gross!!!  </li>
            <li> I have no doubt that this product works wonders for dry, damaged or unruly hair but my hair is not really any of those.</li>
            <li> I wish it came in larger bottles for less.</li>
            <li> but it did make my hair very dry.</li>
            <li> and I figured it was due to lack of vitamins or that my hair is just to dry.</li>
            <li> it felt as if I had an entire bottle of conditioner dried in my hair.</li>
            <li> and my hair is fuller not as thin and is much brighter now.</li>
            <li> I will not use any other hair care product.  </li>
            <li> They have other products they prefer over Wen.</li>
            <li> However, it is supposed to replace other hair products, so it might make up for it.</li>
            <li> That can make it pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> For the price this was definetly not worth it for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> (dark brown)and</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s difficult to keep it shiny and straight.  </li>
            <li> but it was not worth trying it again so under the sink it went .</li>
            <li> Love the product - hate the price</li>
            <li> and it calms it down.  </li>
            <li> Try other scents instead, don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> I can use less of the product  than recommended, but I leave it in my hair for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I followed directions given by Chaz on QVC, where he said to do half the indicated amount then rinse and repeat.</li>
            <li> I used half of what it called for...</li>
            <li> I looked it up in amazon and got it for way less.</li>
            <li> Hair is manageable, even the cow licks tame down.  </li>
            <li> so NOT washing it everyday</li>
            <li> It was too heavy for my hair and gave it an oily sheen.</li>
            <li> I have tried it a few times.</li>
            <li> By evening, my hair is an oily, limp mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> This made my hair look and feel heavy, dull, and just limp.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> (that&#x27;s all this size bottle lasts for) and my hair looks no better than if I&#x27;d used Dove Color Care Shampoo, which is a heck of a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> product is too expensive to use as a leave-in conditioner and ineffective as a total shampoo/conditioner combo.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money on this !</li>
            <li> 3 stars because it is pricey for the small amount.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I will continue to use this; will have to consider the cost vs outcome.</li>
            <li> you are not sure, then I suggest you do what I did and order a small amount to try.</li>
            <li> However by day 4 my hair felt like a grease slick.</li>
            <li> In all fairness to the product I will try it as an after shampoo conditioner using a very small amount but as a cleansing agent, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel very stiff and</li>
            <li> If you do not like the results, at least it can not do any damage.  </li>
            <li> For at least 2 years I&#x27;ve read the raves about WEN on the Q shopping channel forum before I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> I used this for about 6 weeks, and I saw nothing but negative effects.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and it did not work well for me.  </li>
            <li> Just because you can gouge, doesn&#x27;t mean you should.</li>
            <li> I completely expected to hate this and for it to not work...that it would leave my hair limp and puny.</li>
            <li> Something bad happened and of course Wen won&#x27;t tell you anything other than they&#x27;re not a doctor and can&#x27;t diagnose you.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been happier to be completely wrong.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with WEN...</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to order Wen because it&#x27;s expensive..</li>
            <li> I WAS WRONG</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d used every shampoo on the market from organics to expensive salon brands.</li>
            <li> This was a game changer for this girl!</li>
            <li> Sorry wen,</li>
            <li> Well I was shocked to see A LOT of my hair in the drain which I have never experienced before.  </li>
            <li> The directions say use something crazy like 20 pumps.</li>
            <li> I would have given it a five star rating but its expensive :(  </li>
            <li> it was so bad.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews &amp; there were some bad ones.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy!</li>
            <li> As a &amp;#34;cleansing&amp;#34; conditioner it failed me miserably.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, a very disappointing product.</li>
            <li> I hated this product as a shampoo.</li>
            <li> And it smells horrible!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for me.  I have short pixie and it makes my hair feel greasy.</li>
            <li> My allergist mentioned this product to me- I am horribly allergic to a couple different ingredients in most shampoos and many soaps. I used to leave the shower and start counting the hives. But not with this- which means I don&#x27;t have to take a medication to try to get rid of the hives. HUGE PERK.  I have very fine baby hair- so NOT washing it everyday isn&#x27;t an option either. It took about 2 weeks consistent use of this for me hair to &amp;#34;adapt&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s the right word- but by about day 12, I noticed that most of the descriptions in the tv ad/infomercial were beginning to be accurate for me. That really surprised me- I completely expected to hate this and for it to not work...that it would leave my hair limp and puny. I&#x27;ve never been happier to be completely wrong. I can use less of the product  than recommended, but I leave it in my hair for about 10 minutes. Makes a massive difference for me. Thank you, thank you for carrying this.</li>
            <li> I purchased the kit that QVC advertised on line and tried the Pomegranate.  It is fantastic!  Just when I think my hair cannot get any softer and tangle free Mr. Dean comes up with another winner!  I will not use any other hair care product.  Now, like another person put in their review.....what do I do with my Paul Mitchell and Loreal and everything else I&#x27;ve tried.  Please know, Wen cannot hurt your hair.  If you do not like the results, at least it can not do any damage.  It only puts moisture in.  The Pomegranate smells absolutely heavenly.  I wish Mr. Dean would make 16oz or 32oz bottles!  I would buy in a flash!  Chaz Dean should get the Noble Prize for his extensive work in creating these wonderful products.  If I could give this ten stars I would.</li>
            <li> I have fine wavy hair, and since this is supposed to work on ALL hair types, i figured i would give it a try.  YUCK!  it weighed my hair down and it made my hair feel absolutely gross!!!  I love the Sweet Almond Mint, but this was terrible on my hair.  i had to use regular shampoo just to get my hair back to normal.  Would not recommend this for fine hair at all...  Oh and i followed the directions to a T....</li>
            <li> I use this all the time so I knew what a nice product it is.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It works great and smells amazing. I have very stubborn unruly hair and it calms it down.  I&lt;br /&gt;personally love both the mint and the pomegranate products.</li>
            <li> Good product as it claims, but I find myself having to wash my hair a bit more often. It takes some getting use to because there is no lather. It basically feels like you are washing your hair with conditioner. In fairness to the manufacturer, it does a very nice job on my fine, color treated hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money! Leaves hair greasy looking</li>
            <li> just a conditioner does not clean hair at all in fact a lot ofhair fell out every time i used it 5 times just wanted to make sure it was the product and not anything else waste of money and ......hair dont believe the hype</li>
            <li> Regarding WEN cleansing conditioner... I read the review and really wanted to believe the negative reviews weren&#x27;t true. That said, I bought this once and will never buy it again. I didn&#x27;t even use the whole bottle it was so bad.</li>
            <li> I like Wen&#x27;s products, but I just don&#x27;t much care for the smell of this one.  To me it smells kind of like cherry cough syrup.  I have a Pomengranate Shampoo that smells better than this product.</li>
            <li> Love Wen and Glad I don&#x27;t have to buy it direct. Product is great I use it every day. Don&#x27;t follow the instructions it says 20 something pumps for each use I use 2. I have shoulder length hair it&#x27;s plenty. 20 pumps and you will never be able to rinse it out.</li>
            <li> I love the Cleansing conditioner,But must of missed the size I was paying for I do not feel the size was worth the price I paid for 6 oz  that was way to much one jar was one wash I have long hair.</li>
            <li> I was really hopeful trying this product, especially after seeing multiple infomercials and presentations on QVC. I followed directions given by Chaz on QVC, where he said to do half the indicated amount then rinse and repeat. I will say that it did make my hair very soft, however, it made my scalp extremely itchy and coated, no matter how long I rinsed for. I ended up needing to use a clarifying shampoo twice only 3 days into using Wen. Another drawback is the price of this product. Unfortunately, a very disappointing product.</li>
            <li> I am black-American and my hair can get ver dry even after adding moisturizer. I have washed my hair twice with Wen and noticed my hair is much softer with shine. I get lots of compliments on my hair. I would have given it a five star rating but its expensive :(  I may buy it again but I hear there is an off brand that is cheaper.</li>
            <li> For the price this was definetly not worth it for me.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the 6oz size to try it out, and it didn&#x27;t even last me 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I liked that I didn&#x27;t need a seperate conditioner, but didn&#x27;t feel the results were significant enough to repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very fine and soft by nature, so it didn&#x27;t benefit much from this.  It may work better for people with course thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of hair products and nothing is as good as WEN.  It&#x27;s the only thing i use on my hair now.</li>
            <li> Started using it a few months ago and I love it.  I can even go a day without washing and I have never been able to do that.</li>
            <li> I bought the 6oz. bottle of WEN Pomegranate to try the product out and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t invest in a larger more expensive size. This product did not impress me at all. My hair type is fine-to-medium, I color it once a year (dark brown)and let it fade to my natural medium brown color; I let my hair air dry with occassional blow drying and I use a flat iron lightly every day; so essentially my hair is pretty healthy, not heat damaged and not chemically over processed. I followed the directions, washed, combed through, let it set and rinsed. The result was underwhelming. It did not seem to change anything dramatically about my hair texture or managability. I have no doubt that this product works wonders for dry, damaged or unruly hair but my hair is not really any of those. I have normal, healthy hair and will stick to maybe using this once a month as a deep conditioner until it runs out. But after that I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> The fragrant isn&#x27;t good. The product really makes my hair limp and oily by next day.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks any way. bye</li>
            <li> At first, I thought I&#x27;d love this because I&#x27;m growing my hair out to donate and it&#x27;s difficult to keep it shiny and straight.  While it did smooth out my hair, I noticed a lot of hair in my drain.  The hair loss continued to the point it was clogging the shower. I even started taking Biotin.  Once I stopped using it (and used Dove, of all things) my hair loss stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this-- I know some people love it, but I will never use it again.  If you do want to buy some, start with the 6 oz and see how it works.</li>
            <li> Love the product - hate the price</li>
            <li> For at least 2 years I&#x27;ve read the raves about WEN on the Q shopping channel forum before I decided to try it. I have chin-length blonde (color-treated) hair; I&#x27;ve been using this almost 3 weeks (that&#x27;s all this size bottle lasts for) and my hair looks no better than if I&#x27;d used Dove Color Care Shampoo, which is a heck of a lot cheaper. I love pomegranates but the WEN smelled odd.</li>
            <li> I had seen this on T.V and so much want to try it and i am so glad i did not waste any more on it then what i did . talk about leaving your hair greasy , i would never buy this again , my hair did not respond well with Wen . grant it I only used it once but it was not worth trying it again so under the sink it went .</li>
            <li> Awesome product !! makes ur hair soft and shiny. Does take some time to rinse out but work great. Great for ur scalp as well.Good seller. Would buy again</li>
            <li> Was advertised as a regular size of Wen, it is a tiny travel size. Do not buy you can go on the Wen site or Qvc and get a better value</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy, curly hair. This product made my hair feel very soft and smelled great, but it did nothing for the frizz.  I&#x27;m tempted to try WEN styling products to see if the combination would work better.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t smell nice like the other Wen cleansing conditioners that I&#x27;ve tried.  Try other scents instead, don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> I hated this product as a shampoo. It was too heavy for my hair and gave it an oily sheen. My daughters have very thick, curly hair and liked it ok as a leave-in conditioner but didn&#x27;t like it as a shampoo. They have other products they prefer over Wen.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and it did not work well for me.  It might be good for people with thin hair.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very coarse and curly hair, and I&#x27;ve seen people rave about Wen all over the internet. Well, that hasn&#x27;t been my experience with it. I used this for about 6 weeks, and I saw nothing but negative effects. My hair was brittle, and as a result I had more breakage and damage than I&#x27;ve ever seen while using cheap shampoo and conditioner. It works okay as a styling gel, although it leaves your hair with the sticky, hard residue that most gels do if you use more than one pump. It smells good (and not like chemicals), which is really the only bonus about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is too expensive to use as a leave-in conditioner and ineffective as a total shampoo/conditioner combo. Stick to the higher quality shampoo and conditioner. They&#x27;re much better than this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product but presently out of work and can&#x27;t afford it I would love to know if there are any other discounts on hair treatment cleansing conditioner</li>
            <li> I love this product! I use it as a conditioner for my hair instead of as directed and it still leaves my hair silky and soft. My hair dresser said she has never seen my hair look so good. I had very dry hair over processed 46 year old hair and noe it looks healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller was very fast in the processing and delivery.</li>
            <li> It cleaned my hair as it should but it was amazing as advertised.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love WEN, I have since bought the Mango Coconut and Gardenia. The Gardenia is my favorite, it smells so good. The Mango Coconut smells great too but the Gardenia takes the cake!</li>
            <li> My hair was easy to comb through without tangleling and it left my hair soft,  but it left hair with a dry feeling after it dries.  It also didn&#x27;t leave any volumn.  It would just hang there and get greasy looking before the day was done. I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money on this ! I have tried it a few times. Seems ok when I get out of the shower, but about 4-6 hours later, my hair is super greasy and limp! And it smells horrible!</li>
            <li> I got this product for my girl friend to try, she has always had problem hair. I got the wen for her because my sister recommended it. It worked well for her also, the only difference is that they had to leave it in longer than normal because we are black Bahamian, which was fine.</li>
            <li> I used this sparingly &amp; liked the results. 3 stars because it is pricey for the small amount. However, it is supposed to replace other hair products, so it might make up for it. I am not sure if I will continue to use this; will have to consider the cost vs outcome.</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel so greasy!  It also made my hair feel dry.</li>
            <li> well wenn is awesome but the problem is my head is so itcy after using it and i apply conditioner too afterward. i recommend for those who want to try wenn to do so but get some true blue and use a tad on just ur scalp to get the icth out then apply wenn.</li>
            <li> Works good on the frizzies also does what it says ,hair color last loaner and way less hair comes out when I brush it or shower!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with WEN... The Pomegranate scent doesn&#x27;t provide the moisturizing that my hair needs like the Lavender or Coconut scents</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe this actually worked.  This is perfect for my hair type.  I have curly hair and I am mixed (half african american and half caucasian).  I was washing my hair too much and just drying it out further.  This stuff works great I just wish it lasted longer and didn&#x27;t cost so much.</li>
            <li> At first, I was skeptical about Wen since I have oily hair, but after using it for a while, I love it! It makes my hair so soft and silky without weighing it down and I no longer have to use a straight iron to get the fly-aways to stay down. Wen makes my hair look and feel healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are not sure, then I suggest you do what I did and order a small amount to try. The 6 oz bottle lasted me about 10-15 showers; however, I did not use it every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do use Wen for a while and then switch back to your normal shampoo, you WILL be able to tell a difference. It&#x27;s crazy! Give it a try!</li>
            <li> Recently fell in love with WEN products.  This conditioner is great, and only needed once a week so it lasts too!</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try Wen by ordering a small bottle first.  Wen works; however, it does take time for your hair to adjust.  Not crazy about the smell though.  Might prefer the almond mint.</li>
            <li> It is shampoo and conditioner in one. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> i do like this product but have learned that to fully get the effect of it, you do need to use a good amount &amp; my hair is short. i normally wash my hair every other day &amp; by second day, my hair has gotten more oilier than the norm after using this. if this product was cheaper i&#x27;d be more dedicated to it. i&#x27;ve been using garnier fight fall - amazing! if you have the means to be committed to this then it&#x27;s great for you!</li>
            <li> it makes your hair feel and smell good</li>
            <li> Finally ordered after seeing so many commercials on this product.  I never have processed my hair and have always taken care of it but thought it could look even better.  Well I was shocked to see A LOT of my hair in the drain which I have never experienced before.  I called the company right away and the girl I spoke with told me she had the same thing happen to her but it was old hair coming out and to continue because it would get better.  Also use the conditioner.  Well I believed her and thought about those commercials and let me tell you there was so much more hair that I lost and now I&#x27;m shedding, shedding, shedding and never has this happened.  Of course I discontinued right away and it hasn&#x27;t stopped.  I hadn&#x27;t done anything different other than using this shampoo.  It also took a lot of my natural color away and I have lots of grey&#x27;s which I didn&#x27;t before.  Something bad happened and of course Wen won&#x27;t tell you anything other than they&#x27;re not a doctor and can&#x27;t diagnose you.  I googled about Wen causing hair loss and my oh my there were so many other people experiencing the same thing.  I only wished I would have checked first to save my hair and my stress.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work and made my hair frizzy</li>
            <li> When I used this product, it made my hair feel even dryer than it was before. Ive seen people say if made their hair fall out, it didn&#x27;t do that to me but it did make my hair very dry.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to order Wen because it&#x27;s expensive.. but it really does make your hair shiny and soft. I love it. it may not be good for everyones hair type.. I have fine hair and swear by it now</li>
            <li> This product worked well, but the directions require you to use something like 20 pumps per shampoo, so if you use it regularly you will be going through the product in no time.  That can make it pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> I tried Wen thinking it would do amazing things to my hair. I WAS WRONG It made my hair feel very stiff and it felt as if I had an entire bottle of conditioner dried in my hair. I DO NOT recommend this product</li>
            <li> I buy wen once in awhile because I do like the way it makes my hair feel. However, I did notice that after using it for a week or two my hair will start to look really greasy and I switch off to a different shampoo and conditioner. My hair is normal, my scalp isn&#x27;t dry or greasy.</li>
            <li> The only thing I liked about this product was the smell. As a &amp;#34;cleansing&amp;#34; conditioner it failed me miserably. The roots of my hair were very greasy, the ends of my hair were still dry feeling. I don&#x27;t see how this product can be called a &amp;#34;cleanser&amp;#34;. In all fairness to the product I will try it as an after shampoo conditioner using a very small amount but as a cleansing agent, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> excellent product, leaves hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li> My daughter has fried her hair and is in need of some rescue. Purchased this for her in hopes that it would help her frazzled hair. She loves it and the way it makes her hair feel.</li>
            <li> I am of a mixed race &amp; have fine frizzy hair. I&#x27;d used every shampoo on the market from organics to expensive salon brands. Nothing ever felt as amazing as WEN! My hair is very soft, has great shine, looks healthy &amp; feels bouncy, something I&#x27;ve never felt. I can&#x27;t &amp; won&#x27;t use anything else. I read some reviews &amp; there were some bad ones. I guess everybody&#x27;s different. It&#x27;s definitely worth trying to see if it work s for you.</li>
            <li> I used half of what it called for...the first day I liked it! However by day 4 my hair felt like a grease slick. I will use more as a deep conditioning treatment on occasion.</li>
            <li> The smell is divine but the way it treats my hair is more then i could imagine i have been using WEN for aprox 2 months and never ever wanna go back to shampoo again....</li>
            <li> I have oily, curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s when WEN works: When I&#x27;m showering to go somewhere in the evening and I need to leave the house and go straight there. WEN makes my curls soft and beautiful with no frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s when it doesn&#x27;t work: When I wash my hair in the morning and I want it to still look good at night. By evening, my hair is an oily, limp mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say WEN works on me for about 4-5 hours, and looks best right away. So it has its place, but I&#x27;ve had the same small container for months and rarely choose to use it.</li>
            <li> My hair looks so different on days I do not use Wen. People notice it all the time. Even my daughter will say that my highlights looks brand new after I use Wen. I wish it came in larger bottles for less. Sometimes when it gets to the bottom of the container it doe snot come out as easy. So I just take the top off and dump it out. Still love the WEN!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for my hair... Waste of money for me. I don&#x27;t know why they charge so much for it.</li>
            <li> This was a game changer for this girl! I have very fine hair. The directions say use something crazy like 20 pumps. I need just over 1 to saturate my hair -- that&#x27;s how fine it is. But it looks fuller now! I&#x27;m never going to have amazing hair, but this is an improvement for sure. It is super soft after Wen, so I do have to add a texturizing spray (love Rusk Thick), but the combo is helping!</li>
            <li> I wanted to like it, but I&#x27;m just not a fan!  I have fine hair that tends to be oily at the scalp and dryer on the ends.  This made my hair look and feel heavy, dull, and just limp.  It might be good if you have very dry hair overall, but I don&#x27;t recommend otherwise.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product it came rather quickly and lasted so much long than I had expected. It smells amazing and gives a clean tingle, I loved it!</li>
            <li> I bought this since thinking something amazing was going to happen....Not so much...It smells nothing like Pomegranate or did ANYTHING for my hair.  It did feel very clean after the first use, but after a week...same old thing, frizzy, and not what I expected.  Maybe I needed the leave in treatment as well, but this was over rated.</li>
            <li> But as I&#x27;ve always said, wen products are way overpriced and they can&#x27;t get a 5 star rating from me until the price is more reasonable. Just because you can gouge, doesn&#x27;t mean you should. Sorry wen, but it&#x27;s just too much. Besides that, it&#x27;s the best thing going for hair right now in my opinion. lol! If money is no object, you must use this every single time you &#x27;wash&#x27; your hair. My hair is usually really dry, but I&#x27;m positive it will work on oily hair as well. I don&#x27;t like ANY of the scents, and it kind of &#x27;burns&#x27; or &#x27;tingles&#x27; too much the first time you use it. But it&#x27;s a magic potion. No lie.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to like, love love the Pomegranate Cleansing.  I have used the Original Mint, but this is the best. Hair is manageable, even the cow licks tame down.  Hair One Cleanser is pretty good, if on a budget, but this is the best.  Try it ladies.</li>
            <li> I started loosing my hair and I figured it was due to lack of vitamins or that my hair is just to dry. I saw this WEN in tv and wanted it but was too much. I looked it up in amazon and got it for way less. I tried it soon as I got it and my hair is fuller not as thin and is much brighter now. It does not fall out as much as before, I really like this Wen product conditioner really does your head good.</li>
            <li> Feels great on the hair. The fragrance is not too strong either.</li>
            <li> I love the pomegranate!!! It works miracles on my hair!!! I finally figured out how to use it correctly. The bottle recommends 1-2 pumps as a leave-in. I loved the results from Wen but I noticed that my ends felt a little straw-like and not silky smooth. I finally figured out that adding 1-2 pumps was way too much for my fine hair. A pea size amount works wonders!!! It&#x27;s absolutely silky smooth now. Pomegranate smells so wonderful and fruity. It&#x27;s truely a dream come true for my hair!</li>
            <li> I love Wen products. I dropped a star for this one because the pomegranate has a very strong smell especially once in the steamy shower. Smells very strong like cherry cough syrup, not in a good way. The product works great but because of the smell I suggest the fig fragrance for thicker/curly hair</li>
