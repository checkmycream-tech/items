            <li>Very good price.</li>
            <li>I think the results are very good for the price.</li>
            <li>My armpit hair is apparently incredibly stubborn.</li>
            <li>I used this on my face and have had nothing but incredible results.</li>
            <li>My wife loves these, they work great and this is the best deal on the internet!</li>
            <li>They worked great for me.</li>
            <li>my legs - it worked GREAT.</li>
            <li>So, once again, I am happy.</li>
            <li>My wife swears that this is a great product.</li>
            <li>These work great, as always.  </li>
            <li>great refills and even greater price on Amazon!</li>
            <li>I was impressed and felt the price was immediately justified even if the thing didn&#x27;t work anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good price for cartridges as well.</li>
            <li>I am always on the lookout for good deals on the cartridges.</li>
            <li>Good product&lt;br /&gt;Ordered</li>
            <li>this so good products because it works so good</li>
            <li>Works awesome and is the best product I have ever tried and believe me I tried a lot of different things.</li>
            <li>After using this for 8 months I&#x27;m very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>but these are cost effective and work just like the one that came with it.</li>
            <li>Virtually painless but effective.</li>
            <li>Kind of pricey</li>
            <li>They arrived on time and nicely packaged.  </li>
            <li>with commitment of never removing the hair on my own</li>
            <li>They work just fine and the price was good and got them on time</li>
            <li>and it has been the best investment so far for all of us.  </li>
            <li>than that, I am quite pleased with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cheap $7 ones for green/blue laser lights are not the appropriate kind.</li>
            <li>Perhaps with more treatments, it will work even better, but I haven&#x27;t gotten to that stage yet.</li>
            <li>That is probably a better solution.</li>
            <li>That is probably a better solution.</li>
            <li>Love the convenience of being able to do this at home and after paying to go to the dermatologist at $50.</li>
            <li>GREAT PRICE FAST SERVICE</li>
            <li>I was a bit agitated because for $9 more I could have had 120,000 flashes instead of three cartridges with 1,000 flashes each.</li>
            <li>I love my Flash &amp; Go.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this.  </li>
            <li>I love my Silk&#x27;n</li>
            <li>Make sure you don&#x27;t have any lotion on your skin before zapping.</li>
            <li>But considering that you need several sessions to get more prolonged results (not to mention the post treatment maintenance), it&#x27;s not the best value.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I also treated my arm hair which was a light brown, now gone!</li>
            <li>Armpit and genital hair are a bit more stubborn, perhaps cause it&#x27;s a thicker hair shaft.</li>
            <li>A couple more treatments</li>
            <li>and I believe, maybe, just maybe I will forever be hair free!</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m finished I&#x27;ll have about a grand into it.</li>
            <li>this is more than recommended by manufacturer</li>
            <li>love this price for product.</li>
            <li>i love the flash n go.</li>
            <li>great product fast shipping</li>
            <li>It works pretty good.</li>
            <li>I use this devise whenever I feel I need to remove couple of hairs and the very fine ones on my face.&lt;br /&gt;You will not end up with hair free face</li>
            <li>Everyone has different experiences, but the Flash N Go worked great for me, for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cartridges themselves go very quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>I was so exciting that they had a cartridge that held so many more pulses.</li>
            <li>Using it for a while so far so good :)</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize you had to use it many times to get the full result.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I had the black leg hair which gives the best results for this system.</li>
            <li>these are Replacement cartridges for the Silk&#x27;n Flash &amp; Go, the fit and work fine.  </li>
            <li>These are just as strong as the original one that was on my device.</li>
            <li>Works great on the Veet machine that is the same as Silk&#x27;n.</li>
            <li>They are individually boxed and are GREAT DEAL.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s good news for me, because I used to be a Wookie - you know, Italian women and the hair thing. &#x3D; )</li>
            <li>The original one that came with the device worked fine.</li>
            <li>To me it&#x27;s 100% worth it!</li>
            <li>I can get 1 1/2 full body runs out of it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*******I want to say something about this seller that they are very much a 5 star company, we had shipping issues and they were top notch on making things right.</li>
            <li>I personally think the cartridge could do more than 1000 flashes, but they limit it because they want to sell more cartridges.</li>
            <li>Maybe it does wear out quickly after that 1000 flash mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, discrete packaging.</li>
            <li>and I feel that around 1000 flashes might have been a pretty accurate number.</li>
            <li>go about 2 days without shaving, I am shaving mostly gray hairs away and even after 24 hours my face is still soft and pretty smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product with the understanding that it does not work overnight and will probably take over a year to see much success.</li>
            <li>Every two months its worth every penny.</li>
            <li>but it worth it</li>
            <li>I recommend all those who own this hair removal system to purchase these at this prices before they change it and could actually raise  it  if they wanted to by about $30.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>i go threw these a lot and the three pack is worth it.</li>
            <li>Make sure to keep the yellow part clean.  </li>
            <li>I am treating my full legs (from 3 inches above the knees), my underarms, my bikini, my chin, upper lip, and happy trail.</li>
            <li>Like everyone else, I went right up to the highest level, except in my bikini area, where I still use level 4.</li>
            <li>( I wonâ€™t let the hair be too long so you can effectively treat the roots)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If someone were willing to give me my $50 back, even with the one issue I have with the product, I would up it to 5 stars. &#x3D; )</li>
            <li>However, after the first use, I noticed that the unit lights up an already lit room.</li>
            <li>My goal is to be able to shave my armpits and make it look like I did actually shave them.</li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s a lot more expensive, I think professional laser is the way to go--if your skin is light enough for IPL or laser; for darker skin or for eyebrow hairs, electrolysis is the best.</li>
            <li>I WILL order more when it becomes necessary.</li>
            <li>I was able to complete a full treatment on all areas once and all of the smaller areas plus 1/2 of one leg</li>
            <li>This system does work but it may not be as effective as other options like laser.  </li>
            <li>Some of my friends have said to use them right away as they think they lose charges the older they get.</li>
            <li>I VERY LIGHTLY marked my legs with a pen - not in a full grid, but just with one evenly spaced row of dots.</li>
            <li>I VERY LIGHTLY marked my legs with a pen - not in a full grid, but just with one evenly spaced row of dots.</li>
            <li>I cannot be very certain how many flashes I used before having to change, but it seemed to be less than what was said.</li>
            <li>Great...thank you so much.</li>
            <li>The tougher, gray hair is still stubborn, but I will keep at it in the hopes that it will soften and eventually stop growing so much.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than purchasing through Veet.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if you will be able to find the same thing, since the seller probably barely broke even on my purchase.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After two years of using Flash and Go , my face looks so clean finally</li>
            <li>I decided to check on the light cartridges as they are limited to a certain amount of flashes and to my surprise, you can get 3 for the price of tow here at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>So far all is good with the one I&#x27;m currently using and there&#x27;re no worries as to whether the other 2 will be also.  </li>
            <li>I always count how many pulses I use and have used up 2 cartridges previously, both were aproximately 40 pulses over the 1000 stated.  </li>
            <li>After one year of use we all have ridden ourselves of the black hairs on our face and arms, our faces are much more radiant.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this if you have struggled with unwanted hair.</li>
            <li>I do highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>have fair skin with black hair , my skin is normal to dry .</li>
            <li>I also want to state that I have had many sessions with various types of professional laser hair removal treatments in my underarms, bikini, and legs - all with mixed results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, but not least, I want to give a warning.</li>
            <li>, but not least, I want to give a warning.</li>
            <li>and they returned it with no problem and gave me a new one.</li>
            <li>very fine hair on my chin except for couple of dark ones ( three actually ) thatâ€™s getting weaker .&lt;br</li>
            <li>First of all this is devise is one of two or three FDA approved for home use (that&#x27;s a big</li>
            <li>I am a MtoF transsexual, and use this item on my face, it will not work on gray hairs, or dark skin, or even blond hairs, but will over time greatly reduce black facial hair to almost nothing.</li>
            <li>The original cartridge that came with the device lasted ten times as long as each of these replacements.</li>
            <li>I purchased this set of three cartridges, and two of them were complete duds.</li>
            <li>And, even with the glasses, this is still WAY cheaper than professional hair removal services.</li>
            <li>I have not had that type of result with any of the professional treatments I have done so far.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work fully, but does work as well as professional treatments.</li>
            <li>However, I have also had professional treatments here</li>
            <li>I doubt complete hair loss in the cards for me, but we&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I doubt complete hair loss in the cards for me, but we&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never  to return anything to Amazon and really have no clue how to get my money back.</li>
            <li>If you didn&#x27;t shave close enough, it is powerful enough to smell burnt hair and can see it curl up as well.</li>
            <li>(so I missed my right leg and 1/2 of my left leg) on a second pass with one cartridge.</li>
            <li>Its light pulse not laser just to be clear , but it does the same thing burns the root of the hair just like laser , after the pulse you will smell the hair burning and you will see the dark one falls .</li>
            <li>I seriously doubt we get that many pulses per cartridge.</li>
            <li>The third lasted a bit longer, but not much (not even two full sessions on my legs).</li>
            <li>I actually didn&#x27;t even have to shave once between my first and second treatments.</li>
            <li>, I finally went for laser sessions with professional therapist .</li>
            <li>I have about completely eliminated my chin hairs and upper lips hairs.  </li>
            <li>If you use something to mark out grids on certain areas, PLEASE do NOT use anything with dark color.</li>
            <li>If you use something to mark out grids on certain areas, PLEASE do NOT use anything with dark color.</li>
            <li>I had hoped these would work :/ Have been using several months with only minimal effect on some of the fine hairs.</li>

            <li> Even though it&#x27;s a lot more expensive, I think professional laser is the way to go--if your skin is light enough for IPL or laser; for darker skin or for eyebrow hairs, electrolysis is the best.</li>
            <li> I WILL order more when it becomes necessary.</li>
            <li> I was able to complete a full treatment on all areas once and all of the smaller areas plus 1/2 of one leg</li>
            <li> This system does work but it may not be as effective as other options like laser.  </li>
            <li> Some of my friends have said to use them right away as they think they lose charges the older they get.</li>
            <li> I VERY LIGHTLY marked my legs with a pen - not in a full grid, but just with one evenly spaced row of dots.</li>

            <li> I cannot be very certain how many flashes I used before having to change, but it seemed to be less than what was said.</li>
            <li> Great...thank you so much.</li>
            <li> The tougher, gray hair is still stubborn, but I will keep at it in the hopes that it will soften and eventually stop growing so much.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than purchasing through Veet.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if you will be able to find the same thing, since the seller probably barely broke even on my purchase.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After two years of using Flash and Go , my face looks so clean finally</li>
            <li> I decided to check on the light cartridges as they are limited to a certain amount of flashes and to my surprise, you can get 3 for the price of tow here at Amazon.  </li>
            <li> So far all is good with the one I&#x27;m currently using and there&#x27;re no worries as to whether the other 2 will be also.  </li>
            <li> I always count how many pulses I use and have used up 2 cartridges previously, both were aproximately 40 pulses over the 1000 stated.  </li>
            <li> After one year of use we all have ridden ourselves of the black hairs on our face and arms, our faces are much more radiant.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this if you have struggled with unwanted hair.</li>

            <li> First of all this is devise is one of two or three FDA approved for home use (that&#x27;s a big</li>
            <li> I am a MtoF transsexual, and use this item on my face, it will not work on gray hairs, or dark skin, or even blond hairs, but will over time greatly reduce black facial hair to almost nothing.</li>
            <li> The original cartridge that came with the device lasted ten times as long as each of these replacements.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set of three cartridges, and two of them were complete duds.</li>
            <li> And, even with the glasses, this is still WAY cheaper than professional hair removal services.</li>
            <li> I have not had that type of result with any of the professional treatments I have done so far.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work fully, but does work as well as professional treatments.</li>
            <li> However, I have also had professional treatments here</li>

            <li> If you didn&#x27;t shave close enough, it is powerful enough to smell burnt hair and can see it curl up as well.</li>
            <li> (so I missed my right leg and 1/2 of my left leg) on a second pass with one cartridge.</li>
            <li> Its light pulse not laser just to be clear , but it does the same thing burns the root of the hair just like laser , after the pulse you will smell the hair burning and you will see the dark one falls .</li>
            <li> I seriously doubt we get that many pulses per cartridge.</li>
            <li> The third lasted a bit longer, but not much (not even two full sessions on my legs).</li>
            <li> I actually didn&#x27;t even have to shave once between my first and second treatments.</li>
            <li> , I finally went for laser sessions with professional therapist .</li>

            <li> and I would be left with equally spaced marks up and down my legs FOREVER.</li>
            <li> The first one I used in this pack seems weak.</li>
            <li> This machine works, see results the first time you use, and have at least 50% permanent hair loss after a few months.</li>
            <li> The facial hair is less as is the hair on my arms.</li>
            <li> The wavelength the Flash &amp; Go uses (475-1200nm) is similar to other Silk&#x27;N AND other IPL/HPL products that a study from Australia shows DO NEED safety glasses.</li>

            <li> I have been using these for almost a year, not as expected, but I will continue to try.</li>
            <li> tried everything plucking (a big mistake) , threading worked of the  growing hair not the ones under the skin, and electrolysis which was not effective if you have a lot of hair like me , painful , time consuming because they remove one hair at a time and it wonâ€™t work effectively .&lt;br</li>
            <li> For all the ladies and gentlemen who purchased the SLIK&#x27;N FLASH N GO Hair removal system, you know that it takes a few months to totally remove the hair once and for all.  </li>
            <li> So I spent $200.00 on the flash and go</li>
            <li> $120 is a small price to pay to save your eyesite later in life.</li>
            <li> I bet I&#x27;ve bought 10 of the other cartridges (I&#x27;ve been using it on my family and friends)  </li>

            <li> As time goes on, you do them less and less.</li>
            <li> and they have worked even less.</li>
            <li> I do have to touch up, but hairs are lighter, finer, and less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Ive also started working on my armpits and bikini -both of which have dramatically less and less hair with each treatment.  </li>
            <li> But you will end up with much less and thinner hair that will grow every few months and may be eventually disappear .&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical to order them because the extra cartridge that came with my unit was weak and didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tedious and time consuming process, since it only treats such a small area.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Firstly, I am a little annoyed that I just bought it last month</li>
            <li> waste your money it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I got my flash n go a few years ago.</li>
            <li> after a year of laser I started to go to the therapist every couple of months paying (50-100 dollars ) for few hairs here and there ,so I searched for home laser and that how I found this Devise, it saved me and still saving my hundreds of dollars</li>
            <li> and by dark I mean rough, black and annoying hair on my mustache on the sides of them , and the big nightmare my Chin and neck especially my chin</li>
            <li> ).&lt;br /&gt;Now I will explain why I gave it 5 stars , but first I will give you a background on my sick which will help you to decide if you should buy it or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Was a little slow in shipping.</li>
            <li> Sorry this products a big no no</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure what I think of the Flash &amp; Go yet.</li>
            <li> so black and thick !&lt;</li>
            <li> and it was so hard to commit)</li>
            <li> This is the area it works the least for me.</li>
            <li> what a waste of money I am so annoyed bottom line it doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> It makes your laser experience less expensive.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but some of them do quite well and some seem weak.</li>
            <li> I just figured they would all be weak.</li>
            <li> so I chose to treat the very hard to treat areas like my chin which looked like a man bear and went to the therapist every  month to remove the stubborn ones .</li>
            <li> if anything its worse cause you have to shave before using this item order for it to work</li>
            <li> They are advertised for approximately 750 pulses.</li>
            <li> It still works, but the results aren&#x27;t quite as dramatic.</li>
            <li> With each cartridge ranging from 38-45bucks, you can&#x27;t go wrong with 3 counts.</li>
            <li> 4 stars because the cartridges are expensive.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> so if I wanted to do all my face each time it would be very expensive  ,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the problem was, but I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate this hair.</li>
            <li> I used to hate having to shave every day and the annoying razor bumps.</li>
            <li> its disgusting</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased this set of three cartridges, and two of them were complete duds. Each cartridge didn&#x27;t even last through one session on my legs (and I only do below the knees). The third lasted a bit longer, but not much (not even two full sessions on my legs). The original cartridge that came with the device lasted ten times as long as each of these replacements. I don&#x27;t know what the problem was, but I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> Well my review isnt very good ive been using this product for almost a year now and i still dont see any changes if anything its worse cause you have to shave before using this item order for it to work so now when i dont use it i look like i have a beard and neck hair its disgusting .me personally dont reccomend it /im gonna try the tria instead cause thats supposed to be a real lazer and not some lamps that dont do anything but make the situation worse . Sorry this products a big no no</li>
            <li> It works pretty good.</li>
            <li> This machine works, see results the first time you use, and have at least 50% permanent hair loss after a few months.</li>
            <li> Great...thank you so much.</li>
            <li> I cannot be very certain how many flashes I used before having to change, but it seemed to be less than what was said. I did not count them. Having said that, I can tell the hair under my armpit is vanishing after using this for several months. The facial hair is less as is the hair on my arms. The tougher, gray hair is still stubborn, but I will keep at it in the hopes that it will soften and eventually stop growing so much. If you didn&#x27;t shave close enough, it is powerful enough to smell burnt hair and can see it curl up as well. Ughh! I hate this hair. I would recommend this product with the understanding that it does not work overnight and will probably take over a year to see much success. However, having said that, any of this gone is a blessing.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize you had to use it many times to get the full result.</li>
            <li> Was a little slow in shipping. Gets a lot of pulses out of this. Some of my friends have said to use them right away as they think they lose charges the older they get. They worked great for me.</li>
            <li> Works great on the Veet machine that is the same as Silk&#x27;n. Much cheaper than purchasing through Veet. They do not sell on Amazon but these are cost effective and work just like the one that came with it.</li>
            <li> Everyone has different experiences, but the Flash N Go worked great for me, for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, I am a little annoyed that I just bought it last month and it just dropped $50 in price, but what can ya do? If someone were willing to give me my $50 back, even with the one issue I have with the product, I would up it to 5 stars. &#x3D; )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I am quite pleased with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I would like to state that I did go ahead and purchase IPL approved safety glasses. The cheap $7 ones for green/blue laser lights are not the appropriate kind. I found a bunch of mixed information. But, here is the conclusion I came to. Silk&#x27;N states you don&#x27;t need safety glasses. However, after the first use, I noticed that the unit lights up an already lit room. That made me nervous. The wavelength the Flash &amp; Go uses (475-1200nm) is similar to other Silk&#x27;N AND other IPL/HPL products that a study from Australia shows DO NEED safety glasses. Here is the link to that study. [...]&lt;br /&gt;Glasses that are specifically approved for IPL use run around $70-$120. I found a pair on a well known auction site that starts with an &amp;#34;E&amp;#34; for around $30. I don&#x27;t know if you will be able to find the same thing, since the seller probably barely broke even on my purchase. However, do some research. $120 is a small price to pay to save your eyesite later in life. And, even with the glasses, this is still WAY cheaper than professional hair removal services. The ones I purchased were the Phillips LS-IPLB-206.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, you point and shoot the thing. Not hard to do, with a little yoga-like flexibility. Like everyone else, I went right up to the highest level, except in my bikini area, where I still use level 4. I have had it 1 month and done 2 treatments, 2 weeks apart, as is recommended in the instruction booklet. As time goes on, you do them less and less. I also want to state that I have had many sessions with various types of professional laser hair removal treatments in my underarms, bikini, and legs - all with mixed results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cartridges - I am treating my full legs (from 3 inches above the knees), my underarms, my bikini, my chin, upper lip, and happy trail. I am 5&#x27;4&amp;#34; and 140 lbs to give you an idea of surface area. I was able to complete a full treatment on all areas once and all of the smaller areas plus 1/2 of one leg (so I missed my right leg and 1/2 of my left leg) on a second pass with one cartridge. I tried to guestimate and I feel that around 1000 flashes might have been a pretty accurate number. I personally think the cartridge could do more than 1000 flashes, but they limit it because they want to sell more cartridges. But, who knows. Maybe it does wear out quickly after that 1000 flash mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my legs - it worked GREAT. No, that is an understatement. It worked AWESOME. I actually didn&#x27;t even have to shave once between my first and second treatments. I have not had that type of result with any of the professional treatments I have done so far. I was impressed and felt the price was immediately justified even if the thing didn&#x27;t work anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my bikini/happy trail - It doesn&#x27;t work fully, but does work as well as professional treatments. Perhaps with more treatments, it will work even better, but I haven&#x27;t gotten to that stage yet. There is a reduction in hair, and the hair still there is finer/thinner. That&#x27;s good news for me, because I used to be a Wookie - you know, Italian women and the hair thing. &#x3D; ) Keep in mind that I only use level 4 on this area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my underarms - This is the area it works the least for me. It still works, but the results aren&#x27;t quite as dramatic. However, I have also had professional treatments here and they have worked even less. My armpit hair is apparently incredibly stubborn. In this region on my body, any improvements is a big deal to me. So, once again, I am happy. My goal is to be able to shave my armpits and make it look like I did actually shave them. Up until now, the roots are so dark that even after shaving, there is still a residual shadow. I doubt complete hair loss in the cards for me, but we&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my face/chin - the hairs here are finer and lighter. However, they didn&#x27;t start that heavy or dark, so I am not sure how much better they can get. Once again, for the price, any improvement will make me happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last, but not least, I want to give a warning. If you use something to mark out grids on certain areas, PLEASE do NOT use anything with dark color. I VERY LIGHTLY marked my legs with a pen - not in a full grid, but just with one evenly spaced row of dots. I tried to avoid the actual pen marks, but the IPL targets dark things, so it left a residual. I was scared that it wouldn&#x27;t go away and I would be left with equally spaced marks up and down my legs FOREVER. I put on some vitamin E and it went away in a couple days. I saw a review where one girl used white eyeliner. That is probably a better solution. Anything other than pure white is a bad idea, though.

            <li> It arrived on time and as expected.  My wife swears that this is a great product.</li>
            <li> With each cartridge ranging from 38-45bucks, you can&#x27;t go wrong with 3 counts. It makes your laser experience less expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using flash n go for 2 years now. Worked wonderfully. I do have to touch up, but hairs are lighter, finer, and less noticeable. Good price for cartridges as well. Arrived quickly, discrete packaging.</li>
            <li> I bought the unit a year ago and it came with 2 cartridges. I don&#x27;t need these yet, because they last a long time. Virtually painless but effective. This saves time and money  not having to go the laser center for tx&#x27;s</li>
            <li> wanted to return after I didn&#x27;t get the Silk&#x27;nFlash device they wouldn&#x27;t take them back $90 spent for products I have no use for</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long for that piece.</li>
            <li> I like the overall system and the results are acceptable. The cartridges themselves go very quickly. They are advertised for approximately 750 pulses. I seriously doubt we get that many pulses per cartridge. I am always on the lookout for good deals on the cartridges.</li>
            <li> This system does work but it may not be as effective as other options like laser.  That may be expected for an at home system vs professional services.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for awhile and I am not seeing any results.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> The replacement cartrige burnd my skin. The original one that came with the device worked fine.</li>
            <li> Kind of pricey and I&#x27;m not sure what I think of the Flash &amp; Go yet.</li>
            <li> Works awesome and is the best product I have ever tried and believe me I tried a lot of different things. Love the convenience of being able to do this at home and after paying to go to the dermatologist at $50. Every two months its worth every penny. I used to hate having to shave every day and the annoying razor bumps. This not only took away all the hair but smoothed my skin out in record time. I highly recommend this if you have struggled with unwanted hair. I used this on my face and have had nothing but incredible results.</li>
            <li> Easy to use does the job will recommend to anybody. Like the ease to get extra cartridges will repeat purchase</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so convenient to get a 3 pack when you know you&#x27;ll be using the flash &amp; go a lot.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRICE FAST SERVICE</li>
            <li> So I bought this and after I purchased it I found out that the website has a LUX Infinity cartridge that has 120,00 flashes for $99. I was a bit agitated because for $9 more I could have had 120,000 flashes instead of three cartridges with 1,000 flashes each. T_T I bought the LUX Infinity cartridge on the Silkn website and hopefully it will save be a ton of money. I love my Flash &amp; Go.</li>
            <li> My wife says she loves them, and they work!!! I have seen it in action and these things make the night time a little smoother if you know what I mean. Wink, Wink!</li>
            <li> They arrived on time and nicely packaged.  So far all is good with the one I&#x27;m currently using and there&#x27;re no worries as to whether the other 2 will be also.  I always count how many pulses I use and have used up 2 cartridges previously, both were aproximately 40 pulses over the 1000 stated.  I gave 4 stars only because it&#x27;s not possible to know until I have actually used them all.</li>
            <li> Good product&lt;br /&gt;Ordered it for my silk&#x27;n hair removal system. Using it for a while so far so good :)</li>
            <li> I have been using these for almost a year, not as expected, but I will continue to try.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Very good price. I think the results are very good for the price.</li>
            <li> I love my Silk&#x27;n Flash&amp;Go Hair Removal Device.  The replacement Cartridge gets about 1000 zaps before needing replacement.  Make sure to keep the yellow part clean.  I think finger prints burns them out quicker.  Make sure you don&#x27;t have any lotion on your skin before zapping.</li>
            <li> 4 stars because the cartridges are expensive.</li>
            <li> My wife loves these, they work great and this is the best deal on the internet!</li>
            <li> great refills and even greater price on Amazon!</li>
            <li> these are Replacement cartridges for the Silk&#x27;n Flash &amp; Go, the fit and work fine.  I have not used them enough to see how long the bulb life is.</li>
            <li> this so good products because it works so good</li>
            <li> But I wish the cartridges lasted longer. I can get 1 1/2 full body runs out of it.</li>
            <li> I think each cartridge should last longer. I end up using one cartridge for one session (both legs, arms, under arm, bikini area, and upper lip). But considering that you need several sessions to get more prolonged results (not to mention the post treatment maintenance), it&#x27;s not the best value.</li>
            <li> what a waste of money I am so annoyed bottom line it doesn&#x27;t work it will take 5 - 10 trigger pulls before it works then it will work for about 3 flashes in a row then stop working and shut shut off. I got my flash n go a few years ago. I LOVE IT. I was so exciting that they had a cartridge that held so many more pulses. I bet I&#x27;ve bought 10 of the other cartridges (I&#x27;ve been using it on my family and friends)  I only had one cartridge not work and I returned it to Bed bath and beyond and they returned it with no problem and gave me a new one. I&#x27;ve never  to return anything to Amazon and really have no clue how to get my money back. This has just been a pain. I hope I just got one that was messed up and that all of them aren&#x27;t like mine. Grrrrr</li>
            <li> I purchased this set and was cheaper than buying individually at Beth Bath and Beyond. I&#x27;ve noticed hair in my back is thinner.</li>
            <li> After using this for 8 months I&#x27;m very satisfied with the results. Fortunately, I had the black leg hair which gives the best results for this system. I also treated my arm hair which was a light brown, now gone! Armpit and genital hair are a bit more stubborn, perhaps cause it&#x27;s a thicker hair shaft. A couple more treatments and I believe, maybe, just maybe I will forever be hair free! It takes patience, time and money to do thorough treatments. When I&#x27;m finished I&#x27;ll have about a grand into it. This includes buying the system and all the cartridges. To me it&#x27;s 100% worth it! My only wish would be for a larger cartridge to treat areas like legs. It&#x27;s a tedious and time consuming process, since it only treats such a small area. This is why I gave it a 4 instead of 5 rating.</li>
            <li> I am a MtoF transsexual, and use this item on my face, it will not work on gray hairs, or dark skin, or even blond hairs, but will over time greatly reduce black facial hair to almost nothing. I can now after about 1 year of using it go about 2 days without shaving, I am shaving mostly gray hairs away and even after 24 hours my face is still soft and pretty smooth to the touch. my black facial hair is almost gone now.&lt;br /&gt;the cartridges say they are 1000 flashes. I had 2 that came with the unit I bought in 2013 and got 980 and 800 flashes out of each cartridge, I use about 50 flashes on my face during each treatment, and I know I&#x27;m not supposed to but I use this several times a week. this is more than recommended by manufacturer but I&#x27;m not burning my face.&lt;br /&gt;*******I want to say something about this seller that they are very much a 5 star company, we had shipping issues and they were top notch on making things right. buy from these people with confidence.*******</li>
            <li> First of all this is devise is one of two or three FDA approved for home use (that&#x27;s a big +).&lt;br /&gt;Now I will explain why I gave it 5 stars , but first I will give you a background on my sick which will help you to decide if you should buy it or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fair skin with black hair , my skin is normal to dry . I started having dark hair on my face since early 20s (am 35 now) and by dark I mean rough, black and annoying hair on my mustache on the sides of them , and the big nightmare my Chin and neck especially my chin so black and thick !&lt;br /&gt;I tried everything plucking (a big mistake) , threading worked of the  growing hair not the ones under the skin, and electrolysis which was not effective if you have a lot of hair like me , painful , time consuming because they remove one hair at a time and it wonâ€™t work effectively .&lt;br /&gt;So , I finally went for laser sessions with professional therapist . it took me a year  to clear my face from the dark hair on my chin ,neck and side face ( coasted me over $2000 ! with commitment of never removing the hair on my own I had to wait in between sessions and it was so hard to commit) but it worth it .&lt;br /&gt; laser therapist charge for the spot so if I wanted to do all my face each time it would be very expensive  , so I chose to treat the very hard to treat areas like my chin which looked like a man bear and went to the therapist every  month to remove the stubborn ones . after a year of laser I started to go to the therapist every couple of months paying (50-100 dollars ) for few hairs here and there ,so I searched for home laser and that how I found this Devise, it saved me and still saving my hundreds of dollars and it worked at the convenient of my home.&lt;br /&gt;Itâ€™s comes with a CD to show you how to use it . Itâ€™s very simple , has 5 levels of heats I use 4-5 as my skin tolerates the heat. Its light pulse not laser just to be clear , but it does the same thing burns the root of the hair just like laser , after the pulse you will smell the hair burning and you will see the dark one falls . ( I wonâ€™t let the hair be too long so you can effectively treat the roots)&lt;br /&gt;I use the devise on my face only once a month or couple of months  , it does decrease the growth of hair . Idonâ€™t have any hair on my checks , neck, sides . very fine hair on my chin except for couple of dark ones ( three actually ) thatâ€™s getting weaker .&lt;br /&gt;After two years of using Flash and Go , my face looks so clean finally no threading every week I havenâ€™t thread my face for so long I use this devise whenever I feel I need to remove couple of hairs and the very fine ones on my face.&lt;br /&gt;You will not end up with hair free face , that wonâ€™t happen But you will end up with much less and thinner hair that will grow every few months and may be eventually disappear .&lt;br /&gt;It comes with two cartridge ,I finished one and am using the second one now , am planning to buy a refill soon . didnâ€™t buy the glasses I just close my eyes.</li>
            <li> For all the ladies and gentlemen who purchased the SLIK&#x27;N FLASH N GO Hair removal system, you know that it takes a few months to totally remove the hair once and for all.  I decided to check on the light cartridges as they are limited to a certain amount of flashes and to my surprise, you can get 3 for the price of tow here at Amazon.  They are individually boxed and are GREAT DEAL.  I recommend all those who own this hair removal system to purchase these at this prices before they change it and could actually raise  it  if they wanted to by about $30.  Get in on it while they still last.</li>
            <li> I had hoped these would work :/ Have been using several months with only minimal effect on some of the fine hairs. Even though it&#x27;s a lot more expensive, I think professional laser is the way to go--if your skin is light enough for IPL or laser; for darker skin or for eyebrow hairs, electrolysis is the best.</li>
            <li> I have bought these disposable cartridges several times. I don&#x27;t know why, but some of them do quite well and some seem weak. The first one I used in this pack seems weak. It does not seem to do its job in 1 flash.</li>
            <li> love this price for product.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical to order them because the extra cartridge that came with my unit was weak and didn&#x27;t last long. I just figured they would all be weak. I was wrong. These are just as strong as the original one that was on my device. Definitely worth the price. I WILL order more when it becomes necessary.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t purchase the laser hair removal without having a backup of cartridges..</li>
            <li> These work great, as always.  This is the cheapest place to get them that I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> i go threw these a lot and the three pack is worth it. i love the flash n go.</li>
            <li> I have spent thousands of dollars at the salons to have my facial hair removed, with no guarantee. I finally couldn&#x27;t afford it anymore, but still had all this facial hair, so my daughter who at the time was working at Ultra suggested I try this Flash and Go hair removal system.  I thought what do I have to loss at this point in time. So I spent $200.00 on the flash and go and it has been the best investment so far for all of us.  My daughters use it and have ridden themselves of all their facial hair, especially the mustache. I am Italian and my daughters are half Italian and Iranian, so we have dark thick black hair.  After one year of use we all have ridden ourselves of the black hairs on our face and arms, our faces are much more radiant. I do highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> They work just fine and the price was good and got them on time</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 3 months now.  I have about completely eliminated my chin hairs and upper lips hairs.  Ive also started working on my armpits and bikini -both of which have dramatically less and less hair with each treatment.  I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> great product fast shipping</li>
