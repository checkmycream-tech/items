            <li>I cant say enough great things about this wonderful product.  </li>
            <li>use it for your own piece of mind, but what works is diet and exercise, everything is a gimmick</li>
            <li>This is my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>I really liked this product and it arrived</li>
            <li>Just got it, feels tingly and rubs in nice.</li>
            <li>it was kind of disappointing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Skinny Cream is quite effective at diminishing the appearance of cellulite, but keep in mind that is not an overnight miracle worker.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Skinny Cream for a couple months now along with my workout plan and I am loving the results.</li>
            <li>but the cream has made my skin feel so nice.</li>
            <li>it is effective.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy it, and will continue to invest in more!!</li>
            <li>the smell its light and pleasant</li>
            <li>It also smells pretty good!</li>
            <li>I really want to thank the makers of this skinny cream for having come up with such an effective and superb product…I feel great about my skin and it has even boosted my confidence!!</li>
            <li>I made the right choice!!!</li>
            <li>This is very good and reasonable price.</li>
            <li>but since the seller won&#x27;t make good on the free bottle opportunity I guess I&#x27;ll never know....</li>
            <li>Nice moisture, but you&#x27;re better off buying the Jergens or St. Ives firming lotion...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it more than a month now and am thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li>this by far is one of the best.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
            <li>and she would buy it again; it has a pleasant smell  and absorbs quickly</li>
            <li>I SAW A GREAT IMPROVEMENT WITH THE FIRST ONE</li>
            <li>This product is great and does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s too good to be true..</li>
            <li>According to me this particular skinny cream product is indeed one of the best cellulite reduction creams that are currently available in the market…thank God</li>
            <li>The product goes on very smooth, not greasy or any odor.</li>
            <li>They seem pretty happy with it and have recommended the product many times.</li>
            <li>Will continue to use, doesn&#x27;t smell to good but smells goes away quickly</li>
            <li>The cellulite reduction skinny cream is easy to apply and has a nice smell.</li>
            <li>The cream restored my skin and now it&#x27;s smooth and healthy!</li>
            <li>Skinny Cream is very smooth and feels lovely.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel very smooth as well, which I love.</li>
            <li>Before I started the medication that started a huge influx on my weight (10 pounds every do month!)</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s when I noticed an ever better improvement to my skin&#x27;s appearance, feel and touch.</li>
            <li>WHICH IS PROMINENT...</li>
            <li>Probably my results would be even better if I used it every day.</li>
            <li>Eat healthy for maximum effect&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a fitness freak</li>
            <li>and I have found the results overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed how this cream is helping to tighten the skin as I continue with my weekly workouts.</li>
            <li>This takes time and should be used along with a healthy diet and</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product :)</li>
            <li>I could never get rid of without a healthy diet and exercise.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love the way it glides on and feels so silky.  </li>
            <li>I love this and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>However if you are looking for a magical, bipity bopity boo solution then keep waiting.</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t know if it does it better than a $10 cream.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying more.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for such a great product!!!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and the product works great.</li>
            <li>just don&#x27;t expect it can work in one day as magic.</li>

            <li>yes like many women I have some issues with skin tone and cellulite.  </li>
            <li>I could never get rid of without a healthy diet and exercise.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t doubt that it will keep helping :)</li>
            <li>My thighs look firmer for sure.</li>
            <li>and so glad I decided to try this.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, it goes on smoothly</li>

            <li>Love this product and can&#x27;t wait to see what results I have after 8 weeks.</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>My legs are smoother, tighter, and have more TONE.</li>
            <li>&amp;#60;3 :)</li>
            <li>Her legs and thighs are noticeably smoother and more shapely, and after almost a month of use</li>
            <li>but 3 pregnancies do change your body for sure</li>
            <li>am allergic to most skin creams</li>
            <li>I’m glad I got it because I now have almost cellulite free-thighs and better looking skin.</li>
            <li>This does not work magic on cellulite.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>It smells okay to me-</li>
            <li>Again, love this product..</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll  love it.</li>
            <li>I do exercise, eat healthy food and drink a lot of water.</li>
            <li>This product has so many benefits, I&#x27;m not even sure where to begin.</li>
            <li>I also can&#x27;t get enough of the wonderful smell of this cream.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Hey, I&#x27;ve got some cellulite that I&#x27;d love to get rid of.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m already dieting, exercising and drinking more than my recommended water, so why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
            <li>so I can only give this a 3-star rating at best.</li>
            <li>but I have always had some cellulite like many women.</li>
            <li>I found them to be mostly harmless ingredients, although one preservative in it called METHYLISOTHIAZOLINONE</li>
            <li>Been using the said product with a body wrap and it makes me sweat more during work outs.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t more than two weeks I was seeing results.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I know I wasn&#x27;t :)</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, great customer service.</li>
            <li>and I can see o lot improvement in my skin most of all my belly.</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t quite sure.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I got the opportunity.</li>
            <li>I was expecting something fruity,  possibly a light dial soap kind of sent</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure this is helping also.</li>
            <li>she likes it a lot saying it is better than the one she used before.</li>
            <li>I eat healthy, work out 6 days a week and drink plenty of water</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t magically erase my cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s a lovely firming lotion but your cellulite won&#x27;t start disappearing.</li>
            <li>i love how this product works</li>
            <li>/&gt;this product make more efective , come on time</li>
            <li>Love it made my leg softer and tone</li>
            <li>the cellulite get much better</li>
            <li>Each week I see more of an improvement.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Fantastic cream!</li>
            <li>I love the way this cream makes my cream look.</li>
            <li>would repurchase when i am done!:)</li>
            <li>Overall, I think it is one of the best products I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>Of course, I eat healthy and exercise which helps.  </li>
            <li>The smell of it could be better.</li>
            <li>Just started using all over my body, also bought 4 more bottles today.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting more</li>
            <li>My thighs don&#x27;t have as many lumps anymore.</li>
            <li>and I exercise 3-5 times a week, drink water and eat fairly healthy.  </li>
            <li>so glad i got to test free for review!</li>
            <li>Works into top layers of adipose tissue/fat.</li>
            <li>and I m thinking to get more to have a better result..</li>
            <li>So along with that, I have been pleased.</li>
            <li>I will surely be  buying more.</li>
            <li>I love in Hawaii</li>
            <li>I am looking forward to see greater results with more use, it does have a almost unnoticeable smell and I like that the tube stands up on its cap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricy, but I decided to buy another bottle to keep trying it and see if it does anything else with more use.</li>
            <li>After I&#x27;d used it for awhile I got more use to it, but it&#x27;s something I can see some would have a problem with.</li>
            <li>By the time my wedding rolls around, I will feel much more confident.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it every day and love the results.</li>
            <li>My skin has become healthy too</li>
            <li>My wife love it.</li>
            <li>However, in the meantime I have noticed firmer skin, better skin tone, and well moisturized skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will continue to use this for another month since many reviewers swear by this stuff</li>
            <li>and I will be sure to update in 30</li>
            <li>will be continuing with the skinny cream forever :)</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I love it and will continue to buy it as I think it works wonders.  </li>
            <li>I layer this on after my shower in the morning and again most nights before bed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>also have been applying this to my belly and legs, which both need a bit more work, but there has been improvement.</li>
            <li>This has an interesting scent, halfway between cocoa butter and suntan lotion.</li>
            <li>I cant imagine using this for a month and what this magical cream can do.</li>
            <li>Im glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>So my results, which were excellent, were achieved using the product only once a day on most days.</li>
            <li>But I did gain even more cellulite from the weight gain.</li>
            <li>And besides that, I just love how smooth it makes my legs feel!</li>
            <li>But I did gain even more cellulite from the weight gain.</li>

            <li>Excited to see if gets better!</li>
            <li>and I was so pleased with the others&#x27; reviews that I had to try a bottle for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Skinny Cream combined with drinking water, eating healthy, working out, and using a cellulite massager has worked WONDERS for me.</li>
            <li>and I try to eat healthy</li>
            <li>I have to use a separate moisturizer on top of Skinny cream</li>
            <li>Fantastic product!</li>
            <li>Our latest one was almost 10 pounds at birth, and my wife is a petite lady</li>
            <li>simply the best...</li>
            <li>i really feel happy for finding this...</li>
            <li>This product really works great..  </li>
            <li>Use this product:)</li>
            <li>MY LEGS LOOK SO MUCH BETTER SINCE I STARTED USING THIS.  </li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, I just ordered 10 more tubes last night, that is how pleased I am with this product!!!</li>
            <li>But I think it&#x27;s a great product to use during warm weather when you&#x27;ll be wearing shorts or a bathing suit or before major events where you&#x27;ll be wearing a dress that shows your legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There was a significant discount on this product which was nice</li>
            <li>I am in my 50&#x27;s and can say it is a great product for older women.</li>
            <li>Highly reccomend, great bang for the buck.</li>
            <li>I think an very reasonable alternative for the time being is using this cream along with good exercise, water etc...</li>
            <li>Excellent product, lasted a long time.</li>
            <li>Looked pretty good.</li>
            <li>Good product and Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have to say this stuff is pretty good as diminishing cellulite and making your skin look smoother.</li>
            <li>I was really intrigued when I saw Skinny Cream and was thrilled to have a chance to order it through a promotion in order to provide my honest and unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To top it off, the seller just ignored all my calls and messages to get a free bottle as it says on the top of bottle to do.</li>
            <li>bought this cream because of good reviews, and now I can say that I agree with all positive reviews: this cream works.</li>
            <li>really happy with my results so far!</li>
            <li>With a good habbit of eating right and applying this, it has made my skin smooth</li>
            <li>Despite the ingredients of raspberry and coffee bean, Skinny Cream didn’t have a really nice smell (but it didn’t exactly stink, either!)  </li>
            <li>So far great product.</li>
            <li>and so far I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep using the product but not too happy so far.</li>
            <li>Skin is more smooth.</li>
            <li>I have used this product faithfully (day and night for 3 weeks) and yes, it does produce an okay smell, it does go on smoothly and it firms some areas BUT not all...</li>
            <li>I have already seen results in the water retention phase and I will be buying more of this fantastic product.</li>
            <li>It made my skin look so smooth and way better.</li>
            <li>exercise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this Skinny Cream complimentary in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>I just lie to her like any good husband would, or one that wants to avoid a verbal beating.  </li>
            <li>This did absolutely nothing for me, didn&#x27;t even smell good, took forever to absorb and produced no results whatsoever.</li>
            <li>i just have to share my good news with everybody who wants to be skinny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would not recommend SKINNY CREAM unless you really want to alienate your loved ones.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the investment even when it isn&#x27;t at a promo price for an honest opinion.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing seen improvement in my skin within a week of use and smells really good</li>
            <li>It is very easy to spread on and it absorbs quickly into my skin.</li>
            <li>i feel the cream works and helps only because  i combine it with working out and a good diet!</li>
            <li>I am really excited to see what will happen in 7 more weeks using this product.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to see the difference a full bottle makes!</li>
            <li>In combination with exercise, and eating healthy, this is a great addition for those areas that need an extra lift.</li>
            <li>The bottle is practical and easy to dispense.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>I saw results very quickly after using Skinny Cream on my thighs.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t gain weight easily</li>
            <li>have struggled with cellulite since hitting my mid 40&#x27;s, so it&#x27;s great to see that my body is getting better day by day.</li>
            <li>The creme was easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>I was very, very, pleasantly surprised and am very impressed that a cream can reduce my cellulite as much as it does.</li>
            <li>I was very, very, pleasantly surprised and am very impressed that a cream can reduce my cellulite as much as it does.</li>
            <li>And the smell is strong.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like how strong the smell is, though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rather strong.</li>
            <li>but it is (1) strong and (2) long-lasting.</li>
            <li>Except for the strong fragrance, after two days of using this cream, the skin on my thighs looked firmer so will continue using it.</li>
            <li>Some may find the smell a bit strong, but in this case I would suggest you apply it before bedtime.</li>
            <li>cream has a strong smell.  </li>
            <li>This cream has a strong scent but you will get use to it after while</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m loving the product!</li>
            <li>I love this cream because I am losing  belly fat very easy and very</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, and a pleasant surprise it is, this stuff actually works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing, i would totally recommend this to anyone that is trying to reduce the appearance of cellulite and it works great for such a good price.</li>
            <li>, the smell of the lotion is aweful, the price I think is fair if your looking for something new to try</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been feeling so much more confident thanks to this cream!</li>
            <li>It applies easily and has a light, pleasing scent.</li>
            <li>Enjoyed this tremendously.</li>
            <li>I really like this Skinny Cream because it is making my thighs look better!</li>
            <li>I have been using this cream for a little over 4 weeks now, and I&#x27;m incredibly impressed with my results!</li>
            <li>My wife uses it and I can see a huge difference (wink wink).  </li>
            <li>Before I started the medication that started a huge influx on my weight (10 pounds every d</li>
            <li>a huge difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I can see a huge difference in size of my arms.</li>
            <li>UNLESS the bottle is huge for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To give you an accurate picture of how well this cream works I must tell you why I wanted to use it to begin with.  </li>
            <li>This is a great topical solution.  </li>
            <li>But okay, if it works, it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was just wondering if anyone has called that number on the packaging it comes with that says you recieve a free bottle when you call that number.  </li>
            <li>The skin feels smooth, with no sticky residue.</li>
            <li>This has a light cooling sensation after a couple minutes, but does not burn.</li>
            <li>I used this cream  last year for about 5 months, it works great.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I hope to receive the free bottle from them</li>
            <li>It will not transform your legs from those that belong in a size fourteen pant into legs that can suddenly fit into size six pants.  </li>
            <li>Yep this skeptic paid for this product after my free trial run</li>
            <li>That said, I wanted to be brave and give potential customers the &amp;#34;skinny&amp;#34; (hurr) on just using this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth.</li>
            <li>Even if it doesn&#x27;t eliminate my cellulite, I do have quite a bit, it&#x27;s a fabulous lotion.</li>
            <li>Its cheap so who cares</li>
            <li>I, however, enjoy the scent, as it reminds me of peppermint.</li>
            <li>I have simply grown to trust this product after I noticed the great improvement it has done to my skin</li>
            <li>The texture is about perfect, but it did take awhile to rub in (I might just be impatient).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a great find.</li>
            <li>I still waiting for my free bottom.</li>
            <li>I like free just like anyone and called the number and was directed to a website to give my information.</li>
            <li>When I purchased the item it had well over a 4-star rating so once realized that people were probably leaving reviews for the free product</li>
            <li>My skin got really smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>I would advise that one eat properly, exercise and try to great product.</li>
            <li>I try this product for free</li>
            <li>My legs aren&#x27;t 100% smooth</li>
            <li>I am so happy with it and will continue to use it regularly!</li>
            <li>The skin on my face has legitimately never felt so smooth.</li>
            <li>It really decreases the appearance of cellulite after 6 weeks,if you want to get better result,you need to keep eating healthy and doing exercise as well.</li>
            <li>have seen good tighten results so far and will continue to use this cream becuase</li>
            <li>(My 16 year old just laughed.)  </li>
            <li>This stuff really does work, and makes me feel more confident when I&#x27;m wearing shorts or dresses.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried just about everything on the market for cellulite lotions/creams/gels and so far so good.</li>
            <li>So far, results are good.</li>
            <li>So far so good for me.</li>
            <li>Wow, nothing but love for this product!&lt;br /&gt;The skin on my thigh tightens up so nicely.</li>
            <li>Product smells nice and absorbs into the skin pretty quickly without leaving you feeling greasy which is a plus.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect some magic weight loss continue to eat right and exercise, but I guarantee it will help you tone and get rid of that unwanted fat faster than just dieting and exercising alone.</li>
            <li>Not bad or rotten, but somewhat strongly like wood chips?</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and very easy to use, made it appart of my daily routine.noticed resluts in 1 week.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>after applying make sure the cream is absorbed well before dressing to get the full benefit.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I have no idea if SKINNY CREAM does what it is supposed to do, although I highly doubt it (the claims being rather fantastical).  </li>
            <li>Overall this product is amazing and does work like it states when it comes to reducing the look and feel of your cellulite!</li>
            <li>They are still there, but they have diminished significantly.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a significant difference</li>
            <li>The company replied promptly and is friendly.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that she is sold on the product, and she hasn&#x27;t asked me to order more, so that&#x27;s pretty telling.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this item.</li>
            <li>and I have seen a significant result.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure that it&#x27;s a scam.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m pretty sure that it&#x27;s a scam, don&#x27;t buy anything from this buyer</li>
            <li>I am so excited I was chosen to test this for quality and express my opinion about the product.  </li>
            <li>She has been using this for a long time now and seems happy with the results.</li>
            <li>It is totally worth the price though!</li>
            <li>I gave the product 3 stars as it is too soon to tell if it will work on cellulite; the bottle states that you will need 8 wks to see significant results.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I was given this to try for my review.</li>
            <li>I love that it does exactly as it says.</li>
            <li>I would recommenced to anyone interested in getting glossy and smooth skin!</li>
            <li>but my husband and I have noticed a significant difference in the appearance of my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is well worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I think you have to make sure you&#x27;ll applying both morning and night consistently though.</li>
            <li>I like most about the cream is that it absorbs very fast into your skin and feel it working right away!</li>
            <li>I am able to control my lose skin now and look far much better than before.</li>
            <li>I can truly see myself cellulite free very soon:))</li>
            <li>, i work out 4-5 days a week, and i eat as clean as i can..</li>
            <li>One unexpected side effect is that my skin has NEVER looked better or felt better.</li>
            <li>She stuck with the applications, and after regular use she had some great success.</li>
            <li>I actually found it to be pleasant.</li>
            <li>I bought it more for skin toning (than cellulite reduction), and the results were positive for me.  </li>
            <li>If it can clear that up, it can surely help out with cellulite too!</li>
            <li>After reading some of the other reviews, to be fair, I think I have to give it more of a chance.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Skinny Cream is easy to use, smells good, and it shows in a few weeks (better to use twice a day).</li>
            <li>and it certainly has all the latest recommended weight loss supplements (with the exception of Garcinia Cambogia).</li>
            <li>I can feel it tightening right after I rub it in!</li>
            <li>and I feel a whole lot better about myself.</li>
            <li>Most scents really cause havoc with me</li>
            <li>I recently lost a good amount of weight and had some excess tummy cellulite.</li>
            <li>I am ½ through my bottle and still use it because the results were good enough for me.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m a good enough person to get it for them because I care.</li>
            <li>So many creams I have tried over the years haven&#x27;t really delivered results.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t tell how much it has helped more than that.</li>
            <li>I recommend this cream to anyone that is constant using it and want to see good results.</li>
            <li>I really like that it isn&#x27;t sticky as most creams of this type are.</li>
            <li>Its fast and totally safe for everyone&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li>Actually it would have been unimaginable if I hadn&#x27;t exposed myself to it a good 60 times.</li>
            <li>those true nature beauties out there</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve try many skinny cream, and this is one really works.</li>
            <li>The texture of my skin really seemed to love the ingredients of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The appearance of the skin is much firmer and more even.</li>
            <li>I have started exercising more and drinking 6 glasses of water a day, hopefully this helps because everything else I have done really doesnt do anything.</li>
            <li>I feel like it makes me go to the bathroom more often, and it has an unusual smell to it.</li>
            <li>I have to make a full disclosure here.</li>
            <li>I am still covered in cellulite after using one full bottle.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it any stars is because it smells good.</li>
            <li>A really cool product.</li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>I know it is best to use the product for at least a month to get the full results.</li>
            <li>not bad for the price of 20 bucks at all.</li>
            <li>but really it&#x27;s not as bad as they&#x27;re making it out to be.</li>
            <li>I have to say Im very excited to have found this product and recommend it highly!</li>
            <li>the cream is fantastic you can feel it right away .</li>
            <li>The orange peel skin will disappear quickly, some areas were overnight, the rest took the full 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>They are slowly but surely going away!!!</li>
            <li>Besides, I have no allergy or any other sort of reaction to it, it has great texture, absorbs well, not greasy or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect quick overnight results.</li>
            <li>I am super picky when it comes to products.</li>
            <li>but I got the chance to try this product free of charge for my own personal unbias review.</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t expect a quick maricle.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>i love my sexy back!!</li>
            <li>The only plus side is that it smells better then most products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I was lucky when I remembered to use it once a day.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, once it&#x27;s soaked in the scent goes away (or isn&#x27;t noticeable).  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly into your skin and is not greasy feeling at all.</li>
            <li>just recently changed my diet to add more water and healthier food, and the results have improved even more.</li>
            <li>I have been using it twice a day on the back of my thighs, and it has really reduced my bumps and dimples -  and my skin tone and firmness has also greatly improved.</li>
            <li>After giving birth to my two wonderful kiddo&#x27;s and then loosing all the weight has left tummy &amp; buttocks area...  with a lot of extra skin.  </li>
            <li>Plus it smells fantastic, isnt sticky or oily, and absorbs very fast.</li>
            <li>I think the smell is pleasant, much better than the antifreeze smelling products I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>, I was pretty fit but still had a patch of stubborn cellulite and one dimple</li>
            <li>but it comes very close and is by far the best topical cream I have come across.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products and Skinny Cream works the best by far.</li>
            <li>, I was pretty fit but still had a patch of stubborn cellulite and one dimple</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d suggest getting one bottle of it and giving it a try for awhile to see if you notice results that are greater than your normal results from just diet and exercise.</li>
            <li>first noticed that my legs started to feel extremely smooth after 3-4 days of use.</li>
            <li>First off, when you receive the item it will come with a slip that says you can get a bottle for free</li>
            <li>I recently lost a lot of weight, and have been using this on my arms, very pleased girl.</li>
            <li>My fiance applied this as instructed, and she hasn&#x27;t felt this good about herself in a long time.</li>
            <li>It does make your skin soft but the smell is so strong!</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is sufficient in the bottle to last a good while comparing to the other one I had which was a good brand also</li>
            <li>I am 24 and my new form should not be a problem (always overweight now a healthily weight)</li>
            <li>but is too small bottle , smells good and for sure make exercice and use</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by how effective this product really is!</li>
            <li>The product comes in quite a large squeeze-tube bottle, which will surely last months and is great for dispensing exactly the amount I need.</li>
            <li>Like many women out there, I&#x27;m always looking for new high quality products to use on my skin to make it feel more soft, moisturized, and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy doing this for myself, it is a positive experience for me.  </li>
            <li>other than that, IT IS AMAZING!</li>
            <li>Two weeks after starting my legs are looking better than they ever have!</li>
            <li>I saw results within the first two weeks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other creams and this is by far the best one that shows noticeable results, the only one that I&#x27;ll continue using, worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li>This summer is going to be a lot more fun because my legs look better than they have in a long time!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not unpleasant (it&#x27;s quite nice actually)</li>
            <li>so it feels great to watch it disappear a little every day.</li>
            <li>This product is definitely a miracle worker--it actually has effectively improved my skin--no more cellulite!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice anything other than a pleasant scent with this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I used it every day after shower with heavy massage and sometimes saunas, the effect was great after usage and little reduced after a day, but you shouldn&#x27;t expect a great difference in a week- for me</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it on the back of my legs and have had amazing results.</li>
            <li>My skin is much firmer and has a smooth texture.  </li>
            <li>After a few weeks I noticed some great results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Add a proper diet and exercise and the results are Amazing.</li>
            <li>You will notice amazing results in only a matter of days.</li>
            <li>buy it one more time to complete the course.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on how soft my skin is.....</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t know if it worth the $29 price tag</li>
            <li>It is better to go the old school way and use coffee grains instead with coconut oil.</li>
            <li>I did think, however, it would be a nice lotion without any claims that it would do something that a topical lotion is incapable of doing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s VERYYY SOFT : ) and does tighten up the skin.</li>
            <li>It is definitely getting rid of extra water and making the skin on my thighs tighter and look smoother .I am happy that it works because I am more confident about wearing shorts and skirts in public places.</li>
            <li>I read reviews of this product and thought to give a try and its worth</li>
            <li>I would say this is only some kind of cream that worth $1 per bottle</li>
            <li>/&gt;While the product works to a degree, it requires a lot of it to be applied to be effective and it has to be applied daily to maintain results</li>
            <li>This was my first time using the product and was very pleased with the initial results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money,it won&#x27;t be disappoint.</li>
            <li>worth the price trust me</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li>The cream has a nice consistency, not too thick but yet not runny at all, it does spread nicely without running and is quickly absorbed .</li>
            <li>And I love that this cream is not heavy</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s all it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.e to get, I think it might be something worth spending the money on for the warmer months at least.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Its worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am thrilled to finally see it go away.  </li>
            <li>Her skin not only looks better because the wrinkles and stretch marks are no longer there, it’s also silky smooth.</li>
            <li>This is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Worth the buy.</li>
            <li>I already have my second bottle so excited to see what that does even more.</li>
            <li>I have struggled with cellulite after my first child birth, so it feels great to watch it disappear a little every day.</li>
            <li>The price on Amazon compared to other products like it is good.</li>
            <li>But when I found Skinny cream, i thought this is product right for me.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>It moisturizes just right</li>
            <li>Right now all I smell is some funky odor.</li>
            <li>suggest to eat right and exercise,  </li>
            <li>Just work out and eat right.</li>
            <li>right at a month now.</li>
            <li>When i rub the cream on my thigs, it goes right inside and the skin just absorbs the cream right away.</li>
            <li>and ive noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li>but I believe using this product consistently will prove effective and lasting results.</li>
            <li>i love  it so far it works for my problem areas when i first use</li>
            <li>Over the past year I have been using Strivectin\\&quot;s body firming cream and thought I was happy with those results.  </li>
            <li>I am highly pleased with the product since the result starts showing from the very first application and they are not just temporary improvements only.</li>
            <li>fact, I&#x27;ve ordered 3 more tubes for my friends who need to shed a little cellulite too :)</li>
            <li>cream itself has a light, pleasant fragrance and is pretty thick in texture.</li>
            <li>and I stated to see results right with the first one.</li>
            <li>I always test out cream by using it on my ears (funny, right?).</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for only a couple of weeks and so far so good.</li>
            <li>I Purchased this item about a month ago, Im seven months pregnant, and trying to prepare to get back in shape after the baby, But am an inpatient person and decided to go ahead and use the skinny cream, I have already seen results and I&#x27;m sure that after the baby comes this product will help me get back to a even better shape</li>
            <li>Most products that promise to &amp;#34;reduce cellulite&amp;#34; rarely work, but this stuff lives up to its name entirely!!</li>
            <li>Thank you very much for this product</li>
            <li>And very fast to.</li>
            <li>Which if you are wanting something to rev up your system is fine, but I am sensitive to caffeine</li>
            <li>No dramatic improvement but was worth the try.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend SKINNY CREAM to every woman who wants HOT LEGS!</li>
            <li>It really worked for me!</li>
            <li>Really works!</li>
            <li>I was dubious at first when we purchased it but within weeks I noticed a drastic change in my gf&#x27;s legs as well as her confidence.</li>
            <li>But one should follow a healthy diet and a proper work out along it for the maximum result.</li>
            <li>It lasts and while slightly strong at first it becomes less strong once my skin absorbed it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel but leaves my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d like to give it more time because I was only using it once a day not twice a day which is indicated on the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what the description says.</li>
            <li>too stinky, had to wash off on first use</li>
            <li>Skinny Cream gave a noticeable difference after the first 5-7 days.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Skinny Cream!</li>
            <li>and I am now summer ready!</li>
            <li>haha!  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell pretty</li>
            <li>If it only gets better from here, I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li>I try to stay fit for myself and 4yr old daughter.</li>
            <li>I recommend using it with a cellulite brush daily as well for even better results.</li>
            <li>The product does exactly what it claims amd helps reduce dimples where celulite is formed</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to come back every 2 weeks for more.</li>
            <li>From the first application I noticed immediate results.</li>
            <li>and I really do see some improvement!  </li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve only been able to use the cream once a day because:</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak to rather or not it actually reduces cellulite over time because I could never use it more than once.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t aware until I already applied the cream that caffeine is one of its leading ingredients so if this is an issue for anyone please be aware of this.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first but after reading the reviews I gave it a try</li>
            <li>My skin is looking pretty firmer</li>
            <li>The first 3 products I bought didn&#x27;t work at all, I was devastated and thought and thought that I was gonna be stuck with my cellulite forever.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed that my skin feels much smoother than before I started using this cream (added bonus!).</li>
            <li>and I can really tell the difference!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna continue to use this product for more results and to prevent future cellulite from returning!</li>
            <li>The flab seems to be disappearing fast!</li>
            <li>It does smell funny</li>
            <li>I can tell I´ve seen inmediate lasting  results but my skin looks better wen</li>
            <li>and it really works!  </li>
            <li>After five days of consistent application, I began to notice some smoothing on my legs.  </li>
            <li>pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of product amount, I found that I had to use quite a bit and one bottle</li>
            <li>i even use the whole bottle!</li>
            <li>The sides and backs of my upper thighs look 75% better and it just wows me.</li>
            <li>I saw results within the first week.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Smells kinda funny.</li>
            <li>I am really amazed!</li>
            <li>It feels smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>And within the first couple weeks I saw a difference.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t really like the smell of it!</li>
            <li>skin, especially my legs, look so much more smoother.</li>
            <li>I wish the cream will absorb better as it takes time to actually rub it into skin.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and makes my legs so soft and moisturized all while diminishing the appearance of my cellulite.  </li>
            <li>But I also eat healthy, and exercise 5-6 times a week regularly.</li>
            <li>I am not quite sure why I have celluite seeing as how I only weigh 110</li>
            <li>I was so amazed that my waist actually lost its love handles.....</li>
            <li>I will be the first to tell you that there is no miracle cure or cream out there</li>
            <li>I do eat healthy &amp; workout regularly</li>
            <li>Ok I wanna say this cream is like a topical laxative.</li>
            <li>This is my first product review.</li>
            <li>Must be consistent.</li>
            <li>bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look, I want to believe that there is this magic cream that makes cellulite vanish instantly, but the saying goes &amp;#34;If</li>
            <li>Im on my first bottle and been using twice a day for almost a month</li>
            <li>, Im starting to notice my legs are looking a lot better.</li>
            <li>already n cellulite is starting to disappear:)</li>
            <li>Recommended for people who wants to improve their skin!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in the tightness of my skin after the first couple of uses.</li>
            <li>and I finally found this cream works magic, I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I love this product and would use it again if and when it comes back.</li>
            <li>Even at my thinnest/most fit I still had cellulite, so I am pleasantly surprised to see it working now at my heaviest.  </li>
            <li>In Europe, a company has to show that a chemical is safe before putting it in a product, but in the US it&#x27;s the opposite; if there is no evidence it causes harm, you can use it.</li>
            <li>Since I have been using it religiously, I will need more soon.</li>
            <li>My wife uses this product every day and absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>is smoothing it out, but it will probably take a few bottles to get good results.</li>
            <li>I have tried several creams and this is the only one that works, smells pleasant and absorbs into the skin without leaving a tacky feeling.  </li>
            <li>It goes right in the skin fast and doesnt leave a sticky feeling.</li>
            <li>and this is the first product that did not cause a rash or any other kind of reaction.</li>
            <li>Not the usual pleasant lotion smell.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I tried this product because it does have some great ingredients in it that are known for cellulite reduction, however, perhaps not a high enough concentration.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products, but this is hands down the best.</li>
            <li>This smells nice and unlike other products, it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Well finally I found this product and saw all the good reviews it had, and decided to give it a try one last time.</li>
            <li>haha..the muscle already become softer and cellulite is reduced significantly！！The product is quite good considering such low price.</li>
            <li>I have a 15 yr old special needs son who has relied on my care 100% day and night..</li>
            <li>It seems to have some positive results.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the product bec of the positive reviews</li>
            <li>She was becoming self-conscious about the lines that were left after the healing process and wanted to find something that would help improve her skin.</li>
            <li>For the price it really can’t be beaten, and the results really show!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure many people despise cellulite, I am certainly not the only one.</li>
            <li>so it a something nice and easy to help with my thick thighs and butt!</li>
            <li>Cant wait to see more long term effects!</li>
            <li>I have used this whole bottle exactly as directed twice a day and it did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>I was less than thrilled.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for 2 weeks, it&#x27;s easy to use,  and I think Its starting to work.</li>
            <li>and my skin felt super soft as well.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely thicker than lotion, but still applies easily and evenly.</li>
            <li>After having a baby and naturally large thighs on a petite frame, I&#x27;ll try, try again.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m fairly certain that lifestyle is not a factor.</li>
            <li>and I will have to say certainly your body will not retain some of your water intake.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used the cream for about two weeks now and the results are quick!</li>
            <li>Even though I had saw the many, many good reviews on this product before I purchased it, I was still somewhat skeptical about whether or not it would actually work well for me, but it had certainly made a believer out of me, and after only my first week of use.</li>
            <li>I decided to test it out in certain spots, you know, to really see if it works.  </li>
            <li>the very least, I do feel like my legs feel energized using it although I have seen no change in appearance of the cellulite as yet -- except maybe a nice placebo glow of smooth just after putting it on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>Now she wants to go to the beach to show off her body.</li>
            <li>I have really noticed a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>This product works miracles, So I highly recommended to everyone!</li>
            <li>I recommend this highly!</li>
            <li>and you really need to rub it into your skin.</li>
            <li>It worked really well.</li>
            <li>I really like this cream.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>and so this was very helpful to decrease what I had.</li>
            <li>I was not expecting much</li>
            <li>This cream really worked well for me.  </li>
            <li>It really has worked for me tightening my thigs and abdomen,  </li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>really helps a lot to reduce the cellulite.</li>
            <li>and I probably won&#x27;t pay that much again.  </li>
            <li>and I really like that about this cream.</li>
            <li>and it really worked.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>is really working.&lt;br /&gt;Remember</li>
            <li>It really reduced signs of cellulite for me</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about a month and really haven&#x27;t noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves this product.</li>
            <li>Cream works ok not as well as I expected</li>
            <li>I really adore this product.</li>
            <li>I use it every day for about 2 months it did absolutely nothing</li>
            <li>but then folks believe the lotion did its job when really all it did was keep the skin from drying out.</li>
            <li>Even though this is not a wrinkle cream, I have  creases on my ear lobe that really bug me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much cellulite</li>
            <li>She really likes this cream for all her &#x27;treatments&#x27; and her skin is smoother...</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really feeling like showing my legs or tummy on my video, but</li>
            <li>But it does take some work to really rub it in.</li>
            <li>It is really works.</li>
            <li>However, I personally don&#x27;t really like the smell</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li>and it absolutely worked .</li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t seen a difference since I used it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>So i wouldn&#x27;t really bother buying this product.</li>
            <li>When used with an anti-cellulite massager, this cream works very well to stimulate the skin and circulation.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about 2 months, did not see much result on me.</li>
            <li>and/or who wants to have noticeably firmer and smoother skin.</li>
            <li>This Skinny cream works really well, not just on cellulite, but it also reduces the appearance of my scars....</li>
            <li>and I can really tell the cellulite I have</li>
            <li>is really going away, u jVe to give it time though.</li>
            <li>If I could afford to, I would use it on my whole body.</li>
            <li>The Real Deal!&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>It was shipped really fast</li>
            <li>I think this product does something, but you really have to treat this product&#x27;s application like you would washing your face or brushing your teeth -- application has to occur every day to maintain the results that do occur.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend it to all.</li>
            <li>, I was very</li>
            <li>I could REALLY tell when I stopped using it for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>It is very fast-acting.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about two weeks now and while I haven&#x27;t seen drastic results, I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy and my skin is much softer.  </li>
            <li>but it finished to fast.</li>
            <li>This has really tightened and toned my arms.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than plastic surgery and body</li>
            <li>so I really don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li>Works fast</li>
            <li>highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I actually enjoy the smell, too, which can be a big problem sometimes with these things.  </li>
            <li>it not too much work</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think any cream can really do that.</li>
            <li>seller, fast and as described.</li>
            <li>This product really works.  </li>
            <li>but it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>I probably wouldn&#x27;t notice the scent as much if I didn&#x27;t apply this to my neck.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve being using it for about two weeks and my legs are much</li>
            <li>very quickly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t all disappear but much improved.</li>
            <li>This product really does reduce cellulite on any area of the body.</li>
            <li>This has really made quite a difference in the appearance of cellulite.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a week of using this product, I really started to see a difference.</li>
            <li>However, after the results I got so far and continue to get, I think it might be something worth spending the money on for the warmer months at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cellulite is definitely not as obvious as it used to be prior to applying this cream religiously, so I&#x27;ve been able to wear skirts more often without worrying about how my thighs look from the back.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t too much like some say.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received the product quite fast after placing the order here.</li>
            <li>and it really did help tighten my tummy.</li>
            <li>It took about 4 days to  really see the difference.</li>
            <li>Gave this as a gift to my wife and she just absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>The product is very creamy and not greasy like the Nivea cream.  </li>
            <li>This product truly works and has fast results..</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Now my skin looks butter smooth and much younger.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really helping with her cellulite.</li>
            <li>I was very please with it and does the job.love</li>
            <li>I was looking for something to keep my legs looking fresh if I happen to have a busy week and not work out.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the cream.</li>
            <li>And if you&#x27;re looking for help with cellulite, speak to a medical professional or just accept your genetic lot in life. :).</li>
            <li>I tried a lot of cellulite and firming creams, this one is by far one of my favorites!!!</li>
            <li>... I would say: smell nice, feel on skin pleasant (may be like any other good body creams), but it is hard to say if it is works for body as promised because... it is too little size of bottle and not much cream.</li>
            <li>This product has given me way better results than any other cellulite products like Nivea&#x27;s Goodbye Cellulite which appeared to do nothing.</li>
            <li>Compared to other brands, I&#x27;ve noticed that you seem to get more for your money here, as the quantity is quite generous.</li>
            <li>Now is this due to this magic cream or the fact that I am losing fat and working out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other creams and</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re anything like me, you like some parts of your body more than other parts.</li>
            <li>Like many other reviewers have already said, it takes a couple weeks to notice results.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve tried many other products claiming cellulite reductions to no</li>
            <li>I needed the full 30 days before I saw any real change, but well into the second bottle I&#x27;m still seeing results.</li>
            <li>Really had high hopes for this..</li>
            <li>First I want to say that I am scent sensitive.</li>
            <li>I really like this product; it was very creamy but; make sure you use it everyday.</li>
            <li>The really surprising thing is that for the sake of the review, I rubbed a nickle-sized dollop on to my left arm, and hours later, it&#x27;s decidedly smoother and younger looking.  </li>
            <li>It is not a bad price for Skinny Cream and you will see that  when you compare prices with others brand names., and you get the same results.</li>
            <li>I suffer from very dry skin and have noticed it has made my skin very silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>Myself, I found the smell more- than odd, kindof like play dough, sunscreen, machine-shop oil and tempura paint.  </li>
            <li>and I put a decent amount on my target areas.  </li>
            <li>This is a decent product.</li>
            <li>It definitely does help, however, the ones with retinol and caffeine in them work much better for me, and are about the same price.</li>
            <li>I got decent results from it.</li>
            <li>I was recommended to buy this by my older brother to buy this</li>
            <li>Mainly was using it on my outer thighs.</li>
            <li>My main problem area is the lower part of my buttocks and hips as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because of the obvious firming, I do think this would be much more beneficial when used during a big life change/new diet &amp; exercise regime.</li>
            <li>I now enjoy wearing short shorts and mini-skirts, not the kind that make you look like a hooker or desperate but the kind that shows just enough skin.</li>
            <li>I have used many different products at all different prices but nothing works like this.  </li>
            <li>It was moisturizing and left my skin feeling soft and smooth all day throug.</li>
            <li>The overall area seems to be smaller and more shapely as well.</li>
            <li>and I will definitely be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li>We both were not happy with the smell, as there was nothing pleasant about it.</li>
            <li>That means healthy, tone and tight.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anybody looking to get rid of cellulite.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product -</li>
            <li>but since obesity is a high in family history</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it..</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I saw it had a fairly high rating - which drew me in to begin with.</li>
            <li>yes, I highly recommend the project.</li>
            <li>yes, I highly recommend the project.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this cream, but it didn&#x27;t quite make it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>As far as the cream itself goes, it took a couple of days to get used to the way this cream smells but it smells much better than other cellulite creams that I have used.</li>
            <li>I received a call back a day later stating to use the product for a month and to leave a positive review to get the free product.</li>
            <li>It did not remove the cellulite, but it did tone a little better.</li>
            <li>This is the only cream that Really Works!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is ok, the texture is a little too creamy for me - I prefer gel-like textures.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I feel it working - also makes skin so soft!!  </li>
            <li>With continued use of this product, I will actually be purchasing my first set of shorts in about 3 years!</li>
            <li>With continued use of this product, I will actually be purchasing my first set of shorts in about 3 years!</li>
            <li>She has been using it for a little more than two months, and has even been putting it in baskets for baby shower gifts for her friends.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to keeping on using it and seeing more results down the line!</li>
            <li>So, thanks to SKINNY CREAM, I can show my legs off with no inhibitions and with complete confidence.</li>
            <li>It has a very funky, kind of nasty smell to it, lol.</li>
            <li>To be clear, there is no miracle cream that will get rid of the handful of skin that has been stretched, however it has helped smooth out and even out the these areas.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t find different types of useful products at one place elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I tend to get really puffy on my legs and such and this helps so much!  </li>
            <li>I will keep applying it fore a few more months.</li>
            <li>Get it works brand defining gel, only thing worth the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different products like this one and this is my favorite so far.  </li>
            <li>My skin is much more firm where I use it.  </li>
            <li>husband has been even complements me more and has noticed a stark difference.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have consulted with a few surgeons for a tummy tuck, being quoted 8-10 grand.  </li>
            <li>When I first bough this cream I really had no idea that it could actually turn out to be</li>
            <li>When used consistently your skin is full and the cellulite appears to be less visible.</li>
            <li>The bottle is easy to open and squeeze and you just rub it in like you would a regular lotion for the skin.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see that this actually does reduce the visibility of cellulite tremendously.</li>
            <li>I do exercise several times a week and TRY to eat right</li>
            <li>I definitely want to keep using the product over the summer since it tightens my skin right away</li>
            <li>Obviously it doesn&#x27;t take care of all of your problems right away</li>
            <li>but it definitely helps take a step in the right direction.</li>
            <li>My skin feels more firm and the texture is improved - wow!  </li>
            <li>, I have to say it is very small bottle for the price, however it smells nice.</li>
            <li>As I often try new creams to find the working ones, this time I think I &#x27;ve found the one doing his</li>
            <li>and it has boosted her confidence to a new level.</li>
            <li>I tried a huge number of products and wasted more money than I should trying anything other than the Skinny Cream!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have had no issues.</li>
            <li>The cream makes my skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t need much and the smell is strong but not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>I am a very active, healthy and fit person who still suffers from cellulite, but this Skinny Cream sure helps the appearance.</li>
            <li>, it says that you should apply it twice a day, I only did it once after I showered, the first couple of weeks</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t look exactly like the gal in the blue bikini (yet!)that they have pictured with the bottle, but the cream has a noticeable smoothing effect.</li>
            <li>This is the first product out of all the products I&#x27;ve tried before that actually works for me!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I need to give it more time to see results</li>
            <li>This is the second week I&#x27;m using it, and I can tell now that the areas I put the cream on getting skinny faster than other areas of my body:)</li>
            <li>No more cottage cheese, more like skim milk baby (wink wink).  </li>
            <li>Once in the morning, and once at night is enough to see results on my hamstrings, glutes, and quads within the first two weeks.</li>
            <li>I can see a small change, but am sure</li>
            <li>I am sure, so I think I have lost a few pounds using it!</li>
            <li>so I can continue using the said product and be able to see if I can lose some inches and resolve the excessive skin problem I had after my weight lose program.</li>
            <li>This is only my first bottle and there is never a miracle cream that&#x27;s just going to fix everything at once.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for several weeks almost exactly as directed.  </li>
            <li>I used this product twice daily for about 4 weeks and saw a significant different in my skin.</li>
            <li>In the past, I&#x27;ve received many compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li>Soon you will be a Firm Believer! :)</li>
            <li>But after I&#x27;d been using it not regularly for several weeks I finally started remembering better</li>
            <li>It was really gross at first</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what I did and you will be pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>I have tried many products but will search no more.</li>
            <li>I apply it right after I shower, so you want to make sure your skin is a little wet.</li>
            <li>that’s only gonna happen only with proper diet and exercise – but the short term *appearance* benefit may be worth it if you have some special occasion to attend in which your legs will be exposed (but no pool parties!)</li>
            <li>This cream has all of the standard anti-cellulite ingredients (the main one being caffeine), and it gets high marks for not being highly perfumed.</li>
            <li>the last 2 yrs I have worked so hard every second of every day to keep him alive and with great sadness I must tell you he went to heaven in October.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way which is nice</li>
            <li>I was considering the cool sculting procedure for my abdomin which basically freezes your fat and costs about $700 per area which would likely take two areas for a total of $1,400</li>
            <li>And the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; parts, at least for me, are the ones where my skin is not smooth and beautiful.</li>
            <li>The lotion is sticky and uncomfortable feeling after application and as I said, the smell isn&#x27;t something pleasant.  </li>
            <li>But when I was watching tv later with my fiancé, I decided to rub some more on while laying down.</li>
            <li>I recently got a bottle for my roommate too, she also positively adores the results.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been looking for something to help with my last little bit of stubborn fat and stretch marks around my love handles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to argue with that :)</li>
            <li>I was so self conscious about all my cellulite, but no matter how much I worked out and dieted with the sole intention to get rid of it, it would never disappear.</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t expect to look like a 20 year old once you are done.  </li>
            <li>Fits my skin and soft</li>
            <li>Overall I really like the way this is working</li>
            <li>I like the natural ingredients, too.</li>
            <li>It made my skin soft but didn&#x27;t reduce the appearance of my cellulite.</li>
            <li>I am 23 years old, 5&#x27;7 and 140lbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m amazed how well it&#x27;s worked so far.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to use at least once a day.</li>
            <li>The downside is it doesn&#x27;t absorb completely and leaves a sticky, skin smothering residue.</li>
            <li>This is complete rubbish and does not work.  </li>
            <li>I am 38 years old</li>
            <li>far I&#x27;ve been using it morning and night</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say I use it enough, but when I do, I feel like it de-puffs</li>
            <li>My skin became firmer, the layer of water  retention on my abs completely vanished and the cellulite was gone to.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re scent sensitive, you&#x27;ll want to skip it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take it away completely</li>
            <li>Skinny Cream is such an appropriate name for a product that actually tones and tightens cellulite-prone skin in such a short amount of time!</li>
            <li>Of course, the only real way to get rid of cellulite is diet, exercise and water.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t have time for as a busy working professional.</li>
            <li>Another cream promising miracle results with no scientific evidence to back up their claims.  </li>
            <li>Why won&#x27;t I ever learn that a sensible diet and exercise are the only real ways to make a difference in your body?</li>
            <li>The cream is also making my skin soft to the touch and does not leave any residue.</li>
            <li>I like this product and it has been working for me so far.</li>
            <li>The only issue I had was it irritated my skin if I put it too much on one area.</li>
            <li>My cellulite isnt completely gone</li>
            <li>, those are completely gone.</li>
            <li>The results I have gotten after a week have really surprised me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very curvy, carry extra fat in thighs and butt.</li>
            <li>So far I can see a difference in my stomach area.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to lose weight around my stomach for so long that it&#x27;s funny.</li>
            <li>this cream also seems to give a natural gloss to the skin ....</li>
            <li>I used it for nearly a month and all my worries about weight loss are gone.</li>
            <li>But it might work well for someone who isn&#x27;t as sensitive to caffeine</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get rid of it completely</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great product that helps to improve skin tone, and as a bonus, the bottle is so big that I likely won&#x27;t have to buy another for at least 4 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>$30 isn&#x27;t much when you consider that it&#x27;s probably same cost as a meal these days.</li>
            <li>I am 57 years old</li>
            <li>Still early</li>
            <li>I needed a fast solution to my skin patches for my approaching wedding and so I chose this cream as I had heard about it</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that whatever you put on your skin gets absorbed by the bloodstream, so you should avoid the many commercial beauty products that contain some of over 12,000 chemical ingredients that are illegal in Europe, but legal in the US.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at my results after using skinny cream...</li>
            <li>I am in my early 30s..</li>
            <li>The skin is the most delicate hence needs the most delicate care.</li>
            <li>I can definitely see that the cream in making my skin more firm.</li>
            <li>My skin is more firm and defined in the back of my legs.</li>
            <li>This cream has the latest in weight loss supplements; such as green tea and raspberry ketones.  </li>
            <li>weird and good thing is, it don’t stay all day.</li>
            <li>I guess its okay otherwise and spreads thickly.</li>
            <li>only minor complaint is that the smell is not that pleasant.</li>
            <li>Granted you can never expect a miracle product that will totally eliminate your problem but relative to other products I&#x27;ve tried, I&#x27;ve seen better results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had cellulite on my thighs and butt for as long as I remember, and after skimming a few products this was the first with such great reviews, so I went out on a limb and ordered it; I was definitely not let down.</li>
            <li>Yes they are small and you go thru them very quickly, but for $30 a bottle, I think it&#x27;s a steal.</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars due to the fact that you do have to use it constantly to keep up the fabulous results.</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars due to the fact that you do have to use it constantly to keep up the fabulous results.</li>
            <li>Both reported the &amp;#34;skinny&amp;#34; feature to be as preposterous as it sounds, and that they thought the smell was odd, but not bad.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using it very much but the little amount of time I have used it, it really works.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a medium aged mom of 2 who does cardio and strength training daily and eats 90% clean.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical when I first tried this cream, I can honestly say that I have not only seen an improvement in the texture of my skin but firmness too.</li>
            <li>The effect is a subtle smoothing and most people could probably use a bit of smoothing on their legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am sure that the effect will disappear the next time I take a shower (or maybe when I go swimming), but I can always reapply the lotion to get the same slight benefit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, decent product</li>
            <li>I had tried a number of such cellulite reduction creams before this but none of them could fetch me the desired result until I switched to this particular cream…</li>
            <li>and I thought it would be better but did nothing at all for me so go back to Nivea that at least smooth me a little.</li>
            <li>I just recently started using this product, so far I can see a little improvement on my inner thigh, as this is most problem area with cellulite.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this stuff, especially before a bikini vacation or summer adventure!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this once a day on my upper thighs, yet I see a positive difference in the firmness and look of my thighs.</li>
            <li>It does make your skin really soft &amp; after a month of using it you barely see the results.</li>
            <li>I was surprised after only one week of use that I already am starting to see very visible and noticeable results.</li>
            <li>I really never expected this to work but was pleasantly surprised to find that I could see a difference in my skin in just a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for 3 weeks only and my skin feels smooth, soft and of course, firm...</li>
            <li>It certainly did nothing for my small amount of cellulite which is what I bought for in the first</li>
            <li>But I eat healthy and drink a lot of water, and workout and have a lot of muscle, but have some aged lose skin that needs firmed up, and a little fat that needs smoothed out, so as I see what happens I will recommit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m learning (the hard way) to not look for easy fixes.</li>
            <li>I exercise and eat clean (and I don’t have cellulite issues), but I am 50 years old and had noticed that the skin on my thighs was starting to look a little “looser”.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much easier if your skin is completely dry, not just towel-dried.</li>
            <li>only a few weeks I could see a smoother appearance of the skin on my waist, hips and thighs and even feel a difference in how my jeans fit.  </li>
            <li>but so far have big hopes for it based on what I have observed so far.</li>
            <li>And as fast as possible, so I&#x27;m totally looking for a miracle.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the only reason I could possibly imagine why a company would release a product for women to put on their bodies that will make them smell absolutely revolting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve rubbed this cream onto the back of my thighs for about 3 weeks now, and I began seeing very noticeable results last week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cream is a thick consistency but absorbs into the skin fairly easily.</li>
            <li>The smell is honestly ridiculously disgusting, I don&#x27;t know why so many people think it smells good, I&#x27;ve heard people say I smell like spoiled wine.</li>
            <li>I am slim, active and have a very fast metabolism</li>
            <li>Not only because it does what it says but it also makes my skin so unbelievably soft!</li>
            <li>I am so excited and can&#x27;t wait for no more cellulite.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I can see a major decrease in the appearance of cellulite.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I can see a major decrease in the appearance of cellulite.</li>
            <li>so there was some major stretching going on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First thing I always check with a new personal care product is the fragrance - with sensitive skin and seasonal allergy issues myself and with other members of my family, it&#x27;s a real concern.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have cellulite, but after going from 210 to 150 pounds, I have a lot of stubborn fat and loose skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a petite person and pretty active</li>
            <li>it is not runny at all, rather it&#x27;s a nice thick white cream that stays where you want it, yet is absorbed quickly into the skin without leaving behind any greasiness or other residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For some reason they look SO much more less noticeable than they ever have while laying down, so Im not quite sure if its helping them or making them worse.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really on a tight budget right now..</li>
            <li>Besides reading the reviews here, I also researched the general consensus on what works to lessen cellulite.</li>
            <li>I generally use another &amp;#34;firming cream&amp;#34; on Amazon.com - but will continue to buy if results continue to improve.</li>
            <li>I had noticeable results on my thighs, and as a bonus, the old baby stretch marks on my stomach have actually lightened up a bit (and those stretch marks have been there for a while).  </li>
            <li>This is my fourth bottle so far.</li>
            <li>I work in fitness industry so obviously I exercise frequently and eat well, even with all that some cellulite still makes its self known.  </li>
            <li>I have always been self conscious about the cellulite on the back of my thighs and buttocks.</li>
            <li>After using this cream, I have to say that so far I only lost 1 inch within a period of 2 months.</li>
            <li>but my skin has completely smoothed out and there is a definite decrease in cellulite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now seeing my skin looking smooth and firm on the back of my legs and upper thighs.</li>
            <li>between my legs was getting rough because i was gaining too much weight</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see the results only after a week&#x27;s use</li>
            <li>My stretch marks are barely noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>That would be nice but truly unrealistic.</li>
            <li>So when I bought this I was very skeptical as I don&#x27;t really trust a lot of hype about any kind of skinny cream.</li>
            <li>I still have some cellulite on my belly, but it is less when I consistently use the cream for 2-3 days.</li>
            <li>I though the whole idea was to not have to do all of those other things, otherwise, what do you need the product for???</li>
            <li>After a few days I could see a little better appearance in the cellulite on my legs.  </li>
            <li>but it did make mine extremely less noticeable, to the point that I actually felt a little better about the way I look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but like others are saying it&#x27;s hard to really gauge how much of it was the cream versus just diet and exercise.</li>
            <li>And now, there is not a single damn effect.</li>
            <li>It was more expensive than the products I had been using and didn&#x27;t work nearly as well.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s harder to tell on a 50 year old than a young person.</li>
            <li>The smell is not bad; it&#x27;s hard to spead though.</li>
            <li>scent of this cream is rather unpleasant to me, but fortunately it absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>Only used it for 5 day with some exercise and am seeing small  wanna complete my first bottle</li>
            <li>I notice, def no excuse with water weight in the morning.</li>
            <li>So I bought the cream for mainly trimming my waist and inner thigh and not really for cellulite purpose.</li>
            <li>I recently lost 35lbs and had some stretch marks and cellulite at the top of my legs, not good for summer vacation wear!  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars due to the odor and the high price.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars due to the odor and the high price.</li>
            <li>Previously I had really visible cellulite because of which I was ashamed of my size 2 body, but now I can wear mini-skirt.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this product much, but when I did use it I seen slight results.</li>
            <li>My skin does feel much smoother and tight.</li>
            <li>I have cellulite and get very embrassed when the shirts are a little above the knee.</li>

            <li> Nice smell and consistency.  </li>
            <li> I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> I found this to be kind of on the pricey side, but it does seem to work well.  </li>
            <li> product was sent to me to review of my own and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be honest:  </li>
            <li> Her self esteem has improved and i&#x27;m always catching her checking her legs out in the mirror.  </li>
            <li> Time will tell how effective it is.  </li>
            <li> I was given a discount to provide honest feedback on this product .</li>
            <li> This is strictly my opinion based on my own experience *</li>
            <li> I liked this product.</li>
            <li> Now I see why this product has received so many good reviews.</li>
            <li> I think this product is fairly effective.  </li>

            <li> Just got it, feels tingly and rubs in nice.</li>
            <li> it was kind of disappointing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Skinny Cream is quite effective at diminishing the appearance of cellulite, but keep in mind that is not an overnight miracle worker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Skinny Cream for a couple months now along with my workout plan and I am loving the results.</li>
            <li> but the cream has made my skin feel so nice.</li>
            <li> it is effective.  </li>

            <li> I made the right choice!!!</li>
            <li> This is very good and reasonable price.</li>
            <li> but since the seller won&#x27;t make good on the free bottle opportunity I guess I&#x27;ll never know....</li>
            <li> Nice moisture, but you&#x27;re better off buying the Jergens or St. Ives firming lotion...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it more than a month now and am thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li> this by far is one of the best.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
            <li> and she would buy it again; it has a pleasant smell  and absorbs quickly</li>
            <li> I SAW A GREAT IMPROVEMENT WITH THE FIRST ONE</li>
            <li> This product is great and does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too good to be true..</li>
            <li> According to me this particular skinny cream product is indeed one of the best cellulite reduction creams that are currently available in the market…thank God</li>
            <li> The product goes on very smooth, not greasy or any odor.</li>
            <li> They seem pretty happy with it and have recommended the product many times.</li>
            <li> Will continue to use, doesn&#x27;t smell to good but smells goes away quickly</li>
            <li> The cellulite reduction skinny cream is easy to apply and has a nice smell.</li>
            <li> The cream restored my skin and now it&#x27;s smooth and healthy!</li>
            <li> Skinny Cream is very smooth and feels lovely.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel very smooth as well, which I love.</li>
            <li> Before I started the medication that started a huge influx on my weight (10 pounds every do month!)</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s when I noticed an ever better improvement to my skin&#x27;s appearance, feel and touch.</li>
            <li> WHICH IS PROMINENT...</li>
            <li> Probably my results would be even better if I used it every day.</li>
            <li> Eat healthy for maximum effect&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a fitness freak</li>
            <li> and I have found the results overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed how this cream is helping to tighten the skin as I continue with my weekly workouts.</li>
            <li> This takes time and should be used along with a healthy diet and</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product :)</li>
            <li> I could never get rid of without a healthy diet and exercise.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love the way it glides on and feels so silky.  </li>
            <li> I love this and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> However if you are looking for a magical, bipity bopity boo solution then keep waiting.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t know if it does it better than a $10 cream.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying more.  </li>
            <li> Thank you for such a great product!!!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and the product works great.</li>

            <li> I love this cream.</li>
            <li> My legs are smoother, tighter, and have more TONE.</li>
            <li> &amp;#60;3 :)</li>
            <li> Her legs and thighs are noticeably smoother and more shapely, and after almost a month of use</li>
            <li> but 3 pregnancies do change your body for sure</li>
            <li> am allergic to most skin creams</li>
            <li> I’m glad I got it because I now have almost cellulite free-thighs and better looking skin.</li>
            <li> This does not work magic on cellulite.</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>

            <li> Again, love this product..</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll  love it.</li>
            <li> I do exercise, eat healthy food and drink a lot of water.</li>
            <li> This product has so many benefits, I&#x27;m not even sure where to begin.</li>
            <li> I also can&#x27;t get enough of the wonderful smell of this cream.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Hey, I&#x27;ve got some cellulite that I&#x27;d love to get rid of.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already dieting, exercising and drinking more than my recommended water, so why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
            <li> so I can only give this a 3-star rating at best.</li>
            <li> but I have always had some cellulite like many women.</li>
            <li> I found them to be mostly harmless ingredients, although one preservative in it called METHYLISOTHIAZOLINONE</li>
            <li> Been using the said product with a body wrap and it makes me sweat more during work outs.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t more than two weeks I was seeing results.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I know I wasn&#x27;t :)</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, great customer service.</li>
            <li> and I can see o lot improvement in my skin most of all my belly.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t quite sure.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I got the opportunity.</li>
            <li> I was expecting something fruity,  possibly a light dial soap kind of sent</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure this is helping also.</li>
            <li> she likes it a lot saying it is better than the one she used before.</li>
            <li> I eat healthy, work out 6 days a week and drink plenty of water</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t magically erase my cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s a lovely firming lotion but your cellulite won&#x27;t start disappearing.</li>
            <li> i love how this product works</li>
            <li> /&gt;this product make more efective , come on time</li>
            <li> Love it made my leg softer and tone</li>
            <li> the cellulite get much better</li>
            <li> Each week I see more of an improvement.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Fantastic cream!</li>
            <li> I love the way this cream makes my cream look.</li>
            <li> would repurchase when i am done!:)</li>
            <li> Overall, I think it is one of the best products I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> Of course, I eat healthy and exercise which helps.  </li>
            <li> The smell of it could be better.</li>
            <li> Just started using all over my body, also bought 4 more bottles today.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting more</li>
            <li> My thighs don&#x27;t have as many lumps anymore.</li>
            <li> and I exercise 3-5 times a week, drink water and eat fairly healthy.  </li>
            <li> so glad i got to test free for review!</li>
            <li> Works into top layers of adipose tissue/fat.</li>
            <li> and I m thinking to get more to have a better result..</li>
            <li> So along with that, I have been pleased.</li>
            <li> I will surely be  buying more.</li>
            <li> I love in Hawaii</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to see greater results with more use, it does have a almost unnoticeable smell and I like that the tube stands up on its cap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricy, but I decided to buy another bottle to keep trying it and see if it does anything else with more use.</li>
            <li> After I&#x27;d used it for awhile I got more use to it, but it&#x27;s something I can see some would have a problem with.</li>
            <li> By the time my wedding rolls around, I will feel much more confident.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it every day and love the results.</li>
            <li> My skin has become healthy too</li>
            <li> My wife love it.</li>
            <li> However, in the meantime I have noticed firmer skin, better skin tone, and well moisturized skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will continue to use this for another month since many reviewers swear by this stuff</li>
            <li> and I will be sure to update in 30</li>
            <li> will be continuing with the skinny cream forever :)</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> I love it and will continue to buy it as I think it works wonders.  </li>
            <li> I layer this on after my shower in the morning and again most nights before bed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> also have been applying this to my belly and legs, which both need a bit more work, but there has been improvement.</li>
            <li> This has an interesting scent, halfway between cocoa butter and suntan lotion.</li>
            <li> I cant imagine using this for a month and what this magical cream can do.</li>
            <li> Im glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> So my results, which were excellent, were achieved using the product only once a day on most days.</li>
            <li> But I did gain even more cellulite from the weight gain.</li>
            <li> And besides that, I just love how smooth it makes my legs feel!</li>

            <li> Skinny Cream combined with drinking water, eating healthy, working out, and using a cellulite massager has worked WONDERS for me.</li>
            <li> and I try to eat healthy</li>
            <li> I have to use a separate moisturizer on top of Skinny cream</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> Our latest one was almost 10 pounds at birth, and my wife is a petite lady</li>
            <li> simply the best...</li>
            <li> i really feel happy for finding this...</li>
            <li> This product really works great..  </li>
            <li> Use this product:)</li>
            <li> MY LEGS LOOK SO MUCH BETTER SINCE I STARTED USING THIS.  </li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, I just ordered 10 more tubes last night, that is how pleased I am with this product!!!</li>
            <li> But I think it&#x27;s a great product to use during warm weather when you&#x27;ll be wearing shorts or a bathing suit or before major events where you&#x27;ll be wearing a dress that shows your legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There was a significant discount on this product which was nice</li>
            <li> I am in my 50&#x27;s and can say it is a great product for older women.</li>
            <li> Highly reccomend, great bang for the buck.</li>
            <li> I think an very reasonable alternative for the time being is using this cream along with good exercise, water etc...</li>
            <li> Excellent product, lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> Looked pretty good.</li>
            <li> Good product and Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have to say this stuff is pretty good as diminishing cellulite and making your skin look smoother.</li>
            <li> I was really intrigued when I saw Skinny Cream and was thrilled to have a chance to order it through a promotion in order to provide my honest and unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To top it off, the seller just ignored all my calls and messages to get a free bottle as it says on the top of bottle to do.</li>
            <li> bought this cream because of good reviews, and now I can say that I agree with all positive reviews: this cream works.</li>
            <li> really happy with my results so far!</li>
            <li> With a good habbit of eating right and applying this, it has made my skin smooth</li>
            <li> Despite the ingredients of raspberry and coffee bean, Skinny Cream didn’t have a really nice smell (but it didn’t exactly stink, either!)  </li>
            <li> So far great product.</li>
            <li> and so far I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep using the product but not too happy so far.</li>
            <li> Skin is more smooth.</li>
            <li> I have used this product faithfully (day and night for 3 weeks) and yes, it does produce an okay smell, it does go on smoothly and it firms some areas BUT not all...</li>
            <li> I have already seen results in the water retention phase and I will be buying more of this fantastic product.</li>
            <li> It made my skin look so smooth and way better.</li>
            <li> exercise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this Skinny Cream complimentary in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I just lie to her like any good husband would, or one that wants to avoid a verbal beating.  </li>
            <li> This did absolutely nothing for me, didn&#x27;t even smell good, took forever to absorb and produced no results whatsoever.</li>
            <li> i just have to share my good news with everybody who wants to be skinny.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would not recommend SKINNY CREAM unless you really want to alienate your loved ones.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the investment even when it isn&#x27;t at a promo price for an honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing seen improvement in my skin within a week of use and smells really good</li>
            <li> It is very easy to spread on and it absorbs quickly into my skin.</li>
            <li> i feel the cream works and helps only because  i combine it with working out and a good diet!</li>
            <li> I am really excited to see what will happen in 7 more weeks using this product.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see the difference a full bottle makes!</li>
            <li> In combination with exercise, and eating healthy, this is a great addition for those areas that need an extra lift.</li>
            <li> The bottle is practical and easy to dispense.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> I saw results very quickly after using Skinny Cream on my thighs.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t gain weight easily</li>
            <li> have struggled with cellulite since hitting my mid 40&#x27;s, so it&#x27;s great to see that my body is getting better day by day.</li>
            <li> The creme was easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> I was very, very, pleasantly surprised and am very impressed that a cream can reduce my cellulite as much as it does.</li>
            <li> I was very, very, pleasantly surprised and am very impressed that a cream can reduce my cellulite as much as it does.</li>
            <li> And the smell is strong.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like how strong the smell is, though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rather strong.</li>
            <li> but it is (1) strong and (2) long-lasting.</li>
            <li> Except for the strong fragrance, after two days of using this cream, the skin on my thighs looked firmer so will continue using it.</li>
            <li> Some may find the smell a bit strong, but in this case I would suggest you apply it before bedtime.</li>
            <li> cream has a strong smell.  </li>
            <li> This cream has a strong scent but you will get use to it after while</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m loving the product!</li>
            <li> I love this cream because I am losing  belly fat very easy and very</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, and a pleasant surprise it is, this stuff actually works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> This product is amazing, i would totally recommend this to anyone that is trying to reduce the appearance of cellulite and it works great for such a good price.</li>
            <li> , the smell of the lotion is aweful, the price I think is fair if your looking for something new to try</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been feeling so much more confident thanks to this cream!</li>
            <li> It applies easily and has a light, pleasing scent.</li>
            <li> Enjoyed this tremendously.</li>
            <li> I really like this Skinny Cream because it is making my thighs look better!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a little over 4 weeks now, and I&#x27;m incredibly impressed with my results!</li>
            <li> My wife uses it and I can see a huge difference (wink wink).  </li>
            <li> Before I started the medication that started a huge influx on my weight (10 pounds every d</li>
            <li> a huge difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I can see a huge difference in size of my arms.</li>
            <li> UNLESS the bottle is huge for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To give you an accurate picture of how well this cream works I must tell you why I wanted to use it to begin with.  </li>
            <li> This is a great topical solution.  </li>
            <li> But okay, if it works, it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was just wondering if anyone has called that number on the packaging it comes with that says you recieve a free bottle when you call that number.  </li>
            <li> The skin feels smooth, with no sticky residue.</li>
            <li> This has a light cooling sensation after a couple minutes, but does not burn.</li>
            <li> I used this cream  last year for about 5 months, it works great.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I hope to receive the free bottle from them</li>
            <li> It will not transform your legs from those that belong in a size fourteen pant into legs that can suddenly fit into size six pants.  </li>
            <li> Yep this skeptic paid for this product after my free trial run</li>
            <li> That said, I wanted to be brave and give potential customers the &amp;#34;skinny&amp;#34; (hurr) on just using this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth.</li>
            <li> Even if it doesn&#x27;t eliminate my cellulite, I do have quite a bit, it&#x27;s a fabulous lotion.</li>
            <li> Its cheap so who cares</li>
            <li> I, however, enjoy the scent, as it reminds me of peppermint.</li>
            <li> I have simply grown to trust this product after I noticed the great improvement it has done to my skin</li>
            <li> The texture is about perfect, but it did take awhile to rub in (I might just be impatient).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a great find.</li>
            <li> I still waiting for my free bottom.</li>
            <li> I like free just like anyone and called the number and was directed to a website to give my information.</li>
            <li> When I purchased the item it had well over a 4-star rating so once realized that people were probably leaving reviews for the free product</li>
            <li> My skin got really smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> I would advise that one eat properly, exercise and try to great product.</li>
            <li> I try this product for free</li>
            <li> My legs aren&#x27;t 100% smooth</li>
            <li> I am so happy with it and will continue to use it regularly!</li>
            <li> The skin on my face has legitimately never felt so smooth.</li>
            <li> It really decreases the appearance of cellulite after 6 weeks,if you want to get better result,you need to keep eating healthy and doing exercise as well.</li>
            <li> have seen good tighten results so far and will continue to use this cream becuase</li>
            <li> (My 16 year old just laughed.)  </li>
            <li> This stuff really does work, and makes me feel more confident when I&#x27;m wearing shorts or dresses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about everything on the market for cellulite lotions/creams/gels and so far so good.</li>
            <li> So far, results are good.</li>
            <li> So far so good for me.</li>
            <li> Wow, nothing but love for this product!&lt;br /&gt;The skin on my thigh tightens up so nicely.</li>
            <li> Product smells nice and absorbs into the skin pretty quickly without leaving you feeling greasy which is a plus.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect some magic weight loss continue to eat right and exercise, but I guarantee it will help you tone and get rid of that unwanted fat faster than just dieting and exercising alone.</li>
            <li> Not bad or rotten, but somewhat strongly like wood chips?</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and very easy to use, made it appart of my daily routine.noticed resluts in 1 week.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> after applying make sure the cream is absorbed well before dressing to get the full benefit.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I have no idea if SKINNY CREAM does what it is supposed to do, although I highly doubt it (the claims being rather fantastical).  </li>
            <li> Overall this product is amazing and does work like it states when it comes to reducing the look and feel of your cellulite!</li>
            <li> They are still there, but they have diminished significantly.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a significant difference</li>
            <li> The company replied promptly and is friendly.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that she is sold on the product, and she hasn&#x27;t asked me to order more, so that&#x27;s pretty telling.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this item.</li>
            <li> and I have seen a significant result.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure that it&#x27;s a scam.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m pretty sure that it&#x27;s a scam, don&#x27;t buy anything from this buyer</li>
            <li> I am so excited I was chosen to test this for quality and express my opinion about the product.  </li>
            <li> She has been using this for a long time now and seems happy with the results.</li>
            <li> It is totally worth the price though!</li>
            <li> I gave the product 3 stars as it is too soon to tell if it will work on cellulite; the bottle states that you will need 8 wks to see significant results.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I was given this to try for my review.</li>
            <li> I love that it does exactly as it says.</li>
            <li> I would recommenced to anyone interested in getting glossy and smooth skin!</li>
            <li> but my husband and I have noticed a significant difference in the appearance of my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is well worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I think you have to make sure you&#x27;ll applying both morning and night consistently though.</li>
            <li> I like most about the cream is that it absorbs very fast into your skin and feel it working right away!</li>
            <li> I am able to control my lose skin now and look far much better than before.</li>
            <li> I can truly see myself cellulite free very soon:))</li>
            <li> , i work out 4-5 days a week, and i eat as clean as i can..</li>
            <li> One unexpected side effect is that my skin has NEVER looked better or felt better.</li>
            <li> She stuck with the applications, and after regular use she had some great success.</li>
            <li> I actually found it to be pleasant.</li>
            <li> I bought it more for skin toning (than cellulite reduction), and the results were positive for me.  </li>
            <li> If it can clear that up, it can surely help out with cellulite too!</li>
            <li> After reading some of the other reviews, to be fair, I think I have to give it more of a chance.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Skinny Cream is easy to use, smells good, and it shows in a few weeks (better to use twice a day).</li>
            <li> and it certainly has all the latest recommended weight loss supplements (with the exception of Garcinia Cambogia).</li>
            <li> I can feel it tightening right after I rub it in!</li>
            <li> and I feel a whole lot better about myself.</li>
            <li> Most scents really cause havoc with me</li>
            <li> I recently lost a good amount of weight and had some excess tummy cellulite.</li>
            <li> I am ½ through my bottle and still use it because the results were good enough for me.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a good enough person to get it for them because I care.</li>
            <li> So many creams I have tried over the years haven&#x27;t really delivered results.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t tell how much it has helped more than that.</li>
            <li> I recommend this cream to anyone that is constant using it and want to see good results.</li>
            <li> I really like that it isn&#x27;t sticky as most creams of this type are.</li>
            <li> Its fast and totally safe for everyone&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> Actually it would have been unimaginable if I hadn&#x27;t exposed myself to it a good 60 times.</li>
            <li> those true nature beauties out there</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve try many skinny cream, and this is one really works.</li>
            <li> The texture of my skin really seemed to love the ingredients of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The appearance of the skin is much firmer and more even.</li>
            <li> I have started exercising more and drinking 6 glasses of water a day, hopefully this helps because everything else I have done really doesnt do anything.</li>
            <li> I feel like it makes me go to the bathroom more often, and it has an unusual smell to it.</li>
            <li> I have to make a full disclosure here.</li>
            <li> I am still covered in cellulite after using one full bottle.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it any stars is because it smells good.</li>
            <li> A really cool product.</li>
            <li> I love it so much</li>
            <li> I know it is best to use the product for at least a month to get the full results.</li>
            <li> not bad for the price of 20 bucks at all.</li>
            <li> but really it&#x27;s not as bad as they&#x27;re making it out to be.</li>
            <li> I have to say Im very excited to have found this product and recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> the cream is fantastic you can feel it right away .</li>
            <li> The orange peel skin will disappear quickly, some areas were overnight, the rest took the full 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> They are slowly but surely going away!!!</li>
            <li> Besides, I have no allergy or any other sort of reaction to it, it has great texture, absorbs well, not greasy or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect quick overnight results.</li>
            <li> I am super picky when it comes to products.</li>
            <li> but I got the chance to try this product free of charge for my own personal unbias review.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t expect a quick maricle.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> i love my sexy back!!</li>
            <li> The only plus side is that it smells better then most products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I was lucky when I remembered to use it once a day.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, once it&#x27;s soaked in the scent goes away (or isn&#x27;t noticeable).  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly into your skin and is not greasy feeling at all.</li>
            <li> just recently changed my diet to add more water and healthier food, and the results have improved even more.</li>
            <li> I have been using it twice a day on the back of my thighs, and it has really reduced my bumps and dimples -  and my skin tone and firmness has also greatly improved.</li>
            <li> After giving birth to my two wonderful kiddo&#x27;s and then loosing all the weight has left tummy &amp; buttocks area...  with a lot of extra skin.  </li>
            <li> Plus it smells fantastic, isnt sticky or oily, and absorbs very fast.</li>
            <li> I think the smell is pleasant, much better than the antifreeze smelling products I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> , I was pretty fit but still had a patch of stubborn cellulite and one dimple</li>
            <li> but it comes very close and is by far the best topical cream I have come across.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products and Skinny Cream works the best by far.</li>
            <li> , I was pretty fit but still had a patch of stubborn cellulite and one dimple</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d suggest getting one bottle of it and giving it a try for awhile to see if you notice results that are greater than your normal results from just diet and exercise.</li>
            <li> first noticed that my legs started to feel extremely smooth after 3-4 days of use.</li>
            <li> First off, when you receive the item it will come with a slip that says you can get a bottle for free</li>
            <li> I recently lost a lot of weight, and have been using this on my arms, very pleased girl.</li>
            <li> My fiance applied this as instructed, and she hasn&#x27;t felt this good about herself in a long time.</li>
            <li> It does make your skin soft but the smell is so strong!</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is sufficient in the bottle to last a good while comparing to the other one I had which was a good brand also</li>
            <li> I am 24 and my new form should not be a problem (always overweight now a healthily weight)</li>
            <li> but is too small bottle , smells good and for sure make exercice and use</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by how effective this product really is!</li>
            <li> The product comes in quite a large squeeze-tube bottle, which will surely last months and is great for dispensing exactly the amount I need.</li>
            <li> Like many women out there, I&#x27;m always looking for new high quality products to use on my skin to make it feel more soft, moisturized, and healthy.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy doing this for myself, it is a positive experience for me.  </li>
            <li> other than that, IT IS AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Two weeks after starting my legs are looking better than they ever have!</li>
            <li> I saw results within the first two weeks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other creams and this is by far the best one that shows noticeable results, the only one that I&#x27;ll continue using, worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> This summer is going to be a lot more fun because my legs look better than they have in a long time!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not unpleasant (it&#x27;s quite nice actually)</li>
            <li> so it feels great to watch it disappear a little every day.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely a miracle worker--it actually has effectively improved my skin--no more cellulite!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice anything other than a pleasant scent with this lotion.  </li>
            <li> I used it every day after shower with heavy massage and sometimes saunas, the effect was great after usage and little reduced after a day, but you shouldn&#x27;t expect a great difference in a week- for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it on the back of my legs and have had amazing results.</li>
            <li> My skin is much firmer and has a smooth texture.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks I noticed some great results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Add a proper diet and exercise and the results are Amazing.</li>
            <li> You will notice amazing results in only a matter of days.</li>
            <li> buy it one more time to complete the course.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on how soft my skin is.....</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t know if it worth the $29 price tag</li>
            <li> It is better to go the old school way and use coffee grains instead with coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I did think, however, it would be a nice lotion without any claims that it would do something that a topical lotion is incapable of doing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s VERYYY SOFT : ) and does tighten up the skin.</li>
            <li> It is definitely getting rid of extra water and making the skin on my thighs tighter and look smoother .I am happy that it works because I am more confident about wearing shorts and skirts in public places.</li>
            <li> I read reviews of this product and thought to give a try and its worth</li>
            <li> I would say this is only some kind of cream that worth $1 per bottle</li>
            <li> /&gt;While the product works to a degree, it requires a lot of it to be applied to be effective and it has to be applied daily to maintain results</li>
            <li> This was my first time using the product and was very pleased with the initial results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money,it won&#x27;t be disappoint.</li>
            <li> worth the price trust me</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li> The cream has a nice consistency, not too thick but yet not runny at all, it does spread nicely without running and is quickly absorbed .</li>
            <li> And I love that this cream is not heavy</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s all it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it.e to get, I think it might be something worth spending the money on for the warmer months at least.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Its worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am thrilled to finally see it go away.  </li>
            <li> Her skin not only looks better because the wrinkles and stretch marks are no longer there, it’s also silky smooth.</li>
            <li> This is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Worth the buy.</li>
            <li> I already have my second bottle so excited to see what that does even more.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with cellulite after my first child birth, so it feels great to watch it disappear a little every day.</li>
            <li> The price on Amazon compared to other products like it is good.</li>
            <li> But when I found Skinny cream, i thought this is product right for me.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> It moisturizes just right</li>
            <li> Right now all I smell is some funky odor.</li>
            <li> suggest to eat right and exercise,  </li>
            <li> Just work out and eat right.</li>
            <li> right at a month now.</li>
            <li> When i rub the cream on my thigs, it goes right inside and the skin just absorbs the cream right away.</li>
            <li> and ive noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li> but I believe using this product consistently will prove effective and lasting results.</li>
            <li> i love  it so far it works for my problem areas when i first use</li>
            <li> Over the past year I have been using Strivectin\\&quot;s body firming cream and thought I was happy with those results.  </li>
            <li> I am highly pleased with the product since the result starts showing from the very first application and they are not just temporary improvements only.</li>
            <li> fact, I&#x27;ve ordered 3 more tubes for my friends who need to shed a little cellulite too :)</li>
            <li> cream itself has a light, pleasant fragrance and is pretty thick in texture.</li>
            <li> and I stated to see results right with the first one.</li>
            <li> I always test out cream by using it on my ears (funny, right?).</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for only a couple of weeks and so far so good.</li>
            <li> I Purchased this item about a month ago, Im seven months pregnant, and trying to prepare to get back in shape after the baby, But am an inpatient person and decided to go ahead and use the skinny cream, I have already seen results and I&#x27;m sure that after the baby comes this product will help me get back to a even better shape</li>
            <li> Most products that promise to &amp;#34;reduce cellulite&amp;#34; rarely work, but this stuff lives up to its name entirely!!</li>
            <li> Thank you very much for this product</li>
            <li> And very fast to.</li>
            <li> Which if you are wanting something to rev up your system is fine, but I am sensitive to caffeine</li>
            <li> No dramatic improvement but was worth the try.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend SKINNY CREAM to every woman who wants HOT LEGS!</li>
            <li> It really worked for me!</li>
            <li> Really works!</li>
            <li> I was dubious at first when we purchased it but within weeks I noticed a drastic change in my gf&#x27;s legs as well as her confidence.</li>
            <li> But one should follow a healthy diet and a proper work out along it for the maximum result.</li>
            <li> It lasts and while slightly strong at first it becomes less strong once my skin absorbed it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel but leaves my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d like to give it more time because I was only using it once a day not twice a day which is indicated on the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Does exactly what the description says.</li>
            <li> too stinky, had to wash off on first use</li>
            <li> Skinny Cream gave a noticeable difference after the first 5-7 days.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Skinny Cream!</li>
            <li> and I am now summer ready!</li>
            <li> haha!  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell pretty</li>
            <li> If it only gets better from here, I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I try to stay fit for myself and 4yr old daughter.</li>
            <li> I recommend using it with a cellulite brush daily as well for even better results.</li>
            <li> The product does exactly what it claims amd helps reduce dimples where celulite is formed</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to come back every 2 weeks for more.</li>
            <li> From the first application I noticed immediate results.</li>
            <li> and I really do see some improvement!  </li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve only been able to use the cream once a day because:</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to rather or not it actually reduces cellulite over time because I could never use it more than once.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t aware until I already applied the cream that caffeine is one of its leading ingredients so if this is an issue for anyone please be aware of this.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first but after reading the reviews I gave it a try</li>
            <li> My skin is looking pretty firmer</li>
            <li> The first 3 products I bought didn&#x27;t work at all, I was devastated and thought and thought that I was gonna be stuck with my cellulite forever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed that my skin feels much smoother than before I started using this cream (added bonus!).</li>
            <li> and I can really tell the difference!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna continue to use this product for more results and to prevent future cellulite from returning!</li>
            <li> The flab seems to be disappearing fast!</li>
            <li> It does smell funny</li>
            <li> I can tell I´ve seen inmediate lasting  results but my skin looks better wen</li>
            <li> and it really works!  </li>
            <li> After five days of consistent application, I began to notice some smoothing on my legs.  </li>
            <li> pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of product amount, I found that I had to use quite a bit and one bottle</li>
            <li> i even use the whole bottle!</li>
            <li> The sides and backs of my upper thighs look 75% better and it just wows me.</li>
            <li> I saw results within the first week.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Smells kinda funny.</li>
            <li> I am really amazed!</li>
            <li> It feels smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> And within the first couple weeks I saw a difference.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t really like the smell of it!</li>
            <li> skin, especially my legs, look so much more smoother.</li>
            <li> I wish the cream will absorb better as it takes time to actually rub it into skin.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and makes my legs so soft and moisturized all while diminishing the appearance of my cellulite.  </li>
            <li> But I also eat healthy, and exercise 5-6 times a week regularly.</li>
            <li> I am not quite sure why I have celluite seeing as how I only weigh 110</li>
            <li> I was so amazed that my waist actually lost its love handles.....</li>
            <li> I will be the first to tell you that there is no miracle cure or cream out there</li>
            <li> I do eat healthy &amp; workout regularly</li>
            <li> Ok I wanna say this cream is like a topical laxative.</li>
            <li> This is my first product review.</li>
            <li> Must be consistent.</li>
            <li> bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look, I want to believe that there is this magic cream that makes cellulite vanish instantly, but the saying goes &amp;#34;If</li>
            <li> Im on my first bottle and been using twice a day for almost a month</li>
            <li> , Im starting to notice my legs are looking a lot better.</li>
            <li> already n cellulite is starting to disappear:)</li>
            <li> Recommended for people who wants to improve their skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in the tightness of my skin after the first couple of uses.</li>
            <li> and I finally found this cream works magic, I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I love this product and would use it again if and when it comes back.</li>
            <li> Even at my thinnest/most fit I still had cellulite, so I am pleasantly surprised to see it working now at my heaviest.  </li>
            <li> In Europe, a company has to show that a chemical is safe before putting it in a product, but in the US it&#x27;s the opposite; if there is no evidence it causes harm, you can use it.</li>
            <li> Since I have been using it religiously, I will need more soon.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this product every day and absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> is smoothing it out, but it will probably take a few bottles to get good results.</li>
            <li> I have tried several creams and this is the only one that works, smells pleasant and absorbs into the skin without leaving a tacky feeling.  </li>
            <li> It goes right in the skin fast and doesnt leave a sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> and this is the first product that did not cause a rash or any other kind of reaction.</li>
            <li> Not the usual pleasant lotion smell.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I tried this product because it does have some great ingredients in it that are known for cellulite reduction, however, perhaps not a high enough concentration.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products, but this is hands down the best.</li>
            <li> This smells nice and unlike other products, it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Well finally I found this product and saw all the good reviews it had, and decided to give it a try one last time.</li>
            <li> haha..the muscle already become softer and cellulite is reduced significantly！！The product is quite good considering such low price.</li>
            <li> I have a 15 yr old special needs son who has relied on my care 100% day and night..</li>
            <li> It seems to have some positive results.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the product bec of the positive reviews</li>
            <li> She was becoming self-conscious about the lines that were left after the healing process and wanted to find something that would help improve her skin.</li>
            <li> For the price it really can’t be beaten, and the results really show!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure many people despise cellulite, I am certainly not the only one.</li>
            <li> so it a something nice and easy to help with my thick thighs and butt!</li>
            <li> Cant wait to see more long term effects!</li>
            <li> I have used this whole bottle exactly as directed twice a day and it did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> I was less than thrilled.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 2 weeks, it&#x27;s easy to use,  and I think Its starting to work.</li>
            <li> and my skin felt super soft as well.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely thicker than lotion, but still applies easily and evenly.</li>
            <li> After having a baby and naturally large thighs on a petite frame, I&#x27;ll try, try again.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m fairly certain that lifestyle is not a factor.</li>
            <li> and I will have to say certainly your body will not retain some of your water intake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the cream for about two weeks now and the results are quick!</li>
            <li> Even though I had saw the many, many good reviews on this product before I purchased it, I was still somewhat skeptical about whether or not it would actually work well for me, but it had certainly made a believer out of me, and after only my first week of use.</li>
            <li> I decided to test it out in certain spots, you know, to really see if it works.  </li>
            <li> the very least, I do feel like my legs feel energized using it although I have seen no change in appearance of the cellulite as yet -- except maybe a nice placebo glow of smooth just after putting it on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> Now she wants to go to the beach to show off her body.</li>
            <li> I have really noticed a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> This product works miracles, So I highly recommended to everyone!</li>
            <li> I recommend this highly!</li>
            <li> and you really need to rub it into your skin.</li>
            <li> It worked really well.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> and so this was very helpful to decrease what I had.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting much</li>
            <li> This cream really worked well for me.  </li>
            <li> It really has worked for me tightening my thigs and abdomen,  </li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> really helps a lot to reduce the cellulite.</li>
            <li> and I probably won&#x27;t pay that much again.  </li>
            <li> and I really like that about this cream.</li>
            <li> and it really worked.</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> is really working.&lt;br /&gt;Remember</li>
            <li> It really reduced signs of cellulite for me</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month and really haven&#x27;t noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves this product.</li>
            <li> Cream works ok not as well as I expected</li>
            <li> I really adore this product.</li>
            <li> I use it every day for about 2 months it did absolutely nothing</li>
            <li> but then folks believe the lotion did its job when really all it did was keep the skin from drying out.</li>
            <li> Even though this is not a wrinkle cream, I have  creases on my ear lobe that really bug me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much cellulite</li>
            <li> She really likes this cream for all her &#x27;treatments&#x27; and her skin is smoother...</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really feeling like showing my legs or tummy on my video, but</li>
            <li> But it does take some work to really rub it in.</li>
            <li> It is really works.</li>
            <li> However, I personally don&#x27;t really like the smell</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li> and it absolutely worked .</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t seen a difference since I used it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> So i wouldn&#x27;t really bother buying this product.</li>
            <li> When used with an anti-cellulite massager, this cream works very well to stimulate the skin and circulation.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 2 months, did not see much result on me.</li>
            <li> and/or who wants to have noticeably firmer and smoother skin.</li>
            <li> This Skinny cream works really well, not just on cellulite, but it also reduces the appearance of my scars....</li>
            <li> and I can really tell the cellulite I have</li>
            <li> is really going away, u jVe to give it time though.</li>
            <li> If I could afford to, I would use it on my whole body.</li>
            <li> The Real Deal!&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> It was shipped really fast</li>
            <li> I think this product does something, but you really have to treat this product&#x27;s application like you would washing your face or brushing your teeth -- application has to occur every day to maintain the results that do occur.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend it to all.</li>
            <li> , I was very</li>
            <li> I could REALLY tell when I stopped using it for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> It is very fast-acting.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about two weeks now and while I haven&#x27;t seen drastic results, I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t greasy and my skin is much softer.  </li>
            <li> but it finished to fast.</li>
            <li> This has really tightened and toned my arms.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than plastic surgery and body</li>
            <li> so I really don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li> Works fast</li>
            <li> highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I actually enjoy the smell, too, which can be a big problem sometimes with these things.  </li>
            <li> it not too much work</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think any cream can really do that.</li>
            <li> seller, fast and as described.</li>
            <li> This product really works.  </li>
            <li> but it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I probably wouldn&#x27;t notice the scent as much if I didn&#x27;t apply this to my neck.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve being using it for about two weeks and my legs are much</li>
            <li> very quickly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t all disappear but much improved.</li>
            <li> This product really does reduce cellulite on any area of the body.</li>
            <li> This has really made quite a difference in the appearance of cellulite.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a week of using this product, I really started to see a difference.</li>
            <li> However, after the results I got so far and continue to get, I think it might be something worth spending the money on for the warmer months at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cellulite is definitely not as obvious as it used to be prior to applying this cream religiously, so I&#x27;ve been able to wear skirts more often without worrying about how my thighs look from the back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t too much like some say.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received the product quite fast after placing the order here.</li>
            <li> and it really did help tighten my tummy.</li>
            <li> It took about 4 days to  really see the difference.</li>
            <li> Gave this as a gift to my wife and she just absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> The product is very creamy and not greasy like the Nivea cream.  </li>
            <li> This product truly works and has fast results..</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Now my skin looks butter smooth and much younger.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really helping with her cellulite.</li>
            <li> I was very please with it and does the job.love</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to keep my legs looking fresh if I happen to have a busy week and not work out.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the cream.</li>
            <li> And if you&#x27;re looking for help with cellulite, speak to a medical professional or just accept your genetic lot in life. :).</li>
            <li> I tried a lot of cellulite and firming creams, this one is by far one of my favorites!!!</li>
            <li> ... I would say: smell nice, feel on skin pleasant (may be like any other good body creams), but it is hard to say if it is works for body as promised because... it is too little size of bottle and not much cream.</li>
            <li> This product has given me way better results than any other cellulite products like Nivea&#x27;s Goodbye Cellulite which appeared to do nothing.</li>
            <li> Compared to other brands, I&#x27;ve noticed that you seem to get more for your money here, as the quantity is quite generous.</li>
            <li> Now is this due to this magic cream or the fact that I am losing fat and working out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other creams and</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re anything like me, you like some parts of your body more than other parts.</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers have already said, it takes a couple weeks to notice results.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve tried many other products claiming cellulite reductions to no</li>
            <li> I needed the full 30 days before I saw any real change, but well into the second bottle I&#x27;m still seeing results.</li>
            <li> Really had high hopes for this..</li>
            <li> First I want to say that I am scent sensitive.</li>
            <li> I really like this product; it was very creamy but; make sure you use it everyday.</li>
            <li> The really surprising thing is that for the sake of the review, I rubbed a nickle-sized dollop on to my left arm, and hours later, it&#x27;s decidedly smoother and younger looking.  </li>
            <li> It is not a bad price for Skinny Cream and you will see that  when you compare prices with others brand names., and you get the same results.</li>
            <li> I suffer from very dry skin and have noticed it has made my skin very silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> Myself, I found the smell more- than odd, kindof like play dough, sunscreen, machine-shop oil and tempura paint.  </li>
            <li> and I put a decent amount on my target areas.  </li>
            <li> This is a decent product.</li>
            <li> It definitely does help, however, the ones with retinol and caffeine in them work much better for me, and are about the same price.</li>
            <li> I got decent results from it.</li>
            <li> I was recommended to buy this by my older brother to buy this</li>
            <li> Mainly was using it on my outer thighs.</li>
            <li> My main problem area is the lower part of my buttocks and hips as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because of the obvious firming, I do think this would be much more beneficial when used during a big life change/new diet &amp; exercise regime.</li>
            <li> I now enjoy wearing short shorts and mini-skirts, not the kind that make you look like a hooker or desperate but the kind that shows just enough skin.</li>
            <li> I have used many different products at all different prices but nothing works like this.  </li>
            <li> It was moisturizing and left my skin feeling soft and smooth all day throug.</li>
            <li> The overall area seems to be smaller and more shapely as well.</li>
            <li> and I will definitely be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li> We both were not happy with the smell, as there was nothing pleasant about it.</li>
            <li> That means healthy, tone and tight.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anybody looking to get rid of cellulite.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product -</li>
            <li> but since obesity is a high in family history</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it..</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I saw it had a fairly high rating - which drew me in to begin with.</li>
            <li> yes, I highly recommend the project.</li>
            <li> yes, I highly recommend the project.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this cream, but it didn&#x27;t quite make it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> As far as the cream itself goes, it took a couple of days to get used to the way this cream smells but it smells much better than other cellulite creams that I have used.</li>
            <li> I received a call back a day later stating to use the product for a month and to leave a positive review to get the free product.</li>
            <li> It did not remove the cellulite, but it did tone a little better.</li>
            <li> This is the only cream that Really Works!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is ok, the texture is a little too creamy for me - I prefer gel-like textures.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I feel it working - also makes skin so soft!!  </li>
            <li> With continued use of this product, I will actually be purchasing my first set of shorts in about 3 years!</li>
            <li> With continued use of this product, I will actually be purchasing my first set of shorts in about 3 years!</li>
            <li> She has been using it for a little more than two months, and has even been putting it in baskets for baby shower gifts for her friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to keeping on using it and seeing more results down the line!</li>
            <li> So, thanks to SKINNY CREAM, I can show my legs off with no inhibitions and with complete confidence.</li>
            <li> It has a very funky, kind of nasty smell to it, lol.</li>
            <li> To be clear, there is no miracle cream that will get rid of the handful of skin that has been stretched, however it has helped smooth out and even out the these areas.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t find different types of useful products at one place elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I tend to get really puffy on my legs and such and this helps so much!  </li>
            <li> I will keep applying it fore a few more months.</li>
            <li> Get it works brand defining gel, only thing worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different products like this one and this is my favorite so far.  </li>
            <li> My skin is much more firm where I use it.  </li>
            <li> husband has been even complements me more and has noticed a stark difference.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have consulted with a few surgeons for a tummy tuck, being quoted 8-10 grand.  </li>
            <li> When I first bough this cream I really had no idea that it could actually turn out to be</li>
            <li> When used consistently your skin is full and the cellulite appears to be less visible.</li>
            <li> The bottle is easy to open and squeeze and you just rub it in like you would a regular lotion for the skin.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see that this actually does reduce the visibility of cellulite tremendously.</li>
            <li> I do exercise several times a week and TRY to eat right</li>
            <li> I definitely want to keep using the product over the summer since it tightens my skin right away</li>
            <li> Obviously it doesn&#x27;t take care of all of your problems right away</li>
            <li> but it definitely helps take a step in the right direction.</li>
            <li> My skin feels more firm and the texture is improved - wow!  </li>
            <li> , I have to say it is very small bottle for the price, however it smells nice.</li>
            <li> As I often try new creams to find the working ones, this time I think I &#x27;ve found the one doing his</li>
            <li> and it has boosted her confidence to a new level.</li>
            <li> I tried a huge number of products and wasted more money than I should trying anything other than the Skinny Cream!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have had no issues.</li>
            <li> The cream makes my skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t need much and the smell is strong but not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> I am a very active, healthy and fit person who still suffers from cellulite, but this Skinny Cream sure helps the appearance.</li>
            <li> , it says that you should apply it twice a day, I only did it once after I showered, the first couple of weeks</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t look exactly like the gal in the blue bikini (yet!)that they have pictured with the bottle, but the cream has a noticeable smoothing effect.</li>
            <li> This is the first product out of all the products I&#x27;ve tried before that actually works for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I need to give it more time to see results</li>
            <li> This is the second week I&#x27;m using it, and I can tell now that the areas I put the cream on getting skinny faster than other areas of my body:)</li>
            <li> No more cottage cheese, more like skim milk baby (wink wink).  </li>
            <li> Once in the morning, and once at night is enough to see results on my hamstrings, glutes, and quads within the first two weeks.</li>
            <li> I can see a small change, but am sure</li>
            <li> I am sure, so I think I have lost a few pounds using it!</li>
            <li> so I can continue using the said product and be able to see if I can lose some inches and resolve the excessive skin problem I had after my weight lose program.</li>
            <li> This is only my first bottle and there is never a miracle cream that&#x27;s just going to fix everything at once.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for several weeks almost exactly as directed.  </li>
            <li> I used this product twice daily for about 4 weeks and saw a significant different in my skin.</li>
            <li> In the past, I&#x27;ve received many compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li> Soon you will be a Firm Believer! :)</li>
            <li> But after I&#x27;d been using it not regularly for several weeks I finally started remembering better</li>
            <li> It was really gross at first</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what I did and you will be pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> I have tried many products but will search no more.</li>
            <li> I apply it right after I shower, so you want to make sure your skin is a little wet.</li>
            <li> that’s only gonna happen only with proper diet and exercise – but the short term *appearance* benefit may be worth it if you have some special occasion to attend in which your legs will be exposed (but no pool parties!)</li>
            <li> This cream has all of the standard anti-cellulite ingredients (the main one being caffeine), and it gets high marks for not being highly perfumed.</li>
            <li> the last 2 yrs I have worked so hard every second of every day to keep him alive and with great sadness I must tell you he went to heaven in October.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way which is nice</li>
            <li> I was considering the cool sculting procedure for my abdomin which basically freezes your fat and costs about $700 per area which would likely take two areas for a total of $1,400</li>
            <li> And the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; parts, at least for me, are the ones where my skin is not smooth and beautiful.</li>
            <li> The lotion is sticky and uncomfortable feeling after application and as I said, the smell isn&#x27;t something pleasant.  </li>
            <li> But when I was watching tv later with my fiancé, I decided to rub some more on while laying down.</li>
            <li> I recently got a bottle for my roommate too, she also positively adores the results.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been looking for something to help with my last little bit of stubborn fat and stretch marks around my love handles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to argue with that :)</li>
            <li> I was so self conscious about all my cellulite, but no matter how much I worked out and dieted with the sole intention to get rid of it, it would never disappear.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t expect to look like a 20 year old once you are done.  </li>
            <li> Fits my skin and soft</li>
            <li> Overall I really like the way this is working</li>
            <li> I like the natural ingredients, too.</li>
            <li> It made my skin soft but didn&#x27;t reduce the appearance of my cellulite.</li>
            <li> I am 23 years old, 5&#x27;7 and 140lbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m amazed how well it&#x27;s worked so far.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to use at least once a day.</li>
            <li> The downside is it doesn&#x27;t absorb completely and leaves a sticky, skin smothering residue.</li>
            <li> This is complete rubbish and does not work.  </li>
            <li> I am 38 years old</li>
            <li> far I&#x27;ve been using it morning and night</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say I use it enough, but when I do, I feel like it de-puffs</li>
            <li> My skin became firmer, the layer of water  retention on my abs completely vanished and the cellulite was gone to.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re scent sensitive, you&#x27;ll want to skip it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take it away completely</li>
            <li> Skinny Cream is such an appropriate name for a product that actually tones and tightens cellulite-prone skin in such a short amount of time!</li>
            <li> Of course, the only real way to get rid of cellulite is diet, exercise and water.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t have time for as a busy working professional.</li>
            <li> Another cream promising miracle results with no scientific evidence to back up their claims.  </li>
            <li> Why won&#x27;t I ever learn that a sensible diet and exercise are the only real ways to make a difference in your body?</li>
            <li> The cream is also making my skin soft to the touch and does not leave any residue.</li>
            <li> I like this product and it has been working for me so far.</li>
            <li> The only issue I had was it irritated my skin if I put it too much on one area.</li>
            <li> My cellulite isnt completely gone</li>
            <li> , those are completely gone.</li>
            <li> The results I have gotten after a week have really surprised me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very curvy, carry extra fat in thighs and butt.</li>
            <li> So far I can see a difference in my stomach area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to lose weight around my stomach for so long that it&#x27;s funny.</li>
            <li> this cream also seems to give a natural gloss to the skin ....</li>
            <li> I used it for nearly a month and all my worries about weight loss are gone.</li>
            <li> But it might work well for someone who isn&#x27;t as sensitive to caffeine</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get rid of it completely</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great product that helps to improve skin tone, and as a bonus, the bottle is so big that I likely won&#x27;t have to buy another for at least 4 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> $30 isn&#x27;t much when you consider that it&#x27;s probably same cost as a meal these days.</li>
            <li> I am 57 years old</li>
            <li> Still early</li>
            <li> I needed a fast solution to my skin patches for my approaching wedding and so I chose this cream as I had heard about it</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that whatever you put on your skin gets absorbed by the bloodstream, so you should avoid the many commercial beauty products that contain some of over 12,000 chemical ingredients that are illegal in Europe, but legal in the US.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at my results after using skinny cream...</li>
            <li> I am in my early 30s..</li>
            <li> The skin is the most delicate hence needs the most delicate care.</li>
            <li> I can definitely see that the cream in making my skin more firm.</li>
            <li> My skin is more firm and defined in the back of my legs.</li>
            <li> This cream has the latest in weight loss supplements; such as green tea and raspberry ketones.  </li>
            <li> weird and good thing is, it don’t stay all day.</li>
            <li> I guess its okay otherwise and spreads thickly.</li>
            <li> only minor complaint is that the smell is not that pleasant.</li>
            <li> Granted you can never expect a miracle product that will totally eliminate your problem but relative to other products I&#x27;ve tried, I&#x27;ve seen better results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had cellulite on my thighs and butt for as long as I remember, and after skimming a few products this was the first with such great reviews, so I went out on a limb and ordered it; I was definitely not let down.</li>
            <li> Yes they are small and you go thru them very quickly, but for $30 a bottle, I think it&#x27;s a steal.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars due to the fact that you do have to use it constantly to keep up the fabulous results.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars due to the fact that you do have to use it constantly to keep up the fabulous results.</li>
            <li> Both reported the &amp;#34;skinny&amp;#34; feature to be as preposterous as it sounds, and that they thought the smell was odd, but not bad.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it very much but the little amount of time I have used it, it really works.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a medium aged mom of 2 who does cardio and strength training daily and eats 90% clean.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I first tried this cream, I can honestly say that I have not only seen an improvement in the texture of my skin but firmness too.</li>
            <li> The effect is a subtle smoothing and most people could probably use a bit of smoothing on their legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am sure that the effect will disappear the next time I take a shower (or maybe when I go swimming), but I can always reapply the lotion to get the same slight benefit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, decent product</li>
            <li> I had tried a number of such cellulite reduction creams before this but none of them could fetch me the desired result until I switched to this particular cream…</li>
            <li> and I thought it would be better but did nothing at all for me so go back to Nivea that at least smooth me a little.</li>
            <li> I just recently started using this product, so far I can see a little improvement on my inner thigh, as this is most problem area with cellulite.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this stuff, especially before a bikini vacation or summer adventure!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once a day on my upper thighs, yet I see a positive difference in the firmness and look of my thighs.</li>
            <li> It does make your skin really soft &amp; after a month of using it you barely see the results.</li>
            <li> I was surprised after only one week of use that I already am starting to see very visible and noticeable results.</li>
            <li> I really never expected this to work but was pleasantly surprised to find that I could see a difference in my skin in just a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 3 weeks only and my skin feels smooth, soft and of course, firm...</li>
            <li> It certainly did nothing for my small amount of cellulite which is what I bought for in the first</li>
            <li> But I eat healthy and drink a lot of water, and workout and have a lot of muscle, but have some aged lose skin that needs firmed up, and a little fat that needs smoothed out, so as I see what happens I will recommit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m learning (the hard way) to not look for easy fixes.</li>
            <li> I exercise and eat clean (and I don’t have cellulite issues), but I am 50 years old and had noticed that the skin on my thighs was starting to look a little “looser”.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much easier if your skin is completely dry, not just towel-dried.</li>
            <li> only a few weeks I could see a smoother appearance of the skin on my waist, hips and thighs and even feel a difference in how my jeans fit.  </li>
            <li> but so far have big hopes for it based on what I have observed so far.</li>
            <li> And as fast as possible, so I&#x27;m totally looking for a miracle.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only reason I could possibly imagine why a company would release a product for women to put on their bodies that will make them smell absolutely revolting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve rubbed this cream onto the back of my thighs for about 3 weeks now, and I began seeing very noticeable results last week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cream is a thick consistency but absorbs into the skin fairly easily.</li>
            <li> The smell is honestly ridiculously disgusting, I don&#x27;t know why so many people think it smells good, I&#x27;ve heard people say I smell like spoiled wine.</li>
            <li> I am slim, active and have a very fast metabolism</li>
            <li> Not only because it does what it says but it also makes my skin so unbelievably soft!</li>
            <li> I am so excited and can&#x27;t wait for no more cellulite.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I can see a major decrease in the appearance of cellulite.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I can see a major decrease in the appearance of cellulite.</li>
            <li> so there was some major stretching going on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First thing I always check with a new personal care product is the fragrance - with sensitive skin and seasonal allergy issues myself and with other members of my family, it&#x27;s a real concern.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have cellulite, but after going from 210 to 150 pounds, I have a lot of stubborn fat and loose skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a petite person and pretty active</li>
            <li> it is not runny at all, rather it&#x27;s a nice thick white cream that stays where you want it, yet is absorbed quickly into the skin without leaving behind any greasiness or other residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For some reason they look SO much more less noticeable than they ever have while laying down, so Im not quite sure if its helping them or making them worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really on a tight budget right now..</li>
            <li> Besides reading the reviews here, I also researched the general consensus on what works to lessen cellulite.</li>
            <li> I generally use another &amp;#34;firming cream&amp;#34; on Amazon.com - but will continue to buy if results continue to improve.</li>
            <li> I had noticeable results on my thighs, and as a bonus, the old baby stretch marks on my stomach have actually lightened up a bit (and those stretch marks have been there for a while).  </li>
            <li> This is my fourth bottle so far.</li>
            <li> I work in fitness industry so obviously I exercise frequently and eat well, even with all that some cellulite still makes its self known.  </li>
            <li> I have always been self conscious about the cellulite on the back of my thighs and buttocks.</li>
            <li> After using this cream, I have to say that so far I only lost 1 inch within a period of 2 months.</li>
            <li> but my skin has completely smoothed out and there is a definite decrease in cellulite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now seeing my skin looking smooth and firm on the back of my legs and upper thighs.</li>
            <li> between my legs was getting rough because i was gaining too much weight</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see the results only after a week&#x27;s use</li>
            <li> My stretch marks are barely noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> That would be nice but truly unrealistic.</li>
            <li> So when I bought this I was very skeptical as I don&#x27;t really trust a lot of hype about any kind of skinny cream.</li>
            <li> I still have some cellulite on my belly, but it is less when I consistently use the cream for 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> I though the whole idea was to not have to do all of those other things, otherwise, what do you need the product for???</li>
            <li> After a few days I could see a little better appearance in the cellulite on my legs.  </li>
            <li> but it did make mine extremely less noticeable, to the point that I actually felt a little better about the way I look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but like others are saying it&#x27;s hard to really gauge how much of it was the cream versus just diet and exercise.</li>
            <li> And now, there is not a single damn effect.</li>
            <li> It was more expensive than the products I had been using and didn&#x27;t work nearly as well.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s harder to tell on a 50 year old than a young person.</li>
            <li> The smell is not bad; it&#x27;s hard to spead though.</li>
            <li> scent of this cream is rather unpleasant to me, but fortunately it absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> Only used it for 5 day with some exercise and am seeing small  wanna complete my first bottle</li>
            <li> I notice, def no excuse with water weight in the morning.</li>
            <li> So I bought the cream for mainly trimming my waist and inner thigh and not really for cellulite purpose.</li>
            <li> I recently lost 35lbs and had some stretch marks and cellulite at the top of my legs, not good for summer vacation wear!  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars due to the odor and the high price.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars due to the odor and the high price.</li>
            <li> Previously I had really visible cellulite because of which I was ashamed of my size 2 body, but now I can wear mini-skirt.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product much, but when I did use it I seen slight results.</li>
            <li> My skin does feel much smoother and tight.</li>
            <li> I have cellulite and get very embrassed when the shirts are a little above the knee.</li>
            <li> The lotion is really thick and creamy and has a fresh scent to it.</li>
            <li> Skinny Cream has a thick consistency, similar perhaps to sunscreen, and it took several minutes to get the white cream completely rubbed into my leg (compared to my OTC lotion, which was readily absorbed into my other leg.)  </li>
            <li> I heard about Raspberry Ketones and Green Coffee Bean Extract on Dr. Oz and other shows, so I figured it&#x27;s worth a try -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 45 years old and not consistent with working out, so I need all the help I can get.</li>
            <li> First of all, I have found that it&#x27;s REALLY hard for me to remember to do things regularly.</li>
            <li> Everything does feel a little tighter, not too much though, My arms haven&#x27;t changed since my first review, but I still have 3 1/2 bottles left to go before I expect some serious results.</li>
            <li> My wife wanted to try this stuff, but she found it to have too much odor to be of any use to her, so it sits on the bathroom sink full and unused and disappointing.</li>
            <li> I see noticed some different ; but I was not able to really tell; but would recommend.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it takes a while to dry completely, otherwise it will cause you to feel sticky if you immediately put your clothes on after, but this is expected with all creams.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start with the obvious: cellulite is certainly less noticeable, that much is clear.</li>
            <li> I already used the whole bottle which a small thing...</li>
            <li> At least now I am ready to go the beach!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed that when comparing the ingredients to other anti-cellulite creams, it always has at least four more ingredients than the others especially the raspberry ketones and green coffee bean extract.</li>
            <li> We haven’t used it long enough to determine its efficacy.</li>
            <li> At first, it felt thick; but, since I&#x27;ve been using a lite oil, I think I was just not used to it.  </li>
            <li> A bit thick at first</li>
            <li> I think I am using it for over a month now everyday,I can say it works.i lost few pounds with out any exercise or changing eating habits.it absorbs quickly in the skin and little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I am no were near large, but i do have some cellulite on my behind.</li>
            <li> I have tried this product for several weeks and it definitely decreases my appetite - likely due to the caffeine content</li>
            <li> My spouse tried this product and was surprised to find her thighs appeared less dimpled.</li>
            <li> For perspective, I should say I couldn&#x27;t care less how young my arm looks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m less self conscious about my body now.</li>
            <li> and it went on white but dried clear.</li>
            <li> So far I Like it , but I have only had it for a few days.</li>
            <li> It took 3 weeks- a month to see major results, but I will not complain, especially since SC is cheaper than the less helpful alternatives.</li>
            <li> This would work on mild to moderate cellulite, I think, but I doubt it would do much for a bad case of cellulite.</li>
            <li> am 2months postpartum 2nd child and things got wrinkled on my belly due to stretching ...and also celulite showed up on my inner thighs and butt...</li>
            <li> I unfortunately have this huge wall mirror in my bathroom</li>
            <li> It did not take long to see results.</li>
            <li> Kinda to early to tell if it works, since it says that it takes a few weeks to start working.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t comment on its long term effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had really rough with tiny pimple like marks everywhere</li>
            <li> As a middle aged woman one of my concerns is the appearance of my legs and buttocks.</li>
            <li> small dimples have not completely disappeared (as expected - again, this is not a miracle cream), but my skin is so much smoother and firmer around that area.</li>
            <li> I in fact carry this cellulite reduction cream with me even when I am on business tours for long days…</li>
            <li> The one and only thing I don&#x27;t like about Skinny Cream is that it is not very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> Also I wouldn&#x27;t want to sweat in it as it is thick and doesn&#x27;t let the skin breathe much</li>
            <li> I just wish the bottle were a little big bigger, but despite it... it does go a looong way!!</li>
            <li> Like any other customer, I too was quite apprehensive about such weight reducing products</li>
            <li> This one on the other hand in the time that I have used it I have noticed a different on my thighs.</li>
            <li> However, if you stop using it as in the case of every other cream, then, everything might go back to the status quo.</li>
            <li> The instructions say to “massage vigorously” into your skin; I wondered if the vigorous massaging effect would help break up cellulite, so I used this cream on one leg and a regular body lotion on my other leg.  </li>
            <li> Imagine what will the results be in the long term!</li>
            <li> The scent is very light, not bad like some other Creams or lotions that have a horrible smell to them.</li>
            <li> We have not used this product very long, but what we have it seem to work.</li>
            <li> Also having a serious allergic reaction to some new face wash that made my skin peel off, it&#x27;s been the only thing that has helped heal it.</li>
            <li> I let them dry so that they sucked fully inside my skin.</li>
            <li> Dry brushing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always doubtful about these sorts of lotions because they&#x27;re often advertised as effective when used in conjunction with hydration and exercise (which essentially do all the fat burning and toning)</li>
            <li> I did notice that the skin on my belly seems a little less &amp;#34;dimply&amp;#34; and smoother, but haven&#x27;t noticed much of a change other than that.</li>
            <li> so I have limited body fat</li>
            <li> After about roughly five minutes, the Skinny Cream leg appeared to be *somewhat* smoother and tighter, but not significantly; the leg with the OTC lotion looked the same ol’ same ol’!  </li>
            <li> it all comes down to your diet, drinking water and exercise, unfortunately there is not an easy fix in 1</li>
            <li> after too much exercise with no good results, now my baby fat is gone in three weeks.</li>
            <li> They never have been in the past as they are REALLY old.</li>
            <li> This product is nothing more than a very expensive body cream...</li>
            <li> I had lost about 75 pounds a couple of years ago and have been battling loose, slack skin along with cellulite lumps and bumps no amount of exercise</li>
            <li> I lost alot of weight and in turn had that stubborn loose skin.</li>
            <li> I had loose skins and was a bit flabby.</li>
            <li> I noticed that my stomach is shrinking and tightening from the loose skin.</li>
            <li> I was worried about my growing age and the loose skins</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first after the first few days, but at about the two week mark, I could tell the product was working.  </li>
            <li> Waiting to experience long term results!!</li>
            <li> I have been using Skinny Cream for several months now, after using almost every other name brand CELLULITE cream on the market!</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way especially if your skin is moist.</li>
            <li> About a month has passed since using this product and I&#x27;ve noticed subtle changes from both the combination of using this and doing some moderate exercise about 4-5 times a week - nothing drastic, but I didn&#x27;t expect any major changes from using this or any other similar product.  </li>
            <li> The cream itself is a thick and creamy and smells a little funny</li>
            <li> The bottle is very small considering the price, only lasted for about ten days when you are using in different areas.  </li>
            <li> Overall, her thighs look less dimply and smoother.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t instant but in the time that I have used it I have noticed that there are less visible signs.</li>
            <li> the only thing i less like is the smell of it</li>
            <li> I would try to use it again if it would be bigger bottle for less price.</li>
            <li> I have used anywhere from really cheap to very expensive creams and some moderately work and</li>
            <li> First of all, this product is expensive for the 4 tiny ounces you get.</li>
            <li> A little is enough to apply it across...</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a little</li>
            <li> My husband finally asked me to stop using it, and my little daughter refused to snuggle with me.</li>
            <li> and I would definitely recommend it to all that have a little bit of a problem with cellulite.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product a little over a week, following the directions to use morning and evening</li>
            <li> I am currently working on toning my body and just needed to get rid of the little cottage or rather cellulite on my legs and glutes.  </li>
            <li> used the rest of this bottle at the end of last week, little to no change at all.</li>
            <li> I also wish the bottle was a little bit bigger.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have too much cellulite, but enough to make me feel uncomfortable in a swim suit.</li>
            <li> Not really</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now on the back of my legs, thighs and butt</li>
            <li> It also will \\&quot;suck in\\&quot; skin that is minimally puffy (i.e., under/around the belly button).  </li>
            <li> I spent hundreds on creams and pills to fix the cellulite that showed up, but nothing worked.</li>
            <li> I have only use it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I have minimal cellulite</li>
            <li> The bag also was everything I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a few weeks</li>
            <li> I used it daily with a massager and this cream didn&#x27;t reduce my cellulite or firm my stomach.</li>
            <li> I am only a few pounds overweight</li>
            <li> It is took me two week to use morning/evening and bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> A total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I am on a diet, exercise regularly, but have a few problem areas I&#x27;d like to see gone</li>
            <li> The product has begun showing its effects, and is tending to work as expected.</li>
            <li> It is not very appealling.</li>
            <li> It is money well spent.</li>
            <li> I noticed absolutely no difference and found the smell so offensive it gave me a headache.</li>
            <li> I have been using skinny cream for the last few weeks</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of use, I have noticed a difference in the reduction of dimples around my upper thighs.</li>
            <li> My skin is actually a lot firmer &amp; the cellulite has decreased about 30% so far.</li>
            <li> I am always a little leary of products that tell you to do a bunch of other things (that will give the same results) while using their product.</li>
            <li> Overall, it was a total failure on all levels in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I could not use this product, and had to wash it off immediately because of the terribly strong unpleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> I felt silly buying this stuff because it&#x27;s made for women, but I knew that Green Coffee Bean and Raspberry Ketones work well, so I thought this might be useful to get that last little bit around my waist</li>
            <li> The cream smells a little strange as well.  </li>
            <li> the size of the bottle is way too small and would be too expensive to continue using long term to actually see some real results.  </li>
            <li> Her cellulite was less noticeable after only trying this product for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Skeptical at first about this product.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve decided to try other products.</li>
            <li> As well as working out every other day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> perhaps this is the cause of my fourth problem, I&#x27;m not sure)</li>
            <li> The cellulite&#x27;s appearance will begin to dramatically reduce within only a few uses, but you can feel it working on your skin as soon as you apply it!</li>
            <li> May be due to massaging the cream in as well</li>
            <li> The change in my thighs appearance is due to</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I would pay 80 bucks for this, but definitely a steal when it is on sale.</li>
            <li> I am not willing to give up any of the benefits I am getting from this product.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve experimented with various cellulite products in the past.</li>
            <li> i am awaiting my other bottle....</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to use up my other two bottles.</li>
            <li> am not overweight but did gain weight due to a health condition and then the medication taken for the condition.</li>
            <li> And due to the increased cellulite I refuse to wear shorts in the summer.</li>
            <li> am not overweight but did gain weight due to a health condition and then the medication taken for the condition.</li>
            <li> And due to the increased cellulite I refuse to wear shorts in the summer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small bottle but last along time.</li>
            <li> I am a fan and recommend it to other women who are trying to get rid of cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I have recommended it to my other friends too</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical</li>
            <li> and when I got it, was disappointed by the amount of many toxic ingredients it contains.  </li>
            <li> I must say I was skeptical but was willing to try this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using on my legs and butt and so far I noticed my skin a little less bumpy for the past couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> My skin looks a little smoother in those bumpy areas and I have noticed the tightening developing only after a few days of use.</li>
            <li> It did not stain any of my clothes, even though I was quick to get dressed after applying, considering the cold weather this time of year!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only down side is the small bottle .</li>
            <li> i have been working out extra hard, squatting, lunges, leg press, walking up hill on the treadmill..</li>
            <li> I have with my routine dropped estimation those 7 last hard picky pounds and also with my routine use the Scala cellulite skin massager with this cream and cambogia</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s possible that it works, I just had a hard time remembering to use it all the time.</li>
            <li> After consistently using the cream for 3 weeks on my upper, outer thighs (saddle bag area), I noticed that the &#x27;cottage cheese&#x27; look wasn&#x27;t as bad.</li>
            <li> only complaint I have is the smell.</li>
            <li> so even though the bottle is kinda weird looking imo, it really works and</li>
            <li> I am always skeptical about these kinds of products, but I&#x27;m getting married in a few months and figured I have nothing to lose except this lumpy skin.</li>
            <li> Its not worth it to poison yourself to improve your appearance.</li>
            <li> I went down to a size 4 by october.  </li>
            <li> I mean the product does work, I can definitely see a difference in my legs while using this cream</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers!</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, you will still need to apply your usual lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I figured that if it only took a few days to notice a small change then what would it look like after a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> DEF not enough of a difference to spend another $30 on a very small bottle.</li>
            <li> Works better if you drink lots of water and keep yourself in shape, doesnt smell bad and the cream is thick</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make everything disappear but it helped to make them a lot less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I can notice less cellulite on my thighs.</li>
            <li> I use the product with a cellulite smoothing mitt and the results started in about a week, week and a half.</li>
            <li> I have been using it less than a week and already see results.  </li>
            <li> I do notice a slightly smoother appearance.</li>
            <li> You will see results within less than 2 weeks but it must be used 2x&#x27;s per day.</li>
            <li> Not even a slight reduction in colour, size, etc.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now, and I&#x27;m starting to see slow results.</li>
            <li> After less than a minute I ended up needing to go wash it all off my legs and even then they continued to itch and burn for 5-10 minutes afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, without diet, exercise and massages or drainages is no super effect visible.</li>
            <li> I thought I seen a slight difference in the fat dimples in my legs but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed a slight sagginess in my skin in the stomach area.</li>
            <li> However, the cellulite is still there (although slightless less noticeable).</li>
            <li> First I was disappointed when I saw the bottle,but it&#x27;s been a month I am using it daily</li>
            <li> my cellulite b show less</li>
            <li> Noticed results/ less cellulite in my butt &amp; thighs after just 2 weeks of using it.</li>
            <li> Lasted for less than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> ,my skin is a baby soft,I see much less cellulite dimples.</li>
            <li> Also do some detox and drink less sugar or no sugar.....</li>
            <li> One bottle lasts me for a month and a half</li>
            <li> Perhaps I just have a less refined sense of smell though than the rest of these</li>
            <li> I typically drink a lot of water all day</li>
            <li> It has a slight odor to it, but it&#x27;s nothing that is overly</li>
            <li> I was done with the bottle in less then three weeks.</li>
            <li> Now, there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m spending anymore money to see if I can see a slight change.</li>
            <li> I notice slight firming but no drastic changes.  </li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s not a good thing, since it prevented me from using it enough times to see if it made a difference.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed they are a little firmer and less crease.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now, maybe a little over, it has tightened my skin slightly</li>
            <li> I see my belly getting smoller and tight.</li>
            <li> plan on using it for a while to keep my skin tight and get rid of the excess</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m somewhere in my 40&#x27;s now) and it didn&#x27;t seem to matter how much or little I weighed, the dimples just wouldn&#x27;t go away.  </li>
            <li> I am usually a little hesitant when it comes to cellulite creams.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed a little difference in the appearance of cellulite on my skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cream to help with those little areas that no amount of exercise will take away.</li>
            <li> Maybe it made her skin a little softer, but that was about it.</li>
            <li> All you need is a little bit on your hand and to rub it all over.</li>
            <li> The product goes on a little sticky, but the effects do seem to mimimize the appearance of cellulite.  </li>
            <li> After my excess weight gain from pregnancy to extreme weight loss I am always looking for something to ensure my cellulite is no more.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I should give it a little longer, but after two weeks, I see no results.  </li>
            <li> but you also have to atleast do a little threadmill, running, skipping, jogging or abs.</li>
            <li> I feel the description is a little misleading</li>
            <li> This stuff stinks to high Heaven!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re not going to make this cream do ALL the heavy lifting, are you?</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> Contains raspberry ketones, and green coffee bean extract.</li>
            <li> a waste of money</li>
            <li> my skin feels firm and smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t harsh on my skin.  </li>
            <li> So wait a few minutes after showering.</li>
            <li> You do have to use it everyday twice a day in order to get the desired results.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your time</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t waste my money.</li>
            <li> I started noticing it going away after just a few weeks of using this.</li>
            <li> This cream just gives you the feeling that you are doing something extra - that you are using a &amp;#34;miracle.&amp;#34; The use of this product is completely unnecessary to see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t use it ongoing in any case for longer than a few months.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels tone and firm.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> Although its pricey while using this with a slimming belt did wonders took inches off and the cream itself isn&#x27;t harsh on the skin</li>
            <li> Some of the ingredients like green coffee bean extract and glycerin tend to temporarily reduce water retention and tighten up the skin and reduce the appearance of cellulite.  </li>
            <li> Its a wasted of money</li>
            <li> But after using it for a few months, the results show well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used this cream everyday even used it along with  a dermaroller and didnt see any difference in cellulite, or firming</li>
            <li> It contains raspberry ketones and green coffee bean extract.</li>
            <li> after a month of everyday use my cellulite wasn&#x27;t gone but it had improved the look of the cellulite and lessened it</li>
            <li> and I have forgotten it a few times after a bath.</li>
            <li> and I have been using it for about a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> and I had trouble using it.  </li>
            <li> but I always heard about green coffee beans extract and raspberry ketones for weight loss.</li>
            <li> I had been using Nivea firming cellulite serum Q10 plus for a few months</li>
            <li> Will update my review in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> but it has help to  firm areas that need help.</li>
            <li> Do not buy it, it is a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> I do have a few depressions, but I think with prolonged use that will go away also.</li>
            <li> This cream actually has tightened and decreased my cellulite immensly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> but since I have bought this product it has been going away little by little!</li>
            <li> There is no strong odor or scent that some have</li>
            <li> Week 2 was a little shady</li>
            <li> It gives you tight toned skin and reduces the complection of cellulite!  </li>
            <li> Im extremely disappointed by this product used it twice a day since it arrived last month and seen no difference can&#x27;t believe I wasted 20 on this :O</li>
            <li> but, after using it for a few days I started to notice a small change.  </li>
            <li> Small decrease in the cellulite, and noticeably smoother after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> But I am going to continue using it with small amount everyday.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> only other complaint is that it is fairly expensive.</li>
            <li> two features mean that I will be unlikely to seek it out on store shelves unless I am planning to go on vacation and know that my legs are going to be on display frequently.</li>
            <li> See very little results, but will continue to use.</li>
            <li> The product is fairly hard to spread and requires quite a few substantial globs to provide coverage to the thigh</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the whole bottle and don&#x27;t see any results plus it smells bad.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I can see a small difference - and would continue using it until I achieve my goal.</li>
            <li> I use it daily without fail and</li>
            <li> I am not sure I even have the words to describe it.</li>
            <li> You see results in just a few days!  </li>
            <li> This expensive lotion is no better than just regular non-cellulite cheapo lotion.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical to how a simple cream would help in this situation</li>
            <li> Just a small change in my cellulite made a believer out of me I would recommend this Skinny Cream.</li>
            <li> I am a surfer, and I am at the beach all year round, my LEGS are always showing!.....</li>
            <li> I usually apply the cream and massage my legs vigorously.</li>
            <li> I have always been highly skeptical of some of the claims put forth by companies that tout similar products.</li>
            <li> I started to see results in just a few days!</li>
            <li> Well I am starting to see a difference in the cellulite i unfortunately have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always struggled with cellulite after my diabetes, a friend of mine recommended this product to me after several others failed on me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately as soon as you stop using it you can expect your skin to go back to how it was.</li>
            <li> and I see small differances.</li>
            <li> While I feel a lot tighter around my stomach area after using this cream, I am not completely sure if its because of this product because I have been working out a lot since using this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why I got this to Vine-review, but I gave it to my wife and daughter to try.  </li>
            <li> , to me was money wasted!</li>
            <li> after a few weeks of use i can see visible reduction of of the cellulite dimple look on my legs!</li>
            <li> Noticed results in a few days!</li>
            <li> Noticed difference in few days!</li>
            <li> I tried it Friday night into Monday Morning and all I can say that I&#x27;m a Firm Believer!</li>
            <li> I got it for the small area on the thighs.</li>
            <li> It seems unfair to write a review when I didn&#x27;t use the product &#x27;properly&#x27;, but here&#x27;s my thoughts and experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure of the results yet.  </li>
            <li> My body has become toned and there is no more any flabbiness.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of days now and can see a small difference.</li>
            <li> Your missing out!</li>
            <li> In fact, it will take a few applications over at least a week before you will see results.</li>
            <li> read that applying this cream can get rid of up to 90% of cellulite after 8 weeks, but I&#x27;ve been rubbing the cream in with just my hand for the past 3 weeks and am already seeing results.</li>
            <li> But beware, the bottle size is small for the price.</li>
            <li> I, however, am not exactly sure what the change is supposed to be.</li>
            <li> The bottle was too small..</li>
            <li> I am fairly small gal 110 that works out like a maniac.  </li>
            <li> Shes been using it for the past 3 months</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, i was a little disappointed  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this item for anyone actively seeking something to help in addressing them tough skin areas.</li>
            <li> for the price tag of this product and what it claims I saw no visible results on cellulite, maybe you have to use it for a long time before seeing anything but is too expensive to be ordering every month and just wait to see something.</li>
            <li> If I had one complaint its that the bottle is too small.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also hard to rub in....</li>
            <li> my hard work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes it hard to exercise.</li>
            <li> I said, I had a hard time remembering to use it.  </li>
            <li> The bottle itself is hard, so it doesn&#x27;t begin flattening or rolling up the way toothpaste tubes</li>
            <li> The only reason I give it 4 stars is because it smells like crazy glue</li>
            <li> Nothing can replace diet and exercise, but some products at least provide assistance in the matter.</li>
            <li> I also rated it low because it stinks.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been hitting the gym much lately because I&#x27;ve been slammed at work.</li>
            <li> , I recommend the product by using it twice a day at least for two months.</li>
            <li> So at least I know that it does work</li>
            <li> I would defiantly recommend at least trying this product....</li>
            <li> so I did, for at least two weeks, apply it twice a day.  </li>
            <li> I have thick thighs with muscle, but you can&#x27;t see the muscles I have</li>
            <li> The cream goes on like a thick lotion</li>
            <li> It is really thick</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a slow process.</li>
            <li> My experience with this cream, sadly, was not a positive one.  </li>
            <li> not very happy with this.</li>
            <li> I have been using some other brand which is quite expensive and not amazingly effective.</li>
            <li> Maybe I was a sucker for thinking that a little bottle of cream was going to actually get rid of cellulite :(</li>
            <li> Within a few moments of applying I must wash my hands because they feel very tight and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> but you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> No, it&#x27;s not as expensive as some of the other creams out there</li>
            <li> No more saddlebags!</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re not sure about the product, just try it!</li>
            <li> This product is unbelievable!</li>
            <li> but it is expensive for the average person -- at least I think so.</li>
            <li> This is a rather unpleasantly scented lotion that promises to reduce the appearance of cellulite if used regularly.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is very small and product is over priced.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m (still) very skeptical of any lotion to do such a thing by having caffiene or raspberry ketones in it.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, another one has let me down.  </li>
            <li> seriously it seems as though i used an iron and smoothen out the handles......</li>
            <li> It smells quite weird, but after a month using it my thighs seem to have less cellulite.</li>
            <li> The fact that is little weird is, cream says it takes some weeks to show results, but i say it worked for me in 5 days.</li>
            <li> a little be expensive .</li>
            <li> Not only does it not work at all, it also smells bad.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s actually not that bad.</li>
            <li> If you have ever had skin peeling, you will agree that it&#x27;s not a good feeling.</li>
            <li> Waste of $30, I am so sad.</li>
            <li> Hvnt had it long enough to judge weather it works but THE SMELL IS HORRIBLE.</li>
            <li> Cellulite is just hard as hell to get rid of!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried practically every cellulite cream on the market only to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m skeptical of a cream that claims to reduce cellulite, and I&#x27;m still not sure if this one does.  </li>
            <li> First of all, the bottle insinuates it has a raspberry scent but in truth it smells terrible.  </li>
            <li> Very thick but feels its working</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!  </li>
            <li> You will see results after about approximately two weeks if you use AS DIRECTED.</li>
            <li> Water retention in those areas decreased, fat seems to be reduced, and I had smoother, firmer skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product helped&lt;br /&gt;firm and also decreased some of my cellulite.  </li>
            <li> I can say that it was actually unappealing.</li>
            <li> It really smells awful!</li>
            <li> Of cause, no one cream won&#x27;t help you, if you eat unhealthy food and don&#x27;t exercise.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit I was sometimes too tired to do it at night.</li>
            <li> Like the area behind the thighs, for example.</li>
            <li> Regarding the smell that other reviewers commented on, I did see how some people didn&#x27;t like it, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s bad at all.</li>
            <li> the tube was empty :( ....</li>
            <li> However, this cream still helped with the appearance of my skin and made bad areas less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Noticed a dramatic difference within a week.</li>
            <li> I have been an athlete my whole life and always thought it was unfair that I had the awful dimples.</li>
            <li> As usual with these things I was skeptical of its validity but ot worked wonders!</li>
            <li> major problem with this cream, if it had worked at all that is, is that it smells awful.</li>
            <li> , I looked up every ingredient (at least the ones listed on the product and provided by the maker) at EWG.ORG!!</li>
            <li> This product has a weird smell</li>
            <li> SO SAD..</li>
            <li> (grammar wrong, there my apologies).</li>
            <li> No funky weird smell either.</li>
            <li> The price is too expensive for the amount that your are getting.</li>
            <li> I feel uncomfortable smearing this on and then getting dressed and going to work.</li>
            <li> Not only does it not work, but it smell awful.</li>
            <li> It is expensive for the amount of product you receive.</li>
            <li> (Sorry)</li>
            <li> last month i made a picture and see how my legs and arms are so horrible for my age&lt;</li>
            <li> But I was quite wrong thinking</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I purchased this</li>
            <li> Ever since finding Skinny Cream, I no longer have to pay for expensive spa treatments to diminish cellulite.  </li>
            <li> product also has a weird smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am always skeptical of trying cellulite creams, because I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them on the market.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say I have excess skin along with some cellulite on hips and thighs.  </li>
            <li> Cellulite is hard to beat without surgery. :(.</li>
            <li> I never really found the smell of the product to be that terrible.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine got some because she was really unhappy about her cellulite.</li>
            <li> /&gt;a must have buy for suffers of the orange peel</li>
            <li> Did not like it because for one thing it stinks</li>
            <li> Gave me a horrible rash all over my legs after using it for a few days.</li>
            <li> she&#x27;s no longer afraid to wear a bathing suit.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife as she works out like crazy and can&#x27;t seem to eliminate her cellulite.</li>
            <li> The people who says it has worked are desperately clinging the the hope that it doesn&#x27;t and fat reduction is all in their minds.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife because she has been unhappy with her weight gain after pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I was rather skeptical when trying Skinny Cream, but I figured what the heck – it couldn’t hurt!  </li>
            <li> As an added bonus it doesn&#x27;t leave her skin greasy or leave any bad lingering odors.</li>
            <li> I have not had any bad reactions to this cream.</li>
            <li> It is a really bad, rancid smell.  </li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t think of anything bad to say about it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells bad and did nothing.</li>
            <li> I had a bad case of skin peeling</li>
            <li> my stretch marks aren&#x27;t as bad.</li>
            <li> too bad</li>
            <li> That ugly cellulite is disappearing.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been known to get sick from drinking decaffeinated coffee because of the trace amounts of caffeine that still remain.  </li>
            <li> Try it once and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m disappointed I&#x27;m not seeing any fading or tightening on my belly from the cream.</li>
            <li> Wish it had worked :(</li>
            <li> no visible improvement or difference on the appearance of my skin :(</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> Does not work!!!!!!  :(</li>
            <li> you will not be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Holy crap.</li>
            <li> I hate that I couldn&#x27;t tolerate the smell.  </li>
            <li> Completely worthless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always hated Orange peel skin, now that I have it, I&#x27;m looking for ways to remove it as I do not like it AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I hated my cellulite and wanted to find a product that could help get of rid of it.</li>
            <li> you keep at it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> because all the terrible cellulite is covering them.  </li>
            <li> The smell is awful.</li>
            <li> Horrible did nothing for my body.</li>
            <li> (the con): I really hate the way this smells!</li>
            <li> It has this awful chemical smell.  </li>
            <li> I am terribly intolerant to caffeine.  </li>
            <li> Gag-inducingly awful.</li>
            <li> Completely disgusting.</li>
            <li> Along with stretch marks, I had gotten cellulite and it looked disgusting.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using this cream for about 6 weeks now and I am already noticing a big difference in my skin - I feels firm and much smoother. I am happy :)</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, i would totally recommend this to anyone that is trying to reduce the appearance of cellulite and it works great for such a good price.</li>
            <li> With a good habbit of eating right and applying this, it has made my skin smooth and I feel a whole lot better about myself.</li>
            <li> The skin is the most delicate hence needs the most delicate care. I recommend Skinny Cream for all the skin needs</li>
            <li> It really worked for me! Previously I had really visible cellulite because of which I was ashamed of my size 2 body, but now I can wear mini-skirt. I used it every day after shower with heavy massage and sometimes saunas, the effect was great after usage and little reduced after a day, but you shouldn&#x27;t expect a great difference in a week- for me it was a sudden change after a month.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy it one more time to complete the course.</li>
            <li> Really works! so happy i found this cream woukd recommend it to every woman with a celluldite problem.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, lasted a long time. I did see improvements in my skin with the use of this product. It didn&#x27;t make everything disappear but it helped to make them a lot less noticeable. *sample provided for review*</li>
            <li> I was dubious at first when we purchased it but within weeks I noticed a drastic change in my gf&#x27;s legs as well as her confidence. As an added bonus it doesn&#x27;t leave her skin greasy or leave any bad lingering odors. Overall, her thighs look less dimply and smoother. This product delivers as promised. Now she wants to go to the beach to show off her body. Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> I waited until my second bottle to write a review. Surprisingly, and a pleasant surprise it is, this stuff actually works pretty well.  I have battled cellulite since I was 19 (I&#x27;m somewhere in my 40&#x27;s now) and it didn&#x27;t seem to matter how much or little I weighed, the dimples just wouldn&#x27;t go away.  I do exercise several times a week and TRY to eat right (still, I&#x27;m a good 10 pounds overweight!) but cellulite can be stubborn.  A bottle lasts me about 30 days - I apply twice a day and only to thighs and buttocks. I have to admit that there is a difference in my dimples.  They are still there, but they have diminished significantly.  If you are struggling with stubborn dimples, give it a try.  Don&#x27;t expect overnight changes - I needed the full 30 days before I saw any real change, but well into the second bottle I&#x27;m still seeing results.</li>
            <li> Works great with a cellulite massage brush that I have been using.  It goes on white so I know when it is all rubbed in.  It has a lot of scientific ingredients that people take different supplements for to help get rid of cellulite.  This is a great topical solution.  It is a great way to pamper ourselves to.  I have thick thighs with muscle, but you can&#x27;t see the muscles I have because all the terrible cellulite is covering them.  This skinny cream helps to minimize the problem.  But remember it is not liposuction so don&#x27;t expect to look like a 20 year old once you are done.  That would be nice but truly unrealistic. I am happy with the product because it does what it claims to do. Plus, I need all the help I can get!  *received for testing and review.</li>
            <li> After a couple weeks of use I noticed visibly firmer skin! I would recommend this to anyone who would like to add substance to their weight loss regimen.</li>
            <li> Simply amazed at this product, went from cellulite to no cellulite in a matter of weeks</li>
            <li> I have really noticed a difference in my skin. This product works miracles, So I highly recommended to everyone! Its the best cellulite cream that you see a fast results.</li>
            <li> Will never buy another cellulite cream besides this one. LOVE LOVE LOVE.</li>
            <li> The cellulite doesn&#x27;t have a chance! Great stuff! I recommend this highly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week and got allergic. This product has a weird smell and I doubt abt the chemical stuff inside.</li>
            <li> Thank you for a great product!!</li>
            <li> This product does work, the scent is pleasant... I did notice a difference in the appearance of mi skin even though I did not follow the instructions entirely, it says that you should apply it twice a day, I only did it once after I showered, the first couple of weeks I did nothing different and still noticed some change, but then I started working out 3 times a week only 20 minute sessions and that&#x27;s when I noticed an ever better improvement to my skin&#x27;s appearance, feel and touch. You should definitely try it! I just wish the bottle were a little big bigger, but despite it... it does go a looong way!!</li>
            <li> Product doesn&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Enjoyed this tremendously. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Hvnt had it long enough to judge weather it works but THE SMELL IS HORRIBLE. It seems to moisturize well tho.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M ON A DIET AND I USED THIS CREAM FOR LAST ONE MONTH... BUT NOTHING WAS CHANGED...STILL HAVE CELLULITE....WHICH IS PROMINENT...SO SAD..</li>
            <li> Besides reading the reviews here, I also researched the general consensus on what works to lessen cellulite. The primary ingredients in this cream--raspberry ketones and green coffee extract--are getting green lights from a number of sources. 30 bucks? Holy crap. But okay, if it works, it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth it. To offer 100% truth in advertising:  I don&#x27;t look exactly like the gal in the blue bikini (yet!)that they have pictured with the bottle, but the cream has a noticeable smoothing effect. I have used it fairly consistently--maybe 4-5X/week. Probably my results would be even better if I used it every day. It also has a pleasant scent and nice texture. (Not at all greasy.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have pointed out, exercise, drinking lots of water, and eating somewhat healthfully are big assists as well. You&#x27;re not going to make this cream do ALL the heavy lifting, are you? Cellulite is the kind of enemy against which you need to stockpile your aresenal, and the Skinny Cream is a great weapon in winning the war.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it very much but the little amount of time I have used it, it really works.&lt;br /&gt;The dimples are almost gone.  No kidding.</li>
            <li> Eat healthy for maximum effect&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a fitness freak and I have found the results overwhelming. But one should follow a healthy diet and a proper work out along it for the maximum result.</li>
            <li> didnt see improvement</li>
            <li> Is an excellent product. Fits my skin and soft I can feel that the skin is healing!</li>
            <li> After having my son 5 years ago my lower stomach skin was never the same. I&#x27;ve started using the product on my lower stomach before I worked out in the morning and before I go bed. I have see the difference I&#x27;m my skin and my skin has become tighter in that area. The cream goes on like a thick lotion and you really need to rub it into your skin. So far great product.</li>
            <li> I received a bottle of this for reviewing purposes and I loved it. It worked really well. I can notice less cellulite on my thighs. My skin looks a lot firmer. This is the first product out of all the products I&#x27;ve tried before that actually works for me! I recommend this to anyone looking for a cream like this. Also the cream isn&#x27;t greasy and blends nicely into skin.</li>
            <li> Like any other customer, I too was quite apprehensive about such weight reducing products but then I found out that it was clinically approved and targets in decrease in fat deposits and water retention without any side effects!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this now for several weeks and definately notice a difference in not only a reduction of cellulite but also my skin feels firmer.  I was considering the cool sculting procedure for my abdomin which basically freezes your fat and costs about $700 per area which would likely take two areas for a total of $1,400 but the results are only estimated to reduce fat by about 20% of loss over several months.  For the tradeoff in costs and no pain...I&#x27;m seeing great results.</li>
            <li> I was supplied this item to test and give my opinion. I have enjoyed how this cream is helping to tighten the skin as I continue with my weekly workouts. I think as with any product you have to use as directed and actually do something to help it work to its maximum ability. I would recommend this item for anyone actively seeking something to help in addressing them tough skin areas. It will not make you a perfect body but it will help you in your firming up process.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream. I&#x27;ve used it about a month, and though my cellulite is not totally gone, it has visibly diminished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I recently got SmartLipo on my chin and abs, and this cream has worked so well to tighten up the skin in those areas. I can feel it tightening right after I rub it in! Great purchase.</li>
            <li> First I want to say that I am scent sensitive. Most scents really cause havoc with me but I found this scent of this cream didn&#x27;t bother me at all. I actually found it to be pleasant. It lasts and while slightly strong at first it becomes less strong once my skin absorbed it. Now on to the actual product. I am usually a little hesitant when it comes to cellulite creams. They claim to work and fall short. This one on the other hand in the time that I have used it I have noticed a different on my thighs. This is the only place I have an issue with cellulite and this cream has been working for me. It isn&#x27;t instant but in the time that I have used it I have noticed that there are less visible signs. Another plus of this cream is it is actually moisturizing. It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel but leaves my skin smooth and soft. Overall I really like the way this is working and I will be purchasing this again when this tube runs out.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Not only because it does what it says but it also makes my skin so unbelievably soft! I get so many compliments on how soft my skin is.....</li>
            <li> My friend says it is very good</li>
            <li> Not an instant miracle but it&#x27;s the best cellulite cream I have purchased. I have used a total of 4 tubes and I stated to see results right with the first one. Skin looks tighter and cellulite got reduced.</li>
            <li> five star&lt;br /&gt;awesome cream</li>
            <li> for the price tag of this product and what it claims I saw no visible results on cellulite, maybe you have to use it for a long time before seeing anything but is too expensive to be ordering every month and just wait to see something. I&#x27;ll just stick to working out</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a few weeks now and I have noticed a little difference in the appearance of cellulite on my skin. I use this Skinny Cream with my waist trimming belt and I can just feel the fat melting away... Not really but you know what I mean. I have noticed the biggest difference from my stomach area but I think that is because I use it with my waist trimming belt. I am still waiting for a change in my arms and legs. It takes time though. I apply my skinny cream twice a day after I shower. As far as the cream itself goes, it took a couple of days to get used to the way this cream smells but it smells much better than other cellulite creams that I have used. It is very easy to spread on and it absorbs quickly into my skin. I have not had any bad reactions to this cream. Because it is working on my stomach, I do recommend this cream. Don&#x27;t expect quick overnight results. This takes time and should be used along with a healthy diet and exercise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this Skinny Cream complimentary in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> This is amazing stuff! I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks now and I can already notice a difference. I didn&#x27;t have too much cellulite, but enough to make me feel uncomfortable in a swim suit. I&#x27;ve been using it on the back of my legs and have had amazing results. Plus, I LOVE the smell! I look forward to using it morning and night simply for the smell. I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I am using it 2 times a day. Just after taking shower I had my routine exercises and then I apply them. I let them dry so that they sucked fully inside my skin. I don’t find smell to be weird and good thing is, it don’t stay all day. The fact that is little weird is, cream says it takes some weeks to show results, but i say it worked for me in 5 days.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of cellulite and so this was very helpful to decrease what I had. I like the natural ingredients, too.</li>
            <li> Regarding the smell that other reviewers commented on, I did see how some people didn&#x27;t like it, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s bad at all. After consistently using the cream for 3 weeks on my upper, outer thighs (saddle bag area), I noticed that the &#x27;cottage cheese&#x27; look wasn&#x27;t as bad. The skin is firmer and the dimpling of the skin isn&#x27;t as deep as before. I will continue to use this product :)</li>
            <li> Cellulite, I thought it was here to stay but its starting to go away! - rrc</li>
            <li> Received a discount to test this item it is excellent</li>
            <li> See very little results, but will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m still losing weight, but the cream worked faster than I did. I still have cellulite but the definition of that patch is gone. Before I started the medication that started a huge influx on my weight (10 pounds every do month!), I was pretty fit but still had a patch of stubborn cellulite and one dimple I could never get rid of without a healthy diet and exercise. for this reason,  I decided to try out some cellulite cream, thinking it may not do anything but if it did, maybe the cellulite would be gone by the time my excess weight was. I don&#x27;t doubt that it will keep helping. Also, it&#x27;s non greasy, absorbs well, and smell great</li>
            <li> I just saw this product here. A friend of mine got some because she was really unhappy about her cellulite. I have to say that I did see a noticeable difference. Looked pretty good. ;)  Must have been the raspberries.</li>
            <li> this product is amazing for cellulite&lt;br /&gt;a must have buy for suffers of the orange peel</li>
            <li> This product was suggested to me by my bestfriend when I asked her on what she uses for her cellulites. I had my share of cellulites after I lose weight during my GM diet. I noticed how uncharming it is in. Especially because I had it at the back of my thighs. This product helped me with removing cellulites and gain the confidence I need to wear short skirts again.</li>
            <li> My spouse tried this product and was surprised to find her thighs appeared less dimpled. We recommend this product solve the problem of dimples. Great product &amp; Great value!</li>
            <li> I could not use this product, and had to wash it off immediately because of the terribly strong unpleasant fragrance. I don&#x27;t know if it works, because I could not tolerate the odor.</li>
            <li> I have been using skinny cream for about 3-weeks.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a significant difference but I&#x27;d like to give it more time because I was only using it once a day not twice a day which is indicated on the bottle.  After I do use the cream twice a day I will update my feedback then.</li>
            <li> Love it! My skin is smoother and some stretch marks gone!! Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Just started using this cream.  Love, love, love the way it glides on and feels so silky.  At first, it felt thick; but, since I&#x27;ve been using a lite oil, I think I was just not used to it.  Like the smell, the feel, and am already seeing results.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Skeptical at first about this product. I recently lost a good amount of weight and had some excess tummy cellulite. I was not expecting much but this product blew my mind away. It did not take long to see results. Does exactly what the description says. I highly recommend this to anybody looking to get rid of cellulite.</li>
            <li> Lets face it nothing beats a good balance diet and exercise.  But guess what even with diet and exercise the unslightly unattractive appearance of cellulite will still be there.  Skinny Cream helps to reduce to appearance of cellulite along with exercise and diet.  This product isn&#x27;t a cure all, it isn&#x27;t a miracle worker it won&#x27;t do all the work for us.  But it does do what its meant to do and that is reduce the appearance of cellulite with a clinically proven formula that does work when we take the extra added steps ourselves.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product hoping to get some results.It made my skin soft but didn&#x27;t reduce the appearance of my cellulite. I used this cream for about four weeks every morning and night. I&#x27;m not sure if I need to give it more time to see results but I&#x27;ve decided to try other products.</li>
            <li> This cream really worked well for me.  I bought it more for skin toning (than cellulite reduction), and the results were positive for me.  I exercise and eat clean (and I don’t have cellulite issues), but I am 50 years old and had noticed that the skin on my thighs was starting to look a little “looser”.  I had noticeable results on my thighs, and as a bonus, the old baby stretch marks on my stomach have actually lightened up a bit (and those stretch marks have been there for a while).  Great product.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Good product will buy again</li>
            <li> I tried a lot of cellulite and firming creams, this one is by far one of my favorites!!! It really has worked for me tightening my thigs and abdomen,  I was just wondering if anyone has called that number on the packaging it comes with that says you recieve a free bottle when you call that number.  I call that number and no one ever answers or calls back! What a scam....</li>
            <li> I have cellulite on the back of my thighs, this cream tightened the area but took around two months to notice a visual difference.</li>
            <li> too stinky, had to wash off on first use</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a while now. I think I have gone through 3 bottles. I really like this stuff. I know cellulite cannot be cured by a cream, because if it could believe me I would know about it!!! I am a very active, healthy and fit person who still suffers from cellulite, but this Skinny Cream sure helps the appearance. It does not cure it, but it definitely helps. I would recommend you to give this product a try.</li>
            <li> I am super picky when it comes to products. I am a hairstylist that comes across a good amount of products to try. I am super impressed with the time this started to work! I love this and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. The smell is great and I noticed an improvement in the cellulite on my thighs and buttocks.  Would by again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now on the back of my legs, thighs and butt and it&#x27;s great!. You will see results after about approximately two weeks if you use AS DIRECTED. Also, I&#x27;ve noticed faster results after exercising regularly. I&#x27;ve also noticed that when comparing the ingredients to other anti-cellulite creams, it always has at least four more ingredients than the others especially the raspberry ketones and green coffee bean extract. I highly recommend this product - IT WORKS - just remember to use as directed...and the best part is, it doesn&#x27;t stink :-)</li>
            <li> I have been using Skinny Cream for about 3 weeks.  I cannot believe the results I have seen already.  Over the past year I have been using Strivectin\\&quot;s body firming cream and thought I was happy with those results.  Skinny Cream gave a noticeable difference after the first 5-7 days.  I had lost about 75 pounds a couple of years ago and have been battling loose, slack skin along with cellulite lumps and bumps no amount of exercise seems to help.  My skin is much firmer and has a smooth texture.  Thanks Skinny Cream!</li>
            <li> I am 23 years old, 5&#x27;7 and 140lbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought 2 of these bottles on groupon, they are selling for $19.99 for a 6 oz bottle! i read the reviews and figured it would work well! so its been 2 weeks and I&#x27;ve been applying it on my outer thighs and back thighs, morning &amp; nightly. i have been working out extra hard, squatting, lunges, leg press, walking up hill on the treadmill.. etc.. i have-not seen any change on my thighs with cellulite reduction.</li>
            <li> I have used this whole bottle exactly as directed twice a day and it did absolutely nothing. Waste of money</li>
            <li> Amazon is an amazing place. You can&#x27;t find different types of useful products at one place elsewhere. Another great product. I used it for 7 weeks and now I&#x27;ve a perfect body.</li>
            <li> After completing a 90day squat challenge, my but looked great apart from the cellulite. Skinny cream took care of that and I am now summer ready!</li>
            <li> It actually works! It is a pleasing surprise considering 75% of the products I try don&#x27;t work. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because it smells like crazy glue</li>
            <li> Only used it for 5 day with some exercise and am seeing small  wanna complete my first bottle then I can conclude.. but I hope to see difference  .</li>
            <li> It really decreases the appearance of cellulite after 6 weeks,if you want to get better result,you need to keep eating healthy and doing exercise as well.I actually go to gym 4 times a week but that didn&#x27;t work by itself,I&#x27;ve found out if I combine all(eating healthy,exercise and the cream)It really helps a lot to reduce the cellulite.It wasn&#x27;t enough for 30 days though, bought the 2nd bottle after 2 week.</li>
            <li> its been 1 month and no change</li>
            <li> When my husband purchased this for me I was less than thrilled. However after trying it for two weeks I am impressed. Knowing that I was looking for something to help reduce the Cellulite that did not appear to be responding to simple exercise, he found a winner.&lt;br /&gt;This product is not only clinically proven as a cellulite reducer but also a skin firming cream as well. In combination with exercise, and eating healthy, this is a great addition for those areas that need an extra lift. However if you are looking for a magical, bipity bopity boo solution then keep waiting. You still have to do the work.&lt;br /&gt;I applied it twice a day, in the morning and evening. The skin feels smooth, with no sticky residue. The orange peel skin will disappear quickly, some areas were overnight, the rest took the full 2 weeks. Water retention in those areas decreased, fat seems to be reduced, and I had smoother, firmer skin.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to see how much better I will look when I have finished the bottle!</li>
            <li> Skinny cream use twice daily to reduce water retention and cellulite. Contains raspberry ketones, and green coffee bean extract. Rub vigorously into targeted area twice a day. I used this cream on my thighs, stomach, and arms. After a week of use I noticed my skin was smoother and felt great. It helped moisturize as well as tighten my skin. I love that this cream is not tested on animals!! Is hypoallergenic, non paraben, and non comedogenic.</li>
            <li> definitely noticed an improvement...will continue to use product</li>
            <li> This produce smells great and goes on smoothly.  It definitely firms and tightens saggy skin.  It also will \\&quot;suck in\\&quot; skin that is minimally puffy (i.e., under/around the belly button).  But I don&#x27;t know if it does it better than a $10 cream.  I am ½ through my bottle and still use it because the results were good enough for me.  But I don&#x27;t know if it worth the $29 price tag and I probably won&#x27;t pay that much again.  I still have some cellulite on my belly, but it is less when I consistently use the cream for 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many creams and this stuff works!  Not only to help reduce the appearance of cellulite but it also tones the skin.  I&#x27;ve been using a big foam roller to roll the area after I apply the cream.  I&#x27;ve only used it for 18 days and I&#x27;m amazed how well it&#x27;s worked so far.  I will be buying more.  Thank you for such a great product!!!</li>
            <li> I can see a small difference - and would continue using it until I achieve my goal.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and the product works great. I would recommend a massage brush and plenty of exercise. Make sure to use at least once a day.</li>
            <li> This cream has all of the standard anti-cellulite ingredients (the main one being caffeine), and it gets high marks for not being highly perfumed. The downside is it doesn&#x27;t absorb completely and leaves a sticky, skin smothering residue. I&#x27;m going back to Fat Girl Slim.</li>
            <li> This product didn’t work for me</li>
            <li> This has a light cooling sensation after a couple minutes, but does not burn. It is hydrating and plumping. When used consistently your skin is full and the cellulite appears to be less visible. The key is consistency. There is no strong odor or scent that some have and I really like that about this cream. The bottle is practical and easy to dispense. I was sent this for review, however it does not effect my honest and unbiased thoughts and opinions.</li>
            <li> no good&lt;br /&gt;Used in order to see the review&lt;br /&gt;It will end soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but Nothing happen change&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sorry&lt;br /&gt;And a waste of money</li>
            <li> I lost a lot of weight after having a gallbladder removed and the cellulite was out of control. My thighs looked like cottage cheese. I have been using this cream for about two months and it really worked. I spent hundreds on creams and pills to fix the cellulite that showed up, but nothing worked. I am 24 and my new form should not be a problem (always overweight now a healthily weight) but with the gross cellulite it was a big one. I use the product with a cellulite smoothing mitt and the results started in about a week, week and a half. Super impressed.</li>
            <li> It works very well. just don&#x27;t expect it can work in one day as magic. I followed the directions and did sone exercise daily. This is the second week I&#x27;m using it, and I can tell now that the areas I put the cream on getting skinny faster than other areas of my body:)</li>
            <li> I love this!!! This is my fourth bottle so far. I have seen definite results! I am middle-aged. My skin is smoother in texture and appearance. There has been a definite reduction in the amount of visible fat.</li>
            <li> Does not work for the cellulite, two star is for a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> My wife uses it and I can see a huge difference (wink wink).  She went from 56 to 30 in a week (wink wink).  No more cottage cheese, more like skim milk baby (wink wink).  Yes, she&#x27;s still watching me.  No dear, I don&#x27;t want the hose again, yes dear, I&#x27;ll come put some more lotion on your skin ...  *** Update *** It has been a while (year or more) and the wife is sleeping ... this stuff did nothing.  I just lie to her like any good husband would, or one that wants to avoid a verbal beating.  OMG!  She&#x27;s coming, I have to go, if I don&#x27;t post anything again call for help.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but am going to start since I rely on them.  I love the fact that this lotion smells like something that would work..haha!  I have been using it less than a week and already see results.  I am also doing the Brazil Buttlift workout with it and it seems overall I have a change that is not just noticed by me.  Therefore, I am happy and will continue to use this product until I reach the results I am hoping for and probably periodically after that to maintain it.  I only use it once in the morning and I put a decent amount on my target areas.  I use it in conjunction with a cellulite scrub to prep the areas.  Hope this helps!!!!!</li>
            <li> Have used this for 1.5wks an have seen no change. It does make your skin soft but the smell is so strong!</li>
            <li> Kinda to early to tell if it works, since it says that it takes a few weeks to start working.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell pretty but you get used to the smell after a couple of uses. It does make your skin really soft &amp; after a month of using it you barely see the results. It will take time &amp; exercise to get the results you want cause the lotion will not work alone like you would like it too.</li>
            <li> This is complete rubbish and does not work.  The bottle is very small and product is over priced.  Nothing can replace diet and exercise, but some products at least provide assistance in the matter.</li>
            <li> Works okay- not fond of the smell</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for only a couple of weeks and so far so good. I know it is best to use the product for at least a month to get the full results. I purchased this cream to help with those little areas that no amount of exercise will take away. I do notice a slightly smoother appearance. If it only gets better from here, I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 3 weeks only and my skin feels smooth, soft and of course, firm... A little is enough to apply it across... Waiting to experience long term results!!</li>
            <li> This cream works wonders for cellulite!</li>
            <li> I am so happy I bought this product.</li>
            <li> I put this on my lower abdominal region where women get that pooch from pregnancy and thighs. With also running and some mid intermediate working out on core, it works!! Yes there are days I have when I crave my jelly donut but since obesity is a high in family history I try to stay fit for myself and 4yr old daughter. I have with my routine dropped estimation those 7 last hard picky pounds and also with my routine use the Scala cellulite skin massager with this cream and cambogia (grammar wrong, there my apologies). They work well together. I&#x27;ve tried nivea and it kinda works but have seen better results with this cream.</li>
            <li> I used this cream  last year for about 5 months, it works great. You will see results within less than 2 weeks but it must be used 2x&#x27;s per day. I work in fitness industry so obviously I exercise frequently and eat well, even with all that some cellulite still makes its self known.  I&#x27;m not gonna say that it gets rid of it 100% but it comes very close and is by far the best topical cream I have come across.  I recommend using it with a cellulite brush daily as well for even better results. A little bit goes a long way especially if your skin is moist.</li>
            <li> I am 38 years old and I was struggling to make my body smoother and firmer. But when I found Skinny cream, i thought this is product right for me. I am able to control my lose skin now and look far much better than before.</li>
            <li> I view the reviews and decided to go for this cream.&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve been using it morning and night just like it says on the instructions. As well as working out every other day.&lt;br /&gt;I have seen good tighten results so far and will continue to use this cream becuase is really working.&lt;br /&gt;Remember this is not a miracle, you will need to work for it and you will see the same results I am getting.</li>
            <li> For skin care resolution, skinny cream has done wonders. I discovered it over the counter after trying many skin care products. Has help do away with cellulite after using it for four months now. This is not the end of use for it has been favorable for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always suffered from flabby skin and cellulite, but this cream is starting to change that!  Two weeks after starting my legs are looking better than they ever have!</li>
            <li> The name says it all for this cream. It really reduced signs of cellulite for me and I&#x27;ve shared it with some friends who are also now hooked! Try it once and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The product does exactly what it claims amd helps reduce dimples where celulite is formed</li>
            <li> I had seen the reviews and ordered it for myself. It worked fine as described in the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Turned out very good product and we have been using in our family since a while. Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> It has almost become a part of my routine now….since I use it daily without fail and surely enough I am noticing wonderful results from this cream..I highly recommend it..</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month and really haven&#x27;t noticed a difference. I think just good ole fashion exercise and eating right is the best way. I also rated it low because it stinks. The smell is awful.</li>
            <li> I received a discount for this product and I was able to get it for my wife. She absolutely loves this product. I was able to see the difference in her skin. It made it look tighter in the areas in which she applied it. You know the saying a happy wife happy life.</li>
            <li> I have always been self conscious about the cellulite on the back of my thighs and buttocks. I have been an athlete my whole life and always thought it was unfair that I had the awful dimples. I&#x27;ve tried other products and Skinny Cream works the best by far. You need to use it as directed, sometimes I use it 3 times a day. A little goes a long way which is nice so you don&#x27;t have to come back every 2 weeks for more. Smells great and isn&#x27;t greasy. Definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> great product, I def see a difference.  Will continue to use, doesn&#x27;t smell to good but smells goes away quickly</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for awhile now and I must say that my skin does look more taught. The lotion is really thick and creamy and has a fresh scent to it. The lotion has not irritated my skin at all. The packaging is really nice, the bottle seems really good quality. The shipping took quite awhile to get to me was the only drawback about this product. I bought this item at a promotional price and am sharing my honest and unbiased opinion about the product here with you.</li>
            <li> Cream works ok not as well as I expected</li>
            <li> Works great!  Seeing results after just one week.  Using the Massager in addition to the cream.  Nice smell and consistency.  Easy to apply.  I have very sensitive skin and have had no issues.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product much, but when I did use it I seen slight results.</li>
            <li> I DNT C WHERE IT IS WRKIN I HV BEEN USING 4 A WEEK NOW I WILL KEEP USING 2 C IT HAD GRT REVIEWS BUT I DNT C IT</li>
            <li> My fiance applied this as instructed, and she hasn&#x27;t felt this good about herself in a long time. It&#x27;s a must have!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been feeling so much more confident thanks to this cream!</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic. I have only been using it for a little and I already feel like my skin is smoother and notice a tiny difference in my cellulite ripples. I use it on my thighs. I love love love the smell of this cream also. It&#x27;s a wonderful raspberry smell that isn&#x27;t overwhelming. The cream is a thick consistency but absorbs into the skin fairly easily. I rub it in vigorously and apply it in the morning and before bed. I want to start applying it to my double chin and hopefully it will tighten that up also. I really adore this product. I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say I use it enough, but when I do, I feel like it de-puffs the area I use it on.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any change on my skin from using this product. I&#x27;m 7 weeks postpartum and I&#x27;ve been using this product on my belly hoping it would help. If anything, it&#x27;s a good moisturizer. But I&#x27;m disappointed I&#x27;m not seeing any fading or tightening on my belly from the cream.</li>
            <li> I have recently lost some weight, and wanted to find something for the &#x27;saggy&#x27; skin in some target areas.&lt;br /&gt;I found and purchased this Skinny Cream in a promotion for testing and review.  This product helped&lt;br /&gt;firm and also decreased some of my cellulite.  I will likely have to purchase another, as my mom has&lt;br /&gt;absconded with this purchase !!</li>
            <li> It has definatly helped with my cellulite. Feels good on the skin as well. Love the design of the bottle. Great smell and also a great texture. Im satisfied with my results. :)</li>
            <li> I know what you&#x27;re thinking, &amp;#34;Hey that&#x27;s a guy&#x27;s name, what does he know?&amp;#34; Well, I know people that suffer of this and I&#x27;m a good enough person to get it for them because I care. They seem pretty happy with it and have recommended the product many times.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because it does have some great ingredients in it that are known for cellulite reduction, however, perhaps not a high enough concentration. This did absolutely nothing for me, didn&#x27;t even smell good, took forever to absorb and produced no results whatsoever. It was more expensive than the products I had been using and didn&#x27;t work nearly as well. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff I have ever used. I&#x27;ve tried practically every cellulite cream on the market only to be disappointed. From the first application I noticed immediate results. My skin became firmer, the layer of water  retention on my abs completely vanished and the cellulite was gone to. I will definitely  continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work for me. I used it for crinkly skin on upper arms. No effect. Also used it on inner thighs, still no effect.</li>
            <li> not very happy with this. I used this every day as bottle recommended and no results. I do exercise, so I don&#x27;t know about this. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. And the smell is strong.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve try many skinny cream, this is the best one among all. i&#x27;ve been using it continuely for 8 weeks andmy legs obviously slender than before. i just have to share my good news with everybody who wants to be skinny. i told everyone around me and 3 of my friends already ordered it. the only thing i less like is the smell of it i rather choose non scent but whatever it works, who care about the smell.</li>
            <li> I saw results very quickly after using Skinny Cream on my thighs. My skin was firmer and the overall appearance was smoother after only a week or two of use. I definitely want to keep using the product over the summer since it tightens my skin right away and i can feel confident in shorts when i use it! This product has given me way better results than any other cellulite products like Nivea&#x27;s Goodbye Cellulite which appeared to do nothing. Already recommended it to friends!</li>
            <li> Review from my wife …&lt;br /&gt;I like the way my skin feels after using the skinny cream. I can actually tell that it is smoother and firmer. The appearance is better but I cannot afford to keep using it for the price of each bottle when it only last about 2 weeks if you use it twice a day as instructed.</li>
            <li> Horrible did nothing for my body. I use it every day for about 2 months it did absolutely nothing would not order again.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing,It has made my skin smoother and i have been using it for about 2 weeks and i see amazing results already,I do recommend this!!</li>
            <li> This product is nothing more than a very expensive body cream...it did not perform as stated. I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I found this to be kind of on the pricey side, but it does seem to work well.  I have been using it on my neck for the last month and I am noticing it is getting firmer.  I don&#x27;t like how strong the smell is, though.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I have no idea if SKINNY CREAM does what it is supposed to do, although I highly doubt it (the claims being rather fantastical).  This stuff stinks to high Heaven! It is a really bad, rancid smell.  I am not sure I even have the words to describe it. I tried it twice a day for a week before my family and I couldn&#x27;t stand it any more.  I put in on my legs and arms in my bathroom, and hours later I still stank, my bathroom still stank, and the smell was worming its way into the rest of the house.  My husband finally asked me to stop using it, and my little daughter refused to snuggle with me. (My 16 year old just laughed.)  That was the last straw.  I am done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend SKINNY CREAM unless you really want to alienate your loved ones.</li>
            <li> I Love this product. So many creams I have tried over the years haven&#x27;t really delivered results. But, this one does.&lt;br /&gt;In only a few weeks I could see a smoother appearance of the skin on my waist, hips and thighs and even feel a difference in how my jeans fit.  It is easy to apply and absorbs quickly. No funky weird smell either. I highly recommend. Oh- and the customer service I received is above and beyond expectations.</li>
            <li> I just recently started using this product, so far I can see a little improvement on my inner thigh, as this is most problem area with cellulite. I&#x27;m gonna continue using it and will report my progress. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My skin does feel much smoother and tight. I have only use it for a few weeks so I can&#x27;t tell how much it has helped more than that. I&#x27;m happy though.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic!  You see results in just a few days!  I have struggled with cellulite since I was in my teens so it feels great to watch it disappear a little every day.</li>
            <li> My wife tried this for the entire bottle, as instructed.  Frankly, it didn&#x27;t do a thing.  Not even a slight reduction in colour, size, etc.  Maybe it made her skin a little softer, but that was about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always doubtful about these sorts of lotions because they&#x27;re often advertised as effective when used in conjunction with hydration and exercise (which essentially do all the fat burning and toning) but then folks believe the lotion did its job when really all it did was keep the skin from drying out. This stuff seemed to work though. I haven&#x27;t been hitting the gym much lately because I&#x27;ve been slammed at work. I have noticed a difference with this though- my skin feels firm and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is the smell. It&#x27;s rather strong. But if it reduces some cellulite, who am I to complain?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once a day on my upper thighs, yet I see a positive difference in the firmness and look of my thighs. I&#x27;m 45 years old and not consistent with working out, so I need all the help I can get. This would work on mild to moderate cellulite, I think, but I doubt it would do much for a bad case of cellulite.</li>
            <li> Did not like it because for one thing it stinks and it did not do anything for me...don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 2 weeks, it&#x27;s easy to use,  and I think Its starting to work. it&#x27;s harder to tell on a 50 year old than a young person. But I eat healthy and drink a lot of water, and workout and have a lot of muscle, but have some aged lose skin that needs firmed up, and a little fat that needs smoothed out, so as I see what happens I will recommit. The price on Amazon compared to other products like it is good.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice anything other than a pleasant scent with this lotion.  I have minimal cellulite and I used the lotion religiously and with a cellulite massage tool.  I did not notice any improvement.  This expensive lotion is no better than just regular non-cellulite cheapo lotion.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about three weeks, and I have been seeing a difference! Once in the morning, and once at night is enough to see results on my hamstrings, glutes, and quads within the first two weeks. All you need is a little bit on your hand and to rub it all over. It also smells pretty good! I&#x27;m happy with my Skinny Cream and hope to continue to see results and have a flawless bottom soon!</li>
            <li> It was while going through an online store that I came across this product and I immediately ordered it going by the reviews and feedbacks that it had fetched.</li>
            <li> Gave me a horrible rash all over my legs after using it for a few days. Too bad.</li>
            <li> This cream works great.  I tend to get really puffy on my legs and such and this helps so much!  It doesn&#x27;t smell.  It isn&#x27;t harsh on my skin.  It is just great quality cream.  Definitely worth the investment even when it isn&#x27;t at a promo price for an honest opinion.</li>
            <li> This skinny cream is an amazing product and I would definitely recommend it to all that have a little bit of a problem with cellulite.</li>
            <li> This is a decent product. It definitely does help, however, the ones with retinol and caffeine in them work much better for me, and are about the same price. Once I found the skingenixx cellulite cream [[ASIN:B00VSDVDH2 Skingenixx Anti-Cellulite Toning and Slimming Cream]] and tried that, I switched. I could almost immediately see the difference.</li>
            <li> Skinny Cream is very smooth and feels lovely. I am using it on my belly and waist.  My skin feels smoother skin upon application and it seems to be making a difference, when using it on my stomach the skin is smoother.  . I just started using it but so far have big hopes for it based on what I have observed so far. Even though this is not a wrinkle cream, I have  creases on my ear lobe that really bug me. I always test out cream by using it on my ears (funny, right?). My ear lobes smoothed out. I used it on my neck and the skin is smoother.  That alone is enough for me to continue to use this product.  I enjoy doing this for myself, it is a positive experience for me.  The company replied promptly and is friendly.  I&#x27;ll update in a couple weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;I continue to use this cream. I like the way it makes my skin feel.  I don&#x27;t have much cellulite but my skin is smoother.  I gave a bottle to my friend and she goes all out, with the plastic wrapping and all. She really likes this cream for all her &#x27;treatments&#x27; and her skin is smoother...</li>
            <li> I SAW A GREAT IMPROVEMENT WITH THE FIRST ONE SO I HAD TO BUY A SECOND BOTTLE...HOPE IT IMPROVES A LOT MORE!! GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:73a9a86297f4a4b4d0c6d16107419e55]] Like many women out there, I&#x27;m always looking for new high quality products to use on my skin to make it feel more soft, moisturized, and healthy.  I was really intrigued when I saw Skinny Cream and was thrilled to have a chance to order it through a promotion in order to provide my honest and unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing I always check with a new personal care product is the fragrance - with sensitive skin and seasonal allergy issues myself and with other members of my family, it&#x27;s a real concern.  I&#x27;m happy to report that the mild scent of Skinny Cream is very pleasant and does NOT trigger any of our multiple allergy issues!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream itself has a wonderful texture - as you can see in my video it is not runny at all, rather it&#x27;s a nice thick white cream that stays where you want it, yet is absorbed quickly into the skin without leaving behind any greasiness or other residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now how about the \\&quot;skinny\\&quot; part of Skinny Cream?  I wasn&#x27;t really feeling like showing my legs or tummy on my video, but yes like many women I have some issues with skin tone and cellulite.  I&#x27;ve been using this regularly now for over a week and I really do see some improvement!  My skin feels more firm and the texture is improved - wow!  I&#x27;m looking forward to keeping on using it and seeing more results down the line!</li>
            <li> I like Skinny Cream it smells good and it has a good texture to it. The price is too expensive for the amount that your are getting. It is better to go the old school way and use coffee grains instead with coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Before I started the medication that started a huge influx on my weight (10 pounds every d**** month!), I was pretty fit but still had a patch of stubborn cellulite and one dimple I could never get rid of without a healthy diet and exercise. I decided to try out some cellulite cream, thinking it may not do anything but if it did, maybe the cellulite would be gone by the time my excess weight was.&lt;br /&gt;  Well, I&#x27;m still losing weight, but the cream worked faster than I did. I still have cellulite but the definition of that patch is gone. I don&#x27;t doubt that it will keep helping :)&lt;br /&gt;  Also, it&#x27;s non greasy, absorbs well, and smell great</li>
            <li> I have not seen any results and have been using it for 6+ months. It smells good, that is about all!</li>
            <li> Had this product of 4 weeks now and I absolutely LOVE IT!  It gives you tight toned skin and reduces the complection of cellulite!  I was a bit skeptical to how a simple cream would help in this situation but, after using it for a few days I started to notice a small change.  I figured that if it only took a few days to notice a small change then what would it look like after a few weeks.  Now I&#x27;m hooked!  Thank you very much for this product and I definatly will be buying it again!!</li>
            <li> If used as directed, Skinny Cream will give that extra push toward a toned appearance.  Of course, it&#x27;s the &amp;#34;as directed&amp;#34; that&#x27;s the key.  Diet, exercise, and drinking plenty of water are critical, and will produce results on their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m skeptical of a cream that claims to reduce cellulite, and I&#x27;m still not sure if this one does.  What I do know is that the Skinny Cream does seem to tighten skin over and beyond diet and exercise.  YMMV.  I&#x27;m rating Skinny Cream with four stars because it does tighten skin.</li>
            <li> My wife has some cellulite on her legs that she wanted to remove, so she gave Skinny cream a try. It did not remove the cellulite, but it did tone a little better. She used it as directed, and so, once again, there is no miracle cream. We both were not happy with the smell, as there was nothing pleasant about it. I can say that it was actually unappealing. Because it did tone her skin, we both agreed to give it 3 stars. I don&#x27;t think that she is sold on the product, and she hasn&#x27;t asked me to order more, so that&#x27;s pretty telling. I am always a little leary of products that tell you to do a bunch of other things (that will give the same results) while using their product. I though the whole idea was to not have to do all of those other things, otherwise, what do you need the product for???</li>
            <li> I chose this for review not because I thought it would do what it said but because I wanted to prove that it didn&#x27;t. It made no visible difference in cellulite reduction. I did think, however, it would be a nice lotion without any claims that it would do something that a topical lotion is incapable of doing. Texture-wise, it was very nice. A bit thick at first and it went on white but dried clear. The problem I had with it was the smell. It&#x27;s not unpleasant (it&#x27;s quite nice actually) but it is (1) strong and (2) long-lasting. I had applied it to my legs, then put on jeans and hours later my kids asked what that smell was. It was the raspberry-ish lotion. So if you&#x27;re scent sensitive, you&#x27;ll want to skip it. And if you&#x27;re looking for help with cellulite, speak to a medical professional or just accept your genetic lot in life. :).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now, and I&#x27;m starting to see slow results. My thighs look firmer for sure. However, I&#x27;ve only been able to use the cream once a day because: (the con): I really hate the way this smells! I feel uncomfortable smearing this on and then getting dressed and going to work. It really smells awful! I have to hold my breath while putting it on! So only at bedtime for me. It&#x27;s also hard to rub in....it&#x27;s much easier if your skin is completely dry, not just towel-dried. So wait a few minutes after showering. But it does take some work to really rub it in. I will keep using it to try and see more results and let you know how it turns out!</li>
            <li> It is really works. I feel so happy.it is a good product. You should try it &amp; see if it works on you.</li>
            <li> I stumbled on this product while browsing one night and so glad I decided to try this. Except for the strong fragrance, after two days of using this cream, the skin on my thighs looked firmer so will continue using it. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This stuff is so amazing. Makes my skin feel and look great. It seems to be lightening my stretch marks after my 2 babies. Smells great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t think of anything bad to say about it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Love it! It defiantly helps with cellulite. I&#x27;m always on the look out for products that would help to reduce cellulite. And this product does, just that!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I have been using this for like a month. I feel that my abs is a bit firmer than before. However, I personally don&#x27;t really like the smell, it smells chemical to me. Overall, decent product but wish it&#x27;s cheaper. &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a month and I have seen great results. I recommend this cream to anyone that is constant using it and want to see good results. I took me a month to see great results. However, I have been exercising with the complement of this cream.</li>
            <li> No results after. 2 weeks</li>
            <li> Skinny Cream is a great product. It smells nice, it goes on smoothly and you do get results, I do not have a lot of cellulite, but what I did have is noticeably different. I use it once on the morning and once at night. I can see a small change, but am sure if I continued to use this I would see even more proven results. It is not a bad price for Skinny Cream and you will see that  when you compare prices with others brand names., and you get the same results.Just a small change in my cellulite made a believer out of me I would recommend this Skinny Cream. ( note to add) after applying make sure the cream is absorbed well before dressing to get the full benefit. I would recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was sent to me to review of my own and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.  It does minimize the appearance of cellulite.  It doesn&#x27;t take it away completely but it leaves you with a smoother appearance.  You do have to use it everyday twice a day in order to get the desired results.</li>
            <li> According to me this particular skinny cream product is indeed one of the best cellulite reduction creams that are currently available in the market…thank God I chose it in time!</li>
            <li> I have been using skinny cream for 3 weeks and already see results. Love this product and can&#x27;t wait to see what results I have after 8 weeks.</li>
            <li> So far I Like it , but I have only had it for a few days.</li>
            <li> After using the entire bottle as recommended I saw no change.... To top it off, the seller just ignored all my calls and messages to get a free bottle as it says on the top of bottle to do. I might have tried it longer to see if results take longer but since the seller won&#x27;t make good on the free bottle opportunity I guess I&#x27;ll never know....and don&#x27;t be fooled by the picture; the bottle is tiny.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. The bag also was everything I expected. I will recommend this product to my family members.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for 4 weeks and it is a great moisturizer and has helped improve my skin texture and look. Obviously it doesn&#x27;t take care of all of your problems right away but it definitely helps take a step in the right direction.</li>
            <li> This is a bunch of bull. I am no were near large, but i do have some cellulite on my behind. I was so excited to get this item. Not only does it not work, but it smell awful. Dont waste your time</li>
            <li> The Skinny Cream feels very nice when massaged into skin.  The problem I have is with the smell.  I was trying to think of something that it smelled like, but I couldn&#x27;t think of anything like it I&#x27;ve smelled before.  And that&#x27;s not a good thing, since it prevented me from using it enough times to see if it made a difference.  Let&#x27;s be honest:  Most skin care claims are exaggerated and some claims are just untrue.  I hate that I couldn&#x27;t tolerate the smell.  Why would a manufacturer market such a foul-smelling skin cream?</li>
            <li> I have been using Skinny Cream for several months now, after using almost every other name brand CELLULITE cream on the market! I am COMPLETELY IMPRESSED! My legs are smoother, tighter, and have more TONE. I am a surfer, and I am at the beach all year round, my LEGS are always showing!.....So, it is very important to me to be looking my very best. That means healthy, tone and tight. So, thanks to SKINNY CREAM, I can show my legs off with no inhibitions and with complete confidence. THANK YOU SKINNY CREAM!!! I would recommend SKINNY CREAM to every woman who wants HOT LEGS! LOVE LOVE LOVE! &amp;#60;3 :)</li>
            <li> I wish I could say this cream is amazing but I haven&#x27;t used it enough, yet. It does provide temporary results but they seem to fade, especially if you don&#x27;t apply the cream daily. It applies easily and has a light, pleasing scent. I really like that it isn&#x27;t sticky as most creams of this type are. It&#x27;s only been a few weeks so I can&#x27;t comment on its long term effectiveness. I will update when I finish the bottle.</li>
            <li> I used the product and I am very excited to get it again and continue to use it, it works great making a skin look youthful, I recommend the product by using it twice a day at least for two months.</li>
            <li> My experience with this cream, sadly, was not a positive one.  I can&#x27;t speak to rather or not it actually reduces cellulite over time because I could never use it more than once.  First of all, the bottle insinuates it has a raspberry scent but in truth it smells terrible.  I can&#x27;t stress that enough. It has this awful chemical smell.  Second, it doesn&#x27;t want to absorb into your skin for anything.  The directions tell you to vigorously rub it in and they&#x27;re not lying.  I had to press and scrub my hand over and over my skin before it would even begin to rub in.  Third (and perhaps this is the cause of my fourth problem, I&#x27;m not sure) I am terribly intolerant to caffeine.  My body just cannot handle it and I&#x27;ve been known to get sick from drinking decaffeinated coffee because of the trace amounts of caffeine that still remain.  I wasn&#x27;t aware until I already applied the cream that caffeine is one of its leading ingredients so if this is an issue for anyone please be aware of this.  Fourth, within thirty seconds of rubbing it into my legs, my skin began to burn and itch.  After less than a minute I ended up needing to go wash it all off my legs and even then they continued to itch and burn for 5-10 minutes afterwards.  So I can&#x27;t vouch for rather or not it actually will reduce the appearance of cellulite, but from my experience I can&#x27;t recommend anyone trying.</li>
            <li> Skinny Cream is such an appropriate name for a product that actually tones and tightens cellulite-prone skin in such a short amount of time! The cellulite&#x27;s appearance will begin to dramatically reduce within only a few uses, but you can feel it working on your skin as soon as you apply it!</li>
            <li> The packaging is perfect and so is the product. I tell people that they should stop using all of the products that they are using and use this one. I think that everyone should try this out. This is probably one of the best products in the market for these types of products.</li>
            <li> My wife started using Skinny Cream earlier this month and I can definitely see a difference.  I was a little skeptical at first after the first few days, but at about the two week mark, I could tell the product was working.  Her legs and thighs are noticeably smoother and more shapely, and after almost a month of use she&#x27;s no longer afraid to wear a bathing suit.  Her self esteem has improved and i&#x27;m always catching her checking her legs out in the mirror.  It&#x27;s hard to argue with that :)</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first but after reading the reviews I gave it a try and it absolutely worked .</li>
            <li> I used it daily with a massager and this cream didn&#x27;t reduce my cellulite or firm my stomach. I am slim, active and have a very fast metabolism so I don&#x27;t gain weight easily but 3 pregnancies do change your body for sure so I decided to give it a try since the 30 lbs I gained and lost during each pregnancy left me with bit of cellulite on my buttocks.  I eat very healthy, drink water, don&#x27;t smoke or wear thigh clothes, I exercise (plus I have 3 kids!!), and this thing didn&#x27;t work at all. I took pictures and measured myself before I started using it so I am doing everything right but this cream just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I thought my skin was hopeless.&lt;br /&gt;I am allergic to most skin creams so I can’t just buy stuff and apply it. I got Skinny Cream and consulted my dermatologist, who gave me a go signal. I’m glad I got it because I now have almost cellulite free-thighs and better looking skin. It moisturizes just right and after a month of use my dermatologist noticed an improvement in my skin’s elasticity.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to others and give it a 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I gave this product ONLY 4 stars because I was expecting like a drastic difference... I mean the product does work, I can definitely see a difference in my legs while using this cream but I wish that it would be a much bigger difference. I have been using this product for almost 2 weeks now and can already see my cellulite fading and not looking as deep. So at least I know that it does work and I didn&#x27;t waste my money. I will give it about a month though to see if anything changes and give my update then.</li>
            <li> Works great! Noticed a dramatic difference within a week. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This does not work magic on cellulite. I tried this for a couple of weeks without exercising and then tried it with exercising. It worked WITH exercise but NOT without. So, I have come to think that the changes that I experienced were from exercise and not this cream.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much result, though I work out everyday. and the smell is not as pleasant as some of the review mentioned.</li>
            <li> works to smooth out skin, especially a good diet and exercise regiment. I felt like the daily use improved appearance of skin.</li>
            <li> Love the product. I bought this product for the 2nd time and I can tell you I see a different in my body. My husband is eve happy about it.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t seen a difference since I used it. I like the way it leaves my skin feel. Not greasy or slimy. I don&#x27;t see the results I thought I would. I would not recommend buying again.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really work. I already used the whole bottle which a small thing...FYI. So i wouldn&#x27;t really bother buying this product.</li>
            <li> When used with an anti-cellulite massager, this cream works very well to stimulate the skin and circulation. I&#x27;ve only had it a week, so I cannot verify that it reduces cellulite, but it definitely stimulates the skin.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. I would put 5 Stars.. but my boyfriend says he HATES the smell and it gives him a headache. It smells okay to me- so I just can&#x27;t apply it when he&#x27;s in the house. What I do though, is spray with body spray before and after I apply this to my upper thighs, etc. It&#x27;s VERYYY SOFT : ) and does tighten up the skin. I apply it right after I shower, so you want to make sure your skin is a little wet.****  Again, love this product.. It would be absolutely perfect if it had a better smell to it. Try it! You&#x27;ll  love it.</li>
            <li> Not a miracle cream, but as close to being a miracle as I have ever encountered!  I enjoy it, and will continue to invest in more!!</li>
            <li> this cream seems to be helping with tummy and flank fat/skin.  Time will tell how effective it is.  May be due to massaging the cream in as well</li>
            <li> The smell is not bad; it&#x27;s hard to spead though. I have been using it for about 2 months, did not see much result on me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for about 4 weeks now and I can see the difference: my skin is firmer and smoother. I couldn&#x27;t say that there is no cellulite anymore, but the effect of this cream is visible to me. I apply it twice a day as recommended. I do exercise, eat healthy food and drink a lot of water. I apply it to my legs and thighs, and by now I see an improvement.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this cream because of good reviews, and now I can say that I agree with all positive reviews: this cream works. Besides, I have no allergy or any other sort of reaction to it, it has great texture, absorbs well, not greasy or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I really like this Skinny Cream because it is making my thighs look better! It is definitely getting rid of extra water and making the skin on my thighs tighter and look smoother .I am happy that it works because I am more confident about wearing shorts and skirts in public places.This summer is going to be a lot more fun because my legs look better than they have in a long time! I am very happy with the results I have seen so far!&lt;br /&gt;* I was given a discount to provide honest feedback on this product . This is strictly my opinion based on my own experience *</li>
            <li> I liked this product. I got decent results from it. I will use it again in the future.</li>
            <li> This Skinny Cream is excellent! I was surprised after only one week of use that I already am starting to see very visible and noticeable results. It&#x27;s amazing. Now I see why this product has received so many good reviews. Even though I had saw the many, many good reviews on this product before I purchased it, I was still somewhat skeptical about whether or not it would actually work well for me, but it had certainly made a believer out of me, and after only my first week of use. I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a good cellulite reducer and/or who wants to have noticeably firmer and smoother skin.</li>
            <li> I read reviews of this product and thought to give a try and its worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Its been 4 weeks and I have seen a significant result. My skin is looking pretty firmer and  I hope using it more will bring me a desired result.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Skinny!</li>
            <li> Thank you skinny cream!! I was so self conscious about all my cellulite, but no matter how much I worked out and dieted with the sole intention to get rid of it, it would never disappear. So about a year ago I started looking into different cremes I could put on my cellulite to make it go away. The first 3 products I bought didn&#x27;t work at all, I was devastated and thought and thought that I was gonna be stuck with my cellulite forever. Well finally I found this product and saw all the good reviews it had, and decided to give it a try one last time. And thank god I did, this stuff works amazing!</li>
            <li> This Skinny cream works really well, not just on cellulite, but it also reduces the appearance of my scars....love I!</li>
            <li> This cream is the best cream in the market to help you get rid of cellulite. Its fast and totally safe for everyone&#x27;s use. If you want good results this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this three days, twice a day and my skin already feels and looks smoother. Cant wait to see more long term effects! Would def pay the amount to keep this as part of my regiment. I also dont work out or diet so it a something nice and easy to help with my thick thighs and butt!</li>
            <li> I believe this product can work with some persistence. I&#x27;ve been applying it before I work out</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for the scent (smelled medicinal). Used it after derma rolling and it burned and stung. Then my skin itched for the next day. Gave it to a friend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the whole bottle and don&#x27;t see any results plus it smells bad.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does work, and makes me feel more confident when I&#x27;m wearing shorts or dresses. Along with a healthy diet and exercise, this stuff will get rid of unwanted cellulite! In just a week I could already see my thighs getting tighter and looking smoother. I try to only use it in the morning after showering instead of twice a day to make the bottle last longer, because it isn&#x27;t a very big bottle. I highly recommend this stuff, especially before a bikini vacation or summer adventure!</li>
            <li> This product has so many benefits, I&#x27;m not even sure where to begin. I&#x27;ll start with the obvious: cellulite is certainly less noticeable, that much is clear. I&#x27;ve also noticed that my skin feels much smoother than before I started using this cream (added bonus!). Compared to other brands, I&#x27;ve noticed that you seem to get more for your money here, as the quantity is quite generous. I also can&#x27;t get enough of the wonderful smell of this cream. I&#x27;ll definitely be replenishing this once I run out!</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing seen improvement in my skin within a week of use and smells really good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this stuff and I can really tell the difference! This is something u have to use every day but it smells good and I can really tell the cellulite I have is really going away, u jVe to give it time though. I started noticing it going away after just a few weeks of using this. I&#x27;m gonna continue to use this product for more results and to prevent future cellulite from returning!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not skinny and I used it like, 5 times! :) Oh, miracle skinny cream where are you? Diet, exercise, what? I guess it&#x27;s back to the elliptical. After reading some of the other reviews, to be fair, I think I have to give it more of a chance. After having a baby and naturally large thighs on a petite frame, I&#x27;ll try, try again.</li>
            <li> I really never expected this to work but was pleasantly surprised to find that I could see a difference in my skin in just a couple of weeks. I have been using it on my neck and my underarms. If I could afford to, I would use it on my whole body. It doesn&#x27;t have a real pleasant smell but you&#x27;ll love  the results. The flab seems to be disappearing fast!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about everything on the market for cellulite lotions/creams/gels and so far so good. Small decrease in the cellulite, and noticeably smoother after a few weeks. Hopefully it keeps up</li>
            <li> I usually apply the cream and massage my legs vigorously. Having been using it for two weeks and legs start to look slimmer haha..the muscle already become softer and cellulite is reduced significantly！！The product is quite good considering such low price.</li>
            <li> This product claims to reduce cellulite if you use it in addition to diet, exercise and keeping hydrated. Of course, the only real way to get rid of cellulite is diet, exercise and water. This cream just gives you the feeling that you are doing something extra - that you are using a &amp;#34;miracle.&amp;#34; The use of this product is completely unnecessary to see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be that as it may, I tried it anyway. Hey, I&#x27;ve got some cellulite that I&#x27;d love to get rid of. And as fast as possible, so I&#x27;m totally looking for a miracle. I&#x27;m already dieting, exercising and drinking more than my recommended water, so why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used it only on my left leg. A month of twice daily use and there is zero difference between my legs. Yes, they look different than they did, smoother. But they match. As in, the cream itself did nothing. The change in my thighs appearance is due to my hard work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The major problem with this cream, if it had worked at all that is, is that it smells awful. Gag-inducingly awful. Almost unimaginably so. Actually it would have been unimaginable if I hadn&#x27;t exposed myself to it a good 60 times. Completely disgusting. Maybe the smell is supposed to convince you that it&#x27;ll do something. That&#x27;s the only reason I could possibly imagine why a company would release a product for women to put on their bodies that will make them smell absolutely revolting.</li>
            <li> I think this product is fairly effective.  The product goes on a little sticky, but the effects do seem to mimimize the appearance of cellulite.  I have always been highly skeptical of some of the claims put forth by companies that tout similar products. But this product does seem to have a visible effect.  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> My doctor says no cream on the market to date will make any impact on cellulite so I can only give this a 3-star rating at best. I simply cannot resist the hope of a cure that doesn&#x27;t involve lasers or surgery or exercise I just don&#x27;t have time for as a busy working professional. I am only a few pounds overweight but I have always had some cellulite like many women. I have tried this product for several weeks and it definitely decreases my appetite - likely due to the caffeine content I am sure, so I think I have lost a few pounds using it! Also, I wear it with Ames Walker compression hosiery and that helps circulation increase too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the very least, I do feel like my legs feel energized using it although I have seen no change in appearance of the cellulite as yet -- except maybe a nice placebo glow of smooth just after putting it on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those true nature beauties out there, I looked up every ingredient (at least the ones listed on the product and provided by the maker) at EWG.ORG!! I found them to be mostly harmless ingredients, although one preservative in it called METHYLISOTHIAZOLINONE is considered a potential low risk neurotoxin. I usually only use organic products but have made an exception for this product because a lot of people were saying it worked. I will keep applying it fore a few more months. It does smell funny so I wouldn&#x27;t use it ongoing in any case for longer than a few months. Also I wouldn&#x27;t want to sweat in it as it is thick and doesn&#x27;t let the skin breathe much and I did get one break out from it already.</li>
            <li> Well this product didn&#x27;t prove anything to me. Let&#x27;s face it, without diet, exercise and massages or drainages is no super effect visible. But for the believers....pay the price then</li>
            <li> I can tell I´ve seen inmediate lasting  results but my skin looks better wen I use it.  It is expensive for the amount of product you receive.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any results yet...about half-way done with bottle. Maybe I was a sucker for thinking that a little bottle of cream was going to actually get rid of cellulite :(</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! It works instantly. My skin looks and feels tone and firm. I love it!</li>
            <li> This is the only cream that Really Works!! I&#x27;ve used other creams and this is by far the best one that shows noticeable results, the only one that I&#x27;ll continue using, worth every penny!!! Been using it over a month now and am very pleased with the results!!! The Real Deal!&lt;br /&gt;And I am so Happy to Announce that I did in fact recieved my free bottle just for calling the 800 number on the bottle!!! It was shipped really fast:) I am so excited to see the results happening from this cream!!! I can truly see myself cellulite free very soon:))</li>
            <li> Been using the said product with a body wrap and it makes me sweat more during work outs. I hope to receive the free bottle from them so I can continue using the said product and be able to see if I can lose some inches and resolve the excessive skin problem I had after my weight lose program. I also like the smell and the concentration of the said lotion, it doesn&#x27;t require you to put a lot for it to work.</li>
            <li> No dramatic improvement but was worth the try.  This is only my first bottle and there is never a miracle cream that&#x27;s just going to fix everything at once.</li>
            <li> I have tried several creams and this is the only one that works, smells pleasant and absorbs into the skin without leaving a tacky feeling.  I am in my 50&#x27;s and can say it is a great product for older women.</li>
            <li> I have been used this cream for about 1 month. I used it every morning and after shower, but i didn&#x27;t see any difference. It doesn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through one bottle of this and I&#x27;m debating on buying another.  I figure you need to use it a few times to really see results.  Right now all I smell is some funky odor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure that it&#x27;s a scam.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this item and used it for a week. I used it according to what it says in the cover, day and night, twice a day. And now, there is not a single damn effect. So I&#x27;m pretty sure that it&#x27;s a scam, don&#x27;t buy anything from this buyer anymore.&lt;br /&gt;After I used the cream and I can&#x27;t feel any heat in my legs, none, never. How could it burn fat without feeling the heat? I would say this is only some kind of cream that worth $1 per bottle and they pretend to give you a discount like 70% off, in fact, they are still earning money.&lt;br /&gt;My experience, I swear to god I&#x27;m honest, just don&#x27;t buy anything from this scammer, and I&#x27;ll get him reported.</li>
            <li> I was recommended to buy this by my older brother to buy this and It has been doing its job.</li>
            <li> Another cream promising miracle results with no scientific evidence to back up their claims.  I always want to believe that these things will work so I try everything.  Unfortunately, another one has let me down.  This is a rather unpleasantly scented lotion that promises to reduce the appearance of cellulite if used regularly.  I&#x27;ve used it for several weeks almost exactly as directed.  I can&#x27;t tell any difference in the appearance of cellulite on my legs.  The lotion is sticky and uncomfortable feeling after application and as I said, the smell isn&#x27;t something pleasant.  Overall, it was a total failure on all levels in my opinion.  Why won&#x27;t I ever learn that a sensible diet and exercise are the only real ways to make a difference in your body?</li>
            <li> Aside from stretch mark issues, I have ran into cellulite issues after giving birth as well. I tried a huge number of products and wasted more money than I should trying anything other than the Skinny Cream! It wasn&#x27;t more than two weeks I was seeing results. I would definitely recommend this product to any of my girl friends!</li>
            <li> I loved the cream.  It&#x27;s smell wasn&#x27;t overpowering and it really works!  I would recommend to a friend because it works so well.</li>
            <li> I think this product does something, but you really have to treat this product&#x27;s application like you would washing your face or brushing your teeth -- application has to occur every day to maintain the results that do occur.  After five days of consistent application, I began to notice some smoothing on my legs.  However, when I let up on application, the results faded pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of product amount, I found that I had to use quite a bit and one bottle did not last me a month.  The product is fairly hard to spread and requires quite a few substantial globs to provide coverage to the thigh area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What can this product handle? It will not transform your legs from those that belong in a size fourteen pant into legs that can suddenly fit into size six pants.  The effect is a subtle smoothing and most people could probably use a bit of smoothing on their legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the product works to a degree, it requires a lot of it to be applied to be effective and it has to be applied daily to maintain results --these two features mean that I will be unlikely to seek it out on store shelves unless I am planning to go on vacation and know that my legs are going to be on display frequently.</li>
            <li> Completely worthless. Not only does it not work at all, it also smells bad.</li>
            <li> This product is great! I started to see results in just a few days! I have struggled with cellulite after my first child birth, so it feels great to watch it disappear a little every day. I&#x27;ve try many skinny cream, and this is one really works. I&#x27;ve been using it for just 2 weeks and my legs obviously slender than before.</li>
            <li> Love it. It works really good</li>
            <li> Does have a positive effect, wonderful scent and nice feel!</li>
            <li> I really like this product; it was very creamy but; make sure you use it everyday. I see noticed some different ; but I was not able to really tell; but would recommend.</li>
            <li> Im extremely disappointed by this product used it twice a day since it arrived last month and seen no difference can&#x27;t believe I wasted 20 on this :O</li>
            <li> After my excess weight gain from pregnancy to extreme weight loss I am always looking for something to ensure my cellulite is no more.  I started using this cream after receiving it to use and give my honest and unbiased review. Well I am starting to see a difference in the cellulite i unfortunately have. They are slowly but surely going away!!! I am so excited and can&#x27;t wait for no more cellulite.  The cream is also making my skin soft to the touch and does not leave any residue.</li>
            <li> Along with stretch marks, I had gotten cellulite and it looked disgusting. I&#x27;m sure many people despise cellulite, I am certainly not the only one. Anyway, I wanted to get rid of it and a friend recommended this. I got it and to my surprise, it worked! The cellulite is gradually fading away and I cannot be happier.</li>
            <li> I like this product and it has been working for me so far. The only issue I had was it irritated my skin if I put it too much on one area. This is why I gave it 4 stars. But I am going to continue using it with small amount everyday.</li>
            <li> doesnt work for me. i even use the whole bottle!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always hated Orange peel skin, now that I have it, I&#x27;m looking for ways to remove it as I do not like it AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to see if I could maybe remove it, now that I&#x27;ve bought it and used it, my pores are starting to close!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have an odor, but the odor smells good which makes me like it  even more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always struggled with cellulite after my diabetes, a friend of mine recommended this product to me after several others failed on me. The cream goes on nicely, and massages into my stomach and thighs! After a few weeks I noticed some great results.&lt;br /&gt;If you keep at it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed! I know I wasn&#x27;t :)</li>
            <li> I didnt see any improvement and didn&#x27;t care for the smell. Mainly was using it on my outer thighs. Wish it had worked :(</li>
            <li> This was my first time using the product and was very pleased with the initial results. I saw it had a fairly high rating - which drew me in to begin with. So far, results are good. I generally use another &amp;#34;firming cream&amp;#34; on Amazon.com - but will continue to buy if results continue to improve. I am not sure if I would pay 80 bucks for this, but definitely a steal when it is on sale. Shipping was fast, great customer service. All around very pleased!</li>
            <li> Compared to the many cellulite products I&#x27;ve used, this worked great. My cellulite didn&#x27;t go away 100%. However I did see great improvement in my skin&#x27;s appearance. Dimples and curves were tightened. I used this product twice daily for about 4 weeks and saw a significant different in my skin. Unfortunately as soon as you stop using it you can expect your skin to go back to how it was. I used this product in preparation for a beach trip and was happy with my results.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the skinny cream.i am trying for 3 weeks now and I can see o lot improvement in my skin most of all my belly. I loved the cream .</li>
            <li> I like this lotion consistency.  It goes right in the skin fast and doesnt leave a sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> OK I admit I was completely skeptical of this but I got the chance to try this product free of charge for my own personal unbias review. During week 1 I saw no change nothing whatsoever. But in all fairness decided to keep using the product since it stated 8 weeks. Week 2 was a little shady I thought I seen a slight difference in the fat dimples in my legs but wasn&#x27;t quite sure. Week 3 I did notice they seemed a bit smoother not quite as deep. Coincidence maybe? Nope becuase in week 5 they literally were reduced by 50% even my husband noticed by then the tube was empty :( .... So I ordered another! Yep this skeptic paid for this product after my free trial run and I&#x27;m so glad I got the opportunity. The sides and backs of my upper thighs look 75% better and it just wows me. I would defiantly recommend at least trying this product.... What a confidence booster!</li>
            <li> I am highly pleased with the product since the result starts showing from the very first application and they are not just temporary improvements only. I absolutely recommend it to all.</li>
            <li> The product its self, is a great product. I saw results within the first week. The ONLY con with this product is the smell. It has a very funky, kind of nasty smell to it, lol. I was expecting something fruity,  possibly a light dial soap kind of sent and it was anything but that. So I advice using it and spraying a cologne or perfume on afterwards, if not used at night before bed.</li>
            <li> I used it twice a day for about four weeks, and it works for me! My friend said my belly is reduced obviously!</li>
            <li> It smells bad and did nothing. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this. Get it works brand defining gel, only thing worth the money.</li>
            <li> Makes it hard to exercise.</li>
            <li> I really LOVE this cream! I see small results that are very encouraging! I got this product last year and NEVER used it! I actually forgot it. I started using this cream January 1, 2015 and I see small differances. I will say that I am working out a lot me and I&#x27;m sure this is helping also. I will buy this product again!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift to my girl friend. she likes it a lot saying it is better than the one she used before. I will buy this again for her again.</li>
            <li> While I feel a lot tighter around my stomach area after using this cream, I am not completely sure if its because of this product because I have been working out a lot since using this product. However, if it is because of this product, I think this is definitely a 5 star product. I plan to repost after another month of use. I am not willing to give up any of the benefits I am getting from this product.</li>
            <li> The cellulite reduction skinny cream is easy to apply and has a nice smell. However, after 20+ days, I haven&#x27;t seen an improvement of cellulite disappearing. In the past, I&#x27;ve received many compliments on my skin. However, as I age I see cellulite and looser skin. I was hoping this cellulite reduction cream would help but the jury is out for now. Perhaps I&#x27;ll need to prolong the applications (twice daily) before I see an improvement. (Sorry)</li>
            <li> Although its pricey while using this with a slimming belt did wonders took inches off and the cream itself isn&#x27;t harsh on the skin this is the only reduction cream Ive tried that works</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve experimented with various cellulite products in the past. This one I would rate a B considering its price and overall effect. My main problem area is the lower part of my buttocks and hips as well. I&#x27;ve also noticed a slight sagginess in my skin in the stomach area. This product definitely helped in tightening the skin wherever applied, and the results showed within a week or so. However, the cellulite is still there (although slightless less noticeable). I eat healthy, work out 6 days a week and drink plenty of water so I&#x27;m fairly certain that lifestyle is not a factor. Granted you can never expect a miracle product that will totally eliminate your problem but relative to other products I&#x27;ve tried, I&#x27;ve seen better results.</li>
            <li> The manufacturer of “Skinny Cream” alleges that this product might reduce the appearance of cellulite, while making the body smoother and firmer. However, if you stop using it as in the case of every other cream, then, everything might go back to the status quo. Some of the ingredients like green coffee bean extract and glycerin tend to temporarily reduce water retention and tighten up the skin and reduce the appearance of cellulite.  If you’re searching for an Elixir of youth this cream might be another product that you might try in your anti-aging and anti-cellulite armament of creams. We haven’t used it long enough to determine its efficacy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why I got this to Vine-review, but I gave it to my wife and daughter to try.  Both reported the &amp;#34;skinny&amp;#34; feature to be as preposterous as it sounds, and that they thought the smell was odd, but not bad.  Myself, I found the smell more- than odd, kindof like play dough, sunscreen, machine-shop oil and tempura paint.  The really surprising thing is that for the sake of the review, I rubbed a nickle-sized dollop on to my left arm, and hours later, it&#x27;s decidedly smoother and younger looking.  For perspective, I should say I couldn&#x27;t care less how young my arm looks and I&#x27;m (still) very skeptical of any lotion to do such a thing by having caffiene or raspberry ketones in it.  (Kinerase, or lac-hydrin maybe)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acknowledging the above and that it&#x27;s an &amp;#34;off label &amp;#34; application, I&#x27;ll endeavor to use up the rest on my test arm and post a picture at the end.</li>
            <li> The bottle recommends you combine this while watching your food intake and exercising to see the best results, which is always good advice. That said, I wanted to be brave and give potential customers the &amp;#34;skinny&amp;#34; (hurr) on just using this. Slathering this on and not dramatically altering my lifestyle. I thank you in advance for your words of my bravery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Smells kinda funny. Not bad or rotten, but somewhat strongly like wood chips? Not the usual pleasant lotion smell.&lt;br /&gt;- Didn&#x27;t magically erase my cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;- It is not moisturizing. If you have dry skin, you will still need to apply your usual lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- It did firm up my skin a bit, immediately and very noticeably. The texture of my skin really seemed to love the ingredients of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the obvious firming, I do think this would be much more beneficial when used during a big life change/new diet &amp; exercise regime. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a lovely firming lotion but your cellulite won&#x27;t start disappearing.</li>
            <li> The product is really good. You have to take it a day at a time nothing happens over night so don&#x27;t expect a quick maricle. It&#x27;s smooth. I&#x27;m going to keep you updated.</li>
            <li> Good product and Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Just started  using it...(only a week)...but do see some improvement in skin tightness....</li>
            <li> When you gift to a Friend was the birth, I was very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;When I heard the expiration date of a friend, it is a very good product</li>
            <li> i love how this product works yes you need to use it daily&lt;br /&gt;these are my own words&lt;br /&gt;i had received this product in return for my review</li>
            <li> After about a week, I could see a difference after daily use. I could REALLY tell when I stopped using it for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Great product.  It is very fast-acting.  I have used several different firming creams and this one surpasses them all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about two weeks now and while I haven&#x27;t seen drastic results, I really like this product.  I am so excited I was chosen to test this for quality and express my opinion about the product.  I use the massage roller to put it on and it feels great.  The cream has a great smell and absorbs easily into my skin.  It isn&#x27;t greasy and my skin is much softer.  I will continue to use this product.  Even if it doesn&#x27;t eliminate my cellulite, I do have quite a bit, it&#x27;s a fabulous lotion.</li>
            <li> I am waiting to see some results so I cannot judge that yet, but it smells like rotten oranges. I guess its okay otherwise and spreads thickly.</li>
            <li> my wife thought it was a good cream  and she would buy it again; it has a pleasant smell  and absorbs quickly</li>
            <li> but is too small bottle , smells good and for sure make exercice and use&lt;br /&gt;this product make more efective , come on time</li>
            <li> I like how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a while now and it seems like it is starting to work.  The thing is you have to give it some time before you see any results.  I would recommend using it.</li>
            <li> Its ok, i dont see great results? but it does moisturize?  I wont purchase again ..</li>
            <li> Great product and easy to use!! Loved the results!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t work at all Its a wasted of money I been using  this product for a month and i don&#x27;t  see it any difference  yet</li>
            <li> Bought this for my gf because she requested this for her birthday gift. She has been using this for a long time now and seems happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I now enjoy wearing short shorts and mini-skirts, not the kind that make you look like a hooker or desperate but the kind that shows just enough skin. It is a great feeling to know that I can wear these and be at ease about what others might think.</li>
            <li> I bought this item several months ago, Arrived as estimated, no problem with seller. After using this cream, I have to say that so far I only lost 1 inch within a period of 2 months. I dieted and exercised too. It&#x27;s up to the buyer if they choose to use this product, but i won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
            <li> Nice moisture, but you&#x27;re better off buying the Jergens or St. Ives firming lotion...</li>
            <li> I think I am using it for over a month now everyday,I can say it works.i lost few pounds with out any exercise or changing eating habits.it absorbs quickly in the skin and little goes a long way.First I was disappointed when I saw the bottle,but it&#x27;s been a month I am using it daily and I still have product remaining in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers! This product is amazing!!! I see a difference in my abdominals and love handles! I&#x27;ve only used the cream for about two weeks now and the results are quick! I will continue to buy this product for life! I&#x27;ve been tempted to undergo a tummy tuck procedure but I believe using this product consistently will prove effective and lasting results. And with anything, you HAVE TO EAT HEALTHY AND EXERCISE! You&#x27;ll receive a greater result!!! And the Customer Service is wonderful! Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product a little over a week, following the directions to use morning and evening and so far I am happy with my purchase. I do see slight visible firming of my thighs (even after a week of use) which is my current target area and main reason I decided to purchase the Skinny Cream. I still have about 3/4 of the bottle left so I will be leaving a follow-up review once I finish the bottle. Product smells nice and absorbs into the skin pretty quickly without leaving you feeling greasy which is a plus. Just wish the bottle was bigger considering the price I paid. Over all Good product and I look forward to continuing my twice a day treatments to see further results!</li>
            <li> Love it made my leg softer and tone the cellulite get much better thank u will buy again again  i would also would tell my friend</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 months now and it works!&lt;br /&gt;For being athletic and slender, I still have cellulite.  I have used many different products at all different prices but nothing works like this.  My cellulite isnt completely gone but my skin has completely smoothed out and there is a definite decrease in cellulite. Each week I see more of an improvement.&lt;br /&gt;I suggest to eat right and exercise,  I guarantee it will help the tone and rid of that unwanted fat quicker than just dieting and exercising alone. I am really amazed! It&#x27;s worth the money,it won&#x27;t be disappoint. Fantastic cream!</li>
            <li> I am on my third bottle of Skinny Cream. I started using this to supplement my exercise and eating program. I love the way this cream makes my cream look. It feels smooth and soft. I can definitely see that the cream in making my skin more firm. I think the smell is pleasant, much better than the antifreeze smelling products I&#x27;ve used in the past. I am a medium aged mom of 2 who does cardio and strength training daily and eats 90% clean. I wasn&#x27;t planning to see the progress that I have. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I Purchased this item about a month ago, Im seven months pregnant, and trying to prepare to get back in shape after the baby, But am an inpatient person and decided to go ahead and use the skinny cream, I have already seen results and I&#x27;m sure that after the baby comes this product will help me get back to a even better shape then I was before. I have always been a fit person, runs everyday but still struggled with the uneven skin look. SO yes I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I used as directed and it totally works! And very fast to. I have been using it on the back of my legs for about 2 months now. And within the first couple weeks I saw a difference. Definitely going to keep buying this product as needed!</li>
            <li> This cream is great. I have only been using this cream for two weeks and it has visibly reduced cellulite from my thighs and booty. My skin is also a lot firmer. I will order again once I run out.</li>
            <li> I am currently working on toning my body and just needed to get rid of the little cottage or rather cellulite on my legs and glutes.  Within a few short months my legs and glutes look much tighter and smoother.  No kidding I am on my third bottle, but using it now for maintenance purposes.  I have also starting putting on my arms and stomach.  I will let you know how that goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mrs. Dow</li>
            <li> Very thick but feels its working</li>
            <li> This cream is also a good cream with great results. I am seeing the changes daily on my thighs and buttocks area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is sufficient in the bottle to last a good while comparing to the other one I had which was a good brand also but it finished to fast.</li>
            <li> 9/10 only cos i don&#x27;t really like the smell of it! other than that, IT IS AMAZING! i actually use it on my arms, once a day before i sleep(directions recommend 2, but cos of the smell, i don&#x27;t use it in the morning)  i actually see a difference with the dimples on my arms, and they look smaller as well.. do keep in mind, i work out 4-5 days a week, and i eat as clean as i can.. i feel the cream works and helps only because  i combine it with working out and a good diet! would repurchase when i am done!:)</li>
            <li> Great product great service!</li>
            <li> Awesome cream! Man, has it changed how my skin looks. After looking at the reviews, I saw the product looked great but still wasn&#x27;t sure. But after using it for a few months, the results show well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin, especially my legs, look so much more smoother. However, I see results in every area from legs to arms!</li>
            <li> This cream is excellent! I had a lot of cellulite on the back of my legs and after about 10 applications, I started seeing a huge difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, I&#x27;ve ordered 3 more tubes for my friends who need to shed a little cellulite too :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended product.</li>
            <li> About a month has passed since using this product and I&#x27;ve noticed subtle changes from both the combination of using this and doing some moderate exercise about 4-5 times a week - nothing drastic, but I didn&#x27;t expect any major changes from using this or any other similar product.  This smells nice and unlike other products, it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for 4 weeks now and I noticed the difference in my skin. The appearance of the skin is much firmer and more even. Cellulite is not gone but there is a visible difference. I wish the cream will absorb better as it takes time to actually rub it into skin. Overall, I think it is one of the best products I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for the last 6 months.  I have noticed reduction in cellulite and smoother even skin tone.  Of course, I eat healthy and exercise which helps.  The smell of it could be better.</li>
            <li> Definitely saw improvement after using it every day. Cellulite diminished</li>
            <li> Used this cream everyday even used it along with  a dermaroller and didnt see any difference in cellulite, or firming</li>
            <li> Used morning and night for 4 days and I can see a huge difference in size of my arms. I don&#x27;t really have cellulite, but after going from 210 to 150 pounds, I have a lot of stubborn fat and loose skin. This has really tightened and toned my arms. Just started using all over my body, also bought 4 more bottles today. Yes they are small and you go thru them very quickly, but for $30 a bottle, I think it&#x27;s a steal. Much cheaper than plastic surgery and body wraps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update  6/9/2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So started using over my entire body 2-3 times a day. This morning as I was putting it on I noticed my stretch marks looked a lot more noticeable! They never have been in the past as they are REALLY old. But when I was watching tv later with my fiancé, I decided to rub some more on while laying down. For some reason they look SO much more less noticeable than they ever have while laying down, so Im not quite sure if its helping them or making them worse. Everything does feel a little tighter, not too much though, My arms haven&#x27;t changed since my first review, but I still have 3 1/2 bottles left to go before I expect some serious results. The smell is honestly ridiculously disgusting, I don&#x27;t know why so many people think it smells good, I&#x27;ve heard people say I smell like spoiled wine. But I didn&#x27;t buy it for the smell so I really don&#x27;t care. One unexpected side effect is that my skin has NEVER looked better or felt better. I&#x27;ve always had really rough with tiny pimple like marks everywhere, those are completely gone. My skin feels like silk! Also having a serious allergic reaction to some new face wash that made my skin peel off, it&#x27;s been the only thing that has helped heal it.</li>
            <li> I used this product ages ago when I was losing a bunch of weight to even out my cellulite areas. I recently got a bottle for my roommate too, she also positively adores the results.</li>
            <li> Yeah so even though the bottle is kinda weird looking imo, it really works and thats all that matters. Its cheap so who cares I&#x27;m getting more</li>
            <li> I noticed my skin tightening and reduce cellulite on my legs.</li>
            <li> I recently started a exercise and diet program and decided I would like to try out this cream on those stubborn areas of my body. I began using this product as soon as it arrived. I suffer from very dry skin and have noticed it has made my skin very silky and smooth. This product doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy and oily, which is a big plus. My skin looks a little smoother in those bumpy areas and I have noticed the tightening developing only after a few days of use. Recommended usage is twice a day, so I have been using it every morning after my shower and at bedtime, after a bath. The smell of the product is amazing. It contains raspberry ketones and green coffee bean extract. Some may find the smell a bit strong, but in this case I would suggest you apply it before bedtime. I, however, enjoy the scent, as it reminds me of peppermint. The bottle is easy to open and squeeze and you just rub it in like you would a regular lotion for the skin. The results I have gotten after a week have really surprised me. I didn&#x27;t expect to see them so soon. I am really excited to see what will happen in 7 more weeks using this product. I recommend this product to anyone looking for that extra help to visibly reduce the appearance of cellulite.</li>
            <li> just same like the picture , i hope this product will work for my legs. i am happy to saw the views, so i order it .. a little be expensive .</li>
            <li> I only used this product like 4 times before noticing a big difference in my skin. It&#x27;s a great product. Works fast</li>
            <li> I have simply grown to trust this product after I noticed the great improvement it has done to my skin…I have even started getting a lot of attention and compliments!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product and I must say it&#x27;s awesome. I&#x27;ve tried other products, but this is hands down the best. Don&#x27;t expect some magic weight loss continue to eat right and exercise, but I guarantee it will help you tone and get rid of that unwanted fat faster than just dieting and exercising alone. I was amazed and truthfully didn&#x27;t expect it to work as great as it did. It&#x27;s worth the money, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> My thighs don&#x27;t have as many lumps anymore. It is now smoother and tighter.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see that this actually does reduce the visibility of cellulite tremendously.</li>
            <li> Atlast!! after too much exercise with no good results, now my baby fat is gone in three weeks. i love my sexy back!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month and haven&#x27;t seen any results. The only plus side is that it smells better then most products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Maybe I should give it a little longer, but after two weeks, I see no results.  I&#x27;m not overweight and I exercise 3-5 times a week, drink water and eat fairly healthy.  I&#x27;ll keep using the product but not too happy so far.</li>
            <li> I followed directions, even bought the brush to massage the areas, but nothing! no visible improvement or difference on the appearance of my skin :(, to me was money wasted!</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. What else can I say, this is the best thing on the market for what it is.</li>
            <li> I had a bad case of skin peeling so I tried out this cream. Took some time but it definitely helped out my skin. If you have ever had skin peeling, you will agree that it&#x27;s not a good feeling. The cream restored my skin and now it&#x27;s smooth and healthy!</li>
            <li> really happy with my results so far! after a few weeks of use i can see visible reduction of of the cellulite dimple look on my legs! my skin looks firmer and more youthful! highly recommend! so glad i got to test free for review!</li>
            <li> The cream makes my skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li> Did not work, it actually gave my mother the hives (yes she did test it on a patch of skin and nothing before use upon daily use hives came out). Save your money, another weight loss gimmick.</li>
            <li> This cream is great! Ive used it all over my belly, thighs, arms and i see amazing improvements. I don&#x27;t regret buying this at all!</li>
            <li> I love this skinny cream!!  It goes on smooth and makes my legs so soft and moisturized all while diminishing the appearance of my cellulite.  I cant say enough great things about this wonderful product.  Try it~~ you wont be disapointed</li>
            <li> Just work out and eat right. Cellulite is hard to beat without surgery. :(. The cream smells a little strange as well.  Just save your money.</li>
            <li> Noticed results in a few days! I&#x27;m very curvy, carry extra fat in thighs and butt. That&#x27;s where I apply this cream. Only use every night after shower. I apply to thighs and butt (I do 1 thigh at time, butt last). I do not rub in with my hands. I use finūlite massager with handle, since the directions say to rub in &amp;#34;vigorously&amp;#34;. Feels good... Works into top layers of adipose tissue/fat. Noticed difference in few days! I think the key is the vigorous rubbing, helps to work it in... Dry brushing the skin also helps, no matter what product you use</li>
            <li> I have tried this lotion for about two weeks and it worked for me but and I m thinking to get more to have a better result..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different products like this one and this is my favorite so far.  It has to be rubbed in, which seems to increase its effectiveness.  Firming cream is a must following fat loss and provides the added benefit of skin softening.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t anything drastic about this cream, but I do feel it helped some. I&#x27;ve used it for my stomach area after 3 pregnancies as well as losing 60 pounds. I&#x27;ve felt I see some firmness and my stretch marks aren&#x27;t as bad. But I also eat healthy, and exercise 5-6 times a week regularly. So along with that, I have been pleased.</li>
            <li> I have cellulite on my butt and backs of my thighs...  after a month of everyday use my cellulite wasn&#x27;t gone but it had improved the look of the cellulite and lessened it and my skin felt super soft as well.  I&#x27;d recommend this product</li>
            <li> I ordered the Skinny Cream last week. I tried it Friday night into Monday Morning and all I can say that I&#x27;m a Firm Believer! The Cream works! I like most about the cream is that it absorbs very fast into your skin and feel it working right away! The scent is very light, not bad like some other Creams or lotions that have a horrible smell to them. My Abs, Waist ,Buns and Thighs feel firmer since I started the cream, I ordered another yesterday! I even bought one for my Mom, told her about it that it works! Try it! Soon you will be a Firm Believer! :)</li>
            <li> I have been trying to get the extra inches off my waistline and I would say it does its job couple with some workouts in the gym.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again!</li>
            <li> ... I would say: smell nice, feel on skin pleasant (may be like any other good body creams), but it is hard to say if it is works for body as promised because... it is too little size of bottle and not much cream. It is took me two week to use morning/evening and bottle is empty. I would try to use it again if it would be bigger bottle for less price.</li>
            <li> I order this product not knowing if it will work or not, and after trying it out for 10 days I saw a difference. I will defintely try this product again. Works better if you drink lots of water and keep yourself in shape, doesnt smell bad and the cream is thick so you know it will work and pentrate to your skin.</li>
            <li> Loved this cream! used it as directed once in the morning and once again before bedtime. Smells amazing and very easy to use, made it appart of my daily routine.noticed resluts in 1 week. I will surely be  buying more.</li>
            <li> last month i made a picture and see how my legs and arms are so horrible for my age&lt;br /&gt;after i read the reviews i decide to give it a try when it come i was schock cause of the size of the bottle but trust me  this would last you 3 to 4 weeks because of the consistency the smell its light and pleasant and it does what they say in exactely 3 weeks my skin smothe my cellulite b show less this is definitely a keeper&lt;br /&gt;it worth the price trust me</li>
            <li> :( Did not receive shipment. Waste of $30, I am so sad. Really had high hopes for this.. Hopefully the seller will either refund my money or resend it to me. If and when it comes I will revise this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I am a girl using my boyfriend&#x27;s account btw)</li>
            <li> Skinny Cream is a really good product! As I often try new creams to find the working ones, this time I think I &#x27;ve found the one doing his job.&lt;br /&gt;I have struggled with cellulite since hitting my mid 40&#x27;s, so it&#x27;s great to see that my body is getting better day by day.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!  Does not work!!!!!!  :(</li>
            <li> I put it on after I get out of the shower and I already see a difference...for sure something to use before summer gets here!</li>
            <li> I hated my cellulite and wanted to find a product that could help get of rid of it. This product helped me and I could not be any happier.</li>
            <li> Using But it&#x27;s only been a couple weeks and I have forgotten it a few times after a bath. I will have to come back and update this in a month or so.&lt;br /&gt;As for the smell, it doesn&#x27;t stink but I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two weeks. So far I can see a difference in my stomach area. Like said before, combined with exercise, water and good eating habits I believe this product can serve its purpose.</li>
            <li> UPDATE 5/14/13&lt;br /&gt;I used the rest of this bottle at the end of last week, little to no change at all. I will not be purchasing again. UNLESS the bottle is huge for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: MAY 7, 2013&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this cream for 6 days now day and night. I have noticed the difference slightly in my upper thighs and nothing at all in my stomach. DEF not enough of a difference to spend another $30 on a very small bottle. I will use it till it is up and then post my final review. I wish they would come up with a miracle in a bottle but they probably never will and it all comes down to your diet, drinking water and exercise, unfortunately there is not an easy fix in 1 day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First recieved:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK I just recieved this cream in the mail last night, I have to say it is very small bottle for the price, however it smells nice. I started it last night and this am, the cream def needs to be rubbed/ massaged into the skin. I got it for the small area on the thighs. I am a skinny person but I do have some cellulite and would like it to disappear before I get on the beach in a month. I have started exercising more and drinking 6 glasses of water a day, hopefully this helps because everything else I have done really doesnt do anything. I am not quite sure why I have celluite seeing as how I only weigh 110 but I do, my mom is in her 50&#x27;s and has had 4 kids, never had cellulite ever, interesting.&lt;br /&gt;WE WILL see if this works and if it does im buying in bulk!</li>
            <li> As a middle aged woman one of my concerns is the appearance of my legs and buttocks. I love in Hawaii so when I was offered this cream for the purpose of inspection and my unbiased opinion I jumped on it immediately. The cream has a nice consistency, not too thick but yet not runny at all, it does spread nicely without running and is quickly absorbed . I&#x27;ve been using on my legs and butt and so far I noticed my skin a little less bumpy for the past couple of weeks. I am looking forward to see greater results with more use, it does have a almost unnoticeable smell and I like that the tube stands up on its cap.</li>
            <li> I have used anywhere from really cheap to very expensive creams and some moderately work and others don&#x27;t work at all. I bought this product because of the great reviews and I&#x27;m glad I did. It has made a big difference and I have been using it for about a few weeks now. I lost alot of weight and in turn had that stubborn loose skin. My skin seems tighter and my cellulite seems to be diminishing. I do want to say that I also work out as well but this product helps it along. The only down side is the small bottle . It is totally worth the price though!</li>
            <li> Noticed results/ less cellulite in my butt &amp; thighs after just 2 weeks of using it. Recommend it for sure!</li>
            <li> use it for your own piece of mind, but what works is diet and exercise, everything is a gimmick and we all know it.</li>
            <li> My wife wanted to try this stuff, but she found it to have too much odor to be of any use to her, so it sits on the bathroom sink full and unused and disappointing.</li>
            <li> Lasted for less than 2 weeks. A total waste of money. I&#x27;m learning (the hard way) to not look for easy fixes. 1 star for smell, 1 star for moisturize.</li>
            <li> I think this cream is awesome....I put skinny cream on at night under tights... In the morning their is a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to lose weight around my stomach for so long that it&#x27;s funny. I am on a diet, exercise regularly, but have a few problem areas I&#x27;d like to see gone (I.E. my belly!!!). I decided to go with the reviews and try it out. I did notice that the skin on my belly seems a little less &amp;#34;dimply&amp;#34; and smoother, but haven&#x27;t noticed much of a change other than that. It&#x27;s pricy, but I decided to buy another bottle to keep trying it and see if it does anything else with more use. It could DEFINITELY come in a larger bottle, especially with the price you pay for it. Definitely use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> I could not see any change at all. I was using the Nivea cellulite gel and I thought it would be better but did nothing at all for me so go back to Nivea that at least smooth me a little.</li>
            <li> First of all, I have found that it&#x27;s REALLY hard for me to remember to do things regularly. This cream is suppose to be used twice a day.  I was lucky when I remembered to use it once a day.  So that might be why it didn&#x27;t work for me.  It seems unfair to write a review when I didn&#x27;t use the product &#x27;properly&#x27;, but here&#x27;s my thoughts and experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, I had a hard time remembering to use it.  But after I&#x27;d been using it not regularly for several weeks I finally started remembering better so I did, for at least two weeks, apply it twice a day.  I wanted to get the best results so I stuck to just my stomach area.  I have had two kids and have a roll as well as cellulite.  I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my cellulite reduction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream has a strong smell.  It was really gross at first and I had trouble using it.  After I&#x27;d used it for awhile I got more use to it, but it&#x27;s something I can see some would have a problem with. Luckily, once it&#x27;s soaked in the scent goes away (or isn&#x27;t noticeable).  The texture is about perfect, but it did take awhile to rub in (I might just be impatient).  I did like the texture a lot though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that I would consider using it again and hoping that I remembered to use it twice daily for the entire bottle.  It&#x27;s possible that it works, I just had a hard time remembering to use it all the time.</li>
            <li> The product has begun showing its effects, and is tending to work as expected. not bad for the price of 20 bucks at all.</li>
            <li> Very nice cream,my skin is a baby soft,I see much less cellulite dimples.The only thing I wish the bottle size will be bigger.</li>
            <li> I gave Skinny Cream the 5 Star rating I think it deserves. I&#x27;ve been using it on the back of my legs and buttocks right at a month now. I am always skeptical about these kinds of products, but I&#x27;m getting married in a few months and figured I have nothing to lose except this lumpy skin. You never know the truth until you try it yourself; so I did am I&#x27;m now seeing my skin looking smooth and firm on the back of my legs and upper thighs. I can&#x27;t wait to get another bottle to keep seeing these changes. By the time my wedding rolls around, I will feel much more confident.</li>
            <li> Skinny Cream indeed!  My skin is much more firm where I use it.  I decided to test it out in certain spots, you know, to really see if it works.  The difference is amazing!  I actually enjoy the smell, too, which can be a big problem sometimes with these things.  I&#x27;m using it every day and love the results.</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to buy this cream but I always heard about green coffee beans extract and raspberry ketones for weight loss. So I bought the cream for mainly trimming my waist and inner thigh and not really for cellulite purpose. I worked!!!! I was so amazed that my waist actually lost its love handles.....something i only thought that had to be removed by surgury....seriously it seems as though i used an iron and smoothen out the handles......between my legs was getting rough because i was gaining too much weight and now that too is smoother....this cream also seems to give a natural gloss to the skin .... almost like a magazine chick look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But hey this is not a lay back and rub on cream. it helps to do all that i told you above but you also have to atleast do a little threadmill, running, skipping, jogging or abs. Also do some detox and drink less sugar or no sugar.....it not too much work but it helps the cream work faster.....i am awaiting my other bottle....</li>
            <li> This is what my wife said about this product: &amp;#34;After reviewing the comments on Amazon about this cream, I had to give it a try. My skin is more firm and defined in the back of my legs. Even my husband told me that my legs feel &#x27;tighter&#x27;...so I am impressed.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I will be the first to tell you that there is no miracle cure or cream out there no matter what others say. This product hydrates your skin and moisturizes it. It absorbs quickly into your skin and is not greasy feeling at all. It does have a medicinally scent that I didn&#x27;t care for, however it goes away after a while. My legs did appear smoother but I think thats because it moisturized my skin quite well. I think if anything, though, this product probably does help to diminish the look of cellulite but it doesn&#x27;t actually take it away. I feel the description is a little misleading so that is why I am giving it only 3 stars. You would need exercise and to drink a lot of water, etc. to take the cellulite away. I don&#x27;t think any cream can really do that. However, this cream still helped with the appearance of my skin and made bad areas less noticeable. I recieved this product for testing and quality purposes. This is my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to get Skinny creme for free to try it out and give my honest opinion.  I received the creme about a week ago.  I decided to try it on my thighs and my ankles to start with.  I opened it and it had a pleasant smell. The creme was easy to apply.  My skin felt firmer immediately.  After a few days I could see a little better appearance in the cellulite on my legs.  My ankles swell up a lot and then get a crease. I have noticed they are a little firmer and less crease.  I would definitely recommend this product for you to try.</li>
            <li> I truly wonderful product!! I used it for nearly a month and all my worries about weight loss are gone. My skin has become healthy too and I feel 10 years younger.</li>
            <li> I still have to notice results, but probably it is too early.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is ok, the texture is a little too creamy for me - I prefer gel-like textures.&lt;br /&gt;But the price/quality deal is good, so go for it.&lt;br /&gt;Good seller, fast and as described.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now, maybe a little over, it has tightened my skin slightly but that&#x27;s about it, the smell of the lotion is aweful, the price I think is fair if your looking for something new to try but I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again. I do eat healthy &amp; workout regularly so I think for tighter skin ill just try and work in more cardio.</li>
            <li> Skinny cream reduces heaviness &amp; water weight in my legs as I do stand alot-love it for that. Can&#x27;t tell if it reduces cellulite, I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week or two. Still hopeful!</li>
            <li> I just started using this cream so I&#x27;m not sure of the results yet.  However, I do wish they could work on the smell of the cream.  It is not very appealling.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this magical cream!! I&#x27;ve been using for a lil over 2 months and can notice that my cellulite in thighs are almost gone. It&#x27;s such a great find. I can&#x27;t wait to use up my other two bottles. One bottle lasts me for a month and a half</li>
            <li> good!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!!</li>
            <li> My wife love it. This is good product. It is helpful.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this is the first product that did not cause a rash or any other kind of reaction. Coupled with the results that I received, this adds up to be an A-MA-ZING product. I attached pictures (one that I took before trying out the cream, and one after two weeks). Talk about visible results. At least now I am ready to go the beach!</li>
            <li> I have used it for my AB area for 4 weeks, plus diet and exercises. It seems to have some positive results.  I would like to use it for a longer time.</li>
            <li> I gave the product 3 stars as it is too soon to tell if it will work on cellulite; the bottle states that you will need 8 wks to see significant results. However, in the meantime I have noticed firmer skin, better skin tone, and well moisturized skin. With that said I would recommend the product and shall return in an additional 4-6 weeks to report on cellulite.</li>
            <li> I bought a second bottle and I can say I totally impressed. I saw the difference after several weeks. Skin is more smooth. And I love that this cream is not heavy and I can get dressed immediately. Of cause, no one cream won&#x27;t help you, if you eat unhealthy food and don&#x27;t exercise. But as additional support this cream is amazing. I will recommend it all my girls!</li>
            <li> Thank God I only paid 10 bucks for this cream cause that&#x27;s all it&#x27;s worth. I have used this product faithfully (day and night for 3 weeks) and yes, it does produce an okay smell, it does go on smoothly and it firms some areas BUT not all... It certainly did nothing for my small amount of cellulite which is what I bought for in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this for another month since many reviewers swear by this stuff and I will be sure to update in 30 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing ventured &#x3D; nothing gained!</li>
            <li> This cream is great and it works!  I can see results after using only once per day for the last month.</li>
            <li> Ok I wanna say this cream is like a topical laxative. I feel like it makes me go to the bathroom more often, and it has an unusual smell to it. Combined with exercise it may work</li>
            <li> We have not used this product very long, but what we have it seem to work.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift so good.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product out of curiosity.&lt;br /&gt;I am 2months postpartum 2nd child and things got wrinkled on my belly due to stretching ...and also celulite showed up on my inner thighs and butt...I use this product EVERYWHERE and the firmness came after 2days of use on my belly...the deep wrinkles are gone....and I see a reduction in celulite in my problem areas.&lt;br /&gt;I will be continuing with the skinny cream forever :) btw I am 22.</li>
            <li> This is my first product review. I had been using Nivea firming cellulite serum Q10 plus for a few months and I didn&#x27;t see any results. I bought skinny cream and used for a month and already have great results. love it.</li>
            <li> As a fitness model, I need to take care of my legs. This cream is so amazing. It is on my daily beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> Skinny cream is wonderful.I am using daily before to go to the gym.I love this cream because I am losing  belly fat very easy and very fast.&lt;br /&gt;I did not use another cream for fat reduction before.I see my belly getting smoller and tight.I am very happy with this cream.I recomend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> I had loose skins and was a bit flabby. My colleague recommended this product and it has worked wonders for me. My body has become toned and there is no more any flabbiness.</li>
            <li> This product really works.  You do have to reapply it but it really makes a difference. I love it and will continue to buy it as I think it works wonders.  It is really thick so you don&#x27;t need much and the smell is strong but not overwhelming.  If you haven&#x27;t found a product that works on your cellulite, you have to try this cream.  You will be amazed.  All my friends have noticed a difference and have bought it as well.  It is money well spent.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very good item for me</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. It was moisturizing and left my skin feeling soft and smooth all day throug. I have already seen results in the water retention phase and I will be buying more of this fantastic product. Results don&#x27;t lie. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I have been using some other brand which is quite expensive and not amazingly effective. And I happened to see this product and decided to give it a shot. I was surprised to see the results only after a week&#x27;s use and now I am following the instructions and applying it twice every day. I am hoping to reduce the cellulite a lot before the summer comes.</li>
            <li> Does not smell the best, but the smell is light so it is not too offensive.  It does seem to help so I don&#x27;t mind the smell.  Has made my legs look a lot firmer.</li>
            <li> So far so good for me. I&#x27;ve been using this product for several weeks and I have seen and felt this working.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a bit of saggy skin on my neck, which appears tighter and firmer after application.  I layer this on after my shower in the morning and again most nights before bed.&lt;br /&gt;I also have been applying this to my belly and legs, which both need a bit more work, but there has been improvement. I&#x27;m hopeful with continued use the stretch marks from pregnancy will not be so noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of this cream is rather unpleasant to me, but fortunately it absorbs quickly.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t notice the scent as much if I didn&#x27;t apply this to my neck.&lt;br /&gt;This definitely causes a tightening effect.  Within a few moments of applying I must wash my hands because they feel very tight and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve being using it for about two weeks and my legs are much smoother.&lt;br /&gt;could def tell the difference.  too bad i didn&#x27;t take before and after pics.</li>
            <li> I never really found the smell of the product to be that terrible. I saw tons of people complaining about it but really it&#x27;s not as bad as they&#x27;re making it out to be. Perhaps I just have a less refined sense of smell though than the rest of these folks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product appears to work but like others are saying it&#x27;s hard to really gauge how much of it was the cream versus just diet and exercise. I&#x27;d suggest getting one bottle of it and giving it a try for awhile to see if you notice results that are greater than your normal results from just diet and exercise. I won&#x27;t be getting another bottle but I&#x27;m not sold it didn&#x27;t reduce cellulite appearance.</li>
            <li> I still waiting for my free bottom. and I call three time no respond. let me know if I have to anything else.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product and it arrived very quickly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend that you diet and workout to get the best results!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for a while now and i have seen great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on using it for a while to keep my skin tight and get rid of the excess cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells great and works great!</li>
            <li> This cream has the latest in weight loss supplements; such as green tea and raspberry ketones.  It also include caffeine as an ingredient.  Which if you are wanting something to rev up your system is fine, but I am sensitive to caffeine and so it doesn&#x27;t work for me.  But it might work well for someone who isn&#x27;t as sensitive to caffeine and it certainly has all the latest recommended weight loss supplements (with the exception of Garcinia Cambogia).</li>
            <li> I noticed absolutely no difference and found the smell so offensive it gave me a headache. It has that salon/acetone/fake tanner type scent. GAG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gimmick.</li>
            <li> I feel it working - also makes skin so soft!!  Visible difference in one week!!!  OMGoodness!!!  I&#x27;d go for it!!</li>
            <li> The cream itself is a thick and creamy and smells a little funny but I defiantly think it has tightened up/reduced fab on my arms and thighs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for almost 8 wks now and it does work but it&#x27;s a slow process. I had a lot of cellulose to get rid of.  I lost almost 140 lbs. in 2 yrs. My skin is actually a lot firmer &amp; the cellulite has decreased about 30% so far. This product does work but you have to be patient &amp; use as directed. This cream has a strong scent but you will get use to it after while and it&#x27;s actually not that bad. Try the cream but before you start to use it take a before picture of the area &amp; after 4 wks take an after picture &amp; compare the results. That&#x27;s what I did and you will be pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> It works. Must be consistent. I did notice a difference in my thighs. It didn&#x27;t all disappear but much improved.I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> When I was contemplating on purchasing this product I was really skeptical about how I would be able to visibly &amp;#34;see&amp;#34; the difference.  However, product was on sale on Groupon, so why not?  I was looking for something to help tone my body. I am 5&#x27;2 at 125 lbs. I started to exercise daily recently and thought the cream could give me any type of jump. Soooo... I&#x27;ve used the cream for about a month, twice a day morning/night and I will have to say certainly your body will not retain some of your water intake. I typically drink a lot of water all day but I noticed I go to the restroom a lot at night. I guess that&#x27;s the difference I notice, def no excuse with water weight in the morning. I will continue to use the cream because I think consistency is key. Recommended usage is 8 weeks and I will continue to regularly use .</li>
            <li> Just got it, feels tingly and rubs in nice. Will update my review in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> This has an interesting scent, halfway between cocoa butter and suntan lotion. It rubs in well and I&#x27;m already seeing results after one week of use. The dimple marks are still there but they&#x27;re not as deep. The overall area seems to be smaller and more shapely as well. Can&#x27;t wait to see the difference a full bottle makes! I received a sample for my review.</li>
            <li> This product really does reduce cellulite on any area of the body. I have used this on my under arms, my stomach and on my thighs. This has really made quite a difference in the appearance of cellulite. I noticed that my stomach is shrinking and tightening from the loose skin. Also my thighs and arms looks firmer and tighter. Its not greasy and rubs in well. Overall this product is amazing and does work like it states when it comes to reducing the look and feel of your cellulite! *sample provided to review</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of days now and can see a small difference. I cant imagine using this for a month and what this magical cream can do. Cant wait to see the bigger result! Im glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by how effective this product really is! I had my doubts about a skin cream reducing cellulite. But I was quite wrong thinking it wasn&#x27;t possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first noticed that my legs started to feel extremely smooth after 3-4 days of use. I unfortunately have this huge wall mirror in my bathroom (that I can&#x27;t remove since it&#x27;s a rental), so I get to see my cellulite each day in person and in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week of using this product, I really started to see a difference. I&#x27;ve been using it more than a month now and am thrilled with the results. Keep in mind that this is not a permanent fix and unless you keep using it the cellulite will likely come back. But I think it&#x27;s a great product to use during warm weather when you&#x27;ll be wearing shorts or a bathing suit or before major events where you&#x27;ll be wearing a dress that shows your legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I have to make a full disclosure here. I did not follow the directions and I usually only applied it once a day. The directions say to apply twice a day. I&#x27;ll admit I was sometimes too tired to do it at night. So my results, which were excellent, were achieved using the product only once a day on most days. I can only imagine what my legs would look like if I had applied it twice a day. And also keep in mind that this is not a miracle cure. It doesn&#x27;t get rid of it completely but it did make mine extremely less noticeable, to the point that I actually felt a little better about the way I look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only minor complaint is that the smell is not that pleasant. However it does not last. It did not stain any of my clothes, even though I was quick to get dressed after applying, considering the cold weather this time of year!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only other complaint is that it is fairly expensive. No, it&#x27;s not as expensive as some of the other creams out there but it is expensive for the average person -- at least I think so. However, after the results I got so far and continue to get, I think it might be something worth spending the money on for the warmer months at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I can see a major decrease in the appearance of cellulite. And just for comparison sake, I do have a lot of cellulite on my thighs.&lt;br /&gt;I am not overweight but did gain weight due to a health condition and then the medication taken for the condition. But I did gain even more cellulite from the weight gain. And due to the increased cellulite I refuse to wear shorts in the summer. With continued use of this product, I will actually be purchasing my first set of shorts in about 3 years! So if that isn&#x27;t an endorsement for the effectiveness of this product, I don&#x27;t know what is. And besides that, I just love how smooth it makes my legs feel! It&#x27;s incredible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes, I highly recommend the project. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars due to the odor and the high price. I also didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars due to the fact that you do have to use it constantly to keep up the fabulous results. But this last fact is something they disclose on the site. I was very, very, pleasantly surprised and am very impressed that a cream can reduce my cellulite as much as it does. Give it a try. It&#x27;s worth it.e to get, I think it might be something worth spending the money on for the warmer months at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I can see a major decrease in the appearance of cellulite.

            <li> I was rather skeptical when trying Skinny Cream, but I figured what the heck – it couldn’t hurt!  The instructions say to “massage vigorously” into your skin; I wondered if the vigorous massaging effect would help break up cellulite, so I used this cream on one leg and a regular body lotion on my other leg.  (For my personal testing purposes, I used CeraVe, an OTC lotion, as my “control” lotion.)  Skinny Cream has a thick consistency, similar perhaps to sunscreen, and it took several minutes to get the white cream completely rubbed into my leg (compared to my OTC lotion, which was readily absorbed into my other leg.)  Despite the ingredients of raspberry and coffee bean, Skinny Cream didn’t have a really nice smell (but it didn’t exactly stink, either!)  After about roughly five minutes, the Skinny Cream leg appeared to be *somewhat* smoother and tighter, but not significantly; the leg with the OTC lotion looked the same ol’ same ol’!  This “smoothing” effect lasted several hours.  I am sure that the effect will disappear the next time I take a shower (or maybe when I go swimming), but I can always reapply the lotion to get the same slight benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that Skinny Cream is NOT gonna get rid of cellulite – that’s only gonna happen only with proper diet and exercise – but the short term *appearance* benefit may be worth it if you have some special occasion to attend in which your legs will be exposed (but no pool parties!)</li>
            <li> First off, when you receive the item it will come with a slip that says you can get a bottle for free is you call a number. I like free just like anyone and called the number and was directed to a website to give my information. I received a call back a day later stating to use the product for a month and to leave a positive review to get the free product. When I purchased the item it had well over a 4-star rating so once realized that people were probably leaving reviews for the free product it was kind of disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway for the review of the actual cream. I can&#x27;t tell you if it worked or not because I didn&#x27;t use a control. I have lost 30lbs in the last 3 months and my before and after pictures do show cellulite reduction. Now is this due to this magic cream or the fact that I am losing fat and working out. I have to think it&#x27;s the latter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t feel anything when I put it on. It has a slight odor to it, but it&#x27;s nothing that is overly bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look, I want to believe that there is this magic cream that makes cellulite vanish instantly, but the saying goes &amp;#34;If it&#x27;s too good to be true.. it probably is&amp;#34;. Stick to your squats/leg exercises/diet and I&#x27;m sure you will see results even without the cream.</li>
            <li> Im on my first bottle and been using twice a day for almost a month and I have to say I Love Love this stuff, Im starting to notice my legs are looking a lot better. It has smoothed my legs already n cellulite is starting to disappear:) I already have my second bottle so excited to see what that does even more. I never ever buy stuff like this but read reviews and was pleased with what I heard. I have to say Im very excited to have found this product and recommend it highly! I use twice a day everyday and massage it into my legs very well, If you haven&#x27;t tried this stuff it&#x27;s great:) Your missing out!</li>
            <li> I love this product it has help me lower my stomach..... Of course I am in a diet and I do exercise but it has help to  firm areas that need help. I will definitely recommend this product</li>
            <li> Works wonderful and you can get same cream on overstock.com for $18.99 each!! Works great and awesome price if you shop around.</li>
            <li> This Skinny Cream is quite effective at diminishing the appearance of cellulite, but keep in mind that is not an overnight miracle worker. In fact, it will take a few applications over at least a week before you will see results. I&#x27;ve rubbed this cream onto the back of my thighs for about 3 weeks now, and I began seeing very noticeable results last week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small dimples have not completely disappeared (as expected - again, this is not a miracle cream), but my skin is so much smoother and firmer around that area. The cellulite is definitely not as obvious as it used to be prior to applying this cream religiously, so I&#x27;ve been able to wear skirts more often without worrying about how my thighs look from the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream itself has a light, pleasant fragrance and is pretty thick in texture. It is definitely thicker than lotion, but still applies easily and evenly. The product comes in quite a large squeeze-tube bottle, which will surely last months and is great for dispensing exactly the amount I need. The bottle itself is hard, so it doesn&#x27;t begin flattening or rolling up the way toothpaste tubes do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read that applying this cream can get rid of up to 90% of cellulite after 8 weeks, but I&#x27;ve been rubbing the cream in with just my hand for the past 3 weeks and am already seeing results. The only thing is that it takes a while to dry completely, otherwise it will cause you to feel sticky if you immediately put your clothes on after, but this is expected with all creams. Overall, this is a great product that helps to improve skin tone, and as a bonus, the bottle is so big that I likely won&#x27;t have to buy another for at least 4 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided by Skinny Cream for the purposes of unbiased testing and reviewing.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m loving the product! I&#x27;m hoping with continued use I will see more results! The smell isn&#x27;t too much like some say. Give it try! $30 isn&#x27;t much when you consider that it&#x27;s probably same cost as a meal these days.</li>
            <li> works soso but does not aborb well</li>
            <li> Wow, nothing but love for this product!&lt;br /&gt;The skin on my thigh tightens up so nicely.</li>
            <li> No effect what so ever!!  we lose fat when we face calorie deficit... by putting on these creams, we wont lose fat from a specific place.. these are all scams</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received the product quite fast after placing the order here. It smells quite weird, but after a month using it my thighs seem to have less cellulite. Good job Skinny Cream!</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I was given this to try for my review. I&#x27;ve tried many other creams and this by far is one of the best. I&#x27;ve been using it for more than a week and it really did help tighten my tummy. I recommend this product</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mum and she was even more grateful when she tried it! Her cellulite was less noticeable after only trying this product for a few weeks. Imagine what will the results be in the long term! Recommended for people who wants to improve their skin!</li>
            <li> It seems like it might actually be working. I am still covered in cellulite after using one full bottle. I am using it with Shessentials Cellulite Massager Brush. Cellulite is just hard as hell to get rid of! Looks like this is smoothing it out, but it will probably take a few bottles to get good results. I wish the bottle was bigger!</li>
            <li> So when I bought this I was very skeptical as I don&#x27;t really trust a lot of hype about any kind of skinny cream. I am 57 years old and I like to wear shorts and skirts. I have cellulite and get very embrassed when the shirts are a little above the knee. I have been using skinny cream for two weeks and I promise you I can see a difference. I am not going to try to say this is miracle cream but I do promise you will like the difference you see.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle, but I was expecting to see some difference. First of all, this product is expensive for the 4 tiny ounces you get. I was done with the bottle in less then three weeks. The day after I got this in the mail the price went up $10! Now, there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m spending anymore money to see if I can see a slight change. The only reason I gave it any stars is because it smells good.</li>
            <li> I have been using skinny cream for the last few weeks and I like the product enough; however, I feel for the price the size of the bottle is way too small and would be too expensive to continue using long term to actually see some real results.  I like the smell enough and the way it smooths into your skin. I&#x27;m hoping they make the amount larger and I will be able to use it again.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this cream, but it didn&#x27;t quite make it. I felt some softness and firmness, but it came back the next day</li>
            <li> I noticed a big improvement after I used the cream. It took about 4 days to  really see the difference.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bs. Doesn&#x27;t do any more then a lotion</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a couple of days and i do see the difference. I see my thigs loosing. When i rub the cream on my thigs, it goes right inside and the skin just absorbs the cream right away. I see strech marks now, but im sure if i use it for some more time, that will also go.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Reduced the appearance of cellulite to my thighs and belly. Non greasy, non sticky lotion. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month and have noticed a great improvement in my legs. That ugly cellulite is disappearing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Skinny Cream for just a week, but I already can see the results. My skin got really smooth and silky. I use it twice a day - in the morning and at night. I love the texture and the smell is just amazing. I&#x27;m really happy for choosing this product.</li>
            <li> Just started using skinny cream have noticed some improvement will continue to use skinny cream hope to see more result by July</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Skinny Cream for a couple months now along with my workout plan and I am loving the results. It makes my skin feel very smooth as well, which I love.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in the tightness of my skin after the first couple of uses. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> My husband bought this for me and I finally found this cream works magic, I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I actually got this cream for myself just out of curiosity since I had been hearing my friends and relatives talking about it so much…I now feel grateful to them!!</li>
            <li> This product does not help at all for cellulite. Do not buy it, it is a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> This product is great and does exactly what it says it does. Your cellulite will be gone before you know it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re anything like me, you like some parts of your body more than other parts. And the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; parts, at least for me, are the ones where my skin is not smooth and beautiful. Like the area behind the thighs, for example. Skinny cream is perfect for restoring and smoothing your skin, and reducing cellulite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 months and I must say it works. Add a proper diet and exercise and the results are Amazing. It&#x27;s a small bottle but last along time.</li>
            <li> I used this product once a day for  3 wks and I did notice improvement and although I was expecting quicker results, I can definitely tell tht this product will work but it will take longer than 3 weeks</li>
            <li> The bottle is very small considering the price, only lasted for about ten days when you are using in different areas.  I notice slight firming but no drastic changes.  Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Still early but I am seeing some improvement. It&#x27;s day 5 and I am using it with a massager I also purchased.. The combo seems to be working, but will give it more time to give my thorough eval and let you know how it goes. I&#x27;m 32, 103 lbs and I am using product on thighs and backs of my legs.</li>
            <li> Its great to find a product that does what it says. I&#x27;m in good shape from diet and working out, but needed something to tighten and tone my arms, belly, hips, and legs. I heard about Raspberry Ketones and Green Coffee Bean Extract on Dr. Oz and other shows, so I figured it&#x27;s worth a try - what have I got to lose but love handles. Its worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skinny Cream is easy to use, smells good, and it shows in a few weeks (better to use twice a day). I am a fan and recommend it to other women who are trying to get rid of cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish someone would have told me about Skinny Cream sooner.</li>
            <li> I needed a fast solution to my skin patches for my approaching wedding and so I chose this cream as I had heard about it a lot!!!...I made the right choice!!!</li>
            <li> I started having some cellulite in the back of my legs. I wanted to try anything to see if this would work and It did. It made my skin look so smooth and way better. I love this product and would use it again if and when it comes back. Love this product.</li>
            <li> I had tried a number of such cellulite reduction creams before this but none of them could fetch me the desired result until I switched to this particular cream…</li>
            <li> I am very much impressed with this cream and I have recommended it to my other friends too…the report from everywhere is really good and I feel great for being of help!</li>
            <li> I would give a ten out of ten to this product!!.....I in fact carry this cellulite reduction cream with me even when I am on business tours for long days…</li>
            <li> A really cool product. Helps a lot.&lt;br /&gt;The name says it all!!  Be sure to try it out today.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I purchased this but I had gone through the reviews and decided to try this product out for myself. I love that it does exactly as it says. I’ve been using it for about five weeks now and there has been good improvement</li>
            <li> As usual with these things I was skeptical of its validity but ot worked wonders!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have to say this stuff is pretty good as diminishing cellulite and making your skin look smoother.</li>
            <li> This cream gave me results in about three weeks!  I have had cellulite on my inner thighs for years and I am thrilled to finally see it go away.  I applied this product 2-3 times a day depending on my day.  Once before work (morning), before the gym, and at night.  I read the reviews before that said that the best results come with drinking a lot of water, diet, and exercise.  Even at my thinnest/most fit I still had cellulite, so I am pleasantly surprised to see it working now at my heaviest.  I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what my wife has been looking for and we are very happy!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!!!!  At first I was skeptical but then I seen my girlfriend had tried it and she swore by it  and how it worked and so I said I will try and did. I don&#x27;t regret it  as a matter of fact I&#x27;m buying more!</li>
            <li> Used it during 3 weeks twice a day, it makes skin firmer yet no improvement compared to cheaper brands. Don&#x27;t recommend it</li>
            <li> Gave this as a gift to my wife and she just absolutely loves it. The cream works for her and I will definitely be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li> This is very good and reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Ever since finding Skinny Cream, I no longer have to pay for expensive spa treatments to diminish cellulite.  Most products that promise to &amp;#34;reduce cellulite&amp;#34; rarely work, but this stuff lives up to its name entirely!!</li>
            <li> I was mislead by the label on the bottle that claims this product is \\&quot;natural.\\&quot; Not coincidentally, before purchasing the product, there is no way to look at the list of ingredients.  I purchased the product bec of the positive reviews and when I got it, was disappointed by the amount of many toxic ingredients it contains.  Keep in mind that whatever you put on your skin gets absorbed by the bloodstream, so you should avoid the many commercial beauty products that contain some of over 12,000 chemical ingredients that are illegal in Europe, but legal in the US. In Europe, a company has to show that a chemical is safe before putting it in a product, but in the US it&#x27;s the opposite; if there is no evidence it causes harm, you can use it. You can check all the ingredients in the cream on the Skin Deep website at http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One red flag is the use of \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; which can include up to 3000 chemicals; companies are not required to disclose what chemical they have put under the label \\&quot;fragrance,\\&quot; so if a product has \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; in the list of ingredients, you can be sure it is something weird and possibly toxic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product also has a weird smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be sending it back. Its not worth it to poison yourself to improve your appearance.</li>
            <li> This cellulite cream works well to decrease the appearance of cellulite (in conjuntion with diet, hydration and exercise)  - the results were similar to Finulite and Nuelle creams.  The product is very creamy and not greasy like the Nivea cream.  Smells good.  But beware, the bottle size is small for the price.</li>
            <li> I am always skeptical of trying cellulite creams, because I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them on the market.  I was pleasantly surprised at my results after using skinny cream... I actually saw a difference! I will be using this cream in my beauty routine from now on! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have used the lotion for a couple of weeks without noticeable change. I, however, am not exactly sure what the change is supposed to be. There was a significant discount on this product which was nice so I was able to try it.</li>
            <li> The best skin cream I&#x27;ve ever tried. You will notice amazing results in only a matter of days.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend Skinny Cream. This definitely took the edge off my cellulite. I&#x27;m less self conscious about my body now. No more saddlebags!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife as she works out like crazy and can&#x27;t seem to eliminate her cellulite. She loves this product and we can both see the reduction in her cellulite. I believe in this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had cellulite on my thighs and butt for as long as I remember, and after skimming a few products this was the first with such great reviews, so I went out on a limb and ordered it; I was definitely not let down. It took 3 weeks- a month to see major results, but I will not complain, especially since SC is cheaper than the less helpful alternatives.</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers have already said, it takes a couple weeks to notice results. I have been using this for several weeks now and have to say this is one of the best products I have used. I was thoroughly impressed at how well it worked. It firmed and tightened across my thighs and I no longer have dimples. I do have a few depressions, but I think with prolonged use that will go away also. I also used it on my stomach and it has tightened there as well. My stretch marks are barely noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;My husband has been even complements me more and has noticed a stark difference.&lt;br /&gt;I just recently changed my diet to add more water and healthier food, and the results have improved even more. I think if you are using this product, and eat healthy, then the results should be more immediate.</li>
            <li> the cream is fantastic you can feel it right away . even though i dont use it twice aday as recomended bec i wanted the cream to last longer time. i still get good result and am going to bye it again. i just wish if they can make bigger bottel who last longer. i did felt diffrent in my thigh and bottock i can wear shorter dress now.&lt;br /&gt;bottom line it is good product.</li>
            <li> I have spider veins, not cellulite and it works for the veins that has been embarassing to me. If it can clear that up, it can surely help out with cellulite too! Overall great product and no residue! Good job!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I recently lost a lot of weight, and have been using this on my arms, very pleased girl. Plus it smells fantastic, isnt sticky or oily, and absorbs very fast. Will happily buy again!</li>
            <li> Ive been using this product and ive noticed a difference right away. I recommend product and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> I must say I was skeptical but was willing to try this product.  This product truly works and has fast results..I have been using this cream faithfully day and night for 2 weeks.  To give you an accurate picture of how well this cream works I must tell you why I wanted to use it to begin with.  I am a mother of 2, homeschooler and I am in my early 30s..I have a 15 yr old special needs son who has relied on my care 100% day and night..the last 2 yrs I have worked so hard every second of every day to keep him alive and with great sadness I must tell you he went to heaven in October.  I was a size 10/12 2 yrs ago and in summer of 2012 my son couldnt eat which meant I couldnt eat..I went down to a size 4 by october.  I have since then gained some weight and am now a size 6/8.  Needless to say I have excess skin along with some cellulite on hips and thighs.  This cream actually has tightened and decreased my cellulite immensly.  I will not use another cream..this product is amazing..you will not be disappointed.  I only wish this cream came in a larger container.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product that would help with my cellulite around my thigh area for under $40. I have found it in this product. After a few weeks of use, I have noticed a difference in the reduction of dimples around my upper thighs. The nutrients in the cream have also helped with the stretch marks as well; it’s a two for one deal! You can’t beat that.</li>
            <li> My sister bought this stuff for me and I used it religiously till it was gone. I don&#x27;t look any better and I keep having to make excuses when she asks why I don&#x27;t wear shorts .... LOL!!</li>
            <li> Seller pleasant to do business with.  Prompt shipping and item arrived as described.  I have seen improvement and hope it gets better with continued use.</li>
            <li> I was expecting more, I have not see any results. I thought the bottle was bigger.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not for me</li>
            <li> I have been using this product now for several weeks in conjunction with doing the 30-day squat challenge. My legs look and feel firmer. The product goes on very smooth, not greasy or any odor. I immediately felt my skin feel better to the touch. I have even started seeing a noticeable reduction in dimples. If I had one complaint its that the bottle is too small. Since I have been using it religiously, I will need more soon. I know the squats are probably helping with the cellulite but the cream has made my skin feel so nice. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I started using this product 2 weeks ago. It is an amazing product. I decided to try it because of the reviews. I have started seeing the results. My waist is now leaner than it was and my thigh area is firmer. I would advise that one eat properly, exercise and try to great product.</li>
            <li> The bottle was too small.. for the price of it n plus shipping..But* :) I&#x27;m Happy because it works.. I&#x27;ve been thinking about ordering another one but don&#x27;t know yet. I&#x27;m really on a tight budget right now.. I wish the bottle was a lot bigger..cause if it was I will keep ordering the product.. I feel it working through my arms stomach n legs. Its has a lovely smell to..I love it so much but I hope I can order another soon&lt;br /&gt; So for anyone who&#x27;s planning to try this product I would say GO FOR IT!!</li>
            <li> I was worried about my growing age and the loose skins so I was suggested by my doctor to try this product out. I agreed since it is clinically approved. Now my skin looks butter smooth and much younger.</li>
            <li> I love this cream!!! After using for a while I notified the different already. I am very pleased. As a matter of fact, I just ordered 10 more tubes last night, that is how pleased I am with this product!!! If you are looking for a product to help you reduce cellulite, PLEASE USE Skinny Cream Clinically Proven Cellulite Reduction!!! You will not be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> My wife uses this product every day and absolutely loves it! I can see a noticeable difference in her wrinkles being gone and it has boosted her confidence to a new level. Would recommend for anybody looking for a wrinkle reducer!</li>
            <li> Cellulite has always been a problem with me but since I have bought this product it has been going away little by little!</li>
            <li> Been using this product for over 1 month and been showing results since day 1! my skin is the smoothest out of all my friends! AMAZING !I would recommenced to anyone interested in getting glossy and smooth skin!</li>
            <li> I feel this product actually works, myself and my wife both use it, and we have seen a difference..Highly reccomend, great bang for the buck. We ahve been using it for around 6 months, and bring when we travel etc.</li>
            <li> It is perfect!! It does work!!!</li>
            <li> My legs are thiner than before</li>
            <li> I am a bodybuilder and I&#x27;ve been looking for something to help with my last little bit of stubborn fat and stretch marks around my love handles. I felt silly buying this stuff because it&#x27;s made for women, but I knew that Green Coffee Bean and Raspberry Ketones work well, so I thought this might be useful to get that last little bit around my waist taken care of. After several weeks my wife asked me if I had been dieting again, and said that my waist looked leaner. I started wearing smaller trunks and you can definitely tell when you have that extra bulge around the hips. Anyways, my wife insisted I tell her what I was using. So now she&#x27;s using it and it&#x27;s really helping with her cellulite. Granted, I think she looks beautiful just the way she is, but I have to say I&#x27;ve noticed she has that firmness to her thighs that she hasn&#x27;t had in a couple years now. Awesome product.</li>
            <li> Hoping to see results!</li>
            <li> I try this product for free i love  it so far it works for my problem areas when i first use i can feel it working immediately after ever use smell okay as well love my results!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Been using this two weeks and I can see a difference,  Excited to see if gets better!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see where this stuff is working.I know it has good intentions but its just not working. But try it, it may work for you.</li>
            <li> I always do my homework before buying any product and I was so pleased with the others&#x27; reviews that I had to try a bottle for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;ve tried many other products claiming cellulite reductions to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Skinny Cream combined with drinking water, eating healthy, working out, and using a cellulite massager has worked WONDERS for me. My legs aren&#x27;t 100% smooth but my husband and I have noticed a significant difference in the appearance of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re not sure about the product, just try it! $30 is like, 3 trips to McDonald&#x27;s that you don&#x27;t need. This product is well worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I found this product to be awesome!  I started using it and within a week I had noticeable changes in my legs.  I recently lost 35lbs and had some stretch marks and cellulite at the top of my legs, not good for summer vacation wear!  Anyway, I am noticing a BIG difference, so I will defintely continue to use this product!</li>
            <li> I have used several different cellulite creams over the years, this is the only one that has worked.  I  am and aerobics instructor and I try to eat healthy but if you have cellulite it does not matter what you do it is still there.  I used the Skinny cream for a month and then I tried another brand, it did not work like the skinny cream.  The one and only thing I don&#x27;t like about Skinny Cream is that it is not very moisturizing.  I have to use a separate moisturizer on top of Skinny cream so my legs don&#x27;t itch from dryness.  It is not a problem for me.  I also wish the bottle was a little bit bigger.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a little over 4 weeks now, and I&#x27;m incredibly impressed with my results! I have been using it twice a day on the back of my thighs, and it has really reduced my bumps and dimples -  and my skin tone and firmness has also greatly improved. Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> I am fairly small gal 110 that works out like a maniac.  After giving birth to my two wonderful kiddo&#x27;s and then loosing all the weight has left tummy &amp; buttocks area...  with a lot of extra skin.  To be clear, there is no miracle cream that will get rid of the handful of skin that has been stretched, however it has helped smooth out and even out the these areas.  I have consulted with a few surgeons for a tummy tuck, being quoted 8-10 grand.  I think an very reasonable alternative for the time being is using this cream along with good exercise, water etc... Look into the raspberry keytone research,  it is effective.  I think you have to make sure you&#x27;ll applying both morning and night consistently though.</li>
            <li> I really want to thank the makers of this skinny cream for having come up with such an effective and superb product…I feel great about my skin and it has even boosted my confidence!!</li>
            <li> When I first bough this cream I really had no idea that it could actually turn out to be so good!!...I now recommend it to all who face the same problems.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, i was a little disappointed  when i saw the bottle but  it lasted for a month. I was very please with it and does the job.love it</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I first tried this cream, I can honestly say that I have not only seen an improvement in the texture of my skin but firmness too. I have been loosing weight and the looseness of my skin was a concern, I do work out often but I can tell this cream had helped me and made a big difference on my skin.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t worked at all. The people who says it has worked are desperately clinging the the hope that it doesn&#x27;t and fat reduction is all in their minds.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my wife after she gave birth to our 3rd kid in 4 years. Our latest one was almost 10 pounds at birth, and my wife is a petite lady so there was some major stretching going on. She was becoming self-conscious about the lines that were left after the healing process and wanted to find something that would help improve her skin. I gave her this “Skinny Cream” and she tried it on some of the looser areas from the pregnancy. She stuck with the applications, and after regular use she had some great success. Her skin not only looks better because the wrinkles and stretch marks are no longer there, it’s also silky smooth. She has been using it for a little more than two months, and has even been putting it in baskets for baby shower gifts for her friends. For the price it really can’t be beaten, and the results really show!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I was looking for something to keep my legs looking fresh if I happen to have a busy week and not work out. I&#x27;m a petite person and pretty active so I have limited body fat and I saw a difference from applying at night to waking up! Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> It moisturizes and tones which makes them look healthier to sum it up i  achieved an overall improvement in the appearance. Thanks to the cream. A++</li>
            <li> This product is unbelievable! I saw results within the first two weeks! I have tried many products but will search no more. This is worth every penny. I am so happy with it and will continue to use it regularly! I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;The customer service is incredible!</li>
            <li> simply the best... i really feel happy for finding this...</li>
            <li> This product really works great..  I decided to finally try it after reading about it and seeing the reviews.  I have been using it for about a month and I can already tell the difference..  My skin is feeling and looking firmer and smoother.  When I started dieting and exercising, it definitely seemed to speed up the process.  I can&#x27;t wait to see how my legs look in another month!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now and I&#x27;m really starting to see a difference! I&#x27;ll definitely be buying another bottle.</li>
            <li> The skin on my face has legitimately never felt so smooth. Wonderful product. Worth the buy.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely a miracle worker--it actually has effectively improved my skin--no more cellulite!</li>
            <li> Noticed a drastic and lasting decrease of cellulite tissue!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife because she has been unhappy with her weight gain after pregnancy. Shes been using it for the past 3 months and she is really happy with her results. Use this product:)</li>
            <li> MY LEGS LOOK SO MUCH BETTER SINCE I STARTED USING THIS.  MY CELLULITE SEEMS LIKE IT IS MELTING AWAY.  LOVE IT!!</li>
