            <li>I have used it for 5 months now and love it.</li>
            <li>I seem to be allergic to many skin creams (and shampoos and conditioners).  </li>
            <li>This cream is OK, but it sort of sits on the surface.  </li>
            <li>My skin was so better, the rosacea was almost gone.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>and it works every bit as good as the product I was buying straight from the Pevonia site.</li>

            <li>I was hoping this was a light cream</li>
            <li>It really helps with my rosacea (even though I have a light case of it) and keeps my skin very comfortable.</li>

            <li>This cream is the most soothing I have found so far.</li>
            <li>Moisturizes and smells good, don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve noticed that some other products that work have a funny smell.</li>
            <li>Very gentle.</li>
            <li>Very gentle and light for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>If you use the RS2 Concentrate first and then apply the RS2 Care Cream, it is does help those with Rosacea.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in the appearance of my skin after the first application.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several other products, even some suggested by the dermatologist, and Pervonia RS2 cream is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>This helps to maintain my skin better than any other product line I have used, as yet, for my rosacea.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth it to keep the redness in check.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and calm.</li>
            <li>For the price, I expected more of this cream.</li>
            <li>I have been using Pevonia Gentle Care Cream for a couple of years.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe it really helps relieve any of the redness</li>
            <li>I have seen a very noticeable improvement in my coloring.</li>
            <li>This product works with the cleanser and gentle lotion</li>
            <li>Reasonable delivery and exactly as advertised, unopened new product.</li>
            <li>Pevonia Gentle Care Cream has given new life to my skin.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>so I have to add sunscreen because I live in Arizona.</li>
            <li>It works better than expected for my Rosacea &amp; oily but peeling facial skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and once something flares it, I cannot use it anymore.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money as it lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li>I shall certainly be making further purchases from this company.</li>
            <li>I think that using the complete RS2 may provide improved results.</li>
            <li>Natural ingredients makes a difference.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>This product was recommended to me by an aesthetician at a spa in Scottsdale AZ as I have a little mild rosacea on my face.  </li>
            <li>but I have used other products with noticeable results ( less redness) and more moisture.</li>
            <li>I barely can say if is doing anything besides hydrating my skin.</li>
            <li>I had used Pevonia Botanica&#x27;s RS2 line for years, but then my aesthetician closed shop, so needed a new source.</li>

            <li> This is the only moisturizer that is both thick enough to last the whole day and removes redness from my face.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than I usually pay for this product</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and occasional outbreaks of roseacea.  </li>
            <li> My skin is back as was before, red, with pink pellets.</li>
            <li> I have better experiences with less expensive creams such as anti redness creams from biodermal.</li>
            <li> But for the last 7 days it has promoted a minimal improvement.</li>
            <li> I have tried other creams recommended to me but always come back to this.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very creamy, so my face still feels dry.  </li>
            <li> I have used this cream everyday for the last year.</li>
            <li> I think I will try one of their other creams.</li>
            <li> I had occasionally tried a new to market less expensive product.</li>
            <li> Due to the cost it is no longer carried in shops locally and getting hard to find.</li>
            <li> This, together with other products from this line have done the trick!</li>
            <li> The rosacea is significantly less pronounced and my face stays hydrated all day.</li>
            <li> I have a little bit of rosacea plus combination skin.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product at a spa a few years ago and have used nothing but Pevonia products since.  </li>
            <li> but I find too heavy for day wear.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and it worked well for few days</li>
            <li> but I find it too heavy and pore blocking.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I just got a bad or old batch, but this smelled sour when I received it.</li>
            <li> I have been coming to Amazon to find sources of the product since January when the my usual source went out of business.  </li>
            <li> Usually the 1.7oz jar lasts me around 60 days when using it twice a day.</li>
            <li> He has moderate to severe rosacea and is on a medicated cream that dries his face out badly.</li>
            <li> I have horrible rosacia, and this product is very calming.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately after purchasing the concentrated serum, I had to stop using this as it is a flare for my peri-oral dermatitis now.</li>
            <li> Sad, this worked well.</li>
            <li> my wife loves this cream for her facials,helps reduce redness,especially in cold weather conditions,recommend this cream for anyone with rosacea</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.  </li>
            <li> Hated this creme for years.</li>

            <li> Very gentle and light for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this line where I get my occasional facials and it helps with the redness some people get - I like it but it does not have any appreciable sunscreen so I have to add sunscreen because I live in Arizona.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and calm.</li>
            <li> I love the Pevonia line.  I was introduced to this product at a spa a few years ago and have used nothing but Pevonia products since.  I give this product and all Pevonia poducts five stars.</li>
            <li> For a rosacea cream, this cream definitely doesn&#x27;t give me sufficient moisturizing. For the price, I expected more of this cream. I have better experiences with less expensive creams such as anti redness creams from biodermal. I like the feel and smell of the cream, I like how it feels on my skin, it just doesn&#x27;t moisturize enough and my red patches have started to return.</li>
            <li> Reasonable delivery and exactly as advertised, unopened new product. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is great for my rosacea. Unfortunately after purchasing the concentrated serum, I had to stop using this as it is a flare for my peri-oral dermatitis now. I had used for over a year, but after the serum it irritates my skin.  Sad, this worked well. I have very sensitive skin, and once something flares it, I cannot use it anymore.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just got a bad or old batch, but this smelled sour when I received it. Returned!</li>
            <li> If you use the RS2 Concentrate first and then apply the RS2 Care Cream, it is does help those with Rosacea.</li>
            <li> Very good.  Hated this creme for years.</li>
            <li> The Pevonia RS2 line of products including the gentle care cream are excellent for sensitive skin.  My face has never felt better!</li>
            <li> This is the last step in my nightly routine. Moisturizes and smells good, don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve noticed that some other products that work have a funny smell. I do believe this helps control the redness.</li>
            <li> I have been using Pevonia Gentle Care Cream for a couple of years. I have paid almost twice at retail as I paid on Amazon.  Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I have used this product specialty line before. The cream I bought did decrease some of my facial redness but I have used other products with noticeable results ( less redness) and more moisture. I think that using the complete RS2 may provide improved results. Mary C.</li>
            <li> my wife loves this cream for her facials,helps reduce redness,especially in cold weather conditions,recommend this cream for anyone with rosacea</li>
            <li> I use this product as part of a skin care system for my Rosacea.  It helps with texture and redness of my skin condition.  Due to the cost it is no longer carried in shops locally and getting hard to find. I have been coming to Amazon to find sources of the product since January when the my usual source went out of business.  This is a great night time moisturizer but I find too heavy for day wear.</li>
            <li> Great face cream for my rosacea!  Bought for me and my wife stole it and now buys for herself too as it doesn&#x27;t cause her to break out.</li>
            <li> I have been using this RS2 Care Cream for years and I love it!!!  I have tried other creams recommended to me but always come back to this.  It really helps with my rosacea (even though I have a light case of it) and keeps my skin very comfortable. It is a light, cream, not heavy at all, and I love the rosy scent. I plan to use this until product forever.</li>
            <li> I use this product in conjunction with the lotion, cleanser, &amp; toner.  The rosacea line by Pevonia is the only product line that gives me relief from the burning, itching, &amp; redness of my skin from my rosacea.  I would definitely recommend these products if you are looking for relief!</li>
            <li> Categorically THE BEST face cream have found for my sensitive skin.  I love this product and if I have to give up coffee for 3 months to get a jar then so be it.  I just discovered Pevonia last month and I&#x27;m a fan for life now.  I noticed a difference in the appearance of my skin after the first application.  The more you use it the better the results!  I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Great price for this product. I don&#x27;t believe it really helps relieve any of the redness but it does make your face feel moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have used this cream everyday for the last year. I have seen a very noticeable improvement in my coloring. The rosacea is significantly less pronounced and my face stays hydrated all day. I highly recommend this product. Usually the 1.7oz jar lasts me around 60 days when using it twice a day.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and occasional outbreaks of roseacea.  This is the best moisturizer I have found. It works great for both.</li>
            <li> Been using Pevonia products for 20 years. Any time a try something else, for say savings or convenience, I regret it and return to the best match for my skin. Natural ingredients makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It&#x27;s worked well for me for several years now.&lt;br /&gt;Thankyou</li>
            <li> A nice cream for sensitive skin</li>

            <li> Very gentle. Gets rid of the redness, itching, and bumps of my mild rosacea. Love the light rose scent.</li>
            <li> Great price, arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> My favorite spa line yet.&lt;br /&gt;Lovely way to pamper my skin at home.&lt;br /&gt;Ask your massage therapist about body wraps, they are amazing too</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by an aesthetician at a spa in Scottsdale AZ as I have a little mild rosacea on my face.  I have used it for 5 months now and love it. It feels so calming when I put it on my skin.  Leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I seem to be allergic to many skin creams (and shampoos and conditioners).  This cream is OK, but it sort of sits on the surface.  It&#x27;s not very creamy, so my face still feels dry.  I don&#x27;t hate it, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.  I think I will try one of their other creams.</li>
            <li> My &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; moisturizer. I have a little bit of rosacea plus combination skin. This cream is the most soothing I have found so far. My skin drinks it up with no residue or greasiness. In the morning I put on this cream and then a chilled eye mask, and then any puffiness and redness is gone. Helps makeup go on nicely too.</li>
            <li> It is a good cream, but I expected something better. It does not hydrate enough. The smell is very light and pleasant.</li>
            <li> He has moderate to severe rosacea and is on a medicated cream that dries his face out badly. This cream soothes his skin and eases the redness.  He loves it an he smells so good!</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and it worked well for few days and I was very happy! My skin was so better, the rosacea was almost gone. But for the last 7 days it has promoted a minimal improvement. I barely can say if is doing anything besides hydrating my skin. My skin is back as was before, red, with pink pellets. And no, I&#x27;m not doing anything different or eating anything different.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try another product next time (cheaper as well).</li>
            <li> Great &amp; lightweight enough for summer use.</li>
            <li> Excellent all round.  Delivery was prompt and the product was a very good price indeed.  I shall certainly be making further purchases from this company.</li>
            <li> This product works with the cleanser and gentle lotion&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend all for skin with rosacea problems.&lt;br /&gt;Great  price.</li>
            <li> Pevonia Gentle Care Cream has given new life to my skin.  It has diminished the wrinkles on my face and It has calmed the effects of rosea,  I have had compliments on my skin and people say I look younger.  I have been using this cream for six months and do not intend to go back to using Neutrogena.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this cream to any of my friends for all the reasons I have mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;I am a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Great price always arrives on time and been using it for years</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, does its job as promised.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my massage therapist. It works better than expected for my Rosacea &amp; oily but peeling facial skin. I have tried several other products, even some suggested by the dermatologist, and Pervonia RS2 cream is by far the best.</li>
            <li> This is the only moisturizer that is both thick enough to last the whole day and removes redness from my face. I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the RS2 line for 10 years because I have dermatitis with red blotches, not rosacea but this works great! I had occasionally tried a new to market less expensive product. I always went back to Pevonia and will never leave again!  I am 55 yrs old and this product is so gentle, light, and nourishing that I get many compliments on my skin. Well worth the money as it lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Wholeheartedly recommend it to everyone. Helps to make my face look healthier.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this was a light cream but I find it too heavy and pore blocking.  Would not order again -</li>
