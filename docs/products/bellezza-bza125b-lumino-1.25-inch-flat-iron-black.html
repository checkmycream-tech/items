            <li>I would recommend this product to parents with teens who don&#x27;t want to shell out a lot money for something that can easily break if mishandled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I do like the heating light which is on the grip itself.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this.</li>
            <li>but it helps if you need a good curling iron to help you make it to your next appointment.</li>
            <li>: Cheap, Fast delivery, Works&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>It worked great without damaging even with everyday use.</li>
            <li>Still...was well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this curling iron to anyone who is looking for a curling iron with good heat, however it does not give you the direct heat like the beauty salons that you will need with natural hair</li>
            <li>BZA-125B one day before the expected delivery (which is nice).</li>
            <li>is just as hot.</li>
            <li>it gets really hot.</li>
            <li>Saw this in the mall for a much higher price.</li>
            <li>I started using it the first time I got it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need so much heat</li>
            <li>She thinks it doesn&#x27;t heat as much as hers</li>
            <li>I came home to see how much it really sells for bc</li>
            <li>I have straight hair already</li>
            <li>My hair looks smoother than before and it was so fast.</li>
            <li>I have an original of the same model.</li>
            <li>The second thing to annoy me a bit is that my original Bellezza has a temperature dial with all the degrees visible.</li>
            <li>It does not get hot enough and it certainly does not curl my hair and make it straight as a board.</li>
            <li>First off, the one I ordered only goes up to 410 degrees as oppose to the \\&quot;450</li>
            <li>Finally I looked on amazon and found this one (which is the exact one I brought from the beautician).</li>
            <li>This is the exact same one, for a fraction of what they sell it for in the mall.</li>
            <li>My first Bellezza was almost double the price I got for this one.</li>
            <li>but my original goes up to 460 degrees and slightly over.</li>
            <li>and I am 57 years old,</li>
            <li>Only defect for me is  wishing that it would get my hair bone straight</li>
            <li>but it does the job of getting it straight enough to flow in the wind as one would say.</li>
            <li>I am natural, I do not do my own hair because it is really thick, but this curling iron helps me to maintain the straightness until my next appointment.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money spent!</li>
            <li>The flat iron heats up to about 450 degrees, which is about the right temperature to tame my course hair.</li>
            <li>I have thick and long natural hair, so I needed a flat iron that could press my hair quickly.</li>

            <li> I just received my Bellezza BZA-125B one day before the expected delivery (which is nice). I have an original of the same model. They are very different. First off, the one I ordered only goes up to 410 degrees as oppose to the \\&quot;450 degrees\\&quot; which is what they are advertising. I don&#x27;t need so much heat but my original goes up to 460 degrees and slightly over. However, I used the one I ordered and got great results. Nice, shiny, straight hair. I did have to crank to the max at 410 degrees to achieve this result. The second thing to annoy me a bit is that my original Bellezza has a temperature dial with all the degrees visible. This one just comes with a dial that shows the lowest setting 140 degrees and the highest setting 410 degrees. Also, the little box in between the irons is not there. You simply have the on/off switch and heating dial. I do like the heating light which is on the grip itself. However, your hand might be covering that. I would recommend this product to parents with teens who don&#x27;t want to shell out a lot money for something that can easily break if mishandled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: Cheap, Fast delivery, Works&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: False advertising, Unlabeled heat degree settings</li>
            <li> Bought for my mother as a xmas gift because she loves mine! Had mine for 3 years this Xmas and it still works like a charm! Only paid $40. AMAZING!</li>
            <li> My daughter bought one of these at the mall and paid almost $100. This one I bought at a bargain price. She thinks it doesn&#x27;t heat as much as hers but I have used both hers and mine and mine is just as hot. The only complaint is there is not auto off. Make sure you turn it off...it gets really hot. And don&#x27;t use it on wet hair...it will destroy your hair. Other than that I straighten and curl my long hair and I am 57 years old, yeah!</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a gift for my daughter; she loves it! This a good product; use by professionals...I recommend it!</li>
            <li> still works great, had it for months and works like the one i paid $100 + very happy with the flat iron :)</li>
            <li> Six years ago I bought one at the mall for $120...before my Amazon days. It worked great without damaging even with everyday use. My only regret is not registering the lifetime warranty. Still...was well worth the money. I was amazed at the price I paid for the replacement. Thank you amazon!!!</li>
            <li> A friend suggested that I purchase the Bellezza Lumino flat iron so I ordered it from Amazon because Amazon offered the best price.  I have thick and long natural hair, so I needed a flat iron that could press my hair quickly. The Bellezza Lumino works! The flat iron heats up to about 450 degrees, which is about the right temperature to tame my course hair. It gives my hair a silky and shiny look, and I do not smell “burnt” hair when I’m done.  For safety reason, I would have preferred the “on” and “off” switch to be located on the side of the flat iron, instead of the bottom ceramic plate. For $35, it was a great deal and Amazon delivered it very quickly.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this. I was stopped by those annoying people in the mall and figured, what the heck - do my hair. It looked AMAZING, so of course I bought one.     Once I got it home and tried it out I immediately realized I&#x27;d been scammed. This straightener does not work. It does not get hot enough and it certainly does not curl my hair and make it straight as a board. I had a Chi before and expected it to work as well, if not better, but it didn&#x27;t even come close. My $30 Revlon works better than this thing. Do not buy this. Don&#x27;t buy Chi&#x27;s either though - they break after a year.    Save your money and do some research before buying a straightener.</li>
            <li> We bought the flat iron about a year &amp; half ago my daughter dropped it &amp; one of the ceramic plates broke:( I am having a terrible time finding any info on how to follow through with the lifetime guarantee info??</li>
            <li> I love my bellezza. Its works for me since I have \\&quot;bi-racial\\&quot; type hair. Only defect for me is  wishing that it would get my hair bone straight but it does the job of getting it straight enough to flow in the wind as one would say. This product is perfect if your looking for a good to great type flat iron.</li>
            <li> THIS FLAT IRON IS THE GOD HONEST TRUTH!!! PEACE OUT DRY COARSE HAIR &amp; HELLOOO SILKY STRAIT NO SPLIT ENDED HAIR!! 5 stars :-)</li>
            <li> I brought this curling iron through a beautician about 3 years ago. When it went dead I had no idea what to do. All other curling irons I tried did not give me the heat I needed for my hair. Finally I looked on amazon and found this one (which is the exact one I brought from the beautician). I love this curling iron. I am natural, I do not do my own hair because it is really thick, but this curling iron helps me to maintain the straightness until my next appointment. I would recommend this curling iron to anyone who is looking for a curling iron with good heat, however it does not give you the direct heat like the beauty salons that you will need with natural hair but it helps if you need a good curling iron to help you make it to your next appointment.</li>
            <li> I got this about a month ago. So far so good. Effect on hair is not too different from my $16 revlon flat iron from walmart though.</li>
            <li> Saw this in the mall for a much higher price. This is the exact same one, for a fraction of what they sell it for in the mall. Same results.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product and I would recommend this to anyone. The price is what sold me! My first Bellezza was almost double the price I got for this one. Well worth the money spent!</li>
            <li> This product is very great I started using it the first time I got it. It has great tempature on it and makes my hair very shiny without oil or anything and gets rid of my split ends. I love this product!</li>
            <li> I bought one on Groupon and it fell on carpet and broke! Company does not have a website. It says under construction. I say Going Under.</li>
            <li> Today I bought this flat iron from tj maxx for $20. I came home to see how much it really sells for bc the msrp on the box was $275! I washed my hair when I got home and tested the product. I have straight hair already but I use a flat iron to tame down the fuzzy dry hair. I&#x27;ve tried sooo many irons out, but I swear, this one is amazing! Not only was I afraid it was gonna be junk but its the best 20 bucks I spent in a while. My hair looks smoother than before and it was so fast. I also tries it on my 5 year old daughters curly hair and it worked great. I&#x27;m super impressed and happy with my purchse. If I had the $$ I would spend the 275 to get this...luckily I got a good quality product for A LOT cheaper!</li>
            <li> Great Price, great iron</li>
            <li> Works great gives beauty salon quality results! With many girls in the family running to the salon is not always an option. This flat iron works wonders!</li>
