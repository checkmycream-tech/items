            <li>I really like biolage products and this one is great!</li>
            <li>I use it along with  Exquisite Oil shampoo and my hair is ever so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I love how Biologe products transformed my hair.</li>
            <li>The performance was amazing how can something so light work so well for moisture?</li>
            <li>It was okay</li>
            <li>am very happy with the moisturizing properties, the smell, and the lasting effects this creme conditioner gives my hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li>The scent is beautiful not too overwhelming, like so sweet, just right.</li>
            <li>but when it was completely dry, my hair couldn&#x27;t be any more shinier and happy!</li>
            <li>After trying many many many very expensive products i can say that Biolage Exquisite Oil is the best, i used it with the oil</li>
            <li>This is a very good conditioner for dry hair.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many products but this is the best one I have tried for straight, fine, dry, damaged hair.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>Rich in emollient.  </li>
            <li>I have long hair and feel it has also helped to make my color look great and</li>
            <li>: I bought and would recommend the pumps that dispense the product from bottle as it&#x27;s quite rich and would become a pain to tap out as it got lower with use.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my &amp;#34;combination&amp;#34; (some straight some wavy some slightly curly) hair type.</li>
            <li>Thank you Biolage for your amazing products and hair that I love letting down and showing off!!!</li>
            <li>My hair not only is healthy and shiny</li>
            <li>Being on a Florida vacation, the sun and surf can really take a toll on your hair.  </li>
            <li>I also noticed I don&#x27;t have to use nearly as much leave-in conditioner/treatment after using this.</li>
            <li>my long tresses look smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I went from not being able to grow my hair past the middle of my back, to long healthy shiny hair that reaches my butt :)</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how I would like this conditioner, but I wanted to try something a little bit thicker than normal to protect my hair from drying out in the winter.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and most conditioners are too heavy but the lighter conditioners are not deep enough.  </li>
            <li>My new holy grail conditioner.</li>
            <li>It felt so soft too.</li>
            <li>Normally, I use a argon oil mousse when I dry my hair and when I remembered their was oil in my conditioner, I worried that my hair would become too greasy.</li>
            <li>Thick and rich.. not watery at all.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair feeling soft and manageable with out being stripped of natural oil or that product weighted down feeling.</li>

            <li> I bought this because i was in between colorings and my curly/ wavy hair was looking really dry.  </li>
            <li> My scalp can also become dry and itchy in between washings when the seasons are changing</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair, so the first thing I noticed was that a small amount of this conditioner goes a long way!</li>
            <li> hair is very very dry, I even use it on my one son&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t end up with the tangles I get with other salon type products.</li>
            <li> Like I said, this product is thick and I probably would only use this seasonally.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> It is VERY thick, and not much is needed on your hair.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is a bit too thick and heavy for me.  </li>
            <li> Hard to wash out and sometimes leaves you looking greasy.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner is so concentrated and thick, I continuously have to add water to the bottle to loosen it up a bit.</li>
            <li> It is REALLY thick.</li>
            <li> so I thought getting this before I noticed any ill effects would be prudent.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Yet, tried it and not too bad</li>
            <li> I promise you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Growing up I had horrible frizzy unmanageable hair which I hated.</li>
            <li> This is not Biolage, and it smells disgusting...</li>

            <li> Thick and rich.. not watery at all.  Rich in emollient.  Stays with your hair and keeps hair supple.</li>
            <li> A great find for conditioning hair. It&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> This is not Biolage, and it smells disgusting... I can&#x27;t believe I wasted my money. I read the reviews and during that time there was no warning. Don&#x27;t buy this guys I promise you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my &amp;#34;combination&amp;#34; (some straight some wavy some slightly curly) hair type. Leaves my hair feeling soft and manageable with out being stripped of natural oil or that product weighted down feeling. This conditioner is so concentrated and thick, I continuously have to add water to the bottle to loosen it up a bit. But, I still like it a lot.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is a bit too thick and heavy for me.  Hard to wash out and sometimes leaves you looking greasy.  I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love how Biologe products transformed my hair. Growing up I had horrible frizzy unmanageable hair which I hated. Two years ago a friend told me about Biolage and I have been using their line since. My hair not only is healthy and shiny it grew superblong too!!! I went from not being able to grow my hair past the middle of my back, to long healthy shiny hair that reaches my butt :) I always get compliments about how beautiful my hair is now. Who would&#x27;ve known that all I needed to do was switch shampoo. Thank you Biolage for your amazing products and hair that I love letting down and showing off!!!</li>
            <li> I do believe I received a counterfeit bottle of this conditioner. The label looks like photo copy and is not the same as the bottle I purchased from a salon.</li>
            <li> It is REALLY thick. It is a challenge to get it out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products but this is the best one I have tried for straight, fine, dry, damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Can you say ahmaaaazing? The scent is beautiful not too overwhelming, like so sweet, just right. The performance was amazing how can something so light work so well for moisture? I bought mine at a salon(Boston Store). My new holy grail conditioner. xxx</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how I would like this conditioner, but I wanted to try something a little bit thicker than normal to protect my hair from drying out in the winter. I really enjoy this product. It is VERY thick, and not much is needed on your hair. Normally, I use a argon oil mousse when I dry my hair and when I remembered their was oil in my conditioner, I worried that my hair would become too greasy. It definitely felt different when I started drying it. but when it was completely dry, my hair couldn&#x27;t be any more shinier and happy! It felt so soft too. Like I said, this product is thick and I probably would only use this seasonally. Same matrix quality though</li>
            <li> cap was cracked with conditioner leaking out</li>
            <li> I really like biolage products and this one is great! It smells amazing and works well on my color treated hair</li>
            <li> After trying many many many very expensive products i can say that Biolage Exquisite Oil is the best, i used it with the oil and it saved my hair.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very very dry, I even use it on my one son&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Being on a Florida vacation, the sun and surf can really take a toll on your hair.  This conditioner was perfect!  I have fine hair and most conditioners are too heavy but the lighter conditioners are not deep enough.  This one is the perfect mix!!</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair, so the first thing I noticed was that a small amount of this conditioner goes a long way! As I applied it, I noticed how silky it felt. It detangles and smooths hair at the same time. I also noticed I don&#x27;t have to use nearly as much leave-in conditioner/treatment after using this. Great product my stylist and I both recommend!</li>
            <li> It was okay but I didn&#x27;t order the weightless conditioner oil. Yet, tried it and not too bad</li>
            <li> I bought this because i was in between colorings and my curly/ wavy hair was looking really dry.  My scalp can also become dry and itchy in between washings when the seasons are changing so I thought getting this before I noticed any ill effects would be prudent.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with the moisturizing properties, the smell, and the lasting effects this creme conditioner gives my hair and scalp.  I have long hair and feel it has also helped to make my color look great and my long tresses look smooth and shiny.  I will buy probably twice or 3 times a year depending on the seasons.&lt;br /&gt;I thought the Seller also was prompt with delivery and everything arrived in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;Note: I bought and would recommend the pumps that dispense the product from bottle as it&#x27;s quite rich and would become a pain to tap out as it got lower with use.</li>
            <li> This is a very good conditioner for dry hair.  I use it along with  Exquisite Oil shampoo and my hair is ever so soft and shiny. I don&#x27;t end up with the tangles I get with other salon type products.</li>
