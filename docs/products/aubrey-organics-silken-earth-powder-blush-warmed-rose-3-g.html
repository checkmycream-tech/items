            <li>Going all organic makeup was a great decision for me.</li>
            <li>It looked great on.</li>
            <li>Aubrey products are always a good choice.</li>
            <li>This blush is now my favorite powder!</li>
            <li>The amount of blush was perfect and the dispenser was exactly what we needed.</li>
            <li>Nice color.</li>
            <li>ROSE - Usage and Coverage</li>
            <li>Very nice blush with a beautiful, natural color.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin this is perfect for you!</li>
            <li>Perfect for any occasion, while feeling natural and healthy on my skin.</li>
            <li>Love this blush.  </li>
            <li>Totally safe on EWG database.  </li>
            <li>really love that Aubrey is organic and chemical-free.</li>
            <li>Love this shade by Aubrey, with the quality top of the line in the organic choices.  </li>
            <li>Nice color, and really smart design of the container.</li>
            <li>: I can&#x27;t give an accurate description as I&#x27;m still using it</li>
            <li>I was a bit worried as others have found the color to be unsuitable, but it really looked nice on.</li>
            <li>Aubrey is my primary blush source.</li>
            <li>I am fair skin, blonde hair and light eyes</li>
            <li>I love this new blush, very true to color and lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lovely, but certainly for darker skin tones.</li>
            <li>This blush is great because it&#x27;s organic, but it&#x27;s a little bit too pigmented.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and the container is completely reusable which is a nice touch,  from an environmentally conscious standpoint.  </li>
            <li>Really love that this is a natural product and</li>
            <li>Not to mention this is about $8 cheaper than Bare Minerals :-)  </li>
            <li>And I looked so pretty in the shade.  </li>
            <li>Also, the color of the &amp;#34;warm rose&amp;#34; blush is exactly as pictured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it really makes your skin glow.</li>
            <li>, then it stays on the whole day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This formulation is VERY concentrated.  </li>
            <li>This blusher goes on smoothly and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>The mineral powder is light and hasn&#x27;t broken me out, so that&#x27;s good (though I don&#x27;t break out in my upper cheeks anyway).</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned (but not ghostly white) and this was so highly pigmented, I looked flushed after applying only a tiny amount.</li>
            <li>The good thing is, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>while the color is good, one must be careful putting it on as it can go on just a  tad too dark.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>so if you re going for the natural look.......</li>
            <li>I usually buy Bare Minerals but wanted to try Aubrey Organics make up because I love the skin care line.</li>
            <li>Very sheer powder, can barely tell you&#x27;re wearing anything</li>

            <li> Very sheer powder, can barely tell you&#x27;re wearing anything</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a powder so hard to get the right amount on the brush.</li>
            <li> : I am a 22 year old asian woman with medium to pale skin tone, oily combination with not-so-clear skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only need to turn it over once (as the container has a divider in it with holes, so only a small amount of powder comes out at a time)</li>
            <li> Since this blush is powder it is really hard not to take too much, but the new container with little holes gives you just a little depending how hard you press on it with the brush.</li>
            <li> You only need a very little.</li>
            <li> for the length of time it stays on, unless you do something extreme (like swim...</li>

            <li> I am caucasian with slightly olive tone skin.</li>
            <li> so I was a little worried, but it looks matte upon applying.</li>

            <li> I have been using this blusher for a few years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always difficult to find natural makeup that doesn&#x27;t harm you but still manages to be efficient.</li>
            <li> Little goes a long way,,,good since this is expensive.</li>
            <li> (and I don&#x27;t use it everyday), but 3 grams of blush is a lot!</li>
            <li> But it past muster with ewe.org/skindeep ratings.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Little goes a long way,,,good since this is expensive. Nice color.</li>
            <li> Like it. Nice color, and really smart design of the container. Since this blush is powder it is really hard not to take too much, but the new container with little holes gives you just a little depending how hard you press on it with the brush. Like it.</li>
            <li> I usually buy Bare Minerals but wanted to try Aubrey Organics make up because I love the skin care line. Not to mention this is about $8 cheaper than Bare Minerals :-)  It looks shimmery in the container so I was a little worried, but it looks matte upon applying. I only have to apply once a day and the color goes on evenly.I am fair skin, blonde hair and light eyes and this color is great for me. I will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Definitely darker than described! WOW! I am fair skinned (but not ghostly white) and this was so highly pigmented, I looked flushed after applying only a tiny amount. It&#x27;s lovely, but certainly for darker skin tones. The description is a bit misleading in this regard.</li>
            <li> Very sheer powder, can barely tell you&#x27;re wearing anything so if you re going for the natural look.......</li>
            <li> I have been using this blusher for a few years. I am caucasian with slightly olive tone skin. This blusher goes on smoothly and lasts a long time. You only need a very little.</li>
            <li> I love this new blush, very true to color and lasts throughout the day. Going all organic makeup was a great decision for me.</li>
            <li> Love this blush.  Totally safe on EWG database.  And I looked so pretty in the shade.  People complimented me in my glow.</li>
            <li> I like this product, but personally I needed to mix in some arrowroot powder to lighten a bit. Aubrey products are always a good choice.</li>
            <li> Background (since each individual is different, I find that some background information might help some readers relate): I am a 22 year old asian woman with medium to pale skin tone, oily combination with not-so-clear skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARM ROSE - Usage and Coverage: I can&#x27;t give an accurate description as I&#x27;m still using it (and I don&#x27;t use it everyday), but 3 grams of blush is a lot! I only need to turn it over once (as the container has a divider in it with holes, so only a small amount of powder comes out at a time) and my brush can pick up enough. That being said, I like that it&#x27;s pretty concentrated because that means a little goes a long way! There is also a tinge of sparkle in the powder so it really makes your skin glow. The mineral powder is light and hasn&#x27;t broken me out, so that&#x27;s good (though I don&#x27;t break out in my upper cheeks anyway). Also, the color of the &amp;#34;warm rose&amp;#34; blush is exactly as pictured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the length of time it stays on, unless you do something extreme (like swim... but what do you expect from swimming with mineral powder on?), then it stays on the whole day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love that Aubrey is organic and chemical-free. It&#x27;s always difficult to find natural makeup that doesn&#x27;t harm you but still manages to be efficient. This blush is now my favorite powder! I hope they continue to sell this because 5/5 I WOULD TOTALLY BUY THIS AGAIN.</li>
            <li> We needed a red blush for our daughters dance performance. I definitely didn&#x27;t want to put a bunch of chemicals on her face. This was an excellent find. The amount of blush was perfect and the dispenser was exactly what we needed. It looked great on. I was a bit worried as others have found the color to be unsuitable, but it really looked nice on.</li>
            <li> Very nice blush with a beautiful, natural color.  Perfect for any occasion, while feeling natural and healthy on my skin.</li>
            <li> This formulation is VERY concentrated.  It seems like it&#x27;ll last forever due to the small amount needed.  I like the color on my very fair skin as well.</li>
            <li> Love this shade by Aubrey, with the quality top of the line in the organic choices.  Goes on smoothly and the container is completely reusable which is a nice touch,  from an environmentally conscious standpoint.  Aubrey is my primary blush source.</li>
            <li> Really love that this is a natural product and while the color is good, one must be careful putting it on as it can go on just a  tad too dark. But I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This blush is great because it&#x27;s organic, but it&#x27;s a little bit too pigmented. The good thing is, a little bit goes a long way. If you have sensitive skin this is perfect for you!</li>
            <li> I try to do a lot of organic body products.  This is a very good blush.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a powder so hard to get the right amount on the brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s colour is a little too concentrated.. i blend it with my powder,  But it past muster with ewe.org/skindeep ratings. Support them!</li>
