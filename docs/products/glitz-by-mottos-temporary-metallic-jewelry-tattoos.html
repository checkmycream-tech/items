            <li>and I had a lot of fun trying them out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun for me and my daughters to put some together</li>
            <li>she had such a fun time putting them on..really nice tattoos</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re really fun and shiny.</li>
            <li>Let me say that my niece and I have been having hours of fun.</li>
            <li>do have two things worth noting.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I had fun playing with these</li>
            <li>It looks beautiful and high quality from other brands.</li>
            <li>Shipped quick and We will definitely need more soon.  </li>
            <li>They have so much fun with them and they stay on very well!</li>
            <li>they where so pretty.</li>
            <li>A bit of advice: if you have somewhat hairy arms and plan to apply on your arms, shave them first.</li>
            <li>My mom almost thought it was real when she saw it!</li>
            <li>So many different ones to choose from.</li>
            <li>The first is that one of the tattoos was not flipped.</li>
            <li>I will order more in the future!</li>
            <li>Theyhave such beautiful colors and just apply with a wet cloth.</li>
            <li>Lasts 3-5 days or more with regular bathing/showering.</li>
            <li>Great product!!&lt;br /&gt;Lasts for 2+ weeks and fades slowly.</li>
            <li>The tats have lasted through 3 showers, 2 ultra hot and humid days where I was sweating, 2 nights of sleep, and at work.</li>
            <li>I did not count how many tats there were total, but I would estimate around 40 give or take.</li>
            <li>Really pretty.</li>
            <li>I put it in very conspicuous place and everyone complimented me on it!</li>
            <li>For me personally, this product is only good for one night out.</li>
            <li>The many designs are fun for everyone, theres really endless possibilities</li>
            <li>and they last a long time the colors are bright and vibrate</li>
            <li>The next day it didn&#x27;t come off in the shower, so I had to use rubbing alcohol, after which it came off easily</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a huge jewlery person,  because I usually get caught on things, however with these I don&#x27;t get caught, and they&#x27;re super cute!!!</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, long lasting, but still comes off pretty easily if you want or need it to.  </li>
            <li>I got these tattoos a few days, and I am soooo in love!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easy to apply and stay on for several days (with minimal touching or interference).</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I will note that the spot is really important -- one that I placed on my wrist wore out really fast, presumably because I move it ALL the time, whereas one on my upper arm lasted much longer.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast too.</li>
            <li>The designs are what any girl or woman wants.</li>
            <li>so you&#x27;re not committing to a real tattoo.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you don&#x27;t move it around when you&#x27;re wetting it because it can cause it to bunch, like any other temp tattoo.  </li>
            <li>but they have more selection in design from other products I have seen.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve put one on already and it was simple and after a few days it still looks pretty good.</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend if you&#x27;re looking for a fun, temporary tattoo!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to try the other ones and get a bit fun with them.</li>
            <li>I thought with it being a foil-type tattoo that it would be fragile and break easily, but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>It was really easy to apply (maybe 15 seconds with a wet towel over it?).</li>
            <li>I opted for the Colors collection and doing a quick count, I received approximately 65 different types of temporary tattoos for around $12.</li>
            <li>I particularly like the ones that resemble gold or silver necklaces.</li>
            <li>They are high quality and not like the temporary tats you used as a kid that you got at birthday parties or the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to cut out the ones you want without ruining other ones.</li>
            <li>It was fun to match with different outfits.  </li>
            <li>Received my tattoos and was very surprised with the quality of the colors.</li>
            <li>My little 6 year old and 15 year old love them.  </li>
            <li>The instructions are easy to follow - clean and dry skin, place the tattoo where you need it, and then wet the back.</li>
            <li>I first used one of these tattoos for a family barbecue where I was moving between sitting in the sun and swimming in the pool all day long... and by the end of the day it was just as shiny and vibrant as when I had put it on.</li>
            <li>They held up for a few days and were easy to remove with rubbing alcohol or makeup remover.</li>
            <li>They stay on very well and last until I take them off.</li>
            <li>they do not stick, it is almost like they are to old....</li>
            <li>The other designs include: a few birds, elephants, words like love and fearless, infinity symbols, and other cool tribal and geometric inspired shapes.</li>
            <li>Except for a couple little dings on the bracelet, they are as nice and pristine as when I put them on a few days</li>
            <li>My mom loved trying on the smaller ones, and my sister and I are pretty crazy for the big bracelets and hearts.</li>

            <li> do have two things worth noting.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I had fun playing with these</li>
            <li> It looks beautiful and high quality from other brands.</li>
            <li> Shipped quick and We will definitely need more soon.  </li>
            <li> They have so much fun with them and they stay on very well!</li>
            <li> they where so pretty.</li>
            <li> A bit of advice: if you have somewhat hairy arms and plan to apply on your arms, shave them first.</li>
            <li> My mom almost thought it was real when she saw it!</li>
            <li> So many different ones to choose from.</li>
            <li> The first is that one of the tattoos was not flipped.</li>
            <li> I will order more in the future!</li>
            <li> Theyhave such beautiful colors and just apply with a wet cloth.</li>
            <li> Lasts 3-5 days or more with regular bathing/showering.</li>
            <li> Great product!!&lt;br /&gt;Lasts for 2+ weeks and fades slowly.</li>
            <li> The tats have lasted through 3 showers, 2 ultra hot and humid days where I was sweating, 2 nights of sleep, and at work.</li>
            <li> I did not count how many tats there were total, but I would estimate around 40 give or take.</li>
            <li> Really pretty.</li>
            <li> I put it in very conspicuous place and everyone complimented me on it!</li>
            <li> For me personally, this product is only good for one night out.</li>
            <li> The many designs are fun for everyone, theres really endless possibilities</li>
            <li> and they last a long time the colors are bright and vibrate</li>
            <li> The next day it didn&#x27;t come off in the shower, so I had to use rubbing alcohol, after which it came off easily</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge jewlery person,  because I usually get caught on things, however with these I don&#x27;t get caught, and they&#x27;re super cute!!!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, long lasting, but still comes off pretty easily if you want or need it to.  </li>
            <li> I got these tattoos a few days, and I am soooo in love!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re easy to apply and stay on for several days (with minimal touching or interference).</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I will note that the spot is really important -- one that I placed on my wrist wore out really fast, presumably because I move it ALL the time, whereas one on my upper arm lasted much longer.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast too.</li>
            <li> The designs are what any girl or woman wants.</li>
            <li> so you&#x27;re not committing to a real tattoo.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you don&#x27;t move it around when you&#x27;re wetting it because it can cause it to bunch, like any other temp tattoo.  </li>
            <li> but they have more selection in design from other products I have seen.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve put one on already and it was simple and after a few days it still looks pretty good.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend if you&#x27;re looking for a fun, temporary tattoo!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to try the other ones and get a bit fun with them.</li>
            <li> I thought with it being a foil-type tattoo that it would be fragile and break easily, but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> It was really easy to apply (maybe 15 seconds with a wet towel over it?).</li>
            <li> I opted for the Colors collection and doing a quick count, I received approximately 65 different types of temporary tattoos for around $12.</li>
            <li> I particularly like the ones that resemble gold or silver necklaces.</li>
            <li> They are high quality and not like the temporary tats you used as a kid that you got at birthday parties or the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to cut out the ones you want without ruining other ones.</li>
            <li> It was fun to match with different outfits.  </li>
            <li> Received my tattoos and was very surprised with the quality of the colors.</li>
            <li> My little 6 year old and 15 year old love them.  </li>
            <li> The instructions are easy to follow - clean and dry skin, place the tattoo where you need it, and then wet the back.</li>
            <li> I first used one of these tattoos for a family barbecue where I was moving between sitting in the sun and swimming in the pool all day long... and by the end of the day it was just as shiny and vibrant as when I had put it on.</li>
            <li> They held up for a few days and were easy to remove with rubbing alcohol or makeup remover.</li>
            <li> They stay on very well and last until I take them off.</li>
            <li> they do not stick, it is almost like they are to old....</li>
            <li> The other designs include: a few birds, elephants, words like love and fearless, infinity symbols, and other cool tribal and geometric inspired shapes.</li>
            <li> Except for a couple little dings on the bracelet, they are as nice and pristine as when I put them on a few days</li>
            <li> My mom loved trying on the smaller ones, and my sister and I are pretty crazy for the big bracelets and hearts.</li>
            <li> I would have reviewed them earlier, but I wanted to see how long the tats would last until they got too grungy.</li>
            <li> If you are putting these tattoos on your fingers, they won&#x27;t last long if you keep washing your hands.</li>
            <li> Last a long time too</li>
            <li> If you really, really, want to take them off, you&#x27;ll need rubbing alcohol and scrub hard.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised, got quite a few compliments on them too.</li>
            <li> I used a wet washcloth and sat it on the back.</li>
            <li> I have purchased other tattoo packs but they didn&#x27;t have the variety of this one, especially for the value.</li>
            <li> The biggest drawback for me was the tattoo only last for a few hours on my skin.</li>
            <li> The application is standard: water and wait a few minutes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it in a few places on my skin but each time it only lasted a few hours before starting to rub off.</li>
            <li> a wet wash cloth will remove it.</li>
            <li> You never really know what will arrive in the mail when you buy online</li>
            <li> I am not much of a tattoo person</li>
            <li> they last a few days too!</li>
            <li> just wish they would&#x27;ve stayed on a little longer.  </li>
            <li> They work just like any temporary tattoo, with a little bit of water, and transfer quite well.</li>
            <li> Had a bit of trouble with some not sticking</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how well they come off</li>
            <li> Well, for a week at least.</li>
            <li> I mean, they do not come off with soap and water, therefore, be prepared to have them on for about 4-6 days.</li>
            <li> and I did not get any weird tan</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love these tattoos.  Had a bit of trouble with some not sticking but once I got them to work they looked great.  recieved a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> Really cute metallic temporary tattoos. Perfect for a quick photoshoot or just for the kids to dress up with now and then. Just make sure you don&#x27;t move it around when you&#x27;re wetting it because it can cause it to bunch, like any other temp tattoo.  Update: they last a few days too! I was pleasantly surprised, got quite a few compliments on them too.</li>
            <li> We love these!!! Super cute and easy to apply. My 8 year old granddaughter thought the tattoos are the best thing since sliced bread!</li>
            <li> I just love the tattoos and I had a lot of fun trying them out. Loved all the designs and the work very well.I was so excited to try these flash tattoos . I open them up and just loved all the designs and I put some on my arm and they where so pretty. The tattoos lasted for a while . loved the tattoos</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these metallic tattoos! It&#x27;s fun for me and my daughters to put some together nd make awesome pieces! They last a good amount of time but are easy to remove with baby oil. Definitely beautiful!</li>
            <li> I bought is as present for my daughter, and she just loves it. Quality is very good and the tattoos keep for several days  depending how often you swim and shower. Would buy them again .</li>
            <li> Tatoos seem pretty good and they arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Love love love these. They stay on very well and last until I take them off. I like how easy it is to change up my style with them!</li>
            <li> These are great! I&#x27;m not a huge jewlery person,  because I usually get caught on things, however with these I don&#x27;t get caught, and they&#x27;re super cute!!!</li>
            <li> I have purchased other tattoo packs but they didn&#x27;t have the variety of this one, especially for the value. The designs are very pretty and I can see myself wearing all of them, which of course I will! The application is standard: water and wait a few minutes and you have a lovely temporary design. A bit of advice: if you have somewhat hairy arms and plan to apply on your arms, shave them first. I love these!</li>
            <li> I really liked the Glitz metallic jewelry tattoos. The packages of tattoos that I have seen in stores do not have any colors in their collection. The Glitz tattoos not only have color but they have more selection in design from other products I have seen.  Very pretty!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Super quick delivery and my daughter and I love them!</li>
            <li> I bought these for a friend, so I don&#x27;t know how good they are; however, I can say that they were well-priced and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> nice product..got this for my grand daughter she had such a fun time putting them on..really nice tattoos</li>
            <li> Those were pretty cool! I got a lot of stares!</li>
            <li> These are great! They&#x27;re really fun and shiny. I&#x27;ve put one on already and it was simple and after a few days it still looks pretty good. It was really easy to apply (maybe 15 seconds with a wet towel over it?). I&#x27;m excited to try the other ones and get a bit fun with them. I&#x27;m not sure how well they come off but I assume it&#x27;s like a regular temp. tattoo. My mom almost thought it was real when she saw it! Would definitely recommend if you&#x27;re looking for a fun, temporary tattoo! I received a discount for providing a review.</li>
            <li> Just received my temporary tattoos today. Let me say that my niece and I have been having hours of fun. We are taking turns applying them to each other and we are having the best of time. Love the selection that I chose. So many different ones to choose from. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> The variety of tattoos that come in one pack is great! The application was very easy, the instructions were very clear. The packaging was efficient. The biggest drawback for me was the tattoo only last for a few hours on my skin. I&#x27;ve tried it in a few places on my skin but each time it only lasted a few hours before starting to rub off. It lasted the longest on my ankle (almost 24 hours). For me personally, this product is only good for one night out.</li>
            <li> I love these tattoos, they are so much fun and easy to use. Thanks</li>
            <li> Got these flash tattoos for my daughter, she loves them!!!! they apply easily, quickly and clean.  Will be buying more.</li>
            <li> After seeing these tattoos pop up every where, I was really excited to get these in the mail. The tattoos on the sheet are well spaced out so it&#x27;s easy to cut out the ones you want without ruining other ones. The instructions are easy to follow - clean and dry skin, place the tattoo where you need it, and then wet the back. I used a wet washcloth and sat it on the back. I was able to get the tattoo on with no awkward sticking to the paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They look utterly gorgeous on the skin, I&#x27;ve received several compliments on them. They seem to last for about 3 solid days and then after that the quality is give or take. I will note that the spot is really important -- one that I placed on my wrist wore out really fast, presumably because I move it ALL the time, whereas one on my upper arm lasted much longer. It is easy to remove these by scrubbing with a washcloth and soap, but just running soap over them doesn&#x27;t seem to affect it. It&#x27;s very easy to remove these with alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have two things worth noting. The first is that one of the tattoos was not flipped. It had the word &amp;#34;dream&amp;#34; on it, but when I applied it, it was then backwards on my skin and unreadable. Also, some of the tattoos were smudged. HOWEVER, I contacted the seller with these issues and they were fast to take care of the problem to make sure that I was a happy customer. Because of this, I definitely recommend this brand and will buy again. I did receive this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> These are very pretty tattoos! They are nice and shiny and look great on your upper arm or on your ankle! I think the best place is your ankle because it doesn&#x27;t keep getting rubbed. I had one on my ankle for a week without any cracking or anything. I took it off to replace it with another one, but I got it off of using my shaver in the shower and applying a but more pressure to rub it off :) I will order more in the future!</li>
            <li> This temporary tattoo are really nice. I can wear this anywhere and anytime I want.  I don&#x27;t have to take it off even taking a shower or go swimming. It&#x27;s easy to use. It has different kinds of designs to choose from. It looks beautiful and high quality from other brands. It&#x27;s easy to apply and remove so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it.  The shipping was fast too.</li>
            <li> These are great and awesome looking!</li>
            <li> Love these tattoos. They are easy to apply and look so real. The designs are what any girl or woman wants. Theyhave such beautiful colors and just apply with a wet cloth.</li>
            <li> Very bright. Went on fast and easy. Lots of different options in the pack for a great price.</li>
            <li> Great temp tattoos, will stay on for about 4 days if you&#x27;re careful with them!!</li>
            <li> I received these metallic temporary tattoos for a product review and love them! Great variety to chose from.Love the colors and unique patterns. Easy to apply. Lasts 3-5 days or more with regular bathing/showering. Very easy to remove.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product.</li>
            <li> I really love the tattoos...just wish they would&#x27;ve stayed on a little longer.  Great designs for short term use!</li>
            <li> Great product!!&lt;br /&gt;Lasts for 2+ weeks and fades slowly. If you need to scrub it off quickly for a job interview, etc. a wet wash cloth will remove it. No pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: Does come off faster in chlorinated pools, but like it says, they are temporary so it makes sense. Wore them to the beach and I did not get any weird tan lines.&lt;br /&gt;Great product for a great price! Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Love these! They&#x27;re stylish, cute, and temporary so you&#x27;re not committing to a real tattoo. They&#x27;re easy to apply and stay on for several days (with minimal touching or interference). A great deal for the price l would totally recommend</li>
            <li> These metallic tattoos are so much fun to wear! Metallic tattoos are super trendy right now, so I was excited to try these out. I opted for the Colors collection and doing a quick count, I received approximately 65 different types of temporary tattoos for around $12. They work just like any temporary tattoo, with a little bit of water, and transfer quite well. I thought with it being a foil-type tattoo that it would be fragile and break easily, but I was pleasantly surprised. They held up for a few days and were easy to remove with rubbing alcohol or makeup remover. I particularly like the ones that resemble gold or silver necklaces. Cute!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product was shipped to me quickly and in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** I received this item for a discount in exchange for leaving a 100% honest review. ***</li>
            <li> I got these tattoos a few days, and I am soooo in love! I would have reviewed them earlier, but I wanted to see how long the tats would last until they got too grungy. I am on day three with the two tats I tried out. I have one on my bicep and another as a bracelet. The tats have lasted through 3 showers, 2 ultra hot and humid days where I was sweating, 2 nights of sleep, and at work. Except for a couple little dings on the bracelet, they are as nice and pristine as when I put them on a few days prior.&lt;br /&gt;The longevity is great, I only took them off today because I have a job interview tomorrow, and the designs are super cute! The bracelets and necklaces are perfect for hot humid days when you want to accessorize but do not want to wear actual jewelry which can cause heat burns. The other designs include: a few birds, elephants, words like love and fearless, infinity symbols, and other cool tribal and geometric inspired shapes. The range in size, so there is something for everyone. My mom loved trying on the smaller ones, and my sister and I are pretty crazy for the big bracelets and hearts. Five out of the six sheets are either gold or silver, but the bonus sheet has bright colors, so you do get a range of styles for a lot of different people. There is something for everyone!!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the are perfect for summertime especially at the beach, but I do not think I will be wearing them in the fall or winter unless it is a special occasion. They would be great for Halloween though depending on your costume or at a rave or party where jewelry can get stolen or lost. You get 6 sheets for $13 which is a good value. They are high quality and not like the temporary tats you used as a kid that you got at birthday parties or the dentist&#x27;s office. I did not count how many tats there were total, but I would estimate around 40 give or take. Since I would only be wearing these in the summertime, these will last me a while, but if I should run out, I would definitely buy them again.m again.</li>
            <li> I love my tats I get so many compliments and they last a long time the colors are bright and vibrate</li>
            <li> Great &amp;#34;flash&amp;#34; tattoos. I mean, they do not come off with soap and water, therefore, be prepared to have them on for about 4-6 days. If you really, really, want to take them off, you&#x27;ll need rubbing alcohol and scrub hard. I have had many compliments when I do place mine on and I will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;In my honest opinion these GLITZ temporary tattoos are good quality and not the cheap kind you find at the stores.</li>
            <li> My daughters loved using these to decorate eggs for easter</li>
            <li> My niece and nephew love these tattoos!  They have so much fun with them and they stay on very well!</li>
            <li> Really pretty. I like how you get different colors of the tattoos. Will probably repurchase before the summer ends.</li>
            <li> Awesome &amp;#34;Temporary&amp;#34; Tattoos. Although they can wash off very easily. If you are putting these tattoos on your fingers, they won&#x27;t last long if you keep washing your hands.</li>
            <li> I first used one of these tattoos for a family barbecue where I was moving between sitting in the sun and swimming in the pool all day long... and by the end of the day it was just as shiny and vibrant as when I had put it on. I put it in very conspicuous place and everyone complimented me on it! The next day it didn&#x27;t come off in the shower, so I had to use rubbing alcohol, after which it came off easily (the tattoo wasn&#x27;t exactly appropriate for my job). Can&#x27;t wait to use more!</li>
            <li> they do not stick, it is almost like they are to old.... and all of them are gold... in the description some or most appeared to be silver which is why I ordered them</li>
            <li> Cool product that comes in all kinds of styles/colors! It was fun to match with different outfits.  Easy to apply, long lasting, but still comes off pretty easily if you want or need it to.  My little 6 year old and 15 year old love them.  Perfect for a girls&#x27; night activity for little ones and adults.  Shipped quick and We will definitely need more soon.  Mahalo!</li>
            <li> Received my tattoos and was very surprised with the quality of the colors. Putting on was also very easy. I loved it. Can&#x27;t wait to put on when I attend a white and gold party. These are awesome.  Last a long time too</li>
            <li> Perfect for the whole family to share and show their &amp;#34;wild side&amp;#34;. Well, for a week at least.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I were looking forward to receiving our order of Glitz Tattoos by Motto. You never really know what will arrive in the mail when you buy online so we were pleasantly surprised by the array of beautiful designs, the ease of application, good quality of this product. I am not much of a tattoo person but I have to say that they looked really good!  My daughter and I had fun playing with these and when it was time to remove them it was with ease. Yes, I will order these again... I am thinking for a girls sleepover or party.</li>
            <li> THESE TATTOOS ARE AWESOME!!  THEY GO ON SMOOTH AND STAY ON!!</li>
            <li> Great gift for kids and teenagers! My nieces love it.</li>
