            <li>/&gt;This is an amazing price!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>When this cologne first came out it was in my opinion, the best on the market.  </li>
            <li>not too strong over bearing just smells darn good &amp; the ladies love it!</li>
            <li>Outstanding Eau-de-toileete.</li>
            <li>Has been my favorite for years.</li>
            <li>Well pleased.</li>
            <li>This stuff is potent, but not over bearing, one spray is all it takes.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>for my boyfriend :) for valentines day:)&lt;br /&gt;i was gnna go macys and buy this one</li>
            <li>I got tons of compliments from the ladies and always felt confident wearing it.  </li>
            <li>For sure, taste of fragrance varies from person to person.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have to say that I fall in love with the smell.</li>
            <li>It, for sure, scored a position in my top choices.</li>
            <li>I love it, he loves it.</li>
            <li>To be frank, I don&#x27;t exactly remember whether I liked it or not.</li>
            <li>Outstanding price, quick delivery.</li>
            <li>i just order it right away:)</li>
            <li>I would very much recommend this product and seller as I will be making more purchases of them again.</li>
            <li>I did manage to get lucky and find a rare older bottle of the good stuff on Ebay</li>
            <li>I have no idea why Dolce would mess with one of the most successful colognes ever made, but the fact is they did.  </li>
            <li>but this cologne was delivered quickly in its original packaging.</li>
            <li>I recently bought this locally and found it to be perfect.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a very warm sexy fragrance, and a little unusual.  </li>
            <li>IT LAST FOR A NICE PERIOD OF TIME</li>
            <li>2 to 3 sprays will last most of the day without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>The Eau-de-toilette Spray wasn&#x27;t satisfactory, seemed old with loss of flavor, I have use this item for more than 4 years and it didn&#x27;t seem the same.</li>
            <li>I can not usually afford this because this size runs over 60 plus dollar.  </li>
            <li>I still had some in an old bottle to compare the scent and could immediately tell the difference.  </li>
            <li>Currently, due to state regulations, this product cannot be shipped to California or Texas.&lt;br /&gt;Error message will appear at checkout for you to select new address.</li>

            <li> Once got this as a gift, and I wanted to purchase this from a store, but it was like 80 bux.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an amazing price!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Excelente perfume muy buen producto la entrega fue buena el tiempo fue el adecuado bien protegido el producto muy bien</li>
            <li> The Eau-de-toilette Spray wasn&#x27;t satisfactory, seemed old with loss of flavor, I have use this item for more than 4 years and it didn&#x27;t seem the same. I recently bought this locally and found it to be perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent for years because it gets me lots of compliments.  2 to 3 sprays will last most of the day without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> Excelente producto. muy buena calidad, el producto llego a tiempo y en buen estado. Lo recomiendo ampliamente. Tiene un agradable olor</li>
            <li> Outstanding Eau-de-toileete. Has been my favorite for years. Outstanding price, quick delivery. Well pleased.</li>
            <li> Currently, due to state regulations, this product cannot be shipped to California or Texas.&lt;br /&gt;Error message will appear at checkout for you to select new address. But by all means, I would suggest giving it a shot as perhaps these regulations can update at any given moment. If it did or did not work, a comment attached would be helpful</li>
            <li> I purchased this thinking I was getting a smaller bottle than what arrived. My mistake is, for once, to my benefit. I received a 4.5 oz bottle and will probably not have to buy cologne for A LONG TIME. This stuff is potent, but not over bearing, one spray is all it takes. I&#x27;ve been wearing it for 3-4 days and received compliments on it on day one. Good stuff. I had wore this scent for a couple years, maybe 5-6 years ago, and it&#x27;s still the same and I love it.</li>
            <li> bought 2 of this ! for my boyfriend :) for valentines day:)&lt;br /&gt;i was gnna go macys and buy this one but then i saw it on amazon..&lt;br /&gt;so i just order it right away:) no gas wasted !!! hehehhehe Ty</li>
            <li> When this cologne first came out it was in my opinion, the best on the market.  I got tons of compliments from the ladies and always felt confident wearing it.  Over the years it has changed for the worse.  It&#x27;s just not the same cologne.  I still had some in an old bottle to compare the scent and could immediately tell the difference.  At first I thought I had received a counterfeit product until I researched and found that other people were feeling the same way, even people who bought it directly from the expensive department stores.  Some have verified that the formulation has been changed several times over the years.  I have no idea why Dolce would mess with one of the most successful colognes ever made, but the fact is they did.  I did manage to get lucky and find a rare older bottle of the good stuff on Ebay a while back for a price.  It will probably be impossible to find ever again and that is unfortunate.  Dolce, if you are listening, I refer you to the saying &amp;#34;If it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> For sure, taste of fragrance varies from person to person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used D&amp;G for men long time back. To be frank, I don&#x27;t exactly remember whether I liked it or not. Recently, I tried it at Macy&#x27;s and I have to say that I fall in love with the smell. I got one immediately. It, for sure, scored a position in my top choices.</li>
            <li> OMG I BROUGHT THIS FOR MY GUY AND HE LOVES IT.....I LIKE THE WAY IT SMELL ON HIM IT LAST FOR A NICE PERIOD OF TIME</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s late but this cologne was delivered quickly in its original packaging. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> this is a must have fragrance! you won&#x27;t be disappointed. not too strong over bearing just smells darn good &amp; the ladies love it!</li>
            <li> I can not usually afford this because this size runs over 60 plus dollar.  When I found this for $40 and no shipping, I did not give it a second thought.  It arrived on time and I could not be happier.  I give this one 6 stars if they had it and give A+++.  I would very much recommend this product and seller as I will be making more purchases of them again.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband it&#x27;s a very warm sexy fragrance, and a little unusual.  I love it, he loves it.</li>
