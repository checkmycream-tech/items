            <li>Makes my products look good</li>
            <li>- I found a solution - a 7&amp;#34; diameter foam ball is a fair substitute.  </li>
            <li>Good for price</li>
            <li>All styles of hats fit perfectly and look good.</li>
            <li>This guy is so funny, he tells me the best jokes.  </li>
            <li>This styrofoam was so handy during class for demonstrations.  </li>
            <li>Nice head to display hats.  </li>
            <li>I got this head to style wigs for cosplay since it&#x27;s close to my own head size.</li>
            <li>It also has a lot of detail and looks great if you&#x27;re planning to use it for display or as an artistic or photographic reference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I swear if we never met I would probably be in the corner of some dingy bar drinking my life away, but now I&#x27;m happy as can be and life is fun and carefree again.  </li>
            <li>I am pretty happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Very light and wouldn&#x27;t stand up well alone though.</li>
            <li>We used this for a Halloween project and were able to decorate it</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better.</li>
            <li>I have a military hat collection and the size and color worked out great!  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and it arrived in good shape.</li>
            <li>Seems to do the trick just fine.</li>
            <li>Its quite light and will serve its purpose as a wig/hat holder.</li>
            <li>but now all my wigs fit like a charm</li>
            <li>great item, low price</li>
            <li>it was love at first sight when i saw him.  </li>
            <li>While it is styrofoam and therefore not something that&#x27;s going to hold up to a lot of abuse, it&#x27;s of good quality with a relatively dense, smooth surface.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It also looks kind of creepy just sitting around, and to me that&#x27;s a huge plus!!!!</li>
            <li>The Geill head is very realistically detailed which makes it great to test different types of lighting techniques for portrait photographers.</li>
            <li>I tend to put old Halloween masks up on a shelf since I like the work that went into some of the masks I own.  </li>
            <li>I received it quickly.  </li>
            <li>Because this is a very sturdy foam, I felt comfortable pinning fabric to it as I worked.  </li>
            <li>They are the right height and weight and have the right head size for my hats.....</li>
            <li>I will be knitting more hats in the future.</li>
            <li>And will be getting several more for posing/testing group shots</li>
            <li>It looks exactly as the picture displays.</li>
            <li>The head has realistic features that let you see all the shadows and highlights so you can experiment for hours to get exactly the right lighting arrangements without having to bore real models to tears.</li>
            <li>The shipping was pretty fast as well.</li>
            <li>Very realistic.</li>
            <li>As long as your expectations are reasonable, I think you&#x27;ll be pleased.  </li>
            <li>The head arrived in a timely fashion (2 days after purchase as it said it would) surrounded by large plastic bubble wrap in an amazon box.</li>
            <li>probably will order a few more!</li>
            <li>and it really is the size of a child or a woman&#x27;s head--not a man&#x27;s size.</li>
            <li>so the wigs she styles fit properly.</li>
            <li>the head came with two light scratches on the left cheek and a thumb print indent on the chin.</li>
            <li>My product came in a very timely manner of which was pleasing.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I needed it to fake out house keeping to win a bet...</li>
            <li>When I was on my 6th cup of coffee at 3AM and was looking on Amazon for a new BFF</li>
            <li>I would judge I have a normal sized head, and I purchased this to place one of my old hats on.  </li>
            <li>these are a little bigger than most I have bought.</li>
            <li>However, the results have far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>it met his needs completely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try to paint it flesh tones and find some fake eyes that should make it even more useful.</li>
            <li>I was able to use it for an art project though, so it wasn&#x27;t a total waste.</li>
            <li>Overall, this was worth every penny spent.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a base for working on a Halloween mask, and while it will certainly do the job, I&#x27;m going to have to fudge quite a bit to make sure the mask will fit my actual head.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about the size of an adult male&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li>Came with some dents in it (needed better shipping protection) and is a little too small.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s about the size of an adult male&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> Came with some dents in it (needed better shipping protection) and is a little too small.</li>
            <li> The head is about the same size as a small to average adult head and the Styrofoam is pretty sturdy.  </li>
            <li> its about 2/3 the size of a typical male head.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high expectations due to the original cost but when it arrived with a lot of dents and a flattened nose I have to say I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> My daughter reports this was just what she needed--larger than the other styro heads</li>
            <li> Just a couple of sizes to small for my hats but no big del.</li>
            <li> NO ONE makes a mannequin head that&#x27;s larger than that of a small child.  </li>
            <li> The features resemble a MAN, but no man would have such a small head.</li>
            <li> foam head does not smile</li>
            <li> only complaint is that it&#x27;s somewhat small.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I would suggest getting a stand for it as a heavy piece would make it fall.</li>
            <li> Not a huge issue, just something to note.  </li>
            <li> A little too small, but correctly advertised.</li>
            <li> before this head foam my DIY wigs always come out way too small for my head  </li>
            <li> When it arrived I found it is much to small for a man&#x27;s head</li>
            <li> I sent a complaint to the seller, who responded to assure me that all of their products &amp;#34;conform with industry standards&amp;#34;, as though that rationale somehow excuses imbecility.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with it and would recommend a man with an average size or large head to not purchase this form.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d hoped to use one as a drying form for use after washing baseball caps - an experiment in abject failure.  </li>
            <li> I must admit that I was skeptical about buying this mannequin head.</li>
            <li> useless for hat display.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the hat is oversized on this mannequin head.  </li>
            <li> I was cold and alone until we met.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad that there isn&#x27;t a head that is a 25&amp;#34; or 25&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I had to buy a base to handle the weight of the mask.</li>
            <li> BUT, when it got here I was VERY disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is awful.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I needed a sturdy foam head since the head I was knitting for was across the country.  The Giell Foam Mannequin Head was a perfect solution.I will be knitting more hats in the future.</li>
            <li> I am pretty happy with my purchase. The shipping was pretty fast as well. I bought this so I could use it as a hanger for my headphones. It serves its purpose perfectly and looks pretty good!</li>
            <li> Just a display dealio for treasured ski hat and all the souvenir pins attached .Thirty years of ski memories don&#x27;t belong in a box.</li>
            <li> The head is about the same size as a small to average adult head and the Styrofoam is pretty sturdy.  We used this for a Halloween project and were able to decorate it and then we left it outside for about two weeks and it held up well.  Shipping was fast and it arrived in good shape.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Makes my products look good</li>
            <li> The Geill head is very realistically detailed which makes it great to test different types of lighting techniques for portrait photographers. The head has realistic features that let you see all the shadows and highlights so you can experiment for hours to get exactly the right lighting arrangements without having to bore real models to tears.</li>
            <li> I guess i got a cat looking head. My head has a squished nose!!!!</li>
            <li> Head is not life size like I wanted it. It is much smaller then an actually head.</li>
            <li> I got this mannequin head to work on making helmets for costumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also looks kind of creepy just sitting around, and to me that&#x27;s a huge plus!!!!</li>
            <li> Great for photography- testing portrait lighting, etc. I&#x27;m going to try to paint it flesh tones and find some fake eyes that should make it even more useful. And will be getting several more for posing/testing group shots</li>
            <li> I needed a mannequin head to make a headpiece for a costume.  Because this is a very sturdy foam, I felt comfortable pinning fabric to it as I worked.  I am very happy with the end result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest getting a stand for it as a heavy piece would make it fall.</li>
            <li> The finest foam mens head in all the land. I needed it to fake out house keeping to win a bet... I won</li>
            <li> I must admit that I was skeptical about buying this mannequin head.However, the results have far exceeded my expectations. The head arrived in a timely fashion (2 days after purchase as it said it would) surrounded by large plastic bubble wrap in an amazon box. There are no damages to the head in any shape or form. It looks exactly as the picture displays. It sits atop my desk sturdily and balances well. Its quite light and will serve its purpose as a wig/hat holder. Overall, this was worth every penny spent. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Who the heck decided that this was &amp;#34;full size&amp;#34; head..  its about 2/3 the size of a typical male head.  useless for hat display.</li>
            <li> It was a styrofoam head.</li>
            <li> life saver . before this head foam my DIY wigs always come out way too small for my head  but now all my wigs fit like a charm</li>
            <li> foam head does not smile</li>
            <li> I have a military hat collection and the size and color worked out great!  They are the right height and weight and have the right head size for my hats.....probably will order a few more!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and supplier</li>
            <li> I bought this head to put my baseball hat on in order to help keep its shape.  When it arrived I found it is much to small for a man&#x27;s head and it really is the size of a child or a woman&#x27;s head--not a man&#x27;s size. I am very disappointed with it and would recommend a man with an average size or large head to not purchase this form.</li>
            <li> head is not 22 inches it is 20 1/2 inches. Wanted to return it they want me to pay return shipping for something that is not what i ordered so either way im paying for it. If your looking for a head that is 22 inches or bigger do not order this one because it is not 22 inches.</li>
            <li> Seems to do the trick just fine.I am very happy with this product and the supplier. It saved me money.</li>
            <li> I would judge I have a normal sized head, and I purchased this to place one of my old hats on.  Unfortunately, the hat is oversized on this mannequin head.  Not a huge issue, just something to note.  Otherwise it is as appears in the picture, feels sturdy, and has no issues.</li>
            <li> My daughter reports this was just what she needed--larger than the other styro heads so the wigs she styles fit properly.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a tool to practice making out. The mouth doesn&#x27;t open though so it was a Dud. I was able to use it for an art project though, so it wasn&#x27;t a total waste.</li>
            <li> This styrofoam was so handy during class for demonstrations.  I facilitate a process known as the Access Consciousness BARS which consists of various points on the head, that when activated, will fire up your neuronet and release limiting beliefs.  This head was great to walk around class and  demonstrate where to put your fingers on the person&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> I received it on time and had no problem with shipping box.&lt;br /&gt;However, the mannequin has damaged on it.&lt;br /&gt;I have no time to go to postoffice to send it back for return or exchange.&lt;br /&gt;It is awful.</li>
            <li> Just a couple of sizes to small for my hats but no big del.</li>
            <li> the head came with two light scratches on the left cheek and a thumb print indent on the chin. These things are visible in pictures of crafted items. That was the reason I purchased it for. I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> NO ONE makes a mannequin head that&#x27;s larger than that of a small child.  I&#x27;d hoped to use one as a drying form for use after washing baseball caps - an experiment in abject failure.  I sent a complaint to the seller, who responded to assure me that all of their products &amp;#34;conform with industry standards&amp;#34;, as though that rationale somehow excuses imbecility.  It will not serve for men&#x27;s hat display, either, as no men&#x27;s hat will sit on it without looking as though it were designed for Brobdingnabian clientele.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT - I found a solution - a 7&amp;#34; diameter foam ball is a fair substitute.  The next one will be 7-1/2&amp;#34; or 7-3/4&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the this product.</li>
            <li> Nice head to display hats.  I received it quickly.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> It displays my hand crocheted (for sale on Amazon) perfectly. I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better. It works great for taking pictures of my product.</li>
            <li> I like using him to display my knitted hats, he has the ideal circumference, shape and size for my purpose.</li>
            <li> Very realistic. Good for price</li>
            <li> Came with some dents in it (needed better shipping protection) and is a little too small. But otherwise great.</li>
            <li> My son had a history project andthis came in real handy for a bust of his person in history he was presenting. it met his needs completely. this order arrived on time, well packaged and was well repersented. thank you</li>
            <li> This is a perfect model to display the hats for my business.  All styles of hats fit perfectly and look good.</li>
            <li> Great for hat photography</li>
            <li> I tend to put old Halloween masks up on a shelf since I like the work that went into some of the masks I own.  I find this worked well but I had to buy a base to handle the weight of the mask.</li>
            <li> Perfectly showcases my halloween mask collection!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a styrofoam head.  As long as your expectations are reasonable, I think you&#x27;ll be pleased.  While it is styrofoam and therefore not something that&#x27;s going to hold up to a lot of abuse, it&#x27;s of good quality with a relatively dense, smooth surface.  It also has a lot of detail and looks great if you&#x27;re planning to use it for display or as an artistic or photographic reference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it&#x27;s somewhat small.  I wear L/XL hats, and this is definitely a S/M head, since when I drop one of my hats on it, it looks like a kid trying on daddy&#x27;s clothes.  I bought this as a base for working on a Halloween mask, and while it will certainly do the job, I&#x27;m going to have to fudge quite a bit to make sure the mask will fit my actual head.</li>
            <li> I measured the size of the head that was said in the description, it was perfect. BUT, when it got here I was VERY disappointed. I cannot display a hat on this because the head is the size of a child&#x27;s. The features resemble a MAN, but no man would have such a small head. I only gave this 2 stars because they were deceptive, not lying.</li>
            <li> My product came in a very timely manner of which was pleasing. However when I opened the package, I was displeased that one side of the head had not been protected from the bottom of the box so there was grooves along the cheek and the forehead brow line was smashed in as well as the nose was smashed to one side.</li>
            <li> This guy is so funny, he tells me the best jokes.  I was cold and alone until we met.  When I was on my 6th cup of coffee at 3AM and was looking on Amazon for a new BFF it was love at first sight when i saw him.  We&#x27;ve been together ever since.  Even though I keep him locked in a closet with a Plague Doctor mask over his head, he never complains.  In fact he only compliments me on my hair and shoes and backpacks.  I swear if we never met I would probably be in the corner of some dingy bar drinking my life away, but now I&#x27;m happy as can be and life is fun and carefree again.  The only drawback is that he won&#x27;t help me get ride of my wife....</li>
            <li> great item, low price</li>
            <li> A little too small, but correctly advertised. It&#x27;s too bad that there isn&#x27;t a head that is a 25&amp;#34; or 25&amp;#34; diameter.</li>
            <li> Worked well for my purposes. Very light and wouldn&#x27;t stand up well alone though.</li>
            <li> these are a little bigger than most I have bought.</li>
            <li> I got this head to style wigs for cosplay since it&#x27;s close to my own head size. Works very well. It&#x27;s about the size of an adult male&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> I use two of these mannequin heads for my Gorn and Mugato Masks.  They go great with my Trek Collection in my 16 foot model case.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high expectations due to the original cost but when it arrived with a lot of dents and a flattened nose I have to say I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> It came damaged and won&#x27;t stand up with anything on it.</li>
            <li> Awesome for my Halloween ghost-head project.</li>
