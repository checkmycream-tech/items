            <li>They produce a nicely finished cut without mashing the nail or crimping it off.  </li>
            <li>Still good and sooooo much better than others I have used</li>

            <li>They have a nice grib and make it easy to clip without getting hang nails!</li>

            <li>They felt very strong and cut very easily.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>

            <li>Excellent so far.  </li>
            <li>and I am pleased that they cut my nails nicely.</li>
            <li>These are by far the best set of clippers I have ever had....</li>
            <li>The placement of the built in file is perfect and provides extra grip at the tip of my thumb.</li>
            <li>I felt so confident using the Clyppi fingernail trimmers</li>
            <li>I was able to use them on my toddler as well.</li>
            <li>The clippers don’t flex as much as cheaper clippers under pressure which greatly decreases the effort of clipping and improves the accuracy and cleanness of the cut.</li>
            <li>I actually haven&#x27;t needed to do any maintenance with them at this time, as I used my parents set - and that went wonderfully, thank you.  </li>
            <li>great product very well designed, this feel and look great.&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
            <li>Like most people I&#x27;ve used a variety of clippers throughout my&lt;br</li>
            <li>able to do the job.</li>
            <li>Well pleased.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of nail clippers at home, most of them do half-done job and most, don&#x27;t even work.</li>
            <li>Once i took them out of the packaging they had nice quality weight to them, not like the cheap drugstore/dollar clippers found every where.</li>
            <li>If anything comes up, i will sure to update this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am glad that i did.</li>

            <li>I let go of the baby nail clippers for my two children and just used these because they were more precise and quicker to use.  </li>
            <li>I have bought so many bail clippers over the years that are so cheap made</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the most important thing of the clippers.</li>
            <li>They cut very well and feel good in your hand.</li>
            <li>I can tell from its look that it is made of good quality stainless steel and that it will not rust.</li>
            <li>I’m glad I stuck with my original decision.</li>

            <li>They cut smooth and easy.</li>
            <li>and well they cut mighty fine.</li>
            <li>In all honesty, I was certain that I would never find the best nail clippers, especially one for pedicures, for us to use.</li>
            <li>After years of using cheap quality nail clippers and toe clippers, I decided to make a change and picked up these Clyppi nail clippers after seeing the reviews.  </li>
            <li>The toenail clipper is fantastic.</li>
            <li>but they aren&#x27;t that cheap either&lt;</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great, I used them last night.</li>
            <li>These are great for my finger nails because they are frail and tiny.</li>
            <li>They cut my nails easily and they gave a clean cut.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always bought the cheap clippers because I figured there was no difference....</li>
            <li>They also have  a  nice modern look to them  </li>
            <li>The clipper is precise and doesn&#x27;t make that &#x27;click&#x27; noise when you cut a nail.</li>
            <li>They fit nicely in my hand, had a nice weight, and appeared to be of medical grade metal.</li>
            <li>They were cheap looking and did not cut nails well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is comfortable to hold and gives me the impression of quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first I did when I opened them was to make sure the clip ends were level.</li>
            <li>I do use files a lot to help clean underneath the nails.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a pull-out under the nail cleaner that most clippers come with, but they did add a nice inner nail filer which I hadn&#x27;t seen before.</li>
            <li>a better testament to the quality of the clippers not having as much to&lt;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a good set of clippers and have bought several.</li>
            <li>wife and I love these nail clippers as they do the job very well...</li>
            <li>it for discounted price but the original price is well worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like it was designed to have a good grip with the little spot on the top of them.  </li>
            <li>I love my new clyppi today!  </li>
            <li>rusted quickly, or just fall apart.</li>
            <li>you are looking for some great clippers, don&#x27;t waste your money on those cheap things you will have to replace in a couple weeks.</li>
            <li>The clipper is solid stainless steel, look and feel very nice.</li>
            <li>These are not your average drug store clippers, so if you want quality implements, these are great.</li>
            <li>I have always used the cheap dollar store nail clippers and about a year ago bought my first Clyppi.</li>
            <li>They really are the ultra cool precision tools!</li>
            <li>They look stylish, very sharp, easy to use, and feel substantial in my hands - much better than a cheap-o drugstore version.</li>
            <li>My husband was very impressed with them They are made with stainless steel instead of the cheaper metal usually used with nail clippers.</li>
            <li>Clyppi clippers are the best and sharpest that I&#x27;ve found so far hands down.</li>
            <li>They are very strong metal, so I don&#x27;t see a way of these coming apart like so many other clippers have done.</li>
            <li>I received my Clyppi set and was pretty excited to use them.</li>
            <li>I would love to order more, especially for the premium stainless finish!</li>
            <li>Kind of strange to get excited about nail&lt;</li>
            <li>They are made of high quality stainless steel with a beautiful brushed metal finish.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is great to finally have some nail clippers that actually cut the nails instead of crushing them apart.</li>
            <li>but if you clip a lot of nails I would say they would be worth it.</li>
            <li>NOT AS GOOD ASI EXPECTED FOR THE PRICE</li>
            <li>The larger nail file is perfect for clipping toenails or nails that are thicker and harder to cut.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>They do such a precise job, and leave you with a smooth, clean cut.  </li>
            <li>They have a very precise, sharp edge and allows me to get a very clean cut when trimming my nails.</li>
            <li>These are high quality stainless steel clippers, with a great brushed finish.</li>
            <li>These are very high quality, and cut cleanly.</li>
            <li>You can feel the quality right out of the box.  </li>
            <li>These are well made and the angle of the blade is just right.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s all the nail falls right off.</li>
            <li>If I lose either one I will replace right away.</li>
            <li>Very well made, cuts clean.</li>
            <li>But as far as how they are balanced and how they feel in the palm of the hand, I haven&#x27;t had a pair of clippers that are this easy to work.  </li>
            <li>The nail clipper was not as crisp in its cut.</li>
            <li>Note that this model doesn&#x27;t include a &amp;#34;nail cleaner&amp;#34; (I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a technical name for that part), but does have the file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE the smaller set</li>
            <li>I would recommend this set to everyone who has a need for nail clippers.&lt;br /&gt;Great quality and will last many years.</li>
            <li>They come in a quality package and the first surprise I got was their weight.</li>
            <li>At first  when I recieved them they look like &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; clippers.</li>
            <li>The toe clippers didn&#x27;t break on the first clip.</li>
            <li>Ok I can definitely tell you what these clippers DONT do.</li>
            <li>It works really well!</li>
            <li>I have consistently bought my clippers at the dollar store.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure they are going to last and outlast me.  </li>
            <li>, I mean my daughters borrow stuff and never return it lol.  </li>
            <li>I had a chance to  use my new Clyppi nail  clippers and love how sharp and clean they cut!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re sharp, easy to hold, finely made out of quality steel.</li>
            <li>They also seem plenty sharp which is nice as well.</li>
            <li>They feel like a good solid item that will last.</li>
            <li>I love these clippers so much I had to order a second set.</li>
            <li>No compensation for a positive review was provided.</li>
            <li>and I never guarantee a positive review.</li>
            <li>The larger than standard size of the fingernail clippers also makes using them much more comfortable and increases the clipping leverage.</li>
            <li>n big set for toe nails either way works fine because they cut the first try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure to use this set for a very long time to come.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use, work really well, and feel like they will last a lifetime.</li>
            <li>This is a nice little set of nail clippers.</li>
            <li>They seem to have that high quality look and feel which, is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>surprisingly,  these are strong and sharp enough to actually clip my nails.  </li>
            <li>Made of stainless steel, the trimmers are manufactured with quality metal.</li>
            <li>These nail clippers cut my nails in one cut, straight across.  </li>
            <li>AS MUCH AS MY SEKI CLIPPERS.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The stainless steel is matte, so it doesn&#x27;t slip.</li>
            <li>Appears to be very well made and should be durable.  </li>
            <li>rather that straight, buyt it worked well.  </li>
            <li>He really likes them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are very well made.</li>
            <li>The design is very stylish.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>Really sturdy nail clippers.</li>
            <li>We used this for everything, including finger nails and toe nails, which wasn&#x27;t very efficient.  </li>
            <li>I have not had this problem to this extent with regular cheap clippers.</li>
            <li>Thanks Clyppi.</li>
            <li>That part I really like because sometimes I don&#x27;t have the time or the nail file on hand to do this.</li>
            <li>When they say precision I really didn&#x27;t understand that until I used these clippers.</li>
            <li>I really like these clippers - they do not hurt your hands when you use them.</li>
            <li>They are also very sturdy.</li>
            <li>and I can really tell the difference with Clyppi.</li>
            <li>It looks very sleek too.</li>
            <li>The clippers are very well built and sturdy.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very convenient.</li>
            <li>They are stainless steel</li>
            <li>whether you have smaller hands or large toes, these things cut cleanly with ease.</li>
            <li>n break first use,I wanted to try out something new .I</li>
            <li>I am planing to buy more to replace my other ones.</li>
            <li>Clyppi is solid and cuts cleanly and evenly every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The pair came in a nice soft black case.</li>
            <li>i like the size of these..they are easy to handle and they clip sharp and really well.</li>
            <li>They are your pretty standard nail clippers at first glance.</li>
            <li>I would rate these a very high 9.25 to 9.75 - nearly perfec!</li>
            <li>They just seem so sharp and  precise compared to most other clippers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Clyppi precision tools Set.</li>
            <li>These are high quality, precision made clippers.</li>
            <li>You can tell that is made of high quality.</li>
            <li>They are lightweight, the grips are easy to hold and use, and the blades seem sharp.  </li>
            <li>I very highly recommend them for nearly anyone.</li>
            <li>I would have liked it on the toenail clipper at least.</li>
            <li>Love the fact they are stainless steel and will not rust when left in the wet shower.  </li>
            <li>This is a feature that I&#x27;ll likely never use, but thought it was worth mentioning.</li>
            <li>There is a filer on the clipper itself which is not that easy to use, only if the filter was larger.  </li>
            <li>Next time i&#x27;ll do it right.</li>
            <li>If I needed a new pair I purchased inexpensive ones from the drugstore.</li>
            <li>Very sharp and easy to to use.</li>
            <li>It is modern, built to last, and does the job very well.</li>
            <li>These clippers are great for men or women and you can use the small pair for women n large for men,or the small set for finger nails</li>
            <li>Not sure why a heavier set of clippers feels better</li>
            <li>LIke a lot of the other people, i didnt think i would write a review on nail clippers but these ones are really much better than a regular nail clipper.  </li>
            <li>...spend the extra $ to get a real set!</li>
            <li>If I didn&#x27;t hold the bigger pair just right, they seemed to be dull, which they are not, it was just the way I was able to hold them.</li>
            <li>The nail clips are so sharp, leave your nail with clean cut that does not require filing.</li>
            <li>Clyppi nail clippers are sharp and cut the nail cleanly.  </li>
            <li>But the smaller pair was very easy to hold onto and to use, very sharp!</li>
            <li>It is smooth and feels like it will last you a long time.</li>
            <li>Once you open them there is a little file on the thumb lever which I found useful for quick cleanups</li>
            <li>the textured finish and the double slots cut into the handle make them easy to grip, even if your hands are wet.  </li>
            <li>I will be honest, nail clippers don&#x27;t last very long in our household, especially all the different sets.</li>
            <li>I also really enjoy the Matte finish and the little filer on the clipper</li>
            <li>Overall they are nice little clippers and will be added to my collection for regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s hard yo use just any kind of clippers but these have been the only ones he loves using,get your clippers</li>
            <li>Because of that I my toes looked beach ready for a recent vacation.  </li>
            <li>comfortable to hold, with a firm grip.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased three sets so far for my husband and I.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;file&amp;#34; is too far from the edge of the handle to use properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whoever</li>
            <li>So I have no experience with quality or professional nail clippers.</li>
            <li>Best cutting clippers I&#x27;ve used, also the most expensive.  </li>
            <li>I mean, what sounds better than an ergonomical nail clipper with a life time</li>
            <li>These clippers really are very easy to use and it actually clips your nails neatly without shattering them or causing a ragged cut that does worse damage.</li>
            <li>/&gt;were not really as long as I normally let them get before trimming but that</li>
            <li>It is not easy to get excited about nail clippers</li>
            <li>It is comfortable to hold, does not split my nails while cutting and sharp enough to do a good job.</li>
            <li>Really, I don&#x27;t think I could be happier with Clyppi and plan on possibly giving these as gifts in the future!</li>
            <li>No other incentives received.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t last like the old ones 70-80&#x27;s vintage.</li>
            <li>They may not look that different from your run of the mill clippers but that&#x27;s far from reality.</li>
            <li>They are not cheap, but they are worth it.</li>
            <li>You really get god leverage on the ergonomic levers, and the blades are sharp.  </li>
            <li>Between the brushed stainless steel, file and wide design</li>
            <li>One is a large nail clipper meant for toenails and the other one is a smaller one for your fingernails.</li>
            <li>They are very sharp and can easily clip large thick or small little bits of nail easily.</li>
            <li>I can tell that it&#x27;s a high quality material compared to other cheaper clippers.</li>
            <li>reviewing this product this gets the nail right down to the cutical, no worries of hang nails left over or scratching yourself with sharp edges thats left over, this is a qaulity product and reccommend this to everyone</li>

            <li> They produce a nicely finished cut without mashing the nail or crimping it off.  </li>
            <li> Still good and sooooo much better than others I have used</li>

            <li> They have a nice grib and make it easy to clip without getting hang nails!</li>
            <li> These clippers are very strong and appear well made.  </li>
            <li> They felt very strong and cut very easily.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>
            <li> They are by far the best set of clippers</li>
            <li> Excellent so far.  </li>
            <li> and I am pleased that they cut my nails nicely.</li>
            <li> These are by far the best set of clippers I have ever had....</li>
            <li> The placement of the built in file is perfect and provides extra grip at the tip of my thumb.</li>
            <li> I felt so confident using the Clyppi fingernail trimmers</li>
            <li> I was able to use them on my toddler as well.</li>
            <li> The clippers don’t flex as much as cheaper clippers under pressure which greatly decreases the effort of clipping and improves the accuracy and cleanness of the cut.</li>
            <li> I actually haven&#x27;t needed to do any maintenance with them at this time, as I used my parents set - and that went wonderfully, thank you.  </li>
            <li> great product very well designed, this feel and look great.&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
            <li> Like most people I&#x27;ve used a variety of clippers throughout my&lt;br</li>
            <li> able to do the job.</li>
            <li> Well pleased.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of nail clippers at home, most of them do half-done job and most, don&#x27;t even work.</li>
            <li> Once i took them out of the packaging they had nice quality weight to them, not like the cheap drugstore/dollar clippers found every where.</li>
            <li> If anything comes up, i will sure to update this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am glad that i did.</li>

            <li> They cut smooth and easy.</li>
            <li> and well they cut mighty fine.</li>
            <li> In all honesty, I was certain that I would never find the best nail clippers, especially one for pedicures, for us to use.</li>
            <li> After years of using cheap quality nail clippers and toe clippers, I decided to make a change and picked up these Clyppi nail clippers after seeing the reviews.  </li>
            <li> The toenail clipper is fantastic.</li>
            <li> but they aren&#x27;t that cheap either&lt;</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great, I used them last night.</li>
            <li> These are great for my finger nails because they are frail and tiny.</li>
            <li> They cut my nails easily and they gave a clean cut.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always bought the cheap clippers because I figured there was no difference....</li>
            <li> They also have  a  nice modern look to them  </li>
            <li> The clipper is precise and doesn&#x27;t make that &#x27;click&#x27; noise when you cut a nail.</li>
            <li> They fit nicely in my hand, had a nice weight, and appeared to be of medical grade metal.</li>
            <li> They were cheap looking and did not cut nails well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is comfortable to hold and gives me the impression of quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first I did when I opened them was to make sure the clip ends were level.</li>
            <li> I do use files a lot to help clean underneath the nails.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a pull-out under the nail cleaner that most clippers come with, but they did add a nice inner nail filer which I hadn&#x27;t seen before.</li>
            <li> a better testament to the quality of the clippers not having as much to&lt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a good set of clippers and have bought several.</li>
            <li> wife and I love these nail clippers as they do the job very well...</li>
            <li> it for discounted price but the original price is well worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like it was designed to have a good grip with the little spot on the top of them.  </li>
            <li> I love my new clyppi today!  </li>
            <li> rusted quickly, or just fall apart.</li>
            <li> you are looking for some great clippers, don&#x27;t waste your money on those cheap things you will have to replace in a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> The clipper is solid stainless steel, look and feel very nice.</li>
            <li> These are not your average drug store clippers, so if you want quality implements, these are great.</li>
            <li> I have always used the cheap dollar store nail clippers and about a year ago bought my first Clyppi.</li>
            <li> They really are the ultra cool precision tools!</li>
            <li> They look stylish, very sharp, easy to use, and feel substantial in my hands - much better than a cheap-o drugstore version.</li>
            <li> My husband was very impressed with them They are made with stainless steel instead of the cheaper metal usually used with nail clippers.</li>
            <li> Clyppi clippers are the best and sharpest that I&#x27;ve found so far hands down.</li>
            <li> They are very strong metal, so I don&#x27;t see a way of these coming apart like so many other clippers have done.</li>
            <li> I received my Clyppi set and was pretty excited to use them.</li>
            <li> I would love to order more, especially for the premium stainless finish!</li>
            <li> Kind of strange to get excited about nail&lt;</li>
            <li> They are made of high quality stainless steel with a beautiful brushed metal finish.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is great to finally have some nail clippers that actually cut the nails instead of crushing them apart.</li>
            <li> but if you clip a lot of nails I would say they would be worth it.</li>
            <li> NOT AS GOOD ASI EXPECTED FOR THE PRICE</li>
            <li> The larger nail file is perfect for clipping toenails or nails that are thicker and harder to cut.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> They do such a precise job, and leave you with a smooth, clean cut.  </li>
            <li> They have a very precise, sharp edge and allows me to get a very clean cut when trimming my nails.</li>
            <li> These are high quality stainless steel clippers, with a great brushed finish.</li>
            <li> These are very high quality, and cut cleanly.</li>
            <li> You can feel the quality right out of the box.  </li>
            <li> These are well made and the angle of the blade is just right.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s all the nail falls right off.</li>
            <li> If I lose either one I will replace right away.</li>
            <li> Very well made, cuts clean.</li>
            <li> But as far as how they are balanced and how they feel in the palm of the hand, I haven&#x27;t had a pair of clippers that are this easy to work.  </li>
            <li> The nail clipper was not as crisp in its cut.</li>
            <li> Note that this model doesn&#x27;t include a &amp;#34;nail cleaner&amp;#34; (I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a technical name for that part), but does have the file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the smaller set</li>
            <li> I would recommend this set to everyone who has a need for nail clippers.&lt;br /&gt;Great quality and will last many years.</li>
            <li> They come in a quality package and the first surprise I got was their weight.</li>
            <li> At first  when I recieved them they look like &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; clippers.</li>
            <li> The toe clippers didn&#x27;t break on the first clip.</li>
            <li> Ok I can definitely tell you what these clippers DONT do.</li>
            <li> It works really well!</li>
            <li> I have consistently bought my clippers at the dollar store.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure they are going to last and outlast me.  </li>
            <li> , I mean my daughters borrow stuff and never return it lol.  </li>
            <li> I had a chance to  use my new Clyppi nail  clippers and love how sharp and clean they cut!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sharp, easy to hold, finely made out of quality steel.</li>
            <li> They also seem plenty sharp which is nice as well.</li>
            <li> They feel like a good solid item that will last.</li>
            <li> I love these clippers so much I had to order a second set.</li>
            <li> No compensation for a positive review was provided.</li>
            <li> and I never guarantee a positive review.</li>
            <li> The larger than standard size of the fingernail clippers also makes using them much more comfortable and increases the clipping leverage.</li>
            <li> n big set for toe nails either way works fine because they cut the first try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure to use this set for a very long time to come.</li>
            <li> They are easy to use, work really well, and feel like they will last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little set of nail clippers.</li>
            <li> They seem to have that high quality look and feel which, is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> surprisingly,  these are strong and sharp enough to actually clip my nails.  </li>
            <li> Made of stainless steel, the trimmers are manufactured with quality metal.</li>
            <li> These nail clippers cut my nails in one cut, straight across.  </li>
            <li> AS MUCH AS MY SEKI CLIPPERS.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The stainless steel is matte, so it doesn&#x27;t slip.</li>
            <li> Appears to be very well made and should be durable.  </li>
            <li> rather that straight, buyt it worked well.  </li>
            <li> He really likes them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are very well made.</li>
            <li> The design is very stylish.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> Really sturdy nail clippers.</li>
            <li> We used this for everything, including finger nails and toe nails, which wasn&#x27;t very efficient.  </li>
            <li> I have not had this problem to this extent with regular cheap clippers.</li>
            <li> Thanks Clyppi.</li>
            <li> That part I really like because sometimes I don&#x27;t have the time or the nail file on hand to do this.</li>
            <li> When they say precision I really didn&#x27;t understand that until I used these clippers.</li>
            <li> I really like these clippers - they do not hurt your hands when you use them.</li>
            <li> They are also very sturdy.</li>
            <li> and I can really tell the difference with Clyppi.</li>
            <li> It looks very sleek too.</li>
            <li> The clippers are very well built and sturdy.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very convenient.</li>
            <li> They are stainless steel</li>
            <li> whether you have smaller hands or large toes, these things cut cleanly with ease.</li>
            <li> n break first use,I wanted to try out something new .I</li>
            <li> I am planing to buy more to replace my other ones.</li>
            <li> Clyppi is solid and cuts cleanly and evenly every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pair came in a nice soft black case.</li>
            <li> i like the size of these..they are easy to handle and they clip sharp and really well.</li>
            <li> They are your pretty standard nail clippers at first glance.</li>
            <li> I would rate these a very high 9.25 to 9.75 - nearly perfec!</li>
            <li> They just seem so sharp and  precise compared to most other clippers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Clyppi precision tools Set.</li>
            <li> These are high quality, precision made clippers.</li>
            <li> You can tell that is made of high quality.</li>
            <li> They are lightweight, the grips are easy to hold and use, and the blades seem sharp.  </li>
            <li> I very highly recommend them for nearly anyone.</li>
            <li> I would have liked it on the toenail clipper at least.</li>
            <li> Love the fact they are stainless steel and will not rust when left in the wet shower.  </li>
            <li> This is a feature that I&#x27;ll likely never use, but thought it was worth mentioning.</li>
            <li> There is a filer on the clipper itself which is not that easy to use, only if the filter was larger.  </li>
            <li> Next time i&#x27;ll do it right.</li>
            <li> If I needed a new pair I purchased inexpensive ones from the drugstore.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and easy to to use.</li>
            <li> It is modern, built to last, and does the job very well.</li>
            <li> These clippers are great for men or women and you can use the small pair for women n large for men,or the small set for finger nails</li>
            <li> Not sure why a heavier set of clippers feels better</li>
            <li> LIke a lot of the other people, i didnt think i would write a review on nail clippers but these ones are really much better than a regular nail clipper.  </li>
            <li> ...spend the extra $ to get a real set!</li>
            <li> If I didn&#x27;t hold the bigger pair just right, they seemed to be dull, which they are not, it was just the way I was able to hold them.</li>
            <li> The nail clips are so sharp, leave your nail with clean cut that does not require filing.</li>
            <li> Clyppi nail clippers are sharp and cut the nail cleanly.  </li>
            <li> But the smaller pair was very easy to hold onto and to use, very sharp!</li>
            <li> It is smooth and feels like it will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> Once you open them there is a little file on the thumb lever which I found useful for quick cleanups</li>
            <li> the textured finish and the double slots cut into the handle make them easy to grip, even if your hands are wet.  </li>
            <li> I will be honest, nail clippers don&#x27;t last very long in our household, especially all the different sets.</li>
            <li> I also really enjoy the Matte finish and the little filer on the clipper</li>
            <li> Overall they are nice little clippers and will be added to my collection for regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard yo use just any kind of clippers but these have been the only ones he loves using,get your clippers</li>
            <li> Because of that I my toes looked beach ready for a recent vacation.  </li>
            <li> comfortable to hold, with a firm grip.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased three sets so far for my husband and I.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;file&amp;#34; is too far from the edge of the handle to use properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whoever</li>
            <li> So I have no experience with quality or professional nail clippers.</li>
            <li> Best cutting clippers I&#x27;ve used, also the most expensive.  </li>
            <li> I mean, what sounds better than an ergonomical nail clipper with a life time</li>
            <li> These clippers really are very easy to use and it actually clips your nails neatly without shattering them or causing a ragged cut that does worse damage.</li>
            <li> /&gt;were not really as long as I normally let them get before trimming but that</li>
            <li> It is not easy to get excited about nail clippers</li>
            <li> It is comfortable to hold, does not split my nails while cutting and sharp enough to do a good job.</li>
            <li> Really, I don&#x27;t think I could be happier with Clyppi and plan on possibly giving these as gifts in the future!</li>
            <li> No other incentives received.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last like the old ones 70-80&#x27;s vintage.</li>
            <li> They may not look that different from your run of the mill clippers but that&#x27;s far from reality.</li>
            <li> They are not cheap, but they are worth it.</li>
            <li> You really get god leverage on the ergonomic levers, and the blades are sharp.  </li>
            <li> Between the brushed stainless steel, file and wide design</li>
            <li> One is a large nail clipper meant for toenails and the other one is a smaller one for your fingernails.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp and can easily clip large thick or small little bits of nail easily.</li>
            <li> I can tell that it&#x27;s a high quality material compared to other cheaper clippers.</li>
            <li> reviewing this product this gets the nail right down to the cutical, no worries of hang nails left over or scratching yourself with sharp edges thats left over, this is a qaulity product and reccommend this to everyone</li>
            <li> They were professionally packed and arrived even before the due date.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I thought the price for this set was a little high.  </li>
            <li> I lost my favorite nail clipper a few weeks ago and after wasting my time with cheap nail clippers from the drugstore/supermarket that left my nails in horrible shape, I finally decided to jump on Amazon and buy highly recommended set.</li>
            <li> The fIler is metal so it should last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I think you&#x27;d have a hard time finding clippers of this quality for such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> and I anticipate them lasting a very long time.</li>
            <li> The price does pay off in the long run.</li>
            <li> I had been shopping for those kinds of clippers all morning long</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to spend this much money on nail clippers,  but I was tired of others ripping and tearing my nails instead of actually clipping them.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever bought cheap clippers and tried to cut through those thick toe nails, you know what I mean.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t slip from you hand when used wet, due to the matte brushed steel</li>
            <li> They are very sharp and actually cut the nail as apposed to pinch it off.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing these I had only used typical department store clippers like Revlon, Trim, and others.</li>
            <li> Only thing I could suggest concerning the toenail clippers is that the opening be a little wider for the toenails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying a dozen or so for gifts, may sound crazy</li>
            <li> These are built for precise cutting on your fingernails/toenails.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about them being worth it.</li>
            <li> so i wanted a few different sizes and varieties.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that the clipper is not smooth.</li>
            <li> They are made to last, are solid and have a small file pad on the handles!</li>
            <li> The Clipper is sharp and not much force is needed.  </li>
            <li> My fingernails are very soft, but toes nails are very hard.</li>
            <li> The edge of the Clyppi was so sharp I didn&#x27;t need to file my nails after trimming, which I almost always have to with others I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> They are precision sharp nail clippers.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> However, I am having to file my nails afterwards due to jagged edges and splits.  </li>
            <li> The blades are sharp, so there are no splitting nails.</li>
            <li> The ends are a bit sharp</li>
            <li> These clippers are sharp and probably will take time getting used to them.  </li>
            <li> With us desperately need clippers, I decided not to get the cheap clippers on sale at Wal-Mart and decided to buy a few sets of Clyppi - one for toenails and for my finger nails.</li>
            <li> They also don&#x27;t leave a jagged edge so sharp you must use a nail file to file them down.</li>
            <li> All the other nail clipper set we had tried previously didn&#x27;t work well,</li>
            <li> The didnt leave my nails sharp and jagged as my previous nail clippers had done (i threw them away).  </li>
            <li> They are durable and I don&#x27;t have to worry about the finish peeling, flaking, rusting or otherwise breaking down.</li>
            <li> but the bigger pair was a little hard for me to hold and navigate.</li>
            <li> My ONLY complaint would be that I wish that these had a little file with it that you could slide out.  </li>
            <li> They cut just like they should, are very sharp</li>
            <li> They are very sharp and the clip ---&amp;#62</li>
            <li> Very sharp.</li>
            <li> Quality and very sharp, will handle the thickest toe nail without any difficulty.</li>
            <li> When I placed my order I almost ordered some made by Wusthof instead (because of the name and previous knife ownership).</li>
            <li> In my early 60&#x27;s now and for some reason I had bought several different brands over and over with poor cutting performance.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first just because of the price, but i was wrong have a quality set like this does make a big difference.</li>
            <li> There seems to be a rough finish around the blades that traps the clippings though, they are a bit hard to get out.  </li>
            <li> This is a seriously heavy duty clipper set.</li>
            <li> You can tell the difference immediately when you hold them - there is a weight to them, not that they are heavy.</li>
            <li> We needed a few sets of Nail clippers.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money--lasted 90 days</li>
            <li> waste your time with cheapo clippers</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;ve tried a few before looking here for help.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard cutting my big toe nail especially, but not with these!</li>
            <li> I can clip my nails, fingernails and toenails, with very little effort which is why I wanted to try these clippers.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;simply were able to do the job or were just horrible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this effects&lt;br /&gt;your</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to apply a ton of pressure as I have had to in the past.  </li>
            <li> Very heavy duty and cut as clippers should.  </li>
            <li> But I am a clumsy oaf when it comes to nail and toe nail clippers.</li>
            <li> have to say, I have extremely thick toenails and these chopped them off like it was nothing</li>
            <li> My hubby&#x27;s toe nails r thick</li>
            <li> They are not cheap but there is a LIFETIME GUARANTEE!!</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t mean that they would quit working</li>
            <li> After some bad luck with store bought nail clippers I decided to look online, after seeing reviews for Clyppi I thought why not - it totally paid off!</li>
            <li> were useless ,they are a rip off at 4.99 much less 27.00 just a dumb dumb purchase&lt;br /&gt;CD</li>
            <li> My nails are very thick</li>
            <li> Nothing worse than &#x27;off&#x27; clippers.</li>
            <li> The blade is sharp and cuts through the nail evenly, reducing the risk of painful hangnails.</li>
            <li> The toenail trimmers worked just as well as the fingernail clippers and even held up to thick men&#x27;s toenails without bending the clipper shank and cutting effortlessly.</li>
            <li> With a lifetime guarantee you really can&#x27;t go wrong purchasing a quality product like Clyppi.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell you what brands they were but needless to say they</li>
            <li> wow...was I wrong.  </li>
            <li> Expensive, but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I have very hard toe nails that usually look horrible after trimming.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m crazy and have crazy friends.</li>
            <li> these FAILED horribly!</li>
            <li> they pinched and tore the skin...very disappointed and returned them.</li>
            <li> I hate the polished chrome clippers because they seem to slip in my fingers.</li>

            <li> This clipper is great!! I&#x27;m buying a dozen or so for gifts, may sound crazy but I&#x27;m crazy and have crazy friends.</li>
            <li> They really are the ultra cool precision tools! The Clyppi fingernail and toenail clipper set exceeds my expectations with both function and style. Made of stainless steel, the trimmers are manufactured with quality metal. They are durable and I don&#x27;t have to worry about the finish peeling, flaking, rusting or otherwise breaking down. The edge of the Clyppi was so sharp I didn&#x27;t need to file my nails after trimming, which I almost always have to with others I&#x27;ve used and they didn&#x27;t peel or split after trimming. The placement of the built in file is perfect and provides extra grip at the tip of my thumb. Between the brushed stainless steel, file and wide design I felt so confident using the Clyppi fingernail trimmers I was able to use them on my toddler as well. The toenail trimmers worked just as well as the fingernail clippers and even held up to thick men&#x27;s toenails without bending the clipper shank and cutting effortlessly. I highly recommend the Clyppi precision tools Set. With a lifetime guarantee you really can&#x27;t go wrong purchasing a quality product like Clyppi. This is the best nail clipper set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was provided with a free or discounted product in order to review this item. However, this did not influence my review. All opinions are true and my own.</li>
            <li> Say good bye to rigid, jagged nails thanks to the best nail clippers out there!  After years of using cheap quality nail clippers and toe clippers, I decided to make a change and picked up these Clyppi nail clippers after seeing the reviews.  They are precision sharp nail clippers.  You can feel the quality right out of the box.  I have very hard toe nails that usually look horrible after trimming.  These nail clippers cut my nails in one cut, straight across.  Because of that I my toes looked beach ready for a recent vacation.  My husband who has chronic ingrown toe nails has found that he hasn&#x27;t had any since using these toe nail clippers.  I let go of the baby nail clippers for my two children and just used these because they were more precise and quicker to use.  Because the nails are cut with a quality nail clipper, I have found both my toe and fingernails have been growing in very healthy and manicured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received these nail clippers for the purpose of this review, however this is my personal opinion and it was not influenced in anyway.</li>
            <li> I had the fingernail clippers already, but hadn&#x27;t had the chance to try the toenail ones!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, I have extremely thick toenails and these chopped them off like it was nothing...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design of these make it really easy to grip. Something about the design of the part where your pressing, truly does make it easy to use!!  It&#x27;s like it was designed to have a good grip with the little spot on the top of them.  My ONLY complaint would be that I wish that these had a little file with it that you could slide out.  Other than that, these are terrific!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I received these for review purposes.  However, the thoughts and opinions expressed are truly my own!</li>
            <li> GREAT CLIPPERS.  GOOD WEIGHT.  LIKE AS MUCH AS MY SEKI CLIPPERS.</li>
            <li> I ordered these clyppi nail clippers along with another brand to try.  I found them easy to hold and i liked the feel of them in the hand. The Did easily cut my nails BUT when i went to clip a hang nail and any excess skin around my nails these FAILED horribly! they pinched and tore the skin...very disappointed and returned them.</li>
            <li> This is a seriously heavy duty clipper set. My husband was very impressed with them They are made with stainless steel instead of the cheaper metal usually used with nail clippers. You can tell the difference immediately when you hold them - there is a weight to them, not that they are heavy. The mechanism works very smoothly and trims nails quickly and without leaving any bits. They are a bit pricey but if you clip a lot of nails I would say they would be worth it.</li>
            <li> These are great. They look stylish, very sharp, easy to use, and feel substantial in my hands - much better than a cheap-o drugstore version. They came in a nice carrying case too. I&#x27;m glad I got both sizes and am happy to have them in my manicure set.</li>
            <li> These are the best nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned!  They are not cheap but there is a LIFETIME GUARANTEE!! So the only thing to worry about is losing them (or someone swiping them!). I very highly recommend them for nearly anyone. These are not the $2 or 3 ones you buy that break after you use them 4 or 5 times. These are about as well made as possible.  I would rate these a very high 9.25 to 9.75 - nearly perfec!</li>
            <li> These are great and well made.</li>
            <li> Very well made, cuts clean. They feel solid in your hand</li>
            <li> The clippers are excellent. They are the best built and functional clippers I have ever used. When I placed my order I almost ordered some made by Wusthof instead (because of the name and previous knife ownership). I’m glad I stuck with my original decision. The clippers don’t flex as much as cheaper clippers under pressure which greatly decreases the effort of clipping and improves the accuracy and cleanness of the cut. They produce a nicely finished cut without mashing the nail or crimping it off.  The larger than standard size of the fingernail clippers also makes using them much more comfortable and increases the clipping leverage. This ultimately makes the process easier, which in turn improves the cut.</li>
            <li> These are well made and the angle of the blade is just right. The toenail clipper is fantastic. Nice and clean line which doesn&#x27;t leave that tear which can cause in bedded nails. (Ouch!) The nail clipper was not as crisp in its cut. Still good and sooooo much better than others I have used but I was hoping for it to be as good as the toenail clipper.</li>
            <li> worst clippers I have ever tried I couldn&#x27;t even use the toe nail clippers to clip my fingernails they weren&#x27;t strong enough.both pairs of clippers were useless ,they are a rip off at 4.99 much less 27.00 just a dumb dumb purchase&lt;br /&gt;CD</li>
            <li> My parents received a Clyppi set for Christmas.  We think that these are a great product.  I actually haven&#x27;t needed to do any maintenance with them at this time, as I used my parents set - and that went wonderfully, thank you.  That was the reason I went out and bought a set for myself.</li>
            <li> great product very well designed, this feel and look great.&lt;br /&gt;Got it for discounted price but the original price is well worth it.</li>
            <li> Best nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever had. They provide a clean perfect cut on my nails without any resistance. My nails are very thick and it&#x27;s hard cutting my big toe nail especially, but not with these! Love em!</li>
            <li> I received my Clyppi set and was pretty excited to use them. My nails&lt;br /&gt;were not really as long as I normally let them get before trimming but that&lt;br /&gt;is a better testament to the quality of the clippers not having as much to&lt;br /&gt;work with. Like most people I&#x27;ve used a variety of clippers throughout my&lt;br /&gt;life. I couldn&#x27;t tell you what brands they were but needless to say they&lt;br /&gt;simply were able to do the job or were just horrible. A lot of them just&lt;br /&gt;crack the nails or can&#x27;t even cut them. The Clyppi set goes way beyond just&lt;br /&gt;being able to do the job. They are by far the best set of clippers I have&lt;br /&gt;ever used. They aren&#x27;t the highest price but they aren&#x27;t that cheap either&lt;br /&gt;so I was skeptical about them being worth it. I&#x27;m not sure how this effects&lt;br /&gt;your business strategy but these are so great I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever need&lt;br /&gt;another pair unless I lose them. Ha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I was thinking about ordering another pair today for my father. No&lt;br /&gt;doubt he will be impressed. Kind of strange to get excited about nail&lt;br /&gt;clippers but it is what it is.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great, I used them last night. Very comfortable to hold and easy to use. They also seem plenty sharp which is nice as well. Nice clean cut.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and easy to to use. These are high quality stainless steel clippers, with a great brushed finish. I hate the polished chrome clippers because they seem to slip in my fingers. These do not. They have a very precise, sharp edge and allows me to get a very clean cut when trimming my nails. I appreciate the level of quality. These are not your average drug store clippers, so if you want quality implements, these are great.</li>
            <li> These sturdy clippers make nice clean cuts.  There is an emery type surface for sanding on the backside of each clipper.  Weight is perfect for easy grasp and use.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing</li>
            <li> They are your pretty standard nail clippers at first glance. Once you open them there is a little file on the thumb lever which I found useful for quick cleanups but I don&#x27;t expect it to replace my regular file. Overall they are nice little clippers and will be added to my collection for regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note, I was provided a discounted unit for review.</li>
            <li> My wife had ordered these for our son when he went off to college recently.  He&#x27;s had a chronic problem with an ingrown toenail, and we wanted to make sure that he had some good quality nail clippers.  Well, let&#x27;s just say that these clippers are the bomb!  They do such a precise job, and leave you with a smooth, clean cut.  No need for filing.  My wife showed them to her parents, and they immediately ordered a set for themselves.  I think you&#x27;d have a hard time finding clippers of this quality for such a reasonable price. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> These are very high quality, and cut cleanly. The stainless steel is matte, so it doesn&#x27;t slip. Note that this model doesn&#x27;t include a &amp;#34;nail cleaner&amp;#34; (I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a technical name for that part), but does have the file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was offered at a discount in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> NOT AS GOOD ASI EXPECTED FOR THE PRICE</li>
            <li> I thought the price for this set was a little high.  Once i received it I immediately understood the reason for the price. These are high quality, precision made clippers. You can feel it the second you pick them up. They work great and I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Excellent so far.  Appears to be very well made and should be durable.  Question as to why the toe nail clippers is curved rather that straight, buyt it worked well.  Also, used the toe nail on fingers and it was easier to use than the smaller finger nail clippers.  I would have only purchased the toe had I known that ahead of time.  Well pleased.</li>
            <li> We needed a few sets of Nail clippers. I think there are socks you just lose them overtime. I do a lot of traveling so i wanted a few different sizes and varieties. These are great for my finger nails because they are frail and tiny. When I saw this set on a promotional price I just had to add them to my collection. These are perfect for your feet nails or fingers. They have a nice grib and make it easy to clip without getting hang nails!</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband.  He really likes them.</li>
            <li> i like the size of these..they are easy to handle and they clip sharp and really well.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of nail clippers at home, most of them do half-done job and most, don&#x27;t even work.It is not easy to get excited about nail clippers but  when i receive Clyppi Nail Clippers they deserved a look and appreciation. Once i took them out of the packaging they had nice quality weight to them, not like the cheap drugstore/dollar clippers found every where. They are made of high quality stainless steel with a beautiful brushed metal finish.&lt;br /&gt;These Clyppi Nail Clipper are a quality set. Below i will list some pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;They are very well made. The design is very stylish.&lt;br /&gt;They cut the nails very quietly and effortlessly .&lt;br /&gt;Very comfortable to hold, with a firm grip.&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t slip from you hand when used wet, due to the matte brushed steel finish.&lt;br /&gt;They come in two sizes, which is perfect for adults and kids.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t find any after using them couple of times by me and my family. If anything comes up, i will sure to update this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now about the packaging and shipping. They were professionally packed and arrived even before the due date.&lt;br /&gt;I got these clippers for testing and to review them honestly. I am glad that i did. Now i will never buy those drug store nail clippers which don&#x27;t do the job properly yet cost a lot. I was skeptical at first just because of the price, but i was wrong have a quality set like this does make a big difference. The price does pay off in the long run. Any one looking for quality/professional nail clippers should buy them without worrying. Overall its a Five star product.</li>
            <li> These are built for precise cutting on your fingernails/toenails. reviewing this product this gets the nail right down to the cutical, no worries of hang nails left over or scratching yourself with sharp edges thats left over, this is a qaulity product and reccommend this to everyone</li>
            <li> These clippers are of the highest craftsmanship that I&#x27;ve seen, regarding nail clippers. They are made to last, are solid and have a small file pad on the handles! Just brilliant and very handy!! I absolutely LOVE the smaller set but the bigger pair was a little hard for me to hold and navigate. If I didn&#x27;t hold the bigger pair just right, they seemed to be dull, which they are not, it was just the way I was able to hold them. But the smaller pair was very easy to hold onto and to use, very sharp! I recommend this product!! Thank you for the chance to review this product and for the discounted price. I&#x27;m sure to use this set for a very long time to come.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a good set of clippers and have bought several. Clyppi clippers are the best and sharpest that I&#x27;ve found so far hands down.</li>
            <li> I love these nail clippers.  I&#x27;ve purchased three sets so far for my husband and I.  I purchased the third set when someone took his from an unlocked  pouch on the front of his suitcase.  I guess everyone loves them.  It will be my go to stocking stuffer for the rest of the family this Christmas.  You really get god leverage on the ergonomic levers, and the blades are sharp.  They are not cheap, but they are worth it.</li>
            <li> These are very good, however the two complaints I have are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needs a larger hole on the end in order to attach it to a lanyard or keychain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;file&amp;#34; is too far from the edge of the handle to use properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whoever designed this does not clip his/her own nails!</li>
            <li> Nice set, good value for the money.  They are lightweight, the grips are easy to hold and use, and the blades seem sharp.  There seems to be a rough finish around the blades that traps the clippings though, they are a bit hard to get out.  Made in China.</li>
            <li> Really sturdy nail clippers. Recommended.</li>
            <li> This set is awesome. I would recommend this set to everyone who has a need for nail clippers.&lt;br /&gt;Great quality and will last many years.</li>
            <li> Best and sharpest clippers I&#x27;ve ever used.  Great quality.</li>
            <li> We received them and they are great, we are planning on ordering another set to have with our travel gear. They are very sharp and actually cut the nail as apposed to pinch it off. I am ordering my second set now. Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> Awesome nail clippers very well made 100% stainless steel.This is a great gift or great buy for a gift or just to keep.You get two clippers for the price of one.I have bought so many bail clippers over the years that are so cheap made n break first use,I wanted to try out something new .I sure put these to the test day one .With a family of 5 liked me you sure gotta have nail clippers in the house .These clippers cut your nail s in a breeze no pulling or tugging it to make the nail come off like most clippers one snip n that&#x27;s all the nail falls right off.These clippers are great for men or women and you can use the small pair for women n large for men,or the small set for finger nails n big set for toe nails either way works fine because they cut the first try.Im simple impressed they cut thick,thin so easy.My hubby&#x27;s toe nails r thick n he&#x27;s a diabetic n it&#x27;s hard yo use just any kind of clippers but these have been the only ones he loves using,get your clippers today you will not by another pair after I try these out.</li>
            <li> I will be honest, nail clippers don&#x27;t last very long in our household, especially all the different sets. We only had one pair that really worked and when that was lost, we were in trouble. We used this for everything, including finger nails and toe nails, which wasn&#x27;t very efficient.  All the other nail clipper set we had tried previously didn&#x27;t work well, rusted quickly, or just fall apart. In all honesty, I was certain that I would never find the best nail clippers, especially one for pedicures, for us to use. With us desperately need clippers, I decided not to get the cheap clippers on sale at Wal-Mart and decided to buy a few sets of Clyppi - one for toenails and for my finger nails. I mean, what sounds better than an ergonomical nail clipper with a life time guarantee?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying their nail clipper, I have to say that I am very impressed. These clippers really are very easy to use and it actually clips your nails neatly without shattering them or causing a ragged cut that does worse damage. I also love that these nail clippers have their own built in nail file that is easy to use and perfect for doing pedicures or manicures. Really, I don&#x27;t think I could be happier with Clyppi and plan on possibly giving these as gifts in the future! A must for any lady!</li>
            <li> I got my Clyppi Nail Clipper Set in the mail today. They come in a quality package and the first surprise I got was their weight. Not sure why a heavier set of clippers feels better but it does. They feel like a good solid item that will last. They have a great design with a shape that fits nicely in your hand and everything about them says quality. I tried them out at once and was impressed. They cut just like they should, are very sharp and I anticipate them lasting a very long time. I received my Clyppi set at a discount in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> I received a discount on these clippers in exchange for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;This is the BEST set of nail clippers I have ever owned. The first I did when I opened them was to make sure the clip ends were level. PERFECT!!! They are very sharp and the clip ---&amp;#62; smooth! :) Nothing worse than &#x27;off&#x27; clippers. These clippers a strong and durable. They are a very comfortable fit in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for some great clippers, don&#x27;t waste your money on those cheap things you will have to replace in a couple weeks. BUY THIS SET!!!</li>
            <li> It is a great item, clips as it should! I would love to order more, especially for the premium stainless finish!</li>
            <li> comfortable to hold and easy to use. i got this at discounted price.thanks</li>
            <li> This is a nice little set of nail clippers. One is a large nail clipper meant for toenails and the other one is a smaller one for your fingernails. They feel strong and durable. They cut my nails easily and they gave a clean cut. I would have liked the nail clippers to have a file though because I am used to using nail clippers with a file. I would have liked it on the toenail clipper at least. I do use files a lot to help clean underneath the nails. Other than that though, these do work well and do the job. I bought these with a discount and I am pleased that they cut my nails nicely.</li>
            <li> Nail clippers are excellent. Only thing I could suggest concerning the toenail clippers is that the opening be a little wider for the toenails.</li>
            <li> Very nice clippers! Strong &amp; reliable. You can feel how sturdy there are the moment you pick up the package. I&#x27;ve been clipping my nails with ease since I received them, no fraying, no tearing. These are EXACTLY as described in the product information, love them!</li>
            <li> I love my new clyppi today!  Love the fact they are stainless steel and will not rust when left in the wet shower.  I used them tonight and well they cut mighty fine.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money--lasted 90 days and then the handle broke off.</li>
            <li> Very nice set of clippers.  Very heavy duty and cut as clippers should.  I received a discount to honestly review the product.</li>
            <li> Ergonomic. My fingers fit nicely and don&#x27;t slip!</li>
            <li> I bought this set of clippers, honestly, because it had the best rating.  I see why they have the best rating, as these are very good clippers.  I&#x27;ve always bought the cheap clippers because I figured there was no difference....wow...was I wrong.  These clippers actually cut the nail, not break it like the cheapies.  Also, a lot of thought was put into the design...the textured finish and the double slots cut into the handle make them easy to grip, even if your hands are wet.  Also, there&#x27;s a nail file integrated into the handle.  This is a feature that I&#x27;ll likely never use, but thought it was worth mentioning.</li>
            <li> These are the best nail clippers I have ever purchased. They cut very well and feel good in your hand. They seem to have that high quality look and feel which, is exactly what I was looking for. I&#x27;m sure they will give me years of service. I have been buying drug store clippers for years you the type.. They don&#x27;t last like the old ones 70-80&#x27;s vintage.</li>
            <li> These clippers are very strong and appear well made.  However, I am having to file my nails afterwards due to jagged edges and splits.  I have not had this problem to this extent with regular cheap clippers.</li>
            <li> It works well. The only problem is that the clipper is not smooth.</li>
            <li> I have always used whatever was at hand. If I needed a new pair I purchased inexpensive ones from the drugstore. These are amazing they actually clip your nail as opposed to tearing it!</li>
            <li> These are the best nail clipper I ever owned. The nail clips are so sharp, leave your nail with clean cut that does not require filing. The clipper is solid stainless steel, look and feel very nice. I also really enjoy the Matte finish and the little filer on the clipper handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great nail clipper. I am planing to buy more to replace my other ones.</li>
            <li> Great product, production is very beautiful, I like</li>
            <li> I love these clippers so much I had to order a second set. I leave one in  my traveling bag so that I never forget it. They just seem so sharp and  precise compared to most other clippers I&#x27;ve used. Love your product!</li>
            <li> I am quite pleased with both the quality and function of my Clyppi Nail Clipper Set.</li>
            <li> At first  when I recieved them they look like &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; clippers. After using them a couple of times I do like how they work. I don&#x27;t even have to file my nails after using them. My fingernails are very soft, but toes nails are very hard. The toe clippers didn&#x27;t break on the first clip. No plastic parts on them. And will be showing  them to my friend and family.</li>
            <li> These clippers are metal with no plastic that will snap or break.  There is a filer on the clipper itself which is not that easy to use, only if the filter was larger.  The fIler is metal so it should last a long time.  The Clipper is sharp and not much force is needed.  The one thing that i didn&#x27;t like about the clipper is metal rubber against metal sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:  Deep discount received for reviewing product.  No other incentives received.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to spend this much money on nail clippers,  but I was tired of others ripping and tearing my nails instead of actually clipping them.  (In a pinch,  I can use my fingernails as a screwdriver.)  surprisingly,  these are strong and sharp enough to actually clip my nails.  Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> LIke a lot of the other people, i didnt think i would write a review on nail clippers but these ones are really much better than a regular nail clipper.  They felt very strong and cut very easily.  The didnt leave my nails sharp and jagged as my previous nail clippers had done (i threw them away).  Although pricey, a great buy.  I was also very impressed by the email from the CEO!</li>
            <li> Love it . Very sharp. Cuts great !!</li>
            <li> It is great to finally have some nail clippers that actually cut the nails instead of crushing them apart. I love &#x27;em. If I lose either one I will replace right away. Thanks Clyppi.</li>
            <li> Ok I can definitely tell you what these clippers DONT do. They don&#x27;t split your nails when you use them. They also don&#x27;t leave a jagged edge so sharp you must use a nail file to file them down. That part I really like because sometimes I don&#x27;t have the time or the nail file on hand to do this. They are able to cut and shape without any filing.  They are very strong metal, so I don&#x27;t see a way of these coming apart like so many other clippers have done. These are all metal, no plastic parts to break, snap or disintegrate. The larger nail file is perfect for clipping toenails or nails that are thicker and harder to cut. They also have  a  nice modern look to them  so they are perfect for a man or a woman. When they say precision I really didn&#x27;t understand that until I used these clippers. They are very sharp and can easily clip large thick or small little bits of nail easily. You don&#x27;t have to apply a ton of pressure as I have had to in the past.  Where you clip is where it trims the nail. Very nice quality set for anyone on your gift list.</li>
            <li> Great purchase for our family. Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> The best clippers I&#x27;ve ever used. They may not look that different from your run of the mill clippers but that&#x27;s far from reality. They&#x27;re sharp, easy to hold, finely made out of quality steel. I can&#x27;t reco these enough.</li>
            <li> I love&lt;br /&gt;it. It works really well!</li>
            <li> I really like these clippers - they do not hurt your hands when you use them. They are also very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but gets the job done. I feel these will never break on me, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> Quality and very sharp, will handle the thickest toe nail without any difficulty. The pair came in a nice soft black case.</li>
            <li> I received them, have used them, and I love them. They are easy to use, work really well, and feel like they will last a lifetime. Nice job!</li>
            <li> I only received one of two of these clippers. It was really nice though, good quality and does a lovely job. I received this as a review deal.</li>
            <li> I lost my favorite nail clipper a few weeks ago and after wasting my time with cheap nail clippers from the drugstore/supermarket that left my nails in horrible shape, I finally decided to jump on Amazon and buy highly recommended set. I made a great choice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife and I love these nail clippers as they do the job very well...whether you have smaller hands or large toes, these things cut cleanly with ease. The wider handle make them easier to, well, &amp;#34;handle&amp;#34;, and construction seems sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your time with cheapo clippers...spend the extra $ to get a real set!</li>
            <li> Before purchasing these I had only used typical department store clippers like Revlon, Trim, and others. So I have no experience with quality or professional nail clippers. In my early 60&#x27;s now and for some reason I had bought several different brands over and over with poor cutting performance. Could be partly because of the quality of manufacturing with these brands in this day and age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I trimmed my toenails and fingernails tonight and I can really tell the difference with Clyppi. They cut smooth and easy. So I am very happy with my purchase. If they continue to perform this way in the coming years (and I think they will) maybe they will last me the remainder of my lifetime!</li>
            <li> Very solid, well made clippers.  I have some medical issues in my hands that have reduced my strength. These two clippers are just perfect.  I can use either hand to clip my finger and toe nails with no problems.  I love them.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice nail clipper set! You can tell that is made of high quality. The larger and the smaller set allows for all size nails from kids to adults...and can also be used as his and hers. The blade is sharp and cuts through the nail evenly, reducing the risk of painful hangnails. We could not be happier with this purchase! discounted for honest and unbiased opinion</li>
            <li> Best cutting clippers I&#x27;ve used, also the most expensive.  A prime example of &#x27;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Great set!  Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>
            <li> After some bad luck with store bought nail clippers I decided to look online, after seeing reviews for Clyppi I thought why not - it totally paid off! Much better than any pair of nail clippers that you can buy in the store today. I know I&#x27;ve tried a few before looking here for help. I&#x27;d buy these as gifts for family and friends!</li>
            <li> The clippers work great. The blades are sharp, so there are no splitting nails. That&#x27;s the most important thing of the clippers. I like the construction of the body. I can tell that it&#x27;s a high quality material compared to other cheaper clippers.</li>
            <li> They work great and as always Amazon is a good place to do business.</li>
            <li> Good quality and comfort.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the quality of the Clyppi.  I got one for fingernails, as well as one for toenails.  They both work exceptionally well. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Stop reading these reviews and buy your Clyppi now! I have always used the cheap dollar store nail clippers and about a year ago bought my first Clyppi. I bought the second time because my wife wont stop stealing mine! They are the best clippers I have ever used and even after a year the first ones are sharper than ever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed by this product. It is a very nice stainless steel quality. The clipper is precise and doesn&#x27;t make that &#x27;click&#x27; noise when you cut a nail. It is smooth and feels like it will last you a long time. I tried it right away and was highly impressed by the build and quality. It doesn&#x27;t have a pull-out under the nail cleaner that most clippers come with, but they did add a nice inner nail filer which I hadn&#x27;t seen before. It is modern, built to last, and does the job very well. Would recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> Immediately could tell they were quality clippers.  They fit nicely in my hand, had a nice weight, and appeared to be of medical grade metal. I have consistently bought my clippers at the dollar store. They were cheap looking and did not cut nails well.  Clyppi nail clippers are sharp and cut the nail cleanly.  Like having a file on the clipper,but wish it would extend the length of the bottom of clipper.  (More surface area needed.  i received this product at a reduced price and promised to give a honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Great set of clippers. Only reason I give this a 4 star because of its price. It is comfortable to hold, does not split my nails while cutting and sharp enough to do a good job. I can tell from its look that it is made of good quality stainless steel and that it will not rust. The ends are a bit sharp therefore you would have to pay attention to it. Otherwise, no complaints​. It looks very sleek too. **This product was received either at no or low cost for review, inspection and testing purposes. No compensation for a positive review was provided. All of my reviews are based 100% off of my experience with the product and I never guarantee a positive review.</li>
            <li> The clippers are very well built and sturdy. I love the file inside of the top it&#x27;s very convenient. They clip well and are easy to handle. I have 4 sets of fingers and toes to clip when I use them so I appreciate the durability of them. I would recommend these to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was offered this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> my husband &amp; i are both very happy with the clyppi set ; we are glad with the purchase...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know anyone that would not be happy with their nail clipper set.  If you&#x27;ve ever bought cheap clippers and tried to cut through those thick toe nails, you know what I mean.  I can clip my nails, fingernails and toenails, with very little effort which is why I wanted to try these clippers.  I have arthritis in my hands and I have to buy products that are easy to use now.  They are stainless steel so I&#x27;m sure they are going to last and outlast me.  They look nice, work great, are easy to hold and I would definitely select this set again for purchase if anything happens to mine and I don&#x27;t mean that they would quit working, I mean my daughters borrow stuff and never return it lol.  This set would be a great Christmas stocking stuffer for the men and women on your gift giving list and of course you&#x27;ll want a set for yourself.</li>
            <li> Never going back to regular ($1) nail clippers lol.  These clippers are sharp and probably will take time getting used to them.  I cut some of my nails too short.  Next time i&#x27;ll do it right.</li>
            <li> I had a chance to  use my new Clyppi nail  clippers and love how sharp and clean they cut! I even clipped my cat&#x27;s nails with them and he didn&#x27;t even notice that I was clipping his claws!&lt;br /&gt;Also, the clippers are made well and have a sleek design.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for making the Clyppi!</li>
            <li> Yes I have received the clipper set and find it to be an outstanding product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the same time I bought your product I purchased another set from DuQue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The DuQue set is definitely inferior to the Clyppi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Clyppi is solid and cuts cleanly and evenly every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is comfortable to hold and gives me the impression of quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering another set of Clyppi Fingernail and Toenail Clippers for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for making a quality product and caring about your customers.</li>
            <li> These are by far the best set of clippers I have ever had.... Thank you for your concern with how I felt about this product you have gone above and beyond...</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t the merchant&#x27;s fault that I thought that these Clippers head rubber kids on the points where the fingers touch. I had been shopping for those kinds of clippers all morning long and when I saw the design on these I just assumed that they would have rubber on them too. They don&#x27;t. But as far as how they are balanced and how they feel in the palm of the hand, I haven&#x27;t had a pair of clippers that are this easy to work.  They&#x27;re worth every penny.  But I am a clumsy oaf when it comes to nail and toe nail clippers. So I have to continue to look for something that accommodates for that. I&#x27;ll keep these but my search continues.</li>
