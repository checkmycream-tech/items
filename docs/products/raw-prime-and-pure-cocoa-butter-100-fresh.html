            <li>also, I figure there has to already be some kind of processing just to get the cocoa butter separated in the first place...</li>
            <li>Great price, melts and combines with other ingredients nicely.</li>
            <li>The texture is fine but the smell is...awful.</li>
            <li>This item worked fine.</li>
            <li>Works just fine for my dyi projects..</li>
            <li>This cocoa butter works fine</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>The cocoa  butter  arrived  quickly  and smelled  lovely.</li>
            <li>I used this to make hand/face cream - it is delightful - put it on it is like smoothing chocolate across your face without the mess...</li>
            <li>Pure amazing coco butter.</li>
            <li>Product quality was excellent and of very high quality, will definitely order again.</li>
            <li>The chocolate smell is heavenly and it melts perfectly smooth.</li>
            <li>Smooth and &amp;#34;melt in your mouth&amp;#34; creamy.</li>
            <li>The scent is fabulous.</li>
            <li>I love the consistency of this butter, it smells like fresh chocolate.</li>
            <li>The quality seems genuine.</li>
            <li>This is such a great product.</li>
            <li>will order through another company that also sells on here and has a far superior product..</li>
            <li>Smells good, has proper consistency, serves the purpose to which I ordered it for, and would buy it again if I need more</li>
            <li>So far so good in my lotion bar recipe.</li>
            <li>Good, fresh, fast.  </li>
            <li>This product smells SO good, it reminds me of being young and smearing it all over my body.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it to make my own lotion and this cocoa butter is of high quality and is easy to work with.</li>
            <li>I just love the feel of my skin after the butter is applied soaks right into it,and leaves my skin soft smooth and smelling good.  </li>
            <li>This is some of the best raw cocoa butter I have purchased.  </li>
            <li>Raw and delicious.</li>
            <li>It arrived very quickly and it was good and solid.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so rich and buttery.</li>
            <li>I mix it with sweet almond oil and any cheap lotion I can find</li>
            <li>Rich, creamy,</li>
            <li>Plus it is much more affordable than the other scar treatments and all natural!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>To be fair,  we have bought this product before and it was fine but the last batch we got smelled like smoke and we couldn&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li>It feels amazing on the skin, it&#x27;s so hydrating, and can be used in many different ways.</li>
            <li>It melted into the other oils &amp; beeswax beautifully.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive my package on SUPERBOWL SUNDAY that I forgot to weigh it to see if it was a full pound as ordered.  </li>
            <li>just right!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the sweet cocoa butter smell</li>
            <li>The packaging seemed a bit rustic, but good enough to not spill anything.</li>
            <li>They made the chocolate peppermint lotion bars smell good enough to eat!!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if you can use it for consumption, but it smells good enough too.</li>
            <li>I have gotten several comments on how good it smells.</li>
            <li>I love how it turned out,  This cocoa butter is so creamy and smells absolutely divine.  </li>
            <li>I even use it as a suntan lotion, I have read that they can be used a a natural sunscreen, but or course do your own research.</li>
            <li>Such a good value.</li>
            <li>Myself and my daughters are all fair skined and need extra moisture.</li>
            <li>but I paid full price</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell as strong at first</li>
            <li>It has a strong chocolate smell at first but wears off quickly.</li>
            <li>I bought the cocoa butter to add to other oils, smells great.</li>
            <li>i ordered the raw cocoa butter which came very quickly, smells great.</li>
            <li>The scent is perfect and subtle for my lotion bars.  </li>
            <li>This item shipped quickly and was just what I was hoping it was.  </li>
            <li>The order came quickly.</li>
            <li>The cocoa aroma is so yummy and mild.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>I love being able to get this in pure form as I like to use all natural products both inside and out.  </li>
            <li>this works great for my applications (melting down to add to lotions).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not concerned that it was melted &amp; poured, as I&#x27;ll be melting it anyways to make my projects...</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to any lotions, so I know with this, I am safe</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about to order my second bag - I love this product!</li>
            <li>It is exactly as described and has a rich cocoa aroma.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what we needed!</li>
            <li>/&gt;~Keep calm and Craft</li>
            <li>I have had mine for almost a year and it still seems fresh.</li>
            <li>Fresh.</li>
            <li>I know it says 100 percent fresh</li>
            <li>It smells fresh and it arrived well packaged.  </li>
            <li>Id say this product is for anyone who wants baby soft skin warm it up in the microwave and apply.</li>
            <li>Compared to natural moisturizers, especially with cocoa butter this is a great deal</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth noting.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You know, so I can quit using hydrogenated oils for pie crust, a nice solid fat for vegan pudding, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>this was by far better than the shea...</li>
            <li>I can use it on my most sensitive areas and it leaves me feel moisturized and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li>and it was well worth it. . .</li>
            <li>smells sooooooooo good and is so easy to use cut a small piece</li>
            <li>Super Fast Delivery!</li>
            <li>I love buying raw butters to make my own lotions.  </li>
            <li>Cocoa butter is known for its moisturizing qualities, and is really good on scrapes due to its restorative properties, making it a must-have for skin care.  </li>
            <li>Yes, just right.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure they sent me something old.</li>
            <li>however, the scent is so very strong that it overpowers the essential oils that I used it with.  </li>
            <li>This product was clean (no foreign matter) &amp; has a rich chocolate aroma.</li>
            <li>The cocoa butter quickly seeped through its packaging, and then sprinkled through the very mailing box it arrived in.</li>
            <li>but was surprised that once the lotion is applied the chocolate scent isn&#x27;t strong at all.  </li>
            <li>I took a piece and put some on my hands which honestly I am always so ashamed of showing because they are so dry.  </li>
            <li>In is naturally fragrant and melts easily to body temperature.</li>
            <li>You can use it for personal care products, like making your own lotions, scrubs, soaps, etc., but what you are really going to want to do it use it in cooking.  </li>
            <li>I scooped the white, fluffy body butter into a variety of containers with lids to save &amp; give as gifts; turned out great!</li>
            <li>Well, the easiest way get a sharp knife and this cuts real easy without alot of efford.  </li>
            <li>no leakage around the bottle and very bland smell but goes great with the product that I made my chapstick with and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I like the product very much</li>
            <li>and I have always pleased with the product I receive, This last order of Shea Butter when I opened it</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>This was the first batch of cocoa butter I ordered.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Ready to make Body Butter!</li>
            <li>It melts well on the skin and our cocoa chunks were perfectly sized -not too big, yet not too small either...</li>
            <li>It helps to run your hands under hot water with the cocoa butter in the palm of your hand to melt it a little.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This cocoa butter really exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li>I plan on purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase more from this seller.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like the natural scent, buy the scent free.</li>
            <li>I used this product to make my first batch of homemade soap.</li>
            <li>It seems greasy at first when applying it but keeping massaging into feet and it will absorb.</li>
            <li>This was my first purchase of cocoa butter</li>
            <li>A little bit dry BUT its a excellent quality.</li>
            <li>It melted nicely and combined with the other ingrediants I had to make a stellar hand cream.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product to make my own lotion and other products.  </li>
            <li>and it was a nice addition to my other oils.</li>
            <li>I am starting to use all natural products and making my own lotions.</li>
            <li>it goes rancid pretty fast unless.</li>
            <li>These came in the larger discs to melt and they melted really easily.</li>
            <li>easy to cut chunks off, double bagged so packaged well.</li>
            <li>I easily break it into about 4 smaller pieces.</li>
            <li>100% pure?</li>
            <li>Fresh raw cocoa buter is moist/ smooth and has the rich smell of chocolate.</li>
            <li>stuff is probably fine for topical body products, but not yummy to eat.</li>
            <li>It came as a giant block which I broke up using a huge knife.</li>
            <li>thanks, Gail</li>
            <li>While mine seemed sorta old and crystallized in spots, it still smelled fresh and worked for my uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s absolute garbage this time.</li>
            <li>What I really didn&#x27;t like is the consistency it gave my chocolates.</li>
            <li>It is much chewier and waxier.</li>
            <li>It shipped fast and it worked well on the cream I wanted to make</li>
            <li>Nothing beats high quality coco butter!.</li>
            <li>I used it in my body butter recipe and it turned out really well.</li>
            <li>Not broken up.</li>
            <li>It seems really nice.&lt;br /&gt;Now, the reason for 4 stars is because of weight.</li>
            <li>I really like</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Shipped fast and was packaged well.</li>
            <li>I did not realize how much cocoa butter I was receiving with my order.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it  with another product and it blends very well.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing and absorbs into your skin like a dream.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The package the cocoa butter came in was much like a deli salad container</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much at a time either, so it lasts for quite awhile.</li>
            <li>And its price is very affordable,</li>
            <li>and it still has a very over powering aroma.</li>
            <li>Mission Accomplished.</li>
            <li>1lb isn&#x27;t that much if you plan to make a lot of body butter with it.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>real cocoa you can smell thru the box&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>This product very fresh,  I do not like to melt this to place in my butters as not the same.</li>
            <li>It does smell good though, maybe a little more toasty than my usual stuff.</li>
            <li>Pure cocoa butter is a main ingredient in my homemade body butter.  </li>
            <li>they told me that is normal!  </li>
            <li>this is by far the best, massaging my scars with this a few times a day is breaking down even the thickest parts of scar tissue.</li>
            <li>I purchase this along with shea butter, coconut oil, sweet almond oil &amp; some essential oils to make body butter.  </li>
            <li>This one seems as though it had been melted down on put in a more compact container.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was also decent.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li>This is my first time purchasing raw cocoa butter, so I admit that I had no idea about what I was getting into, but just be prepared that you may have to mix the cocoa butter with another type of oil OR plan to warm a bit of it in the microwave daily to melt it for use.</li>
            <li>Well that is not the normal</li>
            <li>I have ordered it several times and it is always fresh.</li>
            <li>It comes in a plastic screw-top jar, in medium-small sized chunks that can easily be shaved down with a knife.</li>
            <li>At first i thought because it wz cold on the day i gt it and wz 26degrees, but even with me putting it on top of the stove so the heat from the pilot light will melt it..</li>
            <li>I did not notice until it was ALL OVER the leather interior of my brand new car.</li>
            <li>I live in Las Vegas, and my family</li>
            <li>The raw form is always better than processed for my purposes.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>I suspect this is either very old or processed.</li>
            <li>Very soft and moisturizing</li>
            <li>No random chemicals, especially fragrances and preservatives</li>
            <li>they were probably the first on the market, and still one of the only producers.</li>
            <li>I was waiting on exactly 1lb of cocoa butter and this cocoa butter was about .2lb short.</li>
            <li>I was a little concerned that I would smell strongly of chocolate once I applied the lotion</li>
            <li>It had been melted down to fit into the container I was given.</li>
            <li>Cacao/Cocoa butter is quite rare and 95% of what is being sold as raw right now isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>THIS IS NOT RAW COCOA BUTTER.  </li>
            <li>This is so soft, you can rub it directly on your skin!</li>
            <li>and I LIKE the sweet smell I&#x27;ve found in other cocoa butters</li>
            <li>My feet don&#x27;t seems to dry and crack as much since I wear flip-flops and sandals very often.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really rate it in comparison to other products, since this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used Cocoa Butter.</li>
            <li>My cocoa butter has a strong smell, but soft in comparison to raw cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>They blended really well with the beeswax, coconut oil and the shea butter and non of my lotion bars felt grainy or gritty.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin soft and even tone.</li>
            <li>and wow, I looked at my hands they looked moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I apply this product directly to my skin.</li>
            <li>And after handling the butter my hands are soft all day.</li>
            <li>I weighed the butter and was pleasantly surprised to find it weighed well over a pound.</li>
            <li>I know many have complained at the packaging</li>
            <li>If you want natural then that is what you get.</li>
            <li>How is that unrefined???&lt;br /&gt;The picture shows a hunk of stuff in its natural state.</li>
            <li>I must say I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and in myself for making the soap.</li>
            <li>i was expecting something soft n pastier.</li>
            <li>I melt it down with coconut oil and let it cool, then I whip it up and add a bit of Vitamin E oil.</li>
            <li>Raw PRIME &amp; PURE Cocoa Butter 100% Fresh 1lb]]</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more yellow in color than the other brand, with a different smell.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s authentic from the tropics, try it and see what I mean</li>
            <li>It smells nice, but I expected raw unrefined cocoa butter</li>
            <li>Seriously this stuff is like magic</li>
            <li>I bought it to rub on scars from recent surgery and the pieces are too small to be able to do that or anything else with</li>
            <li>It really does seem to live up to the claims of being raw and 100% pure.</li>
            <li>It feels solid and hard, but creamy and nice at the same time.</li>
            <li>The fragrance and flavor has the distinct essence of dark chocolate.</li>
            <li>It smells just like unsweetened cocoa powder, in other words not as sweet smelling as chocolate with milk and sugar, but just like regular cocoa.</li>
            <li>This brand provides some decent quality, and they waste no time with pretty packaging.  </li>
            <li>Minuses were  the  cost was higher  than other sites and</li>
            <li>True raw cocoa butter is not processed in any way.</li>
            <li>Because its really pure fresh and tasty, the only thing i did not like its  i wait little long time to receive it</li>
            <li>but, I know it&#x27;s important to some ppl that the least amount of &amp;#34;processing&amp;#34; is done, so</li>
            <li>After several minutes, it become light &amp; fluffy like merengue!  </li>
            <li>Not bitter at all.</li>
            <li>It worked well and easily melted to create the products I wanted; however, after solidifying it became a solid rock again and hard to use.</li>
            <li>I did NOT receive processed disks as other reviews have said, but large irregular chunks.</li>
            <li>and it was not melted, but you could plainly see the peaks at the top where it was melted down before being formed.</li>
            <li>it would have been a mess in hot weather.  </li>
            <li>I expected a product that was more pliable and not hard in chunks that needed to be broken up.</li>
            <li>I did run some of the extra little peaces right on my sink.</li>
            <li>The first one I got came in large chunks broken up.</li>
            <li>Melts easily at low temperatures (apparently, cocoa butter will not solidify if melted to above 100 degrees F.)  </li>
            <li>They ship it in small plastic zip lock bags and the double up on the bags so its fresh when you get it.</li>
            <li>It is the first time I have purchased raw cocoa butter, so perhaps that is the norm.</li>
            <li>This is minimally processed and very raw, which means it can have a bit of grit left in (1-2 per cubic inch) and still tastes and smells strongly of chocolate.</li>

            <li> Rich, creamy,</li>
            <li> Plus it is much more affordable than the other scar treatments and all natural!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> To be fair,  we have bought this product before and it was fine but the last batch we got smelled like smoke and we couldn&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li> It feels amazing on the skin, it&#x27;s so hydrating, and can be used in many different ways.</li>
            <li> It melted into the other oils &amp; beeswax beautifully.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive my package on SUPERBOWL SUNDAY that I forgot to weigh it to see if it was a full pound as ordered.  </li>
            <li> just right!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the sweet cocoa butter smell</li>
            <li> The packaging seemed a bit rustic, but good enough to not spill anything.</li>
            <li> They made the chocolate peppermint lotion bars smell good enough to eat!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if you can use it for consumption, but it smells good enough too.</li>
            <li> I have gotten several comments on how good it smells.</li>
            <li> I love how it turned out,  This cocoa butter is so creamy and smells absolutely divine.  </li>
            <li> I even use it as a suntan lotion, I have read that they can be used a a natural sunscreen, but or course do your own research.</li>
            <li> Such a good value.</li>
            <li> Myself and my daughters are all fair skined and need extra moisture.</li>
            <li> but I paid full price</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell as strong at first</li>
            <li> It has a strong chocolate smell at first but wears off quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought the cocoa butter to add to other oils, smells great.</li>
            <li> i ordered the raw cocoa butter which came very quickly, smells great.</li>
            <li> The scent is perfect and subtle for my lotion bars.  </li>
            <li> This item shipped quickly and was just what I was hoping it was.  </li>
            <li> The order came quickly.</li>
            <li> The cocoa aroma is so yummy and mild.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I love being able to get this in pure form as I like to use all natural products both inside and out.  </li>
            <li> this works great for my applications (melting down to add to lotions).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not concerned that it was melted &amp; poured, as I&#x27;ll be melting it anyways to make my projects...</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to any lotions, so I know with this, I am safe</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about to order my second bag - I love this product!</li>
            <li> It is exactly as described and has a rich cocoa aroma.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what we needed!</li>
            <li> /&gt;~Keep calm and Craft</li>
            <li> I have had mine for almost a year and it still seems fresh.</li>
            <li> Fresh.</li>
            <li> I know it says 100 percent fresh</li>
            <li> It smells fresh and it arrived well packaged.  </li>
            <li> Id say this product is for anyone who wants baby soft skin warm it up in the microwave and apply.</li>
            <li> Compared to natural moisturizers, especially with cocoa butter this is a great deal</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth noting.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You know, so I can quit using hydrogenated oils for pie crust, a nice solid fat for vegan pudding, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> this was by far better than the shea...</li>
            <li> I can use it on my most sensitive areas and it leaves me feel moisturized and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> and it was well worth it. . .</li>
            <li> smells sooooooooo good and is so easy to use cut a small piece</li>
            <li> Super Fast Delivery!</li>
            <li> I love buying raw butters to make my own lotions.  </li>
            <li> Cocoa butter is known for its moisturizing qualities, and is really good on scrapes due to its restorative properties, making it a must-have for skin care.  </li>
            <li> Yes, just right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure they sent me something old.</li>
            <li> however, the scent is so very strong that it overpowers the essential oils that I used it with.  </li>
            <li> This product was clean (no foreign matter) &amp; has a rich chocolate aroma.</li>
            <li> The cocoa butter quickly seeped through its packaging, and then sprinkled through the very mailing box it arrived in.</li>
            <li> but was surprised that once the lotion is applied the chocolate scent isn&#x27;t strong at all.  </li>
            <li> I took a piece and put some on my hands which honestly I am always so ashamed of showing because they are so dry.  </li>
            <li> In is naturally fragrant and melts easily to body temperature.</li>
            <li> You can use it for personal care products, like making your own lotions, scrubs, soaps, etc., but what you are really going to want to do it use it in cooking.  </li>
            <li> I scooped the white, fluffy body butter into a variety of containers with lids to save &amp; give as gifts; turned out great!</li>
            <li> Well, the easiest way get a sharp knife and this cuts real easy without alot of efford.  </li>
            <li> no leakage around the bottle and very bland smell but goes great with the product that I made my chapstick with and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I like the product very much</li>
            <li> and I have always pleased with the product I receive, This last order of Shea Butter when I opened it</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> This was the first batch of cocoa butter I ordered.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Ready to make Body Butter!</li>
            <li> It melts well on the skin and our cocoa chunks were perfectly sized -not too big, yet not too small either...</li>
            <li> It helps to run your hands under hot water with the cocoa butter in the palm of your hand to melt it a little.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This cocoa butter really exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li> I plan on purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase more from this seller.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like the natural scent, buy the scent free.</li>
            <li> I used this product to make my first batch of homemade soap.</li>
            <li> It seems greasy at first when applying it but keeping massaging into feet and it will absorb.</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase of cocoa butter</li>
            <li> A little bit dry BUT its a excellent quality.</li>
            <li> It melted nicely and combined with the other ingrediants I had to make a stellar hand cream.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to make my own lotion and other products.  </li>
            <li> and it was a nice addition to my other oils.</li>
            <li> I am starting to use all natural products and making my own lotions.</li>
            <li> it goes rancid pretty fast unless.</li>
            <li> These came in the larger discs to melt and they melted really easily.</li>
            <li> easy to cut chunks off, double bagged so packaged well.</li>
            <li> I easily break it into about 4 smaller pieces.</li>
            <li> 100% pure?</li>
            <li> Fresh raw cocoa buter is moist/ smooth and has the rich smell of chocolate.</li>
            <li> stuff is probably fine for topical body products, but not yummy to eat.</li>
            <li> It came as a giant block which I broke up using a huge knife.</li>
            <li> thanks, Gail</li>
            <li> While mine seemed sorta old and crystallized in spots, it still smelled fresh and worked for my uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s absolute garbage this time.</li>
            <li> What I really didn&#x27;t like is the consistency it gave my chocolates.</li>
            <li> It is much chewier and waxier.</li>
            <li> It shipped fast and it worked well on the cream I wanted to make</li>
            <li> Nothing beats high quality coco butter!.</li>
            <li> I used it in my body butter recipe and it turned out really well.</li>
            <li> Not broken up.</li>
            <li> It seems really nice.&lt;br /&gt;Now, the reason for 4 stars is because of weight.</li>
            <li> I really like</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and was packaged well.</li>
            <li> I did not realize how much cocoa butter I was receiving with my order.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it  with another product and it blends very well.</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing and absorbs into your skin like a dream.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The package the cocoa butter came in was much like a deli salad container</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much at a time either, so it lasts for quite awhile.</li>
            <li> And its price is very affordable,</li>
            <li> and it still has a very over powering aroma.</li>
            <li> Mission Accomplished.</li>
            <li> 1lb isn&#x27;t that much if you plan to make a lot of body butter with it.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> real cocoa you can smell thru the box&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> This product very fresh,  I do not like to melt this to place in my butters as not the same.</li>
            <li> It does smell good though, maybe a little more toasty than my usual stuff.</li>
            <li> Pure cocoa butter is a main ingredient in my homemade body butter.  </li>
            <li> they told me that is normal!  </li>
            <li> this is by far the best, massaging my scars with this a few times a day is breaking down even the thickest parts of scar tissue.</li>
            <li> I purchase this along with shea butter, coconut oil, sweet almond oil &amp; some essential oils to make body butter.  </li>
            <li> This one seems as though it had been melted down on put in a more compact container.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was also decent.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> This is my first time purchasing raw cocoa butter, so I admit that I had no idea about what I was getting into, but just be prepared that you may have to mix the cocoa butter with another type of oil OR plan to warm a bit of it in the microwave daily to melt it for use.</li>
            <li> Well that is not the normal</li>
            <li> I have ordered it several times and it is always fresh.</li>
            <li> It comes in a plastic screw-top jar, in medium-small sized chunks that can easily be shaved down with a knife.</li>
            <li> At first i thought because it wz cold on the day i gt it and wz 26degrees, but even with me putting it on top of the stove so the heat from the pilot light will melt it..</li>
            <li> I did not notice until it was ALL OVER the leather interior of my brand new car.</li>
            <li> I live in Las Vegas, and my family</li>
            <li> The raw form is always better than processed for my purposes.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> I suspect this is either very old or processed.</li>
            <li> Very soft and moisturizing</li>
            <li> No random chemicals, especially fragrances and preservatives</li>
            <li> they were probably the first on the market, and still one of the only producers.</li>
            <li> I was waiting on exactly 1lb of cocoa butter and this cocoa butter was about .2lb short.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned that I would smell strongly of chocolate once I applied the lotion</li>
            <li> It had been melted down to fit into the container I was given.</li>
            <li> Cacao/Cocoa butter is quite rare and 95% of what is being sold as raw right now isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT RAW COCOA BUTTER.  </li>
            <li> This is so soft, you can rub it directly on your skin!</li>
            <li> and I LIKE the sweet smell I&#x27;ve found in other cocoa butters</li>
            <li> My feet don&#x27;t seems to dry and crack as much since I wear flip-flops and sandals very often.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really rate it in comparison to other products, since this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used Cocoa Butter.</li>
            <li> My cocoa butter has a strong smell, but soft in comparison to raw cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> They blended really well with the beeswax, coconut oil and the shea butter and non of my lotion bars felt grainy or gritty.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin soft and even tone.</li>
            <li> and wow, I looked at my hands they looked moisturized.  </li>
            <li> I apply this product directly to my skin.</li>
            <li> And after handling the butter my hands are soft all day.</li>
            <li> I weighed the butter and was pleasantly surprised to find it weighed well over a pound.</li>
            <li> I know many have complained at the packaging</li>
            <li> If you want natural then that is what you get.</li>
            <li> How is that unrefined???&lt;br /&gt;The picture shows a hunk of stuff in its natural state.</li>
            <li> I must say I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and in myself for making the soap.</li>
            <li> i was expecting something soft n pastier.</li>
            <li> I melt it down with coconut oil and let it cool, then I whip it up and add a bit of Vitamin E oil.</li>
            <li> Raw PRIME &amp; PURE Cocoa Butter 100% Fresh 1lb]]</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much more yellow in color than the other brand, with a different smell.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s authentic from the tropics, try it and see what I mean</li>
            <li> It smells nice, but I expected raw unrefined cocoa butter</li>
            <li> Seriously this stuff is like magic</li>
            <li> I bought it to rub on scars from recent surgery and the pieces are too small to be able to do that or anything else with</li>
            <li> It really does seem to live up to the claims of being raw and 100% pure.</li>
            <li> It feels solid and hard, but creamy and nice at the same time.</li>
            <li> The fragrance and flavor has the distinct essence of dark chocolate.</li>
            <li> It smells just like unsweetened cocoa powder, in other words not as sweet smelling as chocolate with milk and sugar, but just like regular cocoa.</li>
            <li> This brand provides some decent quality, and they waste no time with pretty packaging.  </li>
            <li> Minuses were  the  cost was higher  than other sites and</li>
            <li> True raw cocoa butter is not processed in any way.</li>
            <li> Because its really pure fresh and tasty, the only thing i did not like its  i wait little long time to receive it</li>
            <li> but, I know it&#x27;s important to some ppl that the least amount of &amp;#34;processing&amp;#34; is done, so</li>
            <li> After several minutes, it become light &amp; fluffy like merengue!  </li>
            <li> Not bitter at all.</li>
            <li> It worked well and easily melted to create the products I wanted; however, after solidifying it became a solid rock again and hard to use.</li>
            <li> I did NOT receive processed disks as other reviews have said, but large irregular chunks.</li>
            <li> and it was not melted, but you could plainly see the peaks at the top where it was melted down before being formed.</li>
            <li> it would have been a mess in hot weather.  </li>
            <li> I expected a product that was more pliable and not hard in chunks that needed to be broken up.</li>
            <li> I did run some of the extra little peaces right on my sink.</li>
            <li> The first one I got came in large chunks broken up.</li>
            <li> Melts easily at low temperatures (apparently, cocoa butter will not solidify if melted to above 100 degrees F.)  </li>
            <li> They ship it in small plastic zip lock bags and the double up on the bags so its fresh when you get it.</li>
            <li> It is the first time I have purchased raw cocoa butter, so perhaps that is the norm.</li>
            <li> This is minimally processed and very raw, which means it can have a bit of grit left in (1-2 per cubic inch) and still tastes and smells strongly of chocolate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy about that, as that is a significant shortage.</li>
            <li> Was very sticky and hard to work with.</li>
            <li> Hobby lobby has tiny little bags with barely 1/2oz for 3.99.</li>
            <li> It also lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> No lumps or strange order.</li>
            <li> Since it is in blocks, we did have to google to see what weight should correlate for a cup of cocoa butter, but it didn&#x27;t take that long and there were a variety of sizes of blocks</li>
            <li> it came in a round tupperware container and it was soft to the touch like shea butter</li>
            <li> It was definitely melted down into a giant soap like bar.</li>
            <li> I have purched a lot of fresh raw cocoa butter in the past.</li>
            <li> We used to slather it on each other at the beach for the &#x27;ultimate&#x27; tan.  </li>
            <li> I am currently looking for other uses to try out.</li>
            <li> and it does not leak out of it or get greasy on the outside with time, like some other products I have  purchased before.</li>
            <li> The bag was somewhat cloudy, which might have meant that the product was old and the lack of aroma indicated that it might have been processed rather than raw.</li>
            <li> and I have a problem with dry skin.</li>
            <li> So, I set out to make a moisturizing soap for us that wouldn&#x27;t dry out our skin.</li>
            <li> I make lotion for dry skin</li>
            <li> This product arrived extremely dry, crumbly and smelled like nothing.</li>
            <li> I did a test run tonight and made a single lotion bar.  </li>
            <li> Will be trying other possibilties mixing this with other essential oils and butters</li>
            <li> I was a little confused when this first arrived because it came in chunks instead of a solid block like the picture.</li>
            <li> I usually buy divine organics brand at whole foods to make my raw chocolate with.</li>
            <li> I used it a little bit in cooking and when I tasted the outcome, I had the same feeling on my tongue as wedding</li>
            <li> I added lots of essential oils because the primary smell seemed to be the cocoa butter, which isn&#x27;t bad, but</li>
            <li> arrive on time - was as described - carefully packaged - will be reordering</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> harder than expected.</li>
            <li> Came as Expected, on time.</li>
            <li> When melted, I put it in the fridge for a few hours until it was starting to solidify, then I put the mixing bowl on the mixer stand &amp; began whipping.  </li>
            <li> This product was delivered sooner than I expected, and arrived in a sealed zip pack.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for unprocessed butter,this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li> love Cocoa Butter use it as the base for all my homemade products will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> I use raw cocoa butter and shea to make lotions so I&#x27;ll end up melting this down and adding several other products, I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s enough to remove the unwanted odor.</li>
            <li> I just cannot get enough of raw coco butter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The cacao butter from Big Tree Farms is truly raw-</li>
            <li> B009SE5ITW Big Tree Farms Organic Raw Cacao Powder, 8-Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I noticed that half of the Shea butter was yellow and the other half was black brownish color</li>
            <li> - this one is like a bitter, dark roast.</li>
            <li> It came melted all over inside the box and all over other items that were in the box.</li>
            <li> Hopefully the other ingredients will help balance out what may be lacking from the cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> like I have had to do with other coco butter</li>
            <li> The weight was correct, which has not been the case with other purchases I have made.  </li>
            <li> Be careful when ordering from this company!</li>
            <li> /&gt;i have ordered cocoa butter from other vendors before on</li>
            <li> Smells like dark chocolate but when mixed with coconut oil and other raw ingredients, it takes on a softer scent</li>
            <li> I previously ordered different raw cocoa butter</li>
            <li> however, i havent open the bag or used it because it&#x27;s hard as a bucket of rocks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even in a clear thin bag that would have leaked if it melted during shipping.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff to make stevia sweetened Dark Chocolate.  </li>
            <li> Is smells like dark chocolate.</li>
            <li> I melted it down and used it in homemade goat milk soap and also in homemade lotions.</li>
            <li> I recieved processed cocoa butter that had been melted down and formed into discs.</li>
            <li> Use it on my skin in my shea butter coconut oil almond oil argan oil mix, goes on slightly oily but fully absorbs after 20mins or so.</li>
            <li> but it also had a slightly off putting chemical smell.</li>
            <li> I was burned badly on my arms and face several months ago and have gone through several different scar treatments...</li>
            <li> what but definitely was not good?</li>
            <li> This was not an air tight seal.  </li>
            <li> also keep a little piece of cocoa butter in the car for chapped lips.</li>
            <li> Smelled very weak and old.</li>
            <li> have used it a few times with no problem</li>
            <li> It came in a heavy duty, silver bag.</li>
            <li> I did this for a few minutes</li>
            <li> but this is a raw product with uneven sized chunks.  </li>
            <li> and I thought that this pound was maybe a little past</li>
            <li> I keep it in its raw form.</li>
            <li> I received processed discs not the prime raw cocoa butter as described.  </li>
            <li> Here is an example of something that&#x27;s close to raw [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> B00168GTX2 Ecuadorian Truly Raw Cacao Butter, 16oz - Pacari Chocolate]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> because i mix mine with raw shea butter which has no smell</li>
            <li> I use a lot of raw cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> I never purchased raw cocoa butter before</li>
            <li> A little hard to measure out for DIY products</li>
            <li> too bad they jacked up the price so much.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in a bag shaped like small discs, even though in the picture, the product appears to be in chunks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> Comes in small discs to eases melting.  </li>
            <li> The aroma is unbelievable</li>
            <li> I store it in the fridge and use small chunks at a time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what this is</li>
            <li> Very messy.</li>
            <li> That is almost 10% less!!</li>
            <li> The product that I received was extremely hard and had not smell to it, as raw cocoa butter would.  </li>
            <li> This product unfortunately must be old.. as it is very hard and not a very good quality..</li>
            <li> It is a bit hard to break off pieces, but this is a small inconvenience.</li>
            <li> Needless to say that I have trashed over half of the 5 pounds I ordered, and I am shocked that they did not offer to replace it to keep me as a customer when there are other vendors selling the same thing so needless to say my next order will not be placed with this vendor.</li>
            <li> For my hard lotion bars though, I will need a refined variety as this scent overpowers everything else.</li>
            <li> Using this to make lip balm and hard lotion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rock hard do your gonna have to melt it.</li>
            <li> COCOA BUTTER  WAS HARD</li>
            <li> I did I reccommend buying at least 2lbs to make tons of lotion.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was slow too.</li>
            <li> but what the heck does that mean?</li>
            <li> I like this item very much, just very disappointed that it was all broken in small chunks.  </li>
            <li> Some of those chunks aer too hard to be broken by hand.</li>
            <li> It is not good quality.</li>
            <li> disappointed , but not worth the trouble to return it for the $12.00.</li>
            <li> The consistency is very hard....</li>
            <li> poor quality.</li>
            <li> It was packed in a thin plastic bag,</li>
            <li> Awful packaging and didn&#x27;t come as pictured in a solid piece but was like small crumbs.</li>
            <li> At least it&#x27;s a 1lbs, I plan on using it on my dogs or something since I don&#x27;t want to risk a batch of soap or lip balm turning out bad because of this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I could be wrong.</li>
            <li> so it wasn&#x27;t difficult.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was just a bad piece or</li>
            <li> I use this as part of my base for whipping up body butters.</li>
            <li> very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am use to and expressed that I was very disappointed with my product and that I would not be using that sheabutter</li>
            <li> It seemed terribly unsanitary.</li>
            <li> Had a horrible smell to it.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Perfect and smells Divine! was in nice large chunks, Much better than having crumbles all over. Will purchase again</li>
            <li> Nice! This is so soft, you can rub it directly on your skin! It also lasts a long time. I have had mine for almost a year and it still seems fresh.</li>
            <li> Made scented shea butter.</li>
            <li> Awful packaging and didn&#x27;t come as pictured in a solid piece but was like small crumbs. Very messy.</li>
            <li> This item shipped quickly and was just what I was hoping it was.  It was ready to be used and worked perfectly for my home made soap and deodorant.</li>
            <li> This is minimally processed and very raw, which means it can have a bit of grit left in (1-2 per cubic inch) and still tastes and smells strongly of chocolate. Good addition for home making chocolate, works ok for home beauty products too</li>
            <li> very disappointed. no cocoa butter smell. poor quality. do not buy this</li>
            <li> arrive on time - was as described - carefully packaged - will be reordering</li>
            <li> just as described and will purchase again</li>
            <li> Great product! Arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Works well in my lotions.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> worked perfect in the lip balm I made.</li>
            <li> I have ordering from this seller for about 4 years and I have always pleased with the product I receive, This last order of Shea Butter when I opened it I noticed that half of the Shea butter was yellow and the other half was black brownish color I have never seen shea butter that color before so I was alarmed that the shea butter may have mildewed or something so I contacted the seller and explained what I was looking at they told me that is normal!  Well that is not the normal I am use to and expressed that I was very disappointed with my product and that I would not be using that sheabutter, the rep proceeded to tell me that once I melt the shea butter the darkness will go away and that it was safe to use, but the problem with that is I don&#x27;t melt my sheabutter I keep it in its raw form. Needless to say that I have trashed over half of the 5 pounds I ordered, and I am shocked that they did not offer to replace it to keep me as a customer when there are other vendors selling the same thing so needless to say my next order will not be placed with this vendor.</li>
            <li> Wonderful service, great product!</li>
            <li> Good consistency. Well packaged. Will definitely last a while. Love the chocolate scent. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and excellent product. I use this in making soaps and lotions.</li>
            <li> Good stuff to mix with coconut oil for your face!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product and an excellent value!</li>
            <li> Works great in my balms and smells divine.  Will have to buy again when I run out!.</li>
            <li> This was amazing!  I bought it to make lotion bars, and they came out perfect. The chocolate smell is heavenly and it melts perfectly smooth. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Love Shea butter it was good to buy in bulk</li>
            <li> The cocoa  butter  arrived  quickly  and smelled  lovely. I used  it to  make lotion  bars and lip balm for Christmas  gifts. Minuses were  the  cost was higher  than other sites and I had to  cut  the  bag to get the butter out.</li>
            <li> The aroma is magnificent</li>
            <li> Used this product today in my body butter and it was great! melted nicely. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I make my own skin care products and loved your cocoa butter in my products!  thanks, Gail</li>
            <li> While mine seemed sorta old and crystallized in spots, it still smelled fresh and worked for my uses.&lt;br /&gt;*Update* I ordered this again and it&#x27;s absolute garbage this time. I don&#x27;t know what happened but the quality went to trash. It&#x27;s even in a clear thin bag that would have leaked if it melted during shipping. At least it&#x27;s a 1lbs, I plan on using it on my dogs or something since I don&#x27;t want to risk a batch of soap or lip balm turning out bad because of this.</li>
            <li> The product itself is great....  however, the scent is so very strong that it overpowers the essential oils that I used it with.  It is the first time I have purchased raw cocoa butter, so perhaps that is the norm.</li>
            <li> Great product! Exactly as described. Good color and scent. Fresh. Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> I usually buy divine organics brand at whole foods to make my raw chocolate with. Decided to try and save $ with this product. It came as a giant block which I broke up using a huge knife. It&#x27;s much more yellow in color than the other brand, with a different smell. It does smell good though, maybe a little more toasty than my usual stuff. What I really didn&#x27;t like is the consistency it gave my chocolates. It is much chewier and waxier. The divine organics brand yields chocolates that melt in your mouth. This cocoa butter sort of coats the mouth. Makes me think the fat composition is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is probably fine for topical body products, but not yummy to eat.</li>
            <li> Delightful, and lots OF it.</li>
            <li> Makes the best skin butter! I add Red Raspberry Seed oil for SPF without the chemicals.</li>
            <li> Yummy smelling, melts great.  Wonderful addition to my solid lotion bars.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love the flexibility this product provides; I&#x27;ve used it for lotions and body butters as well as in recipes. Definitely food grade.  Seller is top notch! This is the only cocoa butter I order!</li>
            <li> This product was clean (no foreign matter) &amp; has a rich chocolate aroma. It came in a plastic tub with lid. I am using it in a recipe for leather conditioner/treatment. It melted into the other oils &amp; beeswax beautifully. I think it is a good product &amp; I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> GREAT QUALITY!!!!!! No lumps or strange order. Will reorder again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cocoa butter for well over a year in my homemade body butter. I melt it down with coconut oil and let it cool, then I whip it up and add a bit of Vitamin E oil. I absolutely LOVE the way this smells, it&#x27;s like a chocolate shop (sometimes I add a bit of orange oil and it smells like a chocolate orange - YUM!) and it&#x27;s so rich and buttery. It feels amazing on the skin, it&#x27;s so hydrating, and can be used in many different ways. I&#x27;m about to order my second bag - I love this product!</li>
            <li> Great stuff. The block was easy to cut and shred how I wanted. My deodorant is cooling and my  lotion is setting can&#x27;t wait to try them tomorrow. I did run some of the extra little peaces right on my sink. So sofe smells soooooo Good. I like the reusable bag.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell as strong at first but when you use it concentrate u could really tell, it smells delicious!! Good product</li>
            <li> Ordered as a gift. My friend loves it. Timely delivery too</li>
            <li> Just made the most amazing batch of cocobutter lotion, smells great, soft and silky.  Best lotion Ive ever used.</li>
            <li> Smells great, melts beautifully in homemade lotions and lip balms.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Used it yesterday to make my own chocolate raspberry fat bombs  Yummy.  It arrived very quickly and it was good and solid.</li>
            <li> This was the first batch of cocoa butter I ordered. My husband wanted to try making chocolates. The butter comes in a molded brick, incidently, it is about the same size as a brick that you would build with. The fragrance and flavor has the distinct essence of dark chocolate. Not bitter at all. Smooth and &amp;#34;melt in your mouth&amp;#34; creamy.</li>
            <li> Great product I use it to make my own skin creams and this one delivers for scars.</li>
            <li> When I received this item, they had packaged it in a plastic &amp;#34;to go&amp;#34; disposable container that looked like a salad bar box with some tape on two sides to keep it &amp;#34;closed&amp;#34;. The cocoa butter quickly seeped through its packaging, and then sprinkled through the very mailing box it arrived in. I did not notice until it was ALL OVER the leather interior of my brand new car. It seemed terribly unsanitary. I would not eat it.</li>
            <li> Smells great.  I&#x27;m using it in lip balm</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never bought cocoa butter until this purchase but wanted to try making a lotion with it.  I really liked the cocoa butter that I received.  It had a pleasant chocolate smell.  I didn&#x27;t have to use essential oils to scent my lotion because of the chocolate smell.  I was a little concerned that I would smell strongly of chocolate once I applied the lotion but was surprised that once the lotion is applied the chocolate scent isn&#x27;t strong at all.  I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly as advertised. Bought it to mix up my own beard conditioner and it works great for that purpose.</li>
            <li> Thank you&#x27;ve had an amazing butter and smell good and smell like cocoa also were not too rigid a wetted my skin so much&lt;br /&gt;I loved it and I will come back to buy again</li>
            <li> I use this with Coconut Oil and Sweet Almond Oil to make my Coconut Dream Body Butter! LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Very nice cocoa butter!</li>
            <li> Wife loves it and ordered more.</li>
            <li> It shipped fast and it worked well on the cream I wanted to make</li>
            <li> This has been great in my soaps, body butters, etc.  I&#x27;ll buy again!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Awesome&amp;#34; Ready to make Body Butter!</li>
            <li> Nothing beats high quality coco butter!.</li>
            <li> I found that this cocoa butter too easily melted in your hands, as well as taking forever to solidify when making lotion bars.  I have never had cocoa butter do this.  I will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> The texture is fine but the smell is...awful. It doesn&#x27;t have the sweet cocoa butter smell I like. It smells pungent, more like rosemary flavored coffee. I use cocoa butter to make lotion bars and I LIKE the sweet smell I&#x27;ve found in other cocoa butters - this one is like a bitter, dark roast. Yeck.</li>
            <li> Works wonders in my lotion</li>
            <li> very good quality butter for my homemade lotions, melts very nicely and smooth</li>
            <li> I received my pound of cocoa butter yesterday.  It is exactly as described and has a rich cocoa aroma.  I&#x27;ve already made some body butter with this and it is wonderful!</li>
            <li> It is not good quality. It came melted all over inside the box and all over other items that were in the box. It had been melted a couple of times and by the time I got it, it was ruined.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff....great product.....no leakage around the bottle and very bland smell but goes great with the product that I made my chapstick with and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I got a lot of product for the price and I appreciate that, but I purchased the cocoa butter to use it as a body moisturizer.  This is my first time purchasing raw cocoa butter, so I admit that I had no idea about what I was getting into, but just be prepared that you may have to mix the cocoa butter with another type of oil OR plan to warm a bit of it in the microwave daily to melt it for use.</li>
            <li> The packaging seemed a bit rustic, but good enough to not spill anything. The product itself is really nice.</li>
            <li> The scent of this cocoa butter is amazing. I used it in my body butter recipe and it turned out really well. I am very excited to share it with my friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered Cocoa Butter 2 times from this vender. It smells WONDERFULLY! I love this vendor and the quality they provide!</li>
            <li> This cocoa butter is very good and helps with the skin and it is not so overly oily when rubbed in on the skin. Yo cant do nothing but try it.</li>
            <li> Love it! Will buy again</li>
            <li> Eeeehhh wasn&#x27;t impressed with the quality of this coco butter. Was very sticky and hard to work with. Just Ok for the price. Shipping was slow too.</li>
            <li> I had a recipe that called for this great stuff.  We used to slather it on each other at the beach for the &#x27;ultimate&#x27; tan.  I am currently looking for other uses to try out.</li>
            <li> We have enjoyed making lotion bars with this cocoa butter.  Very pleased with purchase and will certainly be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> I was a little confused when this first arrived because it came in chunks instead of a solid block like the picture. When I actually used it, I was grateful for the chunks because it made measuring a snap. It melted nicely and combined with the other ingrediants I had to make a stellar hand cream.</li>
            <li> making soap and lotion. great addition to my supply. Hobby lobby has tiny little bags with barely 1/2oz for 3.99. What a rip off. This was great stuff.</li>
            <li> These came in the larger discs to melt and they melted really easily. They made the chocolate peppermint lotion bars smell good enough to eat!!! They blended really well with the beeswax, coconut oil and the shea butter and non of my lotion bars felt grainy or gritty. Very pleased with this product and in fact, I ordered more...</li>
            <li> I liked this much better than the last coaoa butter I ordered was nice and fragrant.</li>
            <li> I love buying raw butters to make my own lotions.  this one is great and is at a great pricepoint too.</li>
            <li> This product unfortunately must be old.. as it is very hard and not a very good quality.. I will not be ordering this item from here again ... will order through another company that also sells on here and has a far superior product..</li>
            <li> Product arrived in a bag shaped like small discs, even though in the picture, the product appears to be in chunks.  Never the less,it smells so good, I wish I could eat it!</li>
            <li> Smells good, has proper consistency, serves the purpose to which I ordered it for, and would buy it again if I need more</li>
            <li> Zero scent.  Came in a beat up bag with a piece of tape around the top.  This was not an air tight seal.  There is zero chocolate scent.  I suspect this is either very old or processed.</li>
            <li> love Cocoa Butter use it as the base for all my homemade products will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and melts great.  love it</li>
            <li> have used it a few times with no problem</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to do a chemical report on this. I know it says 100 percent fresh but what the heck does that mean? 100% pure? I&#x27;m not sure. I used it a little bit in cooking and when I tasted the outcome, I had the same feeling on my tongue as wedding cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could be wrong. Has anyone else tried to eat this?</li>
            <li> To be fair,  we have bought this product before and it was fine but the last batch we got smelled like smoke and we couldn&#x27;t use it.  I don&#x27;t know if it was just a bad piece or what but definitely was not good?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with the cocoa</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to make my own lotion and other products.  It smells fresh and it arrived well packaged.  I don&#x27;t know if you can use it for consumption, but it smells good enough too.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to work with.  Great prices.  I am already using it in my lipbalms and lotions!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> this stuff is awesome! the smell alone is very nice</li>
            <li> Great for making your own lotion bars. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> So far so good in my lotion bar recipe. Smells like the coco butter my grandma used. Doesn&#x27;t look as pictured though. It was definitely melted down into a giant soap like bar.</li>
            <li> Use it on my skin in my shea butter coconut oil almond oil argan oil mix, goes on slightly oily but fully absorbs after 20mins or so.</li>
            <li> Works so much better than store bought cocoa butter products and lotions. Melts on your skin from your body temperature which makes it easy to apply. I was burned badly on my arms and face several months ago and have gone through several different scar treatments...this is by far the best, massaging my scars with this a few times a day is breaking down even the thickest parts of scar tissue. Plus it is much more affordable than the other scar treatments and all natural!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this to use in all sorts of home made creams and balms and such.  Love it.  Will be ordering more when I run out.  Seems to want to last forever..</li>
            <li> I make my own whipped shea butter mix &amp; this is a good quality ingredient.</li>
            <li> I received processed discs not the prime raw cocoa butter as described.  Does not match the picture in the ad.  I will be returning this product.</li>
            <li> Had a recipe that called for melted Cocoa Butter. This item worked fine. I can&#x27;t really rate it in comparison to other products, since this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used Cocoa Butter. It seemed to work fine in the recipe, and it&#x27;s packaged nice, with a resealable package. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I appreciate that it came wrapped up in a sealed plastic back and they also give you a re-sealable zip-lock type bag. I love this product. I will order again when I run out of this amazing stuff!</li>
            <li> I just received this today. It came in a heavy duty, silver bag. It came as a slab shaped like it was poured in a plastic container and then taken out and put in a bag. Not broken up. It feels solid and hard, but creamy and nice at the same time. It visibly got creamier from the warmth of my hands. It smells just like unsweetened cocoa powder, in other words not as sweet smelling as chocolate with milk and sugar, but just like regular cocoa. I haven used it yet, but I got it to put in skin products. It seems really nice.&lt;br /&gt;Now, the reason for 4 stars is because of weight. It is supposed to be 16 oz, but I weighed it as soon as it came and it is only 14.45 oz. (or 409 gr.). That is almost 10% less!! I&#x27;m not happy about that, as that is a significant shortage.</li>
            <li> I use it in my body butter</li>
            <li> I love it! I could smell it before I opened the package! It melts well on the skin and our cocoa chunks were perfectly sized -not too big, yet not too small either...just right! I WILL reorder from this company again!</li>
            <li> Everything I hoped it&#x27;d be.  I keep a chunk of cocoa butter by every sink to rub on my hands after I wash them.  It helps to run your hands under hot water with the cocoa butter in the palm of your hand to melt it a little.&lt;br /&gt;I also keep a little piece of cocoa butter in the car for chapped lips.</li>
            <li> Id say this product is for anyone who wants baby soft skin warm it up in the microwave and apply. Best stuff ive ever used BY FAR</li>
            <li> This cocoa butter really exceeded my expectations! I melted it down and used it in homemade goat milk soap and also in homemade lotions. It worked great and is very moisturizing and the smell is very pleasant!</li>
            <li> i use for, to  making  cream</li>
            <li> Great product i love the smell i use it to make my own lotion and creams.</li>
            <li> This cocoa butter is smooth, not greasy, melts nicely and works great in my body butters, lip balms, etc. Smells really nice</li>
            <li> Great product. Super Fast Delivery!</li>
            <li> Bought this cocoa butter to make organic all natural lotion and it came out AMAZING!!!  Smells so good it makes you want to eat it!  If you are using it for the same purpose I did I reccommend buying at least 2lbs to make tons of lotion.  1lb will only make 5 medium size jars of lotion so it&#x27;s better to get more!</li>
            <li> The product that I received was extremely hard and had not smell to it, as raw cocoa butter would.  Not what I expected.  Still used the product to make my body butter.  Hopefully the other ingredients will help balance out what may be lacking from the cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> harder than expected. doesnt melt at touch.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel. The scent is fabulous. For my hard lotion bars though, I will need a refined variety as this scent overpowers everything else.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin soft and even tone. Easy to apply. Great smell. Would recommend to everyone. Better than those liquids so-called cocoa-butter.</li>
            <li> Because its really pure fresh and tasty, the only thing i did not like its  i wait little long time to receive it</li>
            <li> I use this as part of my base for whipping up body butters. Love the smell and it keeps well. Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Came as Expected, on time. Good quality Cocoa Butter.</li>
            <li> Good product, good price, good transaction</li>
            <li> I expected a product that was more pliable and not hard in chunks that needed to be broken up. Some of those chunks aer too hard to be broken by hand.</li>
            <li> I love this butter, it goes well with all my products and keeps it&#x27;s smell throughout. It is a bit hard to break off pieces, but this is a small inconvenience. I like the package as well and it does not leak out of it or get greasy on the outside with time, like some other products I have  purchased before.</li>
            <li> Smelled very weak and old.</li>
            <li> A little hard to measure out for DIY products but I don&#x27;t think there is anything else that is easier.</li>
            <li> I used this to make hand/face cream - it is delightful - put it on it is like smoothing chocolate across your face without the mess...</li>
            <li> should have a used by date.</li>
            <li> Just wonderful and smells so good.</li>
            <li> too bad they jacked up the price so much.</li>
            <li> Works just fine for my dyi projects..</li>
            <li> This is some of the best raw cocoa butter I have purchased.  i PLAN TO PURCHASE FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I use this stuff to make stevia sweetened Dark Chocolate.  Melts easily at low temperatures (apparently, cocoa butter will not solidify if melted to above 100 degrees F.)  Comes in small discs to eases melting.  I&#x27;ve bought this product all the times I&#x27;ve made my chocolate.</li>
            <li> Cocoa smell overpowers anything else you add so make sure that&#x27;s what you want. I wanted the oils to dominate and that doesn&#x27;t happen with this.</li>
            <li> This butter is amazing.  I am starting to use all natural products and making my own lotions. I bought this mostly for the chocolaty smell they all said it has so my lotions would smell good. What a surprise, as soon as I got it I took a piece and put some on my hands which honestly I am always so ashamed of showing because they are so dry.  I was watching tv and kept a piece of the butter (they come in chunks) between my hands and as it melt I applied the oil to my hands.  I did this for a few minutes and wow, I looked at my hands they looked moisturized.  I use it every day twice a day now, but I made my own lotion with the rest for my body. Love it!</li>
            <li> I really like Shea butter is very good for the skin.I can&#x27;t wait to use it again. thank you thank you.</li>
            <li> So here I am trying to collect what I need to make my own lotions and stuff. Don&#x27;t know how it will all turn out but Thanks</li>
            <li> Nice product very strong smell</li>
            <li> Yes, just right. Raw and delicious.</li>
            <li> This has been great cocoa butter. I&#x27;ve been using it to make my own lotion and this cocoa butter is of high quality and is easy to work with. The lotion bars that I&#x27;ve been making have been excellent and this is thanks in large part to this ingredient.</li>
            <li> Seems like good cocoa butter to me.  Smells nice and worked for what I made. Shipped fast and was packaged well.</li>
            <li> I bought the cocoa butter to add to other oils, smells great. I did not realize how much cocoa butter I was receiving with my order. Great service.</li>
            <li> Great product- I used it to make a body butter.... it came out great!</li>
            <li> smells nice, works well in lip balm. easy to cut chunks off, double bagged so packaged well.</li>
            <li> I just cannot get enough of raw coco butter. If I could find a way to use it as a candle or air fresher I would because it just smells so yummy. This is perfect for melting own w/ other butters for my diy lotion. I love that it is chips so that I melts easy and I do not have to break it apart, like I have had to do with other coco butter I have purchased.  I plan on purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> Making bath bombs with this next weekend. Thank you</li>
            <li> Very good quality cocoa butter!</li>
            <li> This product arrives in a 1lb brick. I easily break it into about 4 smaller pieces. I apply this product directly to my skin. In is naturally fragrant and melts easily to body temperature. I have stopped using lotions and exclusively use cocoa buttet to moisturize my skin after showers. My skin especially the soles of my feet are softer than ever. I have bought this product twice and will do again.</li>
            <li> great service, will order again</li>
            <li> Love this butter.  Very soft and moisturizing</li>
            <li> This is also greasy feeling but does absorb nice when you put it on.</li>
            <li> I put this on my skin after bathing, and it is helpful to avoid itch. I mix it with sweet almond oil and any cheap lotion I can find</li>
            <li> I use coco butter for many of my homemade products: face cream, lotion, cleanser etc.  This cocoa butter works fine</li>
            <li> I loved this soap a lot. It worked wonders on my skin and I received a lot of it. Thanks</li>
            <li> Really good stuff. I use it for all of my DIY beauty recipes.</li>
            <li> I love this cocoa butter! I did NOT receive processed disks as other reviews have said, but large irregular chunks. I have been using this in place of any moisturizer since April and I love it. Why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. My skin has NEVER been softer. Seriously this stuff is like magic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I&#x27;m saving money. I&#x27;m only about a 20% through my supply after five months. Compared to natural moisturizers, especially with cocoa butter this is a great deal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. No random chemicals, especially fragrances and preservatives they don&#x27;t even need to list&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. I smell amazing now</li>
            <li> smells wonderful and makes my skin feel so nourished and silky smooth. Ahhhhhhhhhhh</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell of this product. I&#x27;ve used it  with another product and it blends very well. I have gotten several comments on how good it smells. I&#x27;ll be finding more ways to use it.</li>
            <li> has a fresh chocolate smell and the oil is very good quality; nice packaging; I luv the Ziploc envelope it comes in</li>
            <li> Perfect, arrived exactly as expected. Will be used to make different body products mixed with essential oils.</li>
            <li> The aroma is unbelievable my daughter said she wanted to eat it! I use this product to make body butter and it was a nice addition to my other oils. I am getting so many comments from customers on how good their skin feels after using this butter. My sister called yesterday to say that her grand-daughters eczema cleared up after using butter. I have already ordered again.</li>
            <li> This is some very good, high quality cocoa butter. It literally smells good enough to eat and worked really good in all my soap, lotion and lip balm recipes. It is very moisturizing and absorbs into your skin like a dream. Will definitely be ordering again!</li>
            <li> Product quality was excellent and of very high quality, will definitely order again. Delivery was prompt. I use this product in soap and body care products.</li>
            <li> Very nice product. I use it in lotions and soaps I make and works great for that. And after handling the butter my hands are soft all day.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this purchase. It is literally the best smelling thing ever! It comes in a plastic screw-top jar, in medium-small sized chunks that can easily be shaved down with a knife. I used this to make deodorant and body butter, both of which turned out well and smell amazing!</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT RAW COCOA BUTTER.  Here is a link to the spec&#x27;s for the chocolate from the manufacturer in Ghana&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raw Cacao/Cocoa butter is quite rare and 95% of what is being sold as raw right now isn&#x27;t.  Here is an example of something that&#x27;s close to raw [[ASIN:B00168GTX2 Ecuadorian Truly Raw Cacao Butter, 16oz - Pacari Chocolate]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cacao butter from Big Tree Farms is truly raw- they were probably the first on the market, and still one of the only producers. Amazon doesn&#x27;t have their cocoa butter , but they do have their cocoa powder [[ASIN:B009SE5ITW Big Tree Farms Organic Raw Cacao Powder, 8-Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product should be re-labeled or removed from Amazon.</li>
            <li> A very mild chocolate smell ,Blends and whips great.lasts forever .I would gladly recomend this product and i will reorder it soon!!!</li>
            <li> Yummy smell !&lt;br /&gt;i like the buttery smell it has because i mix mine with raw shea butter which has no smell so it adds the nice buttery smell to the mixture.</li>
            <li> This is the purest rawest form of Cocoa Butter I have ever seen. Purchased 1lb along with 5lbs of shea butter for use on hair (whip). It smells divine. The consistency is very hard....I had to soften for whipping. I will definitely purchase more from this seller. Fast shipping. Packaged as described. I am extremely happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The package the cocoa butter came in was much like a deli salad container and though it was wrapped in plastic, it had melted and left a film on everything in the box.  However. I weighed the butter and was pleasantly surprised to find it weighed well over a pound. So I feel they compensated for any product lost during shipping.  It smells fantastic!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT, love the smell, love everything about it</li>
            <li> I like the product very much</li>
            <li> I just used the last of my Coco Butter and you can bet I&#x27;m ordering some more . Love it !</li>
            <li> I am using this in a salve for the whole body and it is very nice. You don&#x27;t need much at a time either, so it lasts for quite awhile.</li>
            <li> The bag of cocoa butter that I received is uniform poured disks...this works great for my applications (melting down to add to lotions).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not concerned that it was melted &amp; poured, as I&#x27;ll be melting it anyways to make my projects...also, I figure there has to already be some kind of processing just to get the cocoa butter separated in the first place...but, I know it&#x27;s important to some ppl that the least amount of &amp;#34;processing&amp;#34; is done, so it&#x27;s worth noting.&lt;br /&gt;The stuff I received has an excellent color and smells WONDERFUL...perfect cocoa butter aroma.  :)</li>
            <li> Perfect!  I use it to make my own Cocoa Butter lotion.</li>
            <li> The cocoa butter came in a ziploc bag.  I know many have complained at the packaging but this is a raw product with uneven sized chunks.  There aren&#x27;t that many options in packaging.  If you are looking for perfection maybe buy something else in a jar that has been processed.  If you want natural then that is what you get.</li>
            <li> I ordered it for home made chocolate. It&#x27;s fresh, it smells so good. And its price is very affordable,</li>
            <li> This cocoa butter works wonderfully!!! It&#x27;s great because I love making lip balm, but some just smell plain funky, but this one smelled great and melts perfectly with my beeswax and coconut oil for lip balm. It got here in about a week. I recommend putting it the fridge cause it goes rancid pretty fast unless. I shall be a return buyer:D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Keep calm and Craft on~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Cookieca</li>
            <li> Great for skin. Using this to make lip balm and hard lotion. Will be trying other possibilties mixing this with other essential oils and butters</li>
            <li> smells sooooooooo good and is so easy to use cut a small piece alittle goes along way</li>
            <li> It came in a bag and is a bunch of staffers. How is that unrefined???&lt;br /&gt;The picture shows a hunk of stuff in its natural state. What I got is for cooking or something</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered. Smells great and seems fresh.</li>
            <li> Use this to make body butter.  Quite pleased with the quality</li>
            <li> Nice product, smelled great. I&#x27;ve used it in homemade body butters and soaps. no problems.</li>
            <li> I use this as an adjunct to my homemade soaps.  This brand provides some decent quality, and they waste no time with pretty packaging.  This arrives in a plastic bag, and called good.  But it&#x27;s cocoa butter, so who cares!  Cocoa butter is known for its moisturizing qualities, and is really good on scrapes due to its restorative properties, making it a must-have for skin care.  I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I ordered this along with some beeswax so I could make some homemade lotion bars and lip balm.  I did a test run tonight and made a single lotion bar.  I love how it turned out,  This cocoa butter is so creamy and smells absolutely divine.  I will be ordering it again in the future.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for a family member as I have Prime and they don&#x27;t. I previously ordered different raw cocoa butter (I&#x27;m sure you can find my review). I like the way this brand was packaged better. The first one I got came in large chunks broken up. This one seems as though it had been melted down on put in a more compact container.  Either one works for me, this one is just easier to store.</li>
            <li> Did not smell like cocoa butter , it was ivory in color and there is no scent to it.not thrilled . Will not purchase again</li>
            <li> I love the consistency of this butter, it smells like fresh chocolate. If you don&#x27;t like the natural scent, buy the scent free. It comes in button form so it is easy to measure to melt.</li>
            <li> I like this item very much, just very disappointed that it was all broken in small chunks.  I bought it to rub on scars from recent surgery and the pieces are too small to be able to do that or anything else with</li>
            <li> I bought this because I need a solid fat that I am not allergic to.  You know, so I can quit using hydrogenated oils for pie crust, a nice solid fat for vegan pudding, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Well, as it turns out, I&#x27;m allergic to cocoa butter, too.  And that is a damn shame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My vegan pudding recipe was spectacular with this cocoa butter.  It is like eating a chocolate mousse.  Rich, creamy, intoxicating.&lt;br /&gt;Well, then I get congested, my finger joints swell, and regret sets in.&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;ve got three more bowls of the stuff!  Muhahaha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this arrived in a plastic tubs and the cocoa butter is in chunks for easy use.  You can use it for personal care products, like making your own lotions, scrubs, soaps, etc., but what you are really going to want to do it use it in cooking.  Trust me.  Well, I&#x27;m off to grab one of those remaining bowls of pudding.  I have nothing if not regrets.&lt;br /&gt;Pam</li>
            <li> Great product but the smell is WAY overwhelming. I tried to mix it with shea butter and coconut oil and it still has a very over powering aroma. I cant even add essential oils to it. I know that the better the quality coco butter smells a lot, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be as strong as it is.</li>
            <li> I used it to whip up a batch of lotion using Cocoa Butter, Shea butter and Coconut oil. I&#x27;m pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I used this product to make my first batch of homemade soap. I must say I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and in myself for making the soap. I live in Las Vegas, and my family and I have a problem with dry skin. So, I set out to make a moisturizing soap for us that wouldn&#x27;t dry out our skin. Mission Accomplished.</li>
            <li> I have bought this before and I will again. I make soap and this seller is wonderful. They ship it in small plastic zip lock bags and the double up on the bags so its fresh when you get it. I&#x27;m a happy buyer, as always!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, smells so good.&lt;br /&gt;I mix it equal parts organic, coco, shea, and coconut oil, use it all over, face too.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to every one as an miracle lotion. I even use it as a suntan lotion, I have read that they can be used a a natural sunscreen, but or course do your own research.</li>
            <li> Great price for the amount. Will be using this in homemade skincare.</li>
            <li> Great product. Smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> Have to return it. As soon as I opened the package I knew something was off. It didn&#x27;t smell like anything, bag was cloudy, looked like it had been melted and there was white film all around the butter. I&#x27;m pretty sure they sent me something old.</li>
            <li> I love cocoa butter for the smell as well as for how it moisturizes. This was a good product. Just as advertised. It was at a good price.</li>
            <li> Weight is spot on, the cocoa butter smells amazing and looks perfect, too. if you are looking to buy cocoa butter, i can personally recommend this. i buy cocoa and shea butters i keep a stock at all times, i am happy with this one too.</li>
            <li> My cocoa butter has a strong smell, but soft in comparison to raw cocoa butter. I was waiting on exactly 1lb of cocoa butter and this cocoa butter was about .2lb short.</li>
            <li> Great item...bought this to make some homemade lotion...used this and shea butter...this was by far better than the shea...the smell was great, melted smoothly and blended nicely...definitely would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This product very fresh,  I do not like to melt this to place in my butters as not the same. I then took a hammer to break up.  Well, the easiest way get a sharp knife and this cuts real easy without alot of efford.  Mix with butters in mixer and blends well.</li>
            <li> Is smells like dark chocolate. The quality seems genuine. 1lb isn&#x27;t that much if you plan to make a lot of body butter with it. It&#x27;s rock hard do your gonna have to melt it.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive my package on SUPERBOWL SUNDAY that I forgot to weigh it to see if it was a full pound as ordered.  It was packed in a thin plastic bag, nothing fancy &amp; it would have been a mess in hot weather.  I purchase this along with shea butter, coconut oil, sweet almond oil &amp; some essential oils to make body butter.  I threw all the butters in a Kitchen Aid mixer bowl &amp; used the mixer bowl as a double boiler over a pot of boiling water to melt the butters together.  When melted, I put it in the fridge for a few hours until it was starting to solidify, then I put the mixing bowl on the mixer stand &amp; began whipping.  After several minutes, it become light &amp; fluffy like merengue!  I added lots of essential oils because the primary smell seemed to be the cocoa butter, which isn&#x27;t bad, but not what I&#x27;m going for.  I scooped the white, fluffy body butter into a variety of containers with lids to save &amp; give as gifts; turned out great!</li>
            <li> This was not the best cocoa butter that I have used.  I make lotion for dry skin and I thought that this pound was maybe a little past it&#x27;s best.</li>
            <li> Good, fresh, fast.  What more could a girl want? I use this cocoa butter to make my own body butter.  I have ordered it several times and it is always fresh.</li>
            <li> This was great! I would totally buy again if I was using for body butter but since it is not deodorized I would not again use it in soap unless I was specifically making a cocoa butter soap as the smell survived saponification. It melted well and was a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> I have purched a lot of fresh raw cocoa butter in the past. Fresh raw cocoa buter is moist/ smooth and has the rich smell of chocolate. This product arrived extremely dry, crumbly and smelled like nothing. The bag was somewhat cloudy, which might have meant that the product was old and the lack of aroma indicated that it might have been processed rather than raw. The raw form is always better than processed for my purposes.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed , but not worth the trouble to return it for the $12.00. They might have known it would not be returned.</li>
            <li> nice smell - melt evenly, and not too waxy</li>
            <li> I melt this and put it in a container so I can push it out and apply it to my skin.  I am very sensitive to any lotions, so I know with this, I am safe</li>
            <li> Arrived on time great product</li>
            <li> This is a great product for making your own body butters and lip balms. It came packaged in a tray with a lid and wrapped in plastic wrap. I would buy this product again. Smells great!</li>
            <li> This is awesome. A must buy for skin.</li>
            <li> WAS NOT WHAT I WAS EXPECTING , NEEDS WORK SO YOU CAN USE IT. COCOA BUTTER  WAS HARD AND SO  I MIXED SOME WITH ALMOND OIL TO SOFTEN . IT WAS OK AFTER THAT</li>
            <li> Works good - I use it on my feet at bedtime about 3 times a week - it is making a difference. My feet don&#x27;t seems to dry and crack as much since I wear flip-flops and sandals very often. When I stop using it I see a big difference. I store it in the fridge and use small chunks at a time. It has a strong chocolate smell at first but wears off quickly. It seems greasy at first when applying it but keeping massaging into feet and it will absorb.</li>
            <li> It worked well and easily melted to create the products I wanted; however, after solidifying it became a solid rock again and hard to use.</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase of cocoa butter and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased! It really does seem to live up to the claims of being raw and 100% pure. It came in a bag of different-sized blocks and smelled heavenly!! We would all just open the bag and smell a while. :)  I bought it for lotion bars and it melted well and the bars are perfect. Since it is in blocks, we did have to google to see what weight should correlate for a cup of cocoa butter, but it didn&#x27;t take that long and there were a variety of sizes of blocks so it wasn&#x27;t difficult. I will DEFINITELY purchase this again!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Smells like dark chocolate but when mixed with coconut oil and other raw ingredients, it takes on a softer scent that&#x27;s wonderful. And this is coming from someone who can&#x27;t stand the smell of cocoa butter lotions from the store.</li>
            <li> The order came quickly. The cocoa butter smells soooo good! I am so happy I tried Smellgood. Their customer service is the best. I can call them about any conerns or questions. Thank you so much. I will be ordering more products from you.</li>
            <li> good quality, good price.</li>
            <li> Good product and price</li>
            <li> Such a good value. Pure amazing coco butter.</li>
            <li> great product, use it in lotion bars and shampoo bars</li>
            <li> Lightening Speed Shipping. Received as a solid even though summer heat. Whips up nicely!</li>
            <li> I love the product and e-mail of great recipe for soft skin</li>
            <li> This product was delivered sooner than I expected, and arrived in a sealed zip pack.  The weight was correct, which has not been the case with other purchases I have made.  The scent was stronger than I am accustomed to, but it may just be that this cocoa butter is not deodorized.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Had a horrible smell to it. Ruined my batch of lotion and had to throw it all out.</li>
            <li> Exactly what i was looking for, perfect for my homemade projects</li>
            <li> This was excellent quality and it smells amazing. I got it to make body butter bars. I mixed it with coconut oil and a bit of bees wax and it is heaven. I also used some in my home made deodorant. The smell is absolutely amazing even without an essentail oil to scent it with.</li>
            <li> Smells great and perfect for body butters Mike with other ingredients.</li>
            <li> Wonderful coco aroma, excellent in making homemade body products!</li>
            <li> Smooth and creamy for my spa products, smells great!</li>
            <li> Huge package, high quality, leaves my skin feeling awesome, and smells great. I can use it on my most sensitive areas and it leaves me feel moisturized and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> Made my skin more even in tone and much more moist compared to when i&#x27;m using lotions. The only downside is that whatever i hold is oily but it&#x27;s technically oil so that&#x27;s that, can&#x27;t remove a star because of it&#x27;s innate characteristics. Packaging is also excellent as i really got it in a whole block inside a zip lock so i can store the excess in the same bag for future use.</li>
            <li> i ordered the raw cocoa butter which came very quickly, smells great. however, i havent open the bag or used it because it&#x27;s hard as a bucket of rocks. i was expecting something soft n pastier. i want to experience the product but, i cant since i cant rub it on my skin. At first i thought because it wz cold on the day i gt it and wz 26degrees, but even with me putting it on top of the stove so the heat from the pilot light will melt it..still nothing.should i put om into a plastic container then in the microwave or sit the container in warm water. or. just send it back and get another pack??????????[[ASIN:B008KPO2MY Raw PRIME &amp; PURE Cocoa Butter 100% Fresh 1lb]]</li>
            <li> I recieved processed cocoa butter that had been melted down and formed into discs. I use a lot of raw cocoa butter. True raw cocoa butter is not processed in any way. The company tried to tell me they used a machine to cut the cocoa butter and it was not melted, but you could plainly see the peaks at the top where it was melted down before being formed. When I buy a product I expect to get what is pictured not a processed item. Bait and tackle is what they are doing here!! Be careful when ordering from this company!</li>
            <li> Great price, melts and combines with other ingredients nicely.</li>
            <li> Exactly what we needed!</li>
            <li> I just love the feel of my skin after the butter is applied soaks right into it,and leaves my skin soft smooth and smelling good.  I make soap so some of this will be added to my bars.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know what this is&lt;br /&gt;i have ordered cocoa butter from other vendors before on amazon&lt;br /&gt;and what i received looked nothing like what is pictured&lt;br /&gt;the biggest giveaway was there was NO chocolate smell none. real cocoa you can smell thru the box&lt;br /&gt;and it came in a round tupperware container and it was soft to the touch like shea butter&lt;br /&gt;will be returning</li>
            <li> It smells nice, but I expected raw unrefined cocoa butter and that is not what I received.  It had been melted down to fit into the container I was given.</li>
            <li> Love it! Smells delicious!! Works wonderfully in my lotions and soaps. I would recommend this cocoa butter to anyone looking for cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for unprocessed butter,this is not the product for you. The cocoa butter was melted and poured into a container. I will either have to break the container or melt it again, to use it! I am considering returning it! I did weigh and the product weighed one pound, which is what I purchased. Shipping was also decent.</li>
            <li> The scent is perfect and subtle for my lotion bars.  It also provides the perfect blend for essential oil scents that might have been to &amp;#34;stingy&amp;#34; to the nosie.</li>
            <li> I think this is a winner.  Great quality and it&#x27;s authentic from the tropics, try it and see what I mean</li>
            <li> Love the Cocoa Butter.  Yummy smell....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what this is but it has a fowl smell to it. I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for DIY recipies.  And smells sooooo good!</li>
            <li> Loved it, used to make lip balm.</li>
            <li> AWESOME stuff! Great quality ! I used this with Mango butter and Coconut oil to make whipped body butter. SO awesome! I gave it out as gifts for stocking stuffers and everyone was pleased</li>
            <li> This is such a great product. The cocoa aroma is so yummy and mild. I do find that it is a bit stronger than any essential oil I try to pair with it but it is really great on our skin. Myself and my daughters are all fair skined and need extra moisture. This works great!</li>
            <li> worked great for body butter</li>
            <li> I added this butter to my body butter mixes and lip balms and it is a great fit. The chuncks melt well and have good consistancy.</li>
            <li> Pure cocoa butter is a main ingredient in my homemade body butter.  I love being able to get this in pure form as I like to use all natural products both inside and out.  I did not get this at a discount but I paid full price and it was well worth it. . .</li>
            <li> Excellent! Arrived on time. Great Quality.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with the Cocoa Butter. I use it as a superfat ingredient in making soap. The product is clean and free of debris, and works great as a soap ingredient. I think this works well, and is an excellent value. I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I never purchased raw cocoa butter before but I am glad I did. I used it in a homemade body butter and it smells and feels wonderful. I highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> A little bit dry BUT its a excellent quality.</li>
            <li> Great smell. Nice color.</li>
            <li> The cocoa butter is good quality and has a nice chocolatey scent. I would have given it five stars but it also had a slightly off putting chemical smell.I use raw cocoa butter and shea to make lotions so I&#x27;ll end up melting this down and adding several other products, I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s enough to remove the unwanted odor.</li>
            <li> Love it. It smells amazing and is holdingg up great in my lotions. Definitely ordering this product again!</li>
            <li> LIke it a lot . A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> This product smells SO good, it reminds me of being young and smearing it all over my body.  I was going to make some body butter but I have used it all up all by itself!  Ordering more today!</li>
            <li> Great product. Quick shipping.</li>
