            <li>I love  this product!  </li>
            <li>Has a strong lavender/herbal scent, but works great on the color.  </li>
            <li>Aveda is also an amazing company that puts people and the environment ahead of profit.</li>
            <li>Some get that nice ashy-silver tone to their hair</li>
            <li>Some get that nice ashy-silver tone to their hair</li>
            <li>I leave it in for 40-50 minutes, sometimes put a plastic bag over it, and my hair is BRASS FREE for a good week.</li>
            <li>My hair is also very fine.  </li>
            <li>I will most def buy this product again.</li>
            <li>It made my brassy blonde hair wonderful again.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Some people need to be more aggressive while others get away with using a brass banisher sparingly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, okay, the price still has me cringe</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, okay, the price still has me cringe</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I am allergic to the purple dye used in most shampoos for silver hair; it makes my scalp burn and itch.</li>
            <li>I feel this is the best daily conditioner by Avada.  </li>
            <li>I have tried all of Aveda&#x27;s conditioners and this is my favorite for easy to comb hair by a mile...</li>
            <li>It keeps the warm tones out of my blonde hair and feels great.</li>
            <li>Great  product completely overpriced here.</li>
            <li>They also stuck in a cute glass case as a special gift.  </li>
            <li>It is a deep conditioner and works beautifully at taking away the orange/yellow/gold problems that can creep up.</li>
            <li>Works as a conditioner just fine.</li>
            <li>As expected - arrived on time and wrapped very securely - great product and love the effect it has on keeping my hair color not to brassy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ultimately, it&#x27;s really about finding a balance for your own hair type and seeing how the product takes to your hair.</li>
            <li>You are welcome to contact me later.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s free, can&#x27;t complain)</li>
            <li>So I use the blue Malva because I don&#x27;t care about it depositing color, I want it for the cleansing and conditioning - this one does not stain my fair skin or my nails (or the light grout in my shower!).</li>
            <li>It just makes a nice soft light color with out the brassiness!</li>
            <li>I have brassiness no matter what color I dye (I&#x27;m a natural warm brown).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products while transitioning from dyed blonde to silver/gray but have yet to find any that top Aveda&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>First of all let me say that I used the amazon free shipping (which can take awhile at times-</li>
            <li>I used this years ago and strarted using the brand my new salon uses, but I like this better.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t need much to wash my waist length hair and leave it easy to comb.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this, it cleared out all the brass!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>Aside from the amazing scent, it brightens your blonde highlights... as well as removes any brassy-ness.  </li>
            <li>I use it once or twice a week to keep my hair a nice color without brass or yellow.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair from getting brassy and my color looking fresh longer.  </li>
            <li>, it turns brassy pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>This product along with the Blue Malva Shampoo provide the best results for removing brassiness from blonde and yellow from gray hair, while leaving hair soft, strong and silky with a healthy shimmer.</li>
            <li>So using a color-enhancing Aveda treatment seemed like a no-brainer, right?  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft, true to color, and light weight.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands, mostly salon brand products, and while each did an okay job, the price and the end result didn&#x27;t really impress me.</li>
            <li>Smells and feels great when massaged and left on for deep conditioning.</li>
            <li>and I was sure I was headed back to the hair salon for help.</li>
            <li>I love the Blue Malva Conditioner and the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that Back to Basics&#x27; line of conditioners are a better alternative.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a good product indeed, but I was not impressed or satisfied</li>
            <li>I will say that it moisturized my hair pretty well, but I was really seeking something that would enhance and protect my color.  </li>
            <li>B000LSC07C Joico Color Endure Shampoo, 10-ounce]] (which didn&#x27;t so much get rid of my brassiness but made it even throughout,</li>
            <li>My hair was very brassy</li>
            <li>But the Blue Malva Conditioner is excellent and has never left my hair too heavy or brassy.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to blondes!</li>
            <li>This Blue Malva doesn&#x27;t fit the bill...</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair really soft and shiny, too, and has a pleasant but not overwhelming smell.</li>
            <li>The conditioner has a strong lavender scent that fades after your hair is dry.</li>
            <li>My dry, frizzy hair has more defined curl, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down.</li>
            <li>looking.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner are pretty much the same except the conditioner has extra oils/lotions/etc in it to keep your hair from drying out, keep it smooth and not smell.</li>
            <li>It seemed to not have any effect on the brassiness (in fact, it left me with more brass than a damn antique store) and even made my brunette roots and overall color seem darker.  </li>
            <li>I was thinking of trying the blue malva and a stylist told me that the Blue Malva conditioner has more pigment than the shampoo</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s highly recommended to use the conditioner</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t recommend this product too highly.</li>
            <li>just know you may have to bleach your tub a little more often.</li>
            <li>It also took at least three treatments with it to see any kind of change in my hair color.  </li>
            <li>my color was like new.</li>
            <li>and I add this at least once a week to the blonde ends which keeps them looking bright.</li>
            <li>I first just used it as a regular conditioner.</li>
            <li>All of their products cause breakouts for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Joico tended to dry out of my hair but not like Shimmer Lights and Aveda&#x27;s Blue Malva leaves my hair a tad dry but as long as I use a moisture rich hair mask or conditioner specifically made for color-treated hair, it feels okay.</li>
            <li>in fact it is the only Aveda product that makes my hair easy to comb - despite the claims of the other products.  </li>
            <li>So soft and shiny and</li>
            <li>I am a bit surprised that there isn&#x27;t a version of this sold as a one bottle solution (like Wen).</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and have never had a problem with breakouts or itchiness from this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t work nearly as well as this one.</li>
            <li>It keeps my naturally black highlighted blonde hair from becoming brassy in between coloring.</li>
            <li>I applied it to my clean, wet hair, put on a shower cap and left it in for about 15 min.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper in the long run than going to a salon for a toner or something.</li>
            <li>and it does not turn you hair blue as in the old days.  </li>
            <li>kind of expensive for it not to work well.</li>
            <li>The other products I&#x27;ve used have never truly gotten rid of the brass, just faded it out and didn&#x27;t really banish it.</li>
            <li>The other products I&#x27;ve used have never truly gotten rid of the brass, just faded it out and didn&#x27;t really banish it.</li>
            <li>Did this every other shampoo and after the third time I really noticed a difference in my silver hair.</li>
            <li>B000TBVGBM Clairol Shimmer Lights Original Conditioning Shampoo]] (which smells terrible but does a fairly good job and mid-line priced),</li>
            <li>but on alternating days; or, you use either every few days or once a week for a certain length of time, and cover it with a plastic bag.</li>

            <li> Also, the major issue in using any brass banisher, be it in a shampoo/conditioner duo or something like L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Brass Banisher, is...the dreaded dry, straw-like hair.</li>
            <li> only hope is that this doesn&#x27;t break my hair in the long run the way Aveda curessence did - which was discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is not a heavy, greasy conditioner that will weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> I put it on dry air and wrapped my head in a Walmart bag and left it on for 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> In the end, having something that I can just grab from the shower, leave it and gets rid of that ugly orange-y hue, even if only for a week at a time, is sooooo worth every penny!!!</li>

            <li> It completely toned the brassy color to a pale blond.</li>
            <li> So, let&#x27;s say you use a conditioner OR shampoo every 2-3 days and leave it in for 20 minutes each time, but if you use the shampoo in conjunction with the matching conditioner, the directions have you doing that same routine just in a different format and in less time for either the shampoo/conditioner throughout the week.</li>
            <li> I went to another salon and got highlights added back to conceal the black color and the highlights came out yellow, not ash as I asked for.  </li>
            <li> To say it in another way: if you use the shampoo OR conditioner, 1-2 times a week, that being one day you use the shampoo and the other time the conditioner, and you leave it in for a lot longer, say, 30-40 min each time and sometimes using a plastic cap to help things along, it all evens out to be about the same in terms of timing and how long the product is in your hair.</li>
            <li> The yellow is a lovely shade of really bad teeth, if you can picture it.  </li>
            <li> Since I bleach my hair, the over-processing will always leave my hair a bit on the dry side but Aveda&#x27;s conditioner doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling like it&#x27;s about to snap in two.</li>
            <li> Next day I used it on dry hair and let it set a half hour and rinsed it out.</li>

            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> That means, you&#x27;d probably be doing 5-10 minutes for shampoo/conditioner but every other day.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s an excellent conditioner.</li>
            <li> I like the Blue Malva shampoo but prefer the shampoo and conditioner from Pantene for &amp;#34;silverizing&amp;#34; my gray hair.  This is gummy and doesn&#x27;t want to spread as well as the pantene products.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this, it cleared out all the brass! I will most def buy this product again. &amp; yes, there is a purplish tint. (&#x3D;</li>
            <li> I love this product! It made my brassy blonde hair wonderful again. So soft and shiny and my color was like new. Love it.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> This condition is perfect for maintaing &amp;#34;silver&amp;#34; in my hair. And, smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I am not a natural blonde and I bleach nearly black hair to pale blonde every once in a while and brassiness is always a pain to deal with, even when I use [[ASIN:B002PMLGVI L&#x27;Oreal Paris Colorist Secrets Brass Banisher Hair Treatment]], it turns brassy pretty quickly. In the past, I&#x27;d tried [[ASIN:B000TBVGBM Clairol Shimmer Lights Original Conditioning Shampoo]] (which smells terrible but does a fairly good job and mid-line priced), [[ASIN:B005MIFIWK John Frieda Sheer Blonde Color Renew Tone, Restoring Shampoo, 8.45 Fluid Ounce (Pack of 2)]] (which doesn&#x27;t work at all and at 7-10 bucks, you get what you paid for...), then [[ASIN:B000LSC07C Joico Color Endure Shampoo, 10-ounce]] (which didn&#x27;t so much get rid of my brassiness but made it even throughout, but it&#x27;s highly recommended to use the conditioner and it&#x27;s a bit pricey). I&#x27;d heard of Aveda&#x27;s Blue Malva shampoo/conditioner but it had me cringing at the price--the 33 oz (the only size it comes in) is a whopping 50 bucks while the conditioner ranges from 20-30 bucks for 8.5 oz. I&#x27;ve tried other brands, mostly salon brand products, and while each did an okay job, the price and the end result didn&#x27;t really impress me. Until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind, that depending on the product, you either need the shampoo OR conditioner, or, you use BOTH but on alternating days; or, you use either every few days or once a week for a certain length of time, and cover it with a plastic bag. Scared? Don&#x27;t be. So, let&#x27;s say you use a conditioner OR shampoo every 2-3 days and leave it in for 20 minutes each time, but if you use the shampoo in conjunction with the matching conditioner, the directions have you doing that same routine just in a different format and in less time for either the shampoo/conditioner throughout the week. That means, you&#x27;d probably be doing 5-10 minutes for shampoo/conditioner but every other day. To say it in another way: if you use the shampoo OR conditioner, 1-2 times a week, that being one day you use the shampoo and the other time the conditioner, and you leave it in for a lot longer, say, 30-40 min each time and sometimes using a plastic cap to help things along, it all evens out to be about the same in terms of timing and how long the product is in your hair. The shampoo and conditioner are pretty much the same except the conditioner has extra oils/lotions/etc in it to keep your hair from drying out, keep it smooth and not smell. That&#x27;s why I use the conditioner only. Does everything the shampoo does, but keeps my hair hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, it&#x27;s really about finding a balance for your own hair type and seeing how the product takes to your hair. Trial and error, and it&#x27;s really hard to error. Some people need to be more aggressive while others get away with using a brass banisher sparingly. Also, the major issue in using any brass banisher, be it in a shampoo/conditioner duo or something like L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Brass Banisher, is...the dreaded dry, straw-like hair. Shimmer Lights dried out my hair, a lot. John Frieda, well, since it didn&#x27;t do anything for my brassiness, dryness wasn&#x27;t even an issue. Joico tended to dry out of my hair but not like Shimmer Lights and Aveda&#x27;s Blue Malva leaves my hair a tad dry but as long as I use a moisture rich hair mask or conditioner specifically made for color-treated hair, it feels okay. Since I bleach my hair, the over-processing will always leave my hair a bit on the dry side but Aveda&#x27;s conditioner doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling like it&#x27;s about to snap in two. Again, hair masks are a MUST, even if whatever product you use doesn&#x27;t suck all the moisture from your hair. I use it every other day. It helps, believe you me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair type: fine/oily. I use the Blue Malva conditioner every 7-10 days. I leave it in the roots for 10 min before putting it on the rest of my hair. I leave it in for 40-50 minutes, sometimes put a plastic bag over it, and my hair is BRASS FREE for a good week. Yeah, a total of 1 hour; however, at 2times a week, I can work with that. Watch TV, read a few chapters of my trashy romance novel, and presto!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, okay, the price still has me cringe and I go through the Aveda Blue Malva Conditioner like crazy but folks, this stuff WORKS, every time and without fail. The other products I&#x27;ve used have never truly gotten rid of the brass, just faded it out and didn&#x27;t really banish it. Some get that nice ashy-silver tone to their hair but I only get that on finer parts of my hair around my hairline. In the end, having something that I can just grab from the shower, leave it and gets rid of that ugly orange-y hue, even if only for a week at a time, is sooooo worth every penny!!! I plan on buying the shampoo soon and using both. Five stars and THEN some!times a week, I can work with that.

            <li> I have ombre hair that melts from copepr red to platinum blond and I add this at least once a week to the blonde ends which keeps them looking bright. My ONLY note: It does make the shower floor look a little messy -- just know you may have to bleach your tub a little more often.</li>
            <li> I have used it only one time and therefore cannot report on its quality. You are welcome to contact me later.</li>
            <li> Been using it on my bleach blonde hair once a week for years, and it does tone-down brassiness.  Has a strong lavender/herbal scent, but works great on the color.  I know people with grey hair who use it too.</li>
            <li> First of all let me say that I used the amazon free shipping (which can take awhile at times- but it&#x27;s free, can&#x27;t complain) and my order arrived in 3 DAYS shipped very securely in a box! That is excellent costumer service and much appreciated, especially after my recently having a terrible experience buying a shampoo with BeautyLuxx (shampoo was packaged terribly and had exploded and they refused reimbursment).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, about the conditioner itself- LOVE IT. I have been struggling with keeping my blonde hair&#x27;s brassiness at bay while at the same time not further damaging my hair- this conditioner is wonderful! It is a deep conditioner and works beautifully at taking away the orange/yellow/gold problems that can creep up. I use it about every 3 days and it&#x27;s just perfect.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Would use it over and over again, and I do.  Takes the brassiness out of your hair.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t seem to make that big of a difference. has an odd smell too. i will keep looking for something to help me get the brassiness out of my hair. kind of expensive for it not to work well.</li>
            <li> As expected - arrived on time and wrapped very securely - great product and love the effect it has on keeping my hair color not to brassy.</li>
            <li> I just used this Aveda Blue Malva Conditioner on my color treated (by me) highlighted grey/blond hair. It&#x27;s a miracle. My hair was very brassy and I was sure I was headed back to the hair salon for help. I first just used it as a regular conditioner. After shampooing I left it in a few minutes and rinsed out. Not so great. Next day I used it on dry hair and let it set a half hour and rinsed it out. It completely toned the brassy color to a pale blond. I can&#x27;t recommend this product too highly.</li>
            <li> I use this and only this to wash and condition my hair. I very thick very long wavy/curly hair. One product solution for people who don&#x27;t like or want to use shampoo and have long hair that tangles. This conditioner does it all and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy. I have tried all of Aveda&#x27;s conditioners and this is my favorite for easy to comb hair by a mile... in fact it is the only Aveda product that makes my hair easy to comb - despite the claims of the other products.  I am a bit surprised that there isn&#x27;t a version of this sold as a one bottle solution (like Wen). I have almost black hair and hate that the black Malva stains my hands and finger nails and if I don&#x27;t rinse for five minutes, stains my white towels. So I use the blue Malva because I don&#x27;t care about it depositing color, I want it for the cleansing and conditioning - this one does not stain my fair skin or my nails (or the light grout in my shower!). I rub this in my scalp (about 2 tbls) and let it rinse down my hair and that does the trick. It is expensive but I don&#x27;t need much to wash my waist length hair and leave it easy to comb. I am disappointed that there isn&#x27;t a one liter of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only hope is that this doesn&#x27;t break my hair in the long run the way Aveda curessence did - which was discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give this product one star for the price and store service. Aveda products are very expensive and the sales staff totally buy into using &#x27;a full system&#x27; or grouping of products - chah ching. The sales lady in Toronto tried to convince me that there was no way I could use the conditioner the way I was and almost didn&#x27;t want to sell me the blue malva. She shook her head at me all the way through my purchase. #rude. If it weren&#x27;t for how well this works for me I would have left the store and called to complain.</li>
            <li> Works as a conditioner just fine. Does it make my white hair shiny like any cheaper drug store brand? Not really. All in all somewhat disappointed in this product</li>
            <li> I love the Blue Malva Conditioner and the [[ASIN:B0016JDLO6 AVEDA by Aveda: Blue Malva Color Shampoo 33.8 OZ]].  I have naturally blonde hair with lots of highlights that are affected by the seasons (lighter in the summer; darker in the winter).  My hair is also very fine.  Therefore, I have to be really careful about which shampoos I use in order to avoid my hair turning brassy, heavy, and oily.  I&#x27;ve struggled with conditioners because of both my color and my hair texture.  But the Blue Malva Conditioner is excellent and has never left my hair too heavy or brassy.  I use the conditioner about once a week with the Blue Malva Shampoo.  It leaves my hair soft, true to color, and light weight.  I have extremely sensitive skin and have never had a problem with breakouts or itchiness from this shampoo.  I highly recommend it to blondes!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but it really does work! I have ombre highlights in my hair (meaning, just the ends are highlighted) that have gotten brassy since I had them done, and this corrects it with just one use. Much cheaper in the long run than going to a salon for a toner or something. I tried a less expensive color correcting conditioner and it didn&#x27;t work nearly as well as this one. It leaves my hair really soft and shiny, too, and has a pleasant but not overwhelming smell.</li>
            <li> My dry, frizzy hair has more defined curl, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down. The color is not as brassy and it&#x27;s been a month since my color. I used this years ago and strarted using the brand my new salon uses, but I like this better.</li>
            <li> If you have allergies, stay away from anything aveda or your skin will break out big time! All of their products cause breakouts for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> First of, I have no idea why this is so expensive on here! Do yourself a favor and save $10 bucks or so and find your nearest Aveda store if you decide to try this.  Now, I did not like this product at all.  I get my hair highlighted ombre at an Aveda salon with Aveda color.  So using a color-enhancing Aveda treatment seemed like a no-brainer, right?  No go. It seemed to not have any effect on the brassiness (in fact, it left me with more brass than a damn antique store) and even made my brunette roots and overall color seem darker.  It also took at least three treatments with it to see any kind of change in my hair color.  I only get my blonde done once every three months, so having this darken my color was incredibly annoying.  I will say that it moisturized my hair pretty well, but I was really seeking something that would enhance and protect my color.  This utterly failed at that.  I eventually bought a bottle of the Naissant Treatment Blonde Pearl- Perla Beige.  That was cheaper and made my color look great after one wash with it.  In fact, I had coworkers ask me if I had just gotten my hair done after using the Naissant.  So I recommend that for de-brassing the blonde over this product without a doubt.</li>
            <li> I have brassiness no matter what color I dye (I&#x27;m a natural warm brown). I&#x27;ve been using this about 5-6yrs (bought elsewhere prior to finding here) and it works to eliminate it no matter what color I&#x27;ve been. If you are prone to brassiness while coloring (or while fading) this will fix it without a trip to the salon.</li>
            <li> I love  this product!  Aside from the amazing scent, it brightens your blonde highlights... as well as removes any brassy-ness.  While I can&#x27;t proove it - it seems to extend your hair color.</li>
            <li> great conditioner for grey/white hair and it does not turn you hair blue as in the old days.  Also recommend the Aveda Blue Malva shampoo.  Both great products.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years. My salon stopped selling it and I hunted all over for it and found it on Amazon. Was so happy to have it again. I have colored hair with blond highlights and this keeps the yellow out. I use it once or twice a week to keep my hair a nice color without brass or yellow. It just makes a nice soft light color with out the brassiness!</li>
            <li> I am allergic to the purple dye used in most shampoos for silver hair; it makes my scalp burn and itch. I was thinking of trying the blue malva and a stylist told me that the Blue Malva conditioner has more pigment than the shampoo so I purchased it. I applied it to my clean, wet hair, put on a shower cap and left it in for about 15 min. Did this every other shampoo and after the third time I really noticed a difference in my silver hair. The conditioner has a strong lavender scent that fades after your hair is dry. It is not a heavy, greasy conditioner that will weigh your hair down. I am very, very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Does not work as well as other blueing conditioners I have used.</li>
            <li> It did not do any &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; trick to my hair. I was expecting a good product indeed, but I was not impressed or satisfied therefore I wont purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Great  product completely overpriced here. Do yourself a favor and get it from an Aveda store if at all possible.</li>
            <li> It may have some blue malva, but it has dye and chemicals and smells like clairol temporary hair color in the drugstore. I canT get it out of my hair and moreover it didn&#x27;t help the yellow ends of my silver hair. STINKS.</li>
            <li> I have bleached hair and use this to take the brassy yellow tones out. Smell isn&#x27;t pleasant but it makes a noticable difference. If you haven&#x27;t used purple/blue shampoo/conditioners before: DO NOT leave this on longer than a minute MAX. Your hair will go grey or purple depending on the level of lightener your hair has been colored.</li>
            <li> After recently going through \\&quot;hair hell\\&quot; with a botched attempt at \\&quot;ombre\\&quot; by my Alabama hair stylist of 20years (who knew NOTHING about the ombre technique) and died my hair Elvira black instead of the med. ash brown base I wanted and then put ugly yellow chunks underneath the back of my hair that came up half way on my head and left an obvious line! My husband said it made my hair look dirty and that it looked awful.  I paid $110 for this disaster then 2 weeks later after seeing that the black color was not washing out I went to another salon and got highlights added back to conceal the black color and the highlights came out yellow, not ash as I asked for.  The yellow is a lovely shade of really bad teeth, if you can picture it.  So, after spending $240 for my hair to look WORSE than it did to start with, I decided to try this Blue Malva.  I put it on dry air and wrapped my head in a Walmart bag and left it on for 30 minutes.  Then shampooed and conditioned as usual.  I&#x27;d say that the ugly yellow is toned by about 30-40%.  Not quite what I was hoping for but definately an improvement.  I will never attempt \\&quot;ombre\\&quot; with a backwards N. Alabama salon again. They are always about 10 years behind the rest of the country in hair trends and techniques.</li>
            <li> Item came way before scheduled delivery and carefully packaged so item&#x27;s contents were not compromised by the elements of shipping in the heat, handling, etc.  It keeps my naturally black highlighted blonde hair from becoming brassy in between coloring. Smells and feels great when massaged and left on for deep conditioning. Definitely recommend this product and seller!</li>
            <li> I have graying hair and this gives the gray extra sparkle.  I use is every third or fourth washing as if I use it every time, it will turn my hair bluish!  They also stuck in a cute glass case as a special gift.  Thanks!!</li>
            <li> This product along with the Blue Malva Shampoo provide the best results for removing brassiness from blonde and yellow from gray hair, while leaving hair soft, strong and silky with a healthy shimmer. I&#x27;ve tried many products while transitioning from dyed blonde to silver/gray but have yet to find any that top Aveda&#x27;s.  Aveda is also an amazing company that puts people and the environment ahead of profit.</li>
            <li> I feel this is the best daily conditioner by Avada.  It keeps the warm tones out of my blonde hair and feels great.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 5+ years will only use this product!</li>
            <li> Great product. Did wonders on the tone of my hair.</li>
            <li> For 15 years, I have used Aveda&#x27;s Clove conditioner intermittently to rejuvenate my medium brown hair color. It leaves my hair with a beautiful shine and softness. However, I can&#x27;t use it daily as it the color looks overdone. So, I thought I&#x27;d try a non-color depositing version of Aveda&#x27;s conditioner to use daily, in between the &amp;#34;Clove&amp;#34; days. This Blue Malva doesn&#x27;t fit the bill...just a so-so conditioner. I&#x27;ve found that Back to Basics&#x27; line of conditioners are a better alternative.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  Keeps my hair from getting brassy and my color looking fresh longer.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  I have white hair, it keeps it looking whiter then white and not brassy looking.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
