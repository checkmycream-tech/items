            <li>I would definately consider this the best lipstick to buy.  </li>
            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>Great Buy</li>
            <li>It is inexpensive and the colors are great for any wardrobe.  </li>
            <li>The color pay off is amazing!</li>
            <li>was pleased that mine all came in perfect condition and looked wonderful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These lipstics are good, they are moisturizing, however they feel like a lip stain and the staying power is not so great..</li>
            <li>Good bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for good quality, opaque lipsticks, I don&#x27;t recommend these.</li>
            <li>Today i received most of them, they were all good, except for this one!  </li>
            <li>Love all the colors, came on time, and good value.</li>
            <li>They have nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>it looks too good to be true, it probably is\\&quot; applies to this set.  </li>
            <li>and I love the colors</li>
            <li>Nice colors, smooth application.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps there could be some primer or something in it to help it stay on your lips better???  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>These so called lipsticks are more like lip gloss.</li>
            <li>But I absolutely love how smooth it applies, and the variety of colors.  </li>
            <li>and it makes a wonderful gift when combined with other goodies.</li>
            <li>These are true too color!  </li>
            <li>my wife liked it very much.  </li>
            <li>packaging is cheap and looks cheap but the colors and their color pay off</li>
            <li>i gave three stars, because one of the pack came clean...</li>
            <li>they were clean and had no problem.</li>
            <li>The lipsticks are very chalky and once applied they come across as very cheap quality.</li>
            <li>So one pack came clean with no melted lipsticks but another one was not that lucky.</li>
            <li>I really like Shany products, I have purchased (and received as gifts) make up, and make up brushes from this company), and enjoyed them all, except for this one.  </li>
            <li>Overall this is a nice budget choice with plenty of variety.</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s price is pretty good at just under ten bucks for the whole set.</li>
            <li>So your probability to get right thing is 50%.  </li>
            <li>They were absolutely right.  </li>
            <li>they all have bumps on them as if they were outside and the humidity got the best of them not cool .</li>
            <li>And okay i know their only $10 ..</li>
            <li>It keeps my lips soft and free from drying.  </li>
            <li>Its also kind of a stain because after wiping my lips with a napkin there was still a little bit of color on my lips.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really complain since I really like just about every shade in this set, just know that these are NOT Shany lipsticks, they are Princessa brand.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>i opened the cap of one of the lipsticks from defective pack,the whole lipstick came out inside the cap...</li>
            <li>You may try your luck if you really need them.</li>
            <li>Absolutely, each and every one of these lipsticks came melted and if you give this &#x27;gift&#x27; to some one, you will be so embarrassed.  </li>
            <li>The color stayed through me eating and drinking straight out of a cup.</li>
            <li>My advice to all is: DEFINITELY BUY Shany products, just pay attention to the reviews:)....and DONT buy this particular set, spend a few more dollars for the better quality Shany set.</li>
            <li>I bought this this set of lipsticks for my girlfriend, along many other lipsticks from other sellers, and some more make up stuff.  </li>
            <li>Individual cases are as cheap as they come, some of the colors are quite similar, quality is good, but a less than a dollar a piece, you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>Then none of the colors match the picture in the picture they Clearly look as if they are going to be in the neutral /brown family</li>
            <li>Multicolor lipstick set contains 12 of the more commonly worn shades of lip make-up.</li>
            <li>I find myself reapplying lipstick frequently.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that a young woman would not agree with this product.  </li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>The product arrived but it would have been better if it had been late.</li>
            <li>I bought these lipsticks 3 months ago, and all the shades are pretty ugly, definetly did not suit my fair olive toned skin.</li>
            <li>I almost purchased the more expensive Shany  lipstick pack&#x27; that was for sale when I bought this one, and I really wish I did!  </li>
            <li>Also, there isn&#x27;t a big veriety of color, mainly browns.  </li>
            <li>They came in a simple, cheap, plastic transparent package (made in Taiwan), so even without opening them, i could see how they melted down.  </li>
            <li>The few more lipsticks that i ordered from some other seller, came as they should, no problem at all!    </li>

            <li> The only reason I took one star away is because the color does not seem to last long.  </li>
            <li> I had read other reviews that said that this set was basically three colors (red, plum and bubble gum pink) repeated over and over.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!</li>
            <li> none the less.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s less that a dollar for each one.  </li>
            <li> So i just got the set of lipsticks and as i opened them my disappointment kicked in first</li>
            <li> Product has some after taste when put it on, but it goes away after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Waste of money unless u like reds magentas plum and one bronze colored lipstick .</li>
            <li> it was broken and jammed in cap.  </li>
            <li> Now I have these small tubes that I can&#x27;t even use.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this product, worst purchase I have ever ordered.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews that the lipsticks came melted, i was skeptical but purchased anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They are very sheer and smell horrible.</li>
            <li> IT WAS HORRIBLE DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
            <li> The &#x27;lipstick&#x27; thing, is now all over the inside of the cap of the lipstick, have no form of a lipstick, it is simply crap!    </li>

            <li> Bought this as a gift. Multicolor lipstick set contains 12 of the more commonly worn shades of lip make-up. Amazon&#x27;s price is pretty good at just under ten bucks for the whole set. Overall this is a nice budget choice with plenty of variety.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really complain since I really like just about every shade in this set, just know that these are NOT Shany lipsticks, they are Princessa brand. Great product none the less. Would consider rebuying, but I&#x27;ve got A LOT of lipsticks now so it may be awhile! haha</li>
            <li> Individual cases are as cheap as they come, some of the colors are quite similar, quality is good, but a less than a dollar a piece, you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Good bang for your buck. Product has some after taste when put it on, but it goes away after a few minutes. Love all the colors, came on time, and good value.</li>
            <li> i ordered two of them to give as a gift.  So one pack came clean with no melted lipsticks but another one was not that lucky. Almost 8 out of 10 lipsticks were melted in defective pack. They were melted inside the cap. i tried to test them... i opened the cap of one of the lipsticks from defective pack,the whole lipstick came out inside the cap... it was broken and jammed in cap.  i gave three stars, because one of the pack came clean... i tested all the lipsticks in that pack... they were clean and had no problem. So your probability to get right thing is 50%.  colors are almost similar to the picture... They have nice fragrance. You may try your luck if you really need them.</li>
            <li> I bought these lipsticks 3 months ago, and all the shades are pretty ugly, definetly did not suit my fair olive toned skin.The lipsticks are very chalky and once applied they come across as very cheap quality.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift pack and I love the colors and it makes a wonderful gift when combined with other goodies.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t sleep on this one especially if you like those nude/light colored lipsticks.  These are true too color!  What you see is what you get.  So lets see 12pk for 9.95 that&#x27;s less that a dollar for each one.  Great Buy</li>
            <li> So i just got the set of lipsticks and as i opened them my disappointment kicked in first they all have bumps on them as if they were outside and the humidity got the best of them not cool . Then none of the colors match the picture in the picture they Clearly look as if they are going to be in the neutral /brown family they are not ! They are in the red hue family ...i don&#x27;t wear red at all. Waste of money unless u like reds magentas plum and one bronze colored lipstick . And okay i know their only $10 ..but i think they should be atleast the color advertised ..oh and FYI their made with castor oil ??? Yuckkkk</li>
            <li> I bought this this set of lipsticks for my girlfriend, along many other lipsticks from other sellers, and some more make up stuff.  Today i received most of them, they were all good, except for this one!  Absolutely, each and every one of these lipsticks came melted and if you give this &#x27;gift&#x27; to some one, you will be so embarrassed.  They came in a simple, cheap, plastic transparent package (made in Taiwan), so even without opening them, i could see how they melted down.  The &#x27;lipstick&#x27; thing, is now all over the inside of the cap of the lipstick, have no form of a lipstick, it is simply crap!    The few more lipsticks that i ordered from some other seller, came as they should, no problem at all!    But this lipstick set is definitely going to the garbage can! They cost me 13$ plus shipping... A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!</li>
            <li> After reading reviews that the lipsticks came melted, i was skeptical but purchased anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I was pleased that mine all came in perfect condition and looked wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is cheap and looks cheap but the colors and their color pay off is phenomonal!&lt;br /&gt;great buy!</li>
            <li> Nice colors, smooth application.  The only reason I took one star away is because the color does not seem to last long.  I find myself reapplying lipstick frequently.  Perhaps there could be some primer or something in it to help it stay on your lips better???  But I absolutely love how smooth it applies, and the variety of colors.  These are perfect to stick in your purse and to travel with.</li>
            <li> I would definately consider this the best lipstick to buy.  It keeps my lips soft and free from drying.  This product has aloe vera and I love it.  It is inexpensive and the colors are great for any wardrobe.  I don&#x27;t think that a young woman would not agree with this product.  Just try it!</li>
            <li> my wife liked it very much.  We will definitely  recommend it our friends and family . keep it up wow.</li>
            <li> I like this product for the variety of choses, however if you like a lot of color this is not the product for you. As for me, just a hint of color is all I need.</li>
            <li> The color pay off is amazing! The color stayed through me eating and drinking straight out of a cup. Its also kind of a stain because after wiping my lips with a napkin there was still a little bit of color on my lips.</li>
            <li> The product arrived but it would have been better if it had been late. Total waste of money. No color just grease. Do not waste your money on this product, worst purchase I have ever ordered. Now I have these small tubes that I can&#x27;t even use.</li>
            <li> These lipstics are good, they are moisturizing, however they feel like a lip stain and the staying power is not so great..</li>
            <li> I had read other reviews that said that this set was basically three colors (red, plum and bubble gum pink) repeated over and over.  They were absolutely right.  DO NOT BUY THIS SET!!  The saying, \\&quot;if it looks too good to be true, it probably is\\&quot; applies to this set.  I really like Shany products, I have purchased (and received as gifts) make up, and make up brushes from this company), and enjoyed them all, except for this one.  I almost purchased the more expensive Shany  lipstick pack&#x27; that was for sale when I bought this one, and I really wish I did!  My advice to all is: DEFINITELY BUY Shany products, just pay attention to the reviews:)....and DONT buy this particular set, spend a few more dollars for the better quality Shany set.</li>
            <li> These so called lipsticks are more like lip gloss. They are very sheer and smell horrible. Also, there isn&#x27;t a big veriety of color, mainly browns.  If you&#x27;re looking for good quality, opaque lipsticks, I don&#x27;t recommend these.</li>
            <li> IT WAS HORRIBLE DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY THE LIPSTICK WAS SHEER. I TRIED EVERY SINLGE LAST LIP STICK AND THERE WAS NO COLOR</li>
