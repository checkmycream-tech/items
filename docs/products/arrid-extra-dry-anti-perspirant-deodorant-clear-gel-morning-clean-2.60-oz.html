            <li>Great product good price.  </li>
            <li>I was so happy to see a four-pack at a good price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It has a pleasant and long-lasting smell</li>
            <li>I have a huge perspiration problem and arrid products work the best for me.</li>
            <li>It shipped on time and arrived in good shape.  </li>
            <li>I have used this item for 25 years and have found nothing as good for me.</li>
            <li>The price was good and I like the product.</li>
            <li>Amazon having it, and having it for a good price is great but having in a six pack is even better.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased Arrid because this product has changed my grooming/beauty routine forever!</li>
            <li>I cannot say for certain why she likes this brand so much (she says because it works the best); all I know is if she&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>Nice product.  </li>
            <li>Nice producat and  arrived on timet</li>
            <li>I was thrilled.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to buy in bulk.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s effective.</li>
            <li>so its nice to have someplace to come and purchase it.  </li>
            <li>great for getting just the right about applied</li>
            <li>Simply, it&#x27;s the most effective, easiest to apply, and at the best price I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>Love this</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a picky person when it comes to deodorant because most cause me to get a rash, since they must have something which I&#x27;m allergic to, but not with this ARRID gel.</li>
            <li>They used to sell this locally in retail stores, but over a year ago they pulled it from most stores in California, so Thank you Amazon for keeping this stocked, your truly the best!</li>
            <li>A favorite of mine.</li>
            <li>For Christmas, he asked for his favorite deodorant, which he could no longer find in stores.</li>
            <li>My favorite deodorant.</li>
            <li>Totally pleased with the experience.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that Amazon carries it.</li>
            <li>The fact is, this is one of the two brands and type of deodorant that I like the most and look for on the shelves.</li>
            <li>I am glad I found this on Amazon.com</li>
            <li>I love the product which I have been using for awhile.  </li>
            <li>This has been my brand for years, and I&#x27;m so glad I can still buy it.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite deodorant on the market.  </li>
            <li>I appreciate being able to order this product from you.  </li>
            <li>I have not been able to find it anymore in stores</li>
            <li>so we shop on amazon for the products that we love to use but can&#x27;t find in our area anymore.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, many underarm anti-antiperspirants in my day some of which I wasn&#x27;t so satisfied with some, others worked well but would discolor my underarm area.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get it in Alaska anymore, so I&#x27;m glad I found it here.</li>
            <li>Any fragrance is OK with me.  </li>
            <li>I would say this is my favorite scent that Arrid makes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>sure hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it.  </li>
            <li>Lot&#x27;s of stores don&#x27;t carry this any more for what ever reason.</li>
            <li>So glad we could buy it in bulk and keep it in the closet.  </li>
            <li>works great applies easily and not too much</li>
            <li>value is pretty good as well.</li>
            <li>The description for this deodorant was accurate and the packaging was appropriately done as well.  </li>
            <li>I love this deodorant, I can&#x27;t find it at my local walmart anymore, and being able to find it online was great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does quite a good job as an anti-perspirant (I give it a pretty good workout on a regular basis, I do plenty of manual labor), and had a nice smell to it.  </li>
            <li>GOOD PRODUCT FAST DELIVERY</li>
            <li>I have tried other deodorant gel types and have found Arrid to be the best one.</li>
            <li>Great product plus great savings on sometimes hard to find.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy, doesn&#x27;t stain anything.  </li>
            <li>As described...  quick shipping too!  </li>
            <li>Absolutely fantastic product.</li>
            <li>The service and price is fantastic</li>
            <li>and I thought that was as good as I&#x27;d get as far as deodorants go.</li>
            <li>Exactly want I needed and wanted!!</li>
            <li>As I live in the \\&quot;cool dry climate\\&quot; here in Dallas/Fort Worth Texas, it&#x27;s effectiveness is most impressive</li>
            <li>It does just keep you dry and has a great smell to it.</li>
            <li>I can only say its the best it goes on easy and does not stain your cloths or leave white marks.</li>
            <li>much safer pick and feels much better on.</li>
            <li>I love the price and how fast it comes to the door</li>
            <li>Does not stain clothing and is the most gentle under your arms while doing it&#x27;s assigned task of keeping you fresh and odor free</li>
            <li>Plus, it smells really fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Since switching to Arrid, I am much happier: much drier and better smelling.</li>
            <li>smells fresh without being too perfumy.  </li>
            <li>keeps me fresh</li>
            <li>The only kind that I could find, that wouldn&#x27;t break me out.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>This is the only gel product I have found that lasts all day and night, does not stain my clothes and most importantly does not burn...  </li>
            <li>so it goes on easy and no mess or sticky residue.</li>
            <li>Great product, but it is so hard to find the gel in the stores.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re needing a strong antiperspirant, and looking at these new improved &amp;#34;clinically&amp;#34; strong products, check this out - this is just as strong for alot less.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kinda manly at first</li>
            <li>This is the most only deodorant my husband will use.</li>
            <li>We love this deodorant and can&#x27;t find it locally.</li>
            <li>I get surgery induced hot flashes, which means I tend to sweat.  </li>
            <li>The so-called clinical products contain a higher percentage (20 %) of the stuff that helps to stop perspiration.  </li>
            <li>Service and product was exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not horrible, but the new fragrance is much stronger and has more of a \\&quot;baby powder\\&quot; smell to it- the old fragrance was a more subtle and fresher smell.</li>
            <li>I am not sure why this product is becoming so hard to find in the stores, but I think it is the best product on the market!</li>
            <li>Love the product and the price, I will continue to purchase for as long as I can</li>
            <li>i leave mine in the medicine cabinet and if you dont retract the gel after use, it will have seeeeped out on its own, making a mess when you pop the cap off.</li>
            <li>and we really like this deodorant.</li>
            <li>Very dissapointing.</li>
            <li>This time I bought a competing brand of Gel and promising myself I&#x27;d use it up and not put it, untouched, with my collection.     </li>
            <li>so much i have an automatic re-order for it.</li>
            <li>The price is also reasonable.</li>
            <li>Who wants to run out?</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This is the product I use, delivered promptly at reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipment Product as Advertised</li>
            <li>really guards against perspiration AND odors, practically eliminating both from happening&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is such a great product and yet is getting more difficult to find in stores.  </li>
            <li>CAn&#x27;t find in my usual places- love it!</li>
            <li>But those other products that have the word &amp;#34;Clinical&amp;#34; on their labels work even better.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m willing to pay a little more because they work.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for as long as it has been available.  </li>
            <li>The scent is nice (not overwhelming).  </li>
            <li>I tried this and it seemed to keep me dry and odor free.</li>
            <li>This is the only deodorant that I like and they quit making it, so I went to amazon and sure enough there it was.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The clinical products do cost a little more.  </li>
            <li>This may not sound like a 5 star rating to most people, but then you don&#x27;t know my dad.</li>
            <li>Had trouble finding more of the gel version in stores</li>
            <li>He especially loves using the clear gel because it dries quickly</li>
            <li>I tried about a dozen stores and was able to find a few of the old fragrance, but all the others were the new one.</li>
            <li>Had used the Arrid Extra Dry Gel / Morning Clean for Years!  </li>
            <li>(I have very sensitive skin)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have a hard time finding this particular scent at most stores.</li>
            <li>I am to the point that I don&#x27;t even know if I have BO because even three days later on a hunting trip I am still smelling pretty.  </li>
            <li>we couldn&#x27;t find this anywhere near where we live sooo...</li>
            <li>B00AD5B6KK Arrid Extra Dry Antiperspirant Deodorant, Clear Gel, Cool Shower, 2.6 Oz (Pack of 4)]] which I like as much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if Arrid isn&#x27;t making the clear gel anymore, or if stores are just no longer carrying it.</li>
            <li>Dont release tooo much, you literally only need a pinch to cover the whole arm pit or youre left feeling soggy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Product was obviously old.</li>
            <li>Saves me having to make frequent trips to store.</li>
            <li>Not only does this one last all day, it also seem to be allowing my underarm area to lighten back up to the original color.</li>
            <li>As other reviewers indicate, these Arrid Clear Gels are becoming increasingly harder to find.</li>
            <li>I have tried many and quite a few a lot more expensive than this one.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product, I have use it for a number of years and would be very disappointed if it were ever it available</li>
            <li>these bottles are only about half full.</li>
            <li>When I recently ran out of Arrid Clear Gel</li>

            <li> I can only say its the best it goes on easy and does not stain your cloths or leave white marks.</li>
            <li> much safer pick and feels much better on.</li>
            <li> I love the price and how fast it comes to the door</li>
            <li> Does not stain clothing and is the most gentle under your arms while doing it&#x27;s assigned task of keeping you fresh and odor free</li>
            <li> Plus, it smells really fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Since switching to Arrid, I am much happier: much drier and better smelling.</li>
            <li> smells fresh without being too perfumy.  </li>
            <li> keeps me fresh</li>
            <li> The only kind that I could find, that wouldn&#x27;t break me out.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> This is the only gel product I have found that lasts all day and night, does not stain my clothes and most importantly does not burn...  </li>
            <li> so it goes on easy and no mess or sticky residue.</li>
            <li> Great product, but it is so hard to find the gel in the stores.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re needing a strong antiperspirant, and looking at these new improved &amp;#34;clinically&amp;#34; strong products, check this out - this is just as strong for alot less.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kinda manly at first</li>
            <li> This is the most only deodorant my husband will use.</li>
            <li> We love this deodorant and can&#x27;t find it locally.</li>
            <li> I get surgery induced hot flashes, which means I tend to sweat.  </li>
            <li> The so-called clinical products contain a higher percentage (20 %) of the stuff that helps to stop perspiration.  </li>
            <li> Service and product was exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not horrible, but the new fragrance is much stronger and has more of a \\&quot;baby powder\\&quot; smell to it- the old fragrance was a more subtle and fresher smell.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why this product is becoming so hard to find in the stores, but I think it is the best product on the market!</li>
            <li> Love the product and the price, I will continue to purchase for as long as I can</li>
            <li> i leave mine in the medicine cabinet and if you dont retract the gel after use, it will have seeeeped out on its own, making a mess when you pop the cap off.</li>
            <li> and we really like this deodorant.</li>
            <li> Very dissapointing.</li>
            <li> This time I bought a competing brand of Gel and promising myself I&#x27;d use it up and not put it, untouched, with my collection.     </li>
            <li> so much i have an automatic re-order for it.</li>
            <li> The price is also reasonable.</li>
            <li> Who wants to run out?</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> This is the product I use, delivered promptly at reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipment Product as Advertised</li>
            <li> really guards against perspiration AND odors, practically eliminating both from happening&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is such a great product and yet is getting more difficult to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> CAn&#x27;t find in my usual places- love it!</li>
            <li> But those other products that have the word &amp;#34;Clinical&amp;#34; on their labels work even better.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m willing to pay a little more because they work.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for as long as it has been available.  </li>
            <li> The scent is nice (not overwhelming).  </li>
            <li> I tried this and it seemed to keep me dry and odor free.</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant that I like and they quit making it, so I went to amazon and sure enough there it was.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The clinical products do cost a little more.  </li>
            <li> This may not sound like a 5 star rating to most people, but then you don&#x27;t know my dad.</li>
            <li> Had trouble finding more of the gel version in stores</li>
            <li> He especially loves using the clear gel because it dries quickly</li>
            <li> I tried about a dozen stores and was able to find a few of the old fragrance, but all the others were the new one.</li>
            <li> Had used the Arrid Extra Dry Gel / Morning Clean for Years!  </li>
            <li> (I have very sensitive skin)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have a hard time finding this particular scent at most stores.</li>
            <li> I am to the point that I don&#x27;t even know if I have BO because even three days later on a hunting trip I am still smelling pretty.  </li>
            <li> we couldn&#x27;t find this anywhere near where we live sooo...</li>
            <li> B00AD5B6KK Arrid Extra Dry Antiperspirant Deodorant, Clear Gel, Cool Shower, 2.6 Oz (Pack of 4)]] which I like as much.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if Arrid isn&#x27;t making the clear gel anymore, or if stores are just no longer carrying it.</li>
            <li> Dont release tooo much, you literally only need a pinch to cover the whole arm pit or youre left feeling soggy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Product was obviously old.</li>
            <li> Saves me having to make frequent trips to store.</li>
            <li> Not only does this one last all day, it also seem to be allowing my underarm area to lighten back up to the original color.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers indicate, these Arrid Clear Gels are becoming increasingly harder to find.</li>
            <li> I have tried many and quite a few a lot more expensive than this one.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product, I have use it for a number of years and would be very disappointed if it were ever it available</li>
            <li> these bottles are only about half full.</li>
            <li> When I recently ran out of Arrid Clear Gel</li>
            <li> Very Bad will only last half a day and leaves sticky residue on you underarm that won&#x27;t i said won&#x27;t come off even with a shower smell is not good when mix with sweet  get Sure Unscented its better</li>
            <li> No white stuff, lasts long, doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell.</li>
            <li> , when they brought out the Arrid &#x27;Extra Extra Dry&#x27;, it broke me out just like that!  </li>
            <li> This deodorant is one of the only ones that keeps me and my clothing dry at all times.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid it was being discontinued, so I was really glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I will keep ordering as long as I can get it.  </li>
            <li> She had been searching for this deodorant locally, but it, like other products, appears to be gone.  </li>
            <li> They seemed to have discontinued the gel version of Arrid Xtra Dry..</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin&lt;</li>
            <li> but once it dies down, smells feminine enough for me.  </li>
            <li> Its hard to find a clear gel anti-perspirant and deodorant.</li>
            <li> More expensive than what the stores used to sell it for, but until we can find it again, we at least have a source.</li>
            <li> I was on my last few applications and then I was to have switched brands.</li>
            <li> and it does not rot out the sleeves of clothing like other deodorants</li>
            <li> I had had similar problems in the past and each time I bought a substitute.</li>
            <li> Used it for decades and other than switching scents from time to time</li>
            <li> This product has been hard to find recently in the stores where I shop.  </li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant I&#x27;ve used over the past few years.</li>
            <li> Only negative is Aarid isuttkng less in each container.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was previously using Degree for Women with Motion Sense</li>
            <li> As soon as it&#x27;s exhausted I&#x27;ll break open the six dispensers I got for Christmas.\\&quot;    </li>
            <li> The breakout and rash happened within a few moments of applying the gel.  </li>
            <li> I do not like solids and the gel is just not available anymore....</li>
            <li> Waste of plastic.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for years, at the suggestion of my family doctor, because of breaking out, but have been unable to find in locally.</li>
            <li> Not available in stores, at least not around me.  </li>
            <li> I used to use Mitchum which dried slowly, smelt weird and didn&#x27;t keep me dry.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to find.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> This gel Arrid id hard to find on store shelves.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> THIS SUCKS...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to deal with losing this trusted product for at least a 9 months.</li>
            <li> This is the only anti-perspirant that I use, and it&#x27;s become all but impossible to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that I can&#x27;t purchase this at CVS or any local drugstore!</li>
            <li> I got tired of trying to find it on the shelf and decided to let my fingers do the shopping.  </li>
            <li> I am so sad that I can not find this product in the stores anymore.  </li>
            <li> Both my husband and I use this product and it is almost impossible to find in the store.  </li>
            <li> I used to use the Arrid spray but hated the fact that it sprayed chemicals in to the air.</li>
            <li> I thought I was doomed to wander through life with perspiration and that disgusting under-arm smell, until I took a chance on this deodorant.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this and it&#x27;s hard to find.</li>
            <li> They seemed to have discontinued the gel version of Arrid Xtra Dry..I love this product. Its the only deodorant that doesn&#x27;t feel cakey or leave any trace on my clothing.. I&#x27;m disappointed that I can&#x27;t purchase this at CVS or any local drugstore! It&#x27;s the best!!!</li>
            <li> Simply, it&#x27;s the most effective, easiest to apply, and at the best price I&#x27;ve found.  Compared too the stick deodorants I used from the local stores, the ease of application and the duration per container are very impressive.  As I live in the \\&quot;cool dry climate\\&quot; here in Dallas/Fort Worth Texas, it&#x27;s effectiveness is most impressive and it does not rot out the sleeves of clothing like other deodorants I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all my wife and I use</li>
            <li> arrived on time.  just what I wanted</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a picky person when it comes to deodorant because most cause me to get a rash, since they must have something which I&#x27;m allergic to, but not with this ARRID gel. This deodorant doesn&#x27;t leave white stains on my shirts either. Plus, it smells really fresh and clean. They used to sell this locally in retail stores, but over a year ago they pulled it from most stores in California, so Thank you Amazon for keeping this stocked, your truly the best!</li>
            <li> we couldn&#x27;t find this anywhere near where we live sooo...now we have enough for year!!!</li>
            <li> This product has been hard to find recently in the stores where I shop.  I was happy to find it on Amazon and at a good price.  I have tried other deodorant gel types and have found Arrid to be the best one.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores and we really like this deodorant. More expensive than what the stores used to sell it for, but until we can find it again, we at least have a source.</li>
            <li> Great product plus great savings on sometimes hard to find.</li>
            <li> Was advertised as a gell and when it was received it was a stick.  Not sold as described.</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant I&#x27;ve used over the past few years. It&#x27;s great! No white stuff, lasts long, doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell. Absolutely fantastic product.</li>
            <li> CAn&#x27;t find in my usual places- love it!</li>
            <li> Nice product.  Can&#x27;t understand why its not still on the open market.</li>
            <li> The fragrance has definitely changed, even though when I called the manufacturer they said that they had not changed it. It&#x27;s not horrible, but the new fragrance is much stronger and has more of a \\&quot;baby powder\\&quot; smell to it- the old fragrance was a more subtle and fresher smell. I tried about a dozen stores and was able to find a few of the old fragrance, but all the others were the new one. Very dissapointing.</li>
            <li> This gel Arrid id hard to find on store shelves.  I have been using it for years.  A favorite of mine.</li>
            <li> Nice producat and  arrived on timet</li>
            <li> I have a huge perspiration problem and arrid products work the best for me. There is a lot of white marks with this compared to solid arrid, but it gets the job.</li>
            <li> My dad is 83 and is sometimes a bit of a crumudgeon. For Christmas, he asked for his favorite deodorant, which he could no longer find in stores. Here&#x27;s his mail:     \\&quot;I know what I like. When I recently ran out of Arrid Clear Gel I searched the stores for a resupply but gave up. I had had similar problems in the past and each time I bought a substitute. I have three unused deodorants that remain from those efforts.     This time I bought a competing brand of Gel and promising myself I&#x27;d use it up and not put it, untouched, with my collection.     As soon as it&#x27;s exhausted I&#x27;ll break open the six dispensers I got for Christmas.\\&quot;    This may not sound like a 5 star rating to most people, but then you don&#x27;t know my dad.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both use this deo and cannot get this at our local&lt;br /&gt;stores anymore as it has been discontinued. This is not sticky or overly&lt;br /&gt;fragrant. We ordered 12 so we do not run out.</li>
            <li> Great price on this product!</li>
            <li> My favorite deodorant. its a gel so it goes on easy and no mess or sticky residue. I&#x27;m so happy i found this scent and (gel) type. I used to use the Arrid spray but hated the fact that it sprayed chemicals in to the air. much safer pick and feels much better on.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find it in the stores...so thankful to find it here on Amazon. Now I can take my time finding a replacement.</li>
            <li> I used to use Mitchum which dried slowly, smelt weird and didn&#x27;t keep me dry. Since switching to Arrid, I am much happier: much drier and better smelling.</li>
            <li> This the only anti-perspiration and deodorant ica use and it has been discontinued, so when I saw it on amazon I was thrilled. Thank you amazon. It does just keep you dry and has a great smell to it.</li>
            <li> the local wal mart,target, etc stopped carrying this brand of deodorant. i like it and it works for me. smells fresh without being too perfumy.  it&#x27;s kinda manly at first but once it dies down, smells feminine enough for me.  keeps me fresh which is all i care about.  doesn&#x27;t irritate my underarms.  i like it so much i have an automatic re-order for it.</li>
            <li> I got tired of trying to find it on the shelf and decided to let my fingers do the shopping.  This product works well for me and now I have 1year plus supply!  It shipped on time and arrived in good shape.  Totally pleased with the experience.</li>
            <li> Had used the Arrid Extra Dry Gel / Morning Clean for Years!  The only kind that I could find, that wouldn&#x27;t break me out.&lt;br /&gt;But, when they brought out the Arrid &#x27;Extra Extra Dry&#x27;, it broke me out just like that!  Don&#x27;t know what they did to it, but something is different.  The breakout and rash happened within a few moments of applying the gel.  Tried 3 different ones and the same for each one happened each time?&lt;br /&gt;The Ingredients are different??&lt;br /&gt;Now I will have to try and find another brand to work&#x27;</li>
            <li> Used it for decades and other than switching scents from time to time I have always used and prefer the jell to the stick.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t find this product in the stores anymore.  I like the smell and the strength of this product.  The price is also reasonable.</li>
            <li> This is the only anti-perspirant that I use, and it&#x27;s become all but impossible to find in stores.  I&#x27;m glad that Amazon carries it.</li>
            <li> this is the only place I find what I like</li>
            <li> Deodorant, Can&#x27;t find this locally any longer and it  is the only one that does not break me out.</li>
            <li> It is all I have used for the last two years.  LOVE IT !!!!!</li>
            <li> As other reviewers indicate, these Arrid Clear Gels are becoming increasingly harder to find. The fact is, this is one of the two brands and type of deodorant that I like the most and look for on the shelves. Amazon is therefore providing a great service for some of us. It&#x27;s nice to buy in bulk. Who wants to run out? Their price is competitive also. At the same time, I also bought a 4-Pack of [[ASIN:B00AD5B6KK Arrid Extra Dry Antiperspirant Deodorant, Clear Gel, Cool Shower, 2.6 Oz (Pack of 4)]] which I like as much. I&#x27;m stocked up for months!</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t find this anywhere and it is the only thing my husband says works for him</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant I can use without getting a rash, but for some reason, they don&#x27;t sell it in the stores anymore.</li>
            <li> The description for this deodorant was accurate and the packaging was appropriately done as well.  I am glad I found this on Amazon.com</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for awhile, but the stores in my town don&#x27;t carry the gel anymore. I like it. It&#x27;s effective.</li>
            <li> these bottles are only about half full. i leave mine in the medicine cabinet and if you dont retract the gel after use, it will have seeeeped out on its own, making a mess when you pop the cap off. Dont release tooo much, you literally only need a pinch to cover the whole arm pit or youre left feeling soggy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By default this smells like the way any deoderant smells after you&#x27;ve played a sport... even at my freshest, i smell like ive just worked out... THIS SUCKS...</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I have use it for a number of years and would be very disappointed if it were ever it available</li>
            <li> I can only say its the best it goes on easy and does not stain your cloths or leave white marks. I love the price and how fast it comes to the door</li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT FAST DELIVERY</li>
            <li> I love the product which I have been using for awhile.  The only problem is that I can&#x27;t find it in Australia, so I have to order it online.  The service and price is fantastic so I don&#x27;t mind ordering it through Amazon.  You must try it!  You&#x27;ll never go back!!!</li>
            <li> Great product good price.  Hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> Best antiperspirant out there. Been using it for 30 years.</li>
            <li> Wal-Mart used to stock this item. Their loss is an Amazon gain. I have used this item for 25 years and have found nothing as good for me.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why this product is becoming so hard to find in the stores, but I think it is the best product on the market!</li>
            <li> This is the most only deodorant my husband will use.</li>
            <li> Very Bad will only last half a day and leaves sticky residue on you underarm that won&#x27;t i said won&#x27;t come off even with a shower smell is not good when mix with sweet  get Sure Unscented its better</li>
            <li> As described...  quick shipping too!  Thanks</li>
            <li> For some reason, no brick and mortar stores carry this anymore, and Amazon comes through again.  This has been my brand for years, and I&#x27;m so glad I can still buy it.  If you&#x27;re needing a strong antiperspirant, and looking at these new improved &amp;#34;clinically&amp;#34; strong products, check this out - this is just as strong for alot less.</li>
            <li> Great product, but it is so hard to find the gel in the stores. I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife (no, not for myself).  She had been searching for this deodorant locally, but it, like other products, appears to be gone.  I was happy to find this for her on Amazon!  I cannot say for certain why she likes this brand so much (she says because it works the best); all I know is if she&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Very good deodorant, I have been using it for many years!!!</li>
            <li> What an you say about a product that you use and required replacement when used up? This is the product I use, delivered promptly at reasonable cost. A perfect situation.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite deodorant on the market.  I have tried many and quite a few a lot more expensive than this one.  This deodorant is one of the only ones that keeps me and my clothing dry at all times.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I appreciate being able to order this product from you.  I have not been able to find it anymore in stores so its nice to have someplace to come and purchase it.  I also like the convenience of home delivery.</li>
            <li> I am so sad that I can not find this product in the stores anymore.  Thank you Amazon for carrying it.  This is the only gel product I have found that lasts all day and night, does not stain my clothes and most importantly does not burn...  ARRID Please start producing again...</li>
            <li> My husband used to get this deodorant at the store but none of the stores carry it anymore so we shop on amazon for the products that we love to use but can&#x27;t find in our area anymore.  He especially loves using the clear gel because it dries quickly and it does the job.</li>
            <li> We love this deodorant and can&#x27;t find it locally.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Cheaper to purchase on Amazon than at the store</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, many underarm anti-antiperspirants in my day some of which I wasn&#x27;t so satisfied with some, others worked well but would discolor my underarm area. Not only does this one last all day, it also seem to be allowing my underarm area to lighten back up to the original color. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> I was on my last few applications and then I was to have switched brands. I do not like solids and the gel is just not available anymore.... anywhere. What a great find.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant, I can&#x27;t find it at my local walmart anymore, and being able to find it online was great.</li>
            <li> I get surgery induced hot flashes, which means I tend to sweat.  A lot.  And at inopportune times.  I love this product.  I can&#x27;t get it in Alaska anymore, so I&#x27;m glad I found it here.</li>
            <li> I tried this and it seemed to keep me dry and odor free. Had trouble finding more of the gel version in stores so I bought it here. The price was good and I like the product.</li>
            <li> Its hard to find a clear gel anti-perspirant and deodorant. I&#x27;ve been using this for years and am happy with it.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipment Product as Advertised</li>
            <li> This products works &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;.  But those other products that have the word &amp;#34;Clinical&amp;#34; on their labels work even better.  Why?  The so-called clinical products contain a higher percentage (20 %) of the stuff that helps to stop perspiration.  The clinical products do cost a little more.  But I&#x27;m willing to pay a little more because they work.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if Arrid isn&#x27;t making the clear gel anymore, or if stores are just no longer carrying it. I have used this anti-perspirant/deodorant for decades. When I couldn&#x27;t find it in a couple of stores, I tried a couple of others. Didn&#x27;t do the job. I was so happy to see a four-pack at a good price on Amazon. I don&#x27;t have to deal with losing this trusted product for at least a 9 months. Also, it was well-priced.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for years, at the suggestion of my family doctor, because of breaking out, but have been unable to find in locally. I was afraid it was being discontinued, so I was really glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant my husband and I will use.</li>
            <li> Went out of shelf and I stocked up. This is the only deodorant that I like and they quit making it, so I went to amazon and sure enough there it was.</li>
            <li> works great applies easily and not too much</li>
            <li> Not available in stores, at least not around me.  I will keep ordering as long as I can get it.  Any fragrance is OK with me.  My husband and I both use this.</li>
            <li> This works quite well for me.  I have used plenty of brands of anti-perspirant, and this is one of the best (mitchum is probably equally as good if you ask me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does quite a good job as an anti-perspirant (I give it a pretty good workout on a regular basis, I do plenty of manual labor), and had a nice smell to it.  I would say this is my favorite scent that Arrid makes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The value is pretty good as well.</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant that doesn&#x27;t irritate my armpits.  I have been using it for over ten years, now, and have no plans ro desire to switch.  The scent is nice (not overwhelming).  If you get irritated by solids, sprays or roll-ons, or if you are just looking for a nice-smelling, long-lasting deodorant, consider trying this.</li>
            <li> Have a hard time finding this particular scent at most stores. Amazon having it, and having it for a good price is great but having in a six pack is even better. Don&#x27;t have to worry about running out. Only negative is Aarid isuttkng less in each container. Waste of plastic.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this in stores in my area any longer. So I was happy to have found it here!!! I hope I can continue to get it here</li>
            <li> I thought I was doomed to wander through life with perspiration and that disgusting under-arm smell, until I took a chance on this deodorant. I&#x27;m honestly really impressed by this product, because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin&lt;br /&gt;-It doesn&#x27;t cause irritation (I have very sensitive skin)&lt;br /&gt;-It has a pleasant and long-lasting smell&lt;br /&gt;-It really guards against perspiration AND odors, practically eliminating both from happening&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was previously using Degree for Women with Motion Sense and I thought that was as good as I&#x27;d get as far as deodorants go. I&#x27;m glad I purchased Arrid because this product has changed my grooming/beauty routine forever!</li>
            <li> Product was obviously old.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the Arrid gel.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for as long as it has been available.  I am to the point that I don&#x27;t even know if I have BO because even three days later on a hunting trip I am still smelling pretty.  Goes on easy, doesn&#x27;t stain anything.  It doesn&#x27;t handle plane rides well...you need to roll it back in before you put it in your luggage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sure hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it.  Can&#x27;t find it locally.  Had to order from Amazon.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t find this product in the stores here, so I was very happy to get six of them at one time. It is a great product, I don&#x27;t know why Arrid doesn&#x27;t support it.</li>
            <li> Service and product was exactly as advertised.  Great experience.</li>
            <li> it met my expectations</li>
            <li> This is such a great product and yet is getting more difficult to find in stores.  Does not stain clothing and is the most gentle under your arms while doing it&#x27;s assigned task of keeping you fresh and odor free</li>
            <li> if you like a gel, try this</li>
            <li> Lot&#x27;s of stores don&#x27;t carry this any more for what ever reason. Love the product and the price, I will continue to purchase for as long as I can</li>
            <li> great for getting just the right about applied</li>
            <li> Great product.  Received as promised.  Saves me having to make frequent trips to store.</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I use this product and it is almost impossible to find in the store.  So glad we could buy it in bulk and keep it in the closet.  This stuff works and NO marks or stain on your clothing.</li>
            <li> Exactly want I needed and wanted!!</li>
