            <li>There are lots of great YouTube videos that show how to do it if you search for &amp;</li>
            <li>This product works great.</li>
            <li>So the look might blend in with a great deal of eyeshadow, but not day-to-day.</li>
            <li>lol....</li>
            <li>The company did have great communication and did refund my money.  </li>

            <li>This product is AMAZING!  </li>
            <li>Amazing the difference in my lashes!</li>
            <li>Amazing product!</li>
            <li>Amazing !</li>
            <li>This product is amazing!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing!</li>
            <li>if you need better instructions, it works awesome!!</li>
            <li>I love it works just as it says it would very happy</li>
            <li>and you can get better results from just a good primer and Maybelline!!...</li>
            <li>When I can get it on without too many clumps, it looks great!  </li>
            <li>Honestly, these things work great and Youtube reviewer Grav3yard Girl even gave this a great review.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily, it wears great; no smudging or raccoon eyes!</li>
            <li>Received item very quickly, and I am very happy with product.</li>
            <li>And although it is easy to remove (I use baby oil) - the staying power is excellent.</li>
            <li>Maybelline great lash works better than this!</li>
            <li>and she really loved it,</li>
            <li>I loved that part of it.</li>
            <li>but…&lt;br /&gt;Adding the fibers is a good way to make your lashes look fuller and longer</li>
            <li>/&gt;I loved it.</li>
            <li>Good mascara for anything</li>
            <li>My wife absolutely loved this mascara.  </li>
            <li>Loved the look of the completed eye.</li>
            <li>If it was including a really good mascara it would be a 5 star.</li>
            <li>but while I was putting it on I honestly didn&#x27;t think it looked great.</li>
            <li>A good fiber mascara from Loreal is just as good.  </li>
            <li>would be a good product if it didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li>Arrived in good condition.  </li>
            <li>and I was good to go.</li>
            <li>not as good as the one i bought from a Younique distributor.  </li>
            <li>Knock offs are not as good.</li>
            <li>i knew that it would be too good to be true!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>rep contacted me to see how much i &#x27;loved&#x27; the product.</li>
            <li>Had them for a good two weeks while wearing the mascara.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s TRUE!!!  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even apply my own mascara before applying the gel and fibers and it still looks amazing!</li>
            <li>However, I can honestly say I found it amazing!  </li>
            <li>Great and easy to use!</li>
            <li>Most people cnt afford to pay 30.00 for mascara no matter how great it is.  </li>
            <li>Coup De Theatere is a great alternative and moisturizes your lashes more...</li>
            <li>Looks great and much better than \\&quot;spider leg\\&quot; eyes.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this purchase</li>
            <li>At first I loved the mascara and was so impressed, after a week or so of using it</li>
            <li>I was able to keep it on all day and it looked great.  </li>
            <li>ok, if the product had been great, I&#x27;d have given the packaging a pass.</li>
            <li>Can make even the crappiest mascara you own look good.</li>
            <li>I thought I would give this product a go as I see so many people selling and buying this product!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>

            <li>I followed the directions and have amazing lashes.  </li>
            <li>But it is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>I received this product as gift for Christmas and it is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Amazing difference in lashes.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing .</li>
            <li>My lashes look amazing.</li>
            <li>The opportunity to share these amazing products should be considered as well.</li>
            <li>it says to apply with your own mascara.</li>
            <li>I must say  though that it works wonderfully, and makes her eyelashes look much thicker.</li>
            <li>and I reeeaaally liked it.</li>
            <li>Kind of clumps.</li>
            <li>I have used the real product and it&#x27;s awesome and did not come in a package mailed from China.</li>
            <li>That may be why I&#x27;m loving it.  </li>
            <li>Gives full beautiful lashes.</li>
            <li>I really liked it and it works</li>
            <li>The directions says to use your own mascara</li>
            <li>Honestly?  </li>
            <li>Save yourself some time and cash by layering your own mascara.</li>
            <li>had tried some a friend had and liked it</li>
            <li>The fibers are great, better than most</li>
            <li>(although I do use a good brand - Lancôme Definicils), but for thicker lashes with more volume, this mascara does the trick.  </li>
            <li>It makes your own lashes come off.</li>
            <li>Tried this from a friend and ordered my own.</li>
            <li>Really a nice surprise.</li>
            <li>Otherwise all was nice  </li>
            <li>And I liked the result.</li>
            <li>and I really liked it.</li>
            <li>kind of look</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear a ton of make-up but, when I do bother to put it on, I want it to look nice.  </li>
            <li>Love love love this product!!  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love this!!</li>
            <li>Package states best results after applying normal mascara.</li>
            <li>Package was great and quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>Comes off very easily with makeup remover products.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>it is very easy to remove.</li>
            <li>My favorite mascara is Lash Love from Mary Kay!</li>
            <li>I love it, its amazing the results</li>
            <li>I was able to keep the nice curl along with darkening and thickening my lashes.  </li>
            <li>This a great product especially if you have a wedding or something important that you want to look your best at!</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing mascara I have ever used</li>
            <li>I must say this is the best product by far.</li>

            <li>love, love, love this!</li>
            <li>Love love love this mascara!  </li>
            <li>and it just wasn&#x27;t as good as my original.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product and tried it expecting great results, but there were several disappointments that I experienced with this product.</li>
            <li>I love this best mascara I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as easy as applying normal mascara, though it does take a couple of go rounds to perfect the technique.</li>
            <li>messed up at first and got an eyeful of fibers, lol, but that was user error.</li>
            <li>Love love love love love!</li>
            <li>Great product, really makes a difference and doesn&#x27;t fall on your cheeks!</li>
            <li>Good mascara, dries out quick</li>
            <li>If you have fine skimpy lashes, the transformation is amazing.</li>
            <li>well after 1 coat my eyelashes was huge!</li>
            <li>I tried applying it with and without my mascara as well as applying a bit more gel to seal it.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, but it really it is way over priced.  </li>
            <li>Please folks, why are you paying MORE for these lashes than getting them from a Younique presenter?  </li>
            <li>To get the authentic 3D Mascara, order from a presenter like myself.  </li>
            <li>Love this mascara.</li>
            <li>As a makeup artist I do not think they make your lashes look flawless at all if you have short lashes trying to build the length.</li>
            <li>do the job better.</li>
            <li>Top are now shorter than bottom lashes.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you follow the instructions.</li>
            <li>I love the mascara</li>
            <li>It makes your eyes &amp; eyelashes look fabulous!</li>
            <li>Love it&lt;br /&gt;BUT</li>
            <li>The product is ok, but just ok.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually really simple to apply too, the brush for the gel is great!</li>
            <li>So glad I&#x27;d just tried it in the day rather than for an event or night</li>
            <li>This is ok.</li>
            <li>Buying from a rep insures authenticity and the 14 day love</li>
            <li>You either love it...or you don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>absolutely love them.</li>
            <li>I have had issues with clumping on a couple applications but have been able to use a eyelash brush to comb out and have not had any of the fibers fall off.</li>
            <li>I have better results with CHERRY BLOOMS than I did with Younique.</li>

            <li>I Love mascara&#x27;s</li>
            <li>and I have tried so many</li>
            <li>I love this 3D Fiber Mascara.  </li>
            <li>All you can do is try it, if you don&#x27;t love it, with this mascara there is a 14 day return policy.  </li>
            <li>but it sure adds length and volume to my lashes :)</li>
            <li>I have had many compliments on the length of my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Watch out for counterfeiters and make sure you are buying from a reputable seller.  </li>
            <li>My girlfriends also love the moodstruck 3d fiber lashes.</li>
            <li>I will be contacting a Younique Rep in my area as I do LOVE this product</li>
            <li>Looks better than most mascaras--but the gel has an ingredient in it that I read is know to burn and itch,</li>
            <li>I love makeup</li>
            <li>I love this product...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the off brand mascara, Love Alpha.</li>
            <li>it fibers more gel....</li>
            <li>Extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li>:)  This person is selling this product illegitimately, and may or may not be counterfeit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The money will be going to women/children who are sexually abused.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara..</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I am sure she will help you answer any questions you may have.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>but I was thinking ok, just buy them</li>
            <li>So I kept applying more coats and it didn&#x27;t do a thing.</li>
            <li>Having used the authentic Younique brand and the knockoff for comparison, there is literally no difference.</li>
            <li>I love it and it doesn&#x27;t clump my eyelashes together at all</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely better than any of the drug store brands.</li>
            <li>it was ok.  </li>
            <li>so you have to be sure to wipe them away.  </li>
            <li>Love this fiber mascara.  </li>
            <li>Love this mascara.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had drugstore brands that worked better than this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to get her more for her Bday.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Maybe, they need to apply it better.  </li>
            <li>I love this thing... after putting 3coats on each eye</li>
            <li>Ok I know it shows my husbands name on this as the reviewer</li>
            <li>I love the results and have never had an issue with it.  </li>
            <li>ok, they look huge!&amp;#34; Then, at the end of the day, the mascara has went under my eyes and my eyes looked horrible.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Very much enjoyed the ease of buying this product, and my daughter loves to use it, probably will buy more.</li>
            <li>it is not an authentic Younique Mascara.  </li>
            <li>I was still going to work with it and try to use it on my top lashes (</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had many satisfied customers...</li>
            <li>also you get a 14 day love it guarantee by purchasing off a presenter like me or someone you know...</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>Love it, love it, love it</li>
            <li>I was okay even though I crashed at a night after the club</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>Ok product, clumps up.</li>
            <li>I love the idea of the product and</li>
            <li>I did get a video up on my tablet (via youtube) before I applied, so that I could make sure it was done correctly.  </li>
            <li>this was helpful.&lt;br /&gt;:-)</li>
            <li>Such a beautiful result!</li>
            <li>Damaged my lashes for sure :</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions and consider myself to be an intelligent, sensible, reasonable person.</li>
            <li>While it is OK, it does not work for ME like the picture.</li>
            <li>Ideally like the natural look</li>
            <li>Great idea, however,  much TOO CLUMPY.</li>
            <li>The mascara is just ok, it took over 3 weeks to arrive.</li>
            <li>and I feel it is a much better product.</li>
            <li>, I would like to try that.&amp;#34;  I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>but when I do it&#x27;s very easy to apply, no smudgind and comes off easily.  </li>
            <li>The lashes through younique are AMAZING and can be ordered through one of their beautiful presenters and will only cost you 29.00 plus tax, shipping and handling.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, amazing product!</li>
            <li>The results are real and the effects are amazing!</li>
            <li>My eye lashes have never looked better and the best part is they look real and soooo much longer than using mascara.  </li>
            <li>I bought this from a Younique rep and absolutely loved it the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good.</li>
            <li>If your are looking for an incredible mascara you have found it, just make sure you get it from an actual presenter</li>
            <li>This is honestly the ONLY mascara that has made me happy with the outcome.</li>
            <li>Makes your lashes very full.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really a makeup person, but I sometimes wear mascara and this just adds a lot of length that could never or hasn&#x27;t been achieved with even the best of mascaras.  </li>
            <li>If you spend $100 or more, you will also get FREE expedited shipping.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes, its great for contact lens wearers</li>
            <li>when you first get it though it&#x27;s nice and many compliments</li>
            <li>By the end of a 8 - 9 hour day the mascara is also smudging more than I am comfortable with.  </li>
            <li>My eyelashes have been abused many years, with cheap mascara.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much, now I am a sales rep.</li>
            <li>Took too much time to apply for results, might as well get good mascara or eyelash extensions.</li>
            <li>A friend tried this product and loved it so much she started selling it.</li>
            <li>My friend told me a trick to getting the fibers to adhere the best- open the tubes so you can quickly apply the gel and then the fibers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It even stayed on after a full 8 hour work day and a 2 hour workout after that!</li>
            <li>Used it today for the first time and have gotten so many compliments on my lashes!</li>
            <li>It comes off super easy with just water!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time i wore it, I fell in love!  </li>
            <li>the fibers can easily get in your eyes</li>
            <li>Younique makeup is Chemical free, Carcinogin Free, Paraben Free, Cruelty Free, Gluten Free, Hypoallergenic, Organic and just all around amazing</li>
            <li>and it removes easily with pads, some use face wash/soap/water.  </li>
            <li>and now it&#x27;s easy for me to apply.</li>
            <li>Two easy steps and POW.....</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and easy to remove.  </li>
            <li>Easy to remove.</li>
            <li>Younique comes off easy and doesn’t leave you looking like a raccoon after.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and it lasts all day and then some.</li>
            <li>With practice and a steady hand, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>The product is super easy to wash off - Sometimes I won&#x27;t have to use makeup remover after getting out of the shower and surprisingly stays on pretty well - slept with it on and still noticeably had curled eyelashes with no smudges.</li>
            <li>This mascara is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of mascaras and with this one I had instant beautiful results.</li>
            <li>And you gotta even apply your own Mascara first ??  </li>
            <li>The mascara may be nice...never tried it due to the fact that the one to try here at the fair is one that everyone here at this fair has tried.</li>
            <li>the product itself is pretty nice</li>
            <li>I would only purchase from the Younique site or from a Beautiful Younique Presenter for $29.00 US</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been just fine.</li>
            <li>The initial effect of the mascara is brilliant, full of length and body.</li>
            <li>Loved at when I first got the product although found I kept getting fibres in my eyes which would annoy and irritate my eyes to the point it just wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>Just the tansplanting gel is fine.</li>
            <li>She, too, tested the theory and the days that she didn&#x27;t wear it, her head was fine.</li>
            <li>Omg it make my eyes look super cute .</li>
            <li>the most beautiful lashes I&#x27;ve been capable of achieving thus far</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is a good product and would encourage you to not waste your money on this!</li>
            <li>Takes a little getting used to but this stuff is great!</li>
            <li>Very fast postage!!  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a huge difference</li>
            <li>For that I&#x27;ll just buy cheap mascara.  </li>
            <li>so yes i am happy with with the overall experience.</li>
            <li>Just look at all the cheap knockoffs of designer handbags.  </li>
            <li>Really extends lashes nicely.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing and works really well if applied correctly.</li>
            <li>Use light touches.</li>
            <li>After asking a handful of my friends if they experienced the same issue in which they responded yes to, I will no longer use this product.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>The shipping was free</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this product and am not too happy with it.</li>
            <li>Fabulous, it is as it describes.</li>
            <li>This mascara system is fantastic.</li>
            <li>The tips of my lashes would not get smooth, they looked like they had lots of split ends.</li>
            <li>Fabulous.  </li>
            <li>Have not tried this and the reviews don&#x27;t sound like I want to.  </li>
            <li>(to sort of smooth them</li>
            <li>the effect on my bottom lashes was totally bizarre) until the irritation started.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;If be happy to help any of you women with your lash needs properly www.misssassylashes.com</li>
            <li>I enjoy doing my makeup now</li>
            <li>wording was misspelled and the makeup was cheap quality.</li>
            <li>Just ok, seem to get the same results with a good mascara.</li>
            <li>But this is the REAL DEAL!!!</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says love this xxxoooo</li>
            <li>Truly worth the money!</li>
            <li>and I was originally excited to try this product out for myself since I use Too Faced brand</li>
            <li>first theres tooo many  .  </li>
            <li>so I was excited.</li>
            <li>Sure, it makes your lashes longer but the tips look funny.</li>
            <li>Since the first application I felt in love with this mascara...</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>im pretty pleased</li>
            <li>It does say to put on top of mascara first</li>
            <li>I love this product when I first get it</li>
            <li>I was excited when I got it.</li>
            <li>Was so excited, I tried it as soon as it arrived.</li>
            <li>Application is straightforward.</li>
            <li>, I was excited that this would work.  </li>
            <li>First, the product requires you to use your own mascara and apply it first, not included in the $39 price.</li>
            <li>and I notice throughout the day of wearing it I&#x27;m having to clean under my eyes.</li>
            <li>And the cool part is the directions dont say &amp;#34;use fiber with youniques mascara&amp;#34; (like most companies that only recommend their own stuff)...</li>
            <li>and I received  right on time very quickly.</li>
            <li>I placed the fiber coat on right after the transplanting gel, followed by the transplanting gel... fiber in my eyes!</li>
            <li>I got these and the first 2 times I used it, it worked great however every time I tried to apply it after those 2 times by gel wand became clumpy and the fibers only stuck to the gel wand and not my eye lashes.</li>
            <li>Lol just be careful it gets in it</li>
            <li>they make my lashes look so full.</li>
            <li>I should have known better, even the photos the gals looked like they had too much mascara on.</li>
            <li>fast shipping too will purchase again :)</li>
            <li>I could tell a difference in this and the generic brand, looks wise and the way they affected my eyes.</li>
            <li>And when you spend money on Youniques foundation (which is coming out in 2015) on an actual presenter page you will be helping for a good cause.  </li>
            <li>I love it, it really makes your eyelashes look longer and fuller.</li>
            <li>These lashes are good IF you have the time to properly apply them and separate them.</li>
            <li>Most days, it is very clumpy.  </li>
            <li>100% True.</li>
            <li>I love it so much that I became a distributor.</li>
            <li>the brush is just one lump, kind of like it is old maybe.</li>
            <li>The lab results showed the product was full of toxins.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did because this product really works.</li>
            <li>i also tried doing my lashes twice with my regular mascara and it turned out really good.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product but would not re-purchase.</li>
            <li>Remember that if it&#x27;s too good to be true, it actually is.</li>
            <li>(I tried the Love Alpha, and the gel dries so fast, that even when quickly applying the fibers, they do not stick well to your lashes.</li>
            <li>Clumpy, lashes sticking together, leaky gel, and having to go thru a Rep and waiting for your product to come in verses going to Ulta and having my purchase right away, not buying 3d again...offered it free to my niece, my daughter, &amp; a neighbor and nobody</li>
            <li>I mainly wear mascara on top lashes.</li>
            <li>After many friends trying to push it at me, I decided to give it a try, against my better judgement more or less.  </li>
            <li>Following the directions exactly, it works amazingly!</li>
            <li>best thing that my sis showed me.. better than wearing false eyelashes!  </li>
            <li>but the mascara/glue dries out too quickly...</li>
            <li>sometimes it&#x27;s a lucky shot to get something at a lower price, but not in this case.</li>
            <li>The idea of the product is brilliant and effective but the wear of the product is flawed.</li>
            <li>I received my order quickly and it worked well.</li>
            <li>Love it, but you are selling this too high....</li>
            <li>Love love love this 3D Fiber lash mascara,  as long as its real.</li>
            <li>For special occasions it&#x27;s totally worth it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>This product is so fantastic and is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty darn good but not worth the price on top of a mascara.</li>
            <li>The transplanting gel was nice and thin and did not clump in the slightest - considering it was on top of a layer of my own Avon mascara.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>If anyone has any questions or wants to discuss Younique and the quality of the products that TRUE presenters stand by, please feel free to reach out to me.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and really make your lashes pop according to my wife.</li>
            <li>with my fair skin, even though I have dark brown hair, my lashes are quite light</li>
            <li>younique  Moodstruck is easy to apply and does really enhance the fullness of your eyelashes.</li>
            <li>This product can easily look too much.</li>
            <li>Shipping was so fast - so thank you!!  </li>
            <li>Several of my friends bought it too and all love it as well!</li>
            <li>I would recommend these to anyone that wants fuller lashes!!</li>
            <li>I knew as soon as I used this mascara the first time, all ladies would want it!  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>Really like this mascara!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard about the mascara and was interested in it and when she offered this a a form of payment to me, I thought what the heck!</li>
            <li>I will absolutely spend the $29!!</li>
            <li>It really did what it said it would do!!</li>
            <li>I bought it from a younique distributor so it is absolutely not fake!  </li>
            <li>, it was great lasted almost 6 months, this stuff now is one clumpy mess,  </li>
            <li>And I realize BLACK mascara is the most prevalent kind, and I prefer brown.</li>
            <li>but it actually goes on really quick and the results are astounding.  </li>
            <li>they look cool if you are very gentle with putting them on.</li>
            <li>Wonderful I Abe been using it everyday!!!</li>
            <li>Cannot believe how great it is for one who has so few lashes.</li>
            <li>I bought for my wife and she absolutely loves this.&lt;br /&gt;Coming from a woman in the beauty business this is a huge compliment.</li>
            <li>only it makes my lashes amazing.</li>
            <li>this is an amazing product order from someone who actually sells and knows about our products</li>
            <li>The product is great - it took a few weeks to be delivered though and didn&#x27;t come with any instructions.</li>
            <li>Def worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Even though the mascara it comes with is pretty cool by itself.</li>
            <li>The problem is I&#x27;ve noticed that my natural lashes are much more scarce.</li>
            <li>This is truly worth every penny.</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t worth 35$ .</li>
            <li>However, after getting the product, I don&#x27;t think it was worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I would stick with the drugstore brand to create more natural looking lashes.</li>
            <li>What I got was the same result as two coats of regular mascara, and incredibly itchy eyes from the fibers.</li>
            <li>You are better off using latisse, or the generic stuff, strip lashes or even the lash extensions, which maintenance wise is only about $40 every 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>I spent a good chunk of money growing them with LiLash and after wearing this maybe three times I noticed my lashes were severely damaged.</li>
            <li>Takes time to get used to but worth it.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and I am not trying to call out the seller, but I have been doing professional makeup for several years now</li>
            <li>Is it worth $29?</li>
            <li>Worth it.  </li>
            <li>The results arent worth &amp;#34;falking&amp;#34; lashes.</li>
            <li>honestly didn&#x27;t think a mascara could possibly make my lashes so noticeably longer &amp; fuller.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it -</li>
            <li>So worth the money</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>While I liked the way it made my  lashes look, I noticed that the fibers dropped onto my face constantly and in my eyes as soon as I put it on.</li>
            <li>I via my lashes once for a more natural with a splash of drama</li>
            <li>I like more natural looking</li>
            <li>It took only two tries for me to get it right, but the end results are beautiful!!!</li>
            <li>Since I have been happy with fibers I wanted to find something even more dramatic; I found younique</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found other mascara products.without fibers in them that works just as good and do not irritate your eyes.</li>
            <li>Was a great buy, got here fast and exactly what I had expected.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are TOO long if I use more than 1 coat!</li>
            <li>Fibers dont stick right and</li>
            <li>Also as the day goes on the fibers get on to your skin right underneath your eye making it look like you have raccoon eyes.  </li>
            <li>so it takes me a while to get it right.</li>
            <li>i had to practice 2 times before getting it right</li>
            <li>And they all place an order right then at [...]  </li>
            <li>Below, on the right, is just my CG Bombshell.</li>
            <li>and it comes right off.</li>
            <li>but they brush right off and don’t leave any marks.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t apply the gel right then the fibers will get in your eyes and on your cheeks.  </li>
            <li>but it definitely needs to be authentic or you&#x27;ll be wearing full falsies.</li>
            <li>As I use it more, I do a better job and it looks less spidery and clumpy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very good product , but it&#x27;s to expensive , you can get around 10$ ,,,,,))) and same quality , go to - aliexpress.com , good luck , on this site , they overcharging ))))</li>
            <li>Yes your lashes look great but no better than any lash thickening and lengthening mascara.  </li>
            <li>looked fabulous, then I came home and used eye makeup remover and my normal face wash</li>
            <li>It does give your lashes a great extension but, honestly, there are a lot of good mascara&#x27;s out there that do the same thing ...without flaking fibers in your tear ducts :(</li>
            <li>This a great product, sold for only 29.00 on Younique (or any independent sellers&#x27;) webpage.</li>
            <li>If you love long full lashes this is a must buy</li>
            <li>the fibers would be in my eyes, the mascara wand was kind of dry</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast as well.</li>
            <li>Just because it is natural does not mean it is safe or that you won&#x27;t react to it.</li>
            <li>Great product but be careful using as the fibers can get in your eyes if you are not careful.  </li>
            <li>There are many product with the same ingredients for 1/2 the price.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the only way to get it!&lt;br /&gt;Order the authentic fiber lashes at www.youniqueproducts.com/NancyRusso&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product really does as advertised!</li>
            <li>I put my contacts in first and do it</li>
            <li>Used this for the first time today.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>and I wanted it;).</li>
            <li>Only sites with youniqueproducts.com in the name are authentic.</li>
            <li>so it is not a fake, damaged or expired.</li>
            <li>although it seems to be better from actual company.</li>
            <li>the mascara I received from actual company was much better quality.</li>
            <li>After first eye application the applicator broke inside tube.</li>
            <li>Be aware that these are not waterproof and can smear from sweat  or moisture.</li>
            <li>I put it on exactly like</li>
            <li>This really works wonders!</li>
            <li>Find a presenter instead of buying here because then you get the terrific return policy and the Love</li>
            <li>Better then Flash Lashes which uses the white fibers....</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>Makes my eyelashes much longer!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not even funny.  </li>
            <li>Please be aware of this in your presenter agreement.  </li>
            <li>I am absolutely amazed at the results!</li>
            <li>The shipping waa extremely fast and it came in a protective package!</li>
            <li>I love it and it makes a big difference in length of lashes</li>
            <li>When you walk into a room or take a photo, the first thing seen shouldn&#x27;t be lashes up to your forehead.  </li>
            <li>Thank you to them for being a stand up company ;)</li>
            <li>Product is exactly what it claims it is and does</li>
            <li>you are interested, or want to verify this information</li>
            <li>It most definitely does not look like falsies.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Make sure youre doing the steps correctly and actually buying the correct mascara.</li>
            <li>It literally doesn&#x27;t matter if they are the authentic Younique brand or the knock off version, they all come from a factory in China and the ingredients are the same.</li>
            <li>I suspect most of the 5 star reviews come from the presenters themselves and not actual customers buying the product.</li>
            <li>And I broke out around my eyes after the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li>These are most likely not what they state</li>
            <li>This is for real!</li>
            <li>Also, the fibers will fall off at first</li>
            <li>I have definitely come to love this mascara.</li>
            <li>I just tried this for the first time...</li>
            <li>The fibers kept falling off on top of my cheeks and made me look like I just got back from coal mining.</li>
            <li>I am a makeup artist but this was my first experience with fiber lashes.</li>
            <li>and she said that many people don&#x27;t apply the second coat of gel after applying fibers and if i do i need to apply more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First it took forever to receive.</li>
            <li>There is a YouTube video with a lady doing a demonstration on her eyes and you have to see the results, and she does it without the masacara being applied first.</li>
            <li>Tried the system on, at first, it was, &amp;#34;Wow..</li>
            <li>So, I curled them, first.</li>
            <li>The first application of the gel, I noticed,</li>
            <li>Adding more onto the already gross looking lashes...dislike this product!</li>
            <li>The product if great just doesn&#x27;t last as long as you would think.</li>
            <li>final note: Younique presenters love to push that this is &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I love the way my very blonde lashes look with this</li>
            <li>The recommendations to do one eye at a time helps, that&#x27;s what I did the first time</li>
            <li>would most definitely recommend this product to anyone &amp; I do!</li>
            <li>The mascara smells funny and the fibers are always falling off and it looks like dirt on your face.  </li>
            <li>I am smiling with my eyes thanks to #Younique 3d mascara!  </li>
            <li>First time I bought it at the beauty show in Vegas</li>
            <li>This is the second time I purchased this product I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>One word,  WOW!!!!  </li>
            <li>For the amount of money that this costs, I will continue go to Sephora or Ulta and buy a much better mascara that I know works and won&#x27;t cause irritation or make a huge mess.</li>
            <li>just isn&#x27;t ever enough for an evening or special occasion look, I finally found djv fiberwig mascara which is another kind of fiber mascara</li>
            <li>Younique offers the ORIGINAL 3D fiberlash mascara.</li>
            <li>and it does not even work the same as an original Younique!</li>
            <li>and at night I washed it off with warm water and baby shampoo where its gentle and wouldn&#x27;t be rough on my eyes.</li>
            <li>Make sure you get the real thing from the actual company.  </li>
            <li>but they fill out my lashes so much i never need more than 2 coats on and will definitely get this product again.</li>
            <li>not a difference really from regular mascara, just more things to do..</li>
            <li>I ave not used it since and have returned to good ole fashioned Loreal Voluminous until I have the same length back.</li>
            <li>I have heard many say the Younique 3D Fiber Mascara that is sold on Amazon is a knock off, so beware..to get the real deal like I did and to only pay $29</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, you still have to own your old regular mascara, because the instructions say to put on 1 coat of that before the Younique product.  </li>
            <li>I have short, sparse, fine lashes and have tried so many different mascaras.</li>
            <li>Really easy and saved loads of money by not buying false eyelashes, very pleased</li>
            <li>Made my eyelashes really love long</li>
            <li>I bought the real mascara from a seller, and at first my lashes looked fuller... for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Fast fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I just wanted to be honest, but its NOT worth the price.</li>
            <li>I love Amazon, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this here, as many have said it&#x27;s not a good idea.</li>
            <li>Washes off easily with dial soap, unlike regular mascaras.</li>
            <li>It is easily removed with my regular eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply, the only thing I didn&#x27;t care for was</li>
            <li>The only dislike is that the fibers I find on my cheeks but that being said still so worth the money an how full my lashes are.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pure nastiness of gunk around your eyes</li>
            <li>Now my lashes look full and super long!</li>
            <li>that is the only way to ensure that you are getting the TRUE product and an HONEST person on the other end of the transaction.  </li>
            <li>I thought this would be a great product, until the little fibers from the fiber wand starting flaking into my eyes.</li>
            <li>Do I want to buy an item that is not guaranteed by the manufacturer because it is not being sold ethically?</li>
            <li>My eyes bothered me the whole night.</li>
            <li>This really irritated my eyes.</li>
            <li>THEN YOU ARE NOT ASSURED YOU ARE GETTING THE REAL THING!&lt;br /&gt;BE</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t cost this much, and you may and probably are getting fakes.  </li>
            <li>I intensely DISLIKE this mascara.  </li>
            <li>And you know you are getting the real deal!&lt;br /&gt;Https://www.youniqueproducts.com</li>
            <li>Really irritates my eyes.</li>
            <li>Irritated my eyes so much</li>
            <li>you really have to follow the directions otherwise</li>
            <li>I like it very well.</li>
            <li>I really wish I can give this a zero star rating.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not the real Younique product.</li>
            <li>can understand why some might not like it, but it&#x27;s honestly a really neat product</li>
            <li>Really works, but I suck at applying it</li>
            <li>The fibers last all day and look fantastic.</li>
            <li>Once again, I was very hesitant.</li>
            <li>This coming from a gal who absolutely hates mascara and tried everything from drug store mascaras to Dior mascaras.</li>
            <li>package arrived really</li>
            <li>I have been fighting straight, straggly eyelashes my whole life and this is the 1st product that ever lived up to it&#x27;s promises.  </li>
            <li>Besides, permanent lashes removes your real lashes after time.</li>
            <li>This is the real product.</li>
            <li>Within 5 minutes my eyelids started burning andfeeling very itchy..</li>
            <li>thanks for making it</li>
            <li>Too much fall out on your face</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t like how it looks.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It did take me about 3 times before I really got the hang of it</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really noticed any benefit, it can  be very flakey.</li>
            <li>so I really can&#x27;t complain too much about the shipping time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The gel doesn&#x27;t really apply anything and when I use the fiber wand, it gets fibers all over my face.  </li>
            <li>Also, A LOT of the 3D fiber lash mascaras on here arent real.</li>
            <li>So I can assure you that my product was the real deal and not counterfeit.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product...</li>
            <li>Not the real Younique 3D Mascara.</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t use too much of it.</li>
            <li>So I absolutely don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I was really gentle.</li>
            <li>This one though, really does work.  </li>
            <li>She was absolutely spot on in her recommendation &amp; I definately think the manufacturer should include a separating spoolie in the kit.  </li>
            <li>If u really want this mascara just buy from the site.</li>
            <li>U know it&#x27;ll be 100% real.</li>
            <li>This mascara really does make you lashes seem longer and fuller.</li>
            <li>FAST SHIPPING.</li>
            <li>but i don&#x27;t really care its cheaper then eye lash extensi&amp;oacute;ns</li>
            <li>For the natural lash gals I would recommend just boosting your own mascara a few extra times it will look so very much better.</li>
            <li>&quot; that have miraculously come out of the tube, with much effort, proceed to fall off of my lashes all day and onto my face which causes some severe skin iirritation.</li>
            <li>Resulting look is what I call &amp;#34;spidery&amp;#34;, like 8 clumped up very sticky eyelashes.</li>
            <li>but this product really does work.  </li>
            <li>I consider myself a makeup snob, I spend too much money on makeup</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, quality product.  </li>
            <li>My order was shipped very quickly!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is a very noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>At 1st I was very hesitant about spending $30 on a mascara, but decided to splurge on my self</li>
            <li>It really does make them look much longer.</li>
            <li>No matter how gently I removed the stuff.  </li>
            <li>The fibers went straight on and stuck immediately to my lashes, not even one flaked off immediately or otherwise.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Everytime I&#x27;d wear it, I&#x27;d have &amp;#34;grainy&amp;#34; eyes all day, very irratating.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really like waterproof mascara</li>
            <li>might want to try djv if that&#x27;s what you want but that one gives length and really lacks in volume.</li>
            <li>and I really like how it makes my eye lashes look longer and a bit fuller.</li>
            <li>My mom actually sells Younique products and gave me this one for free.</li>
            <li>It really works well.</li>
            <li>so if you curl your lashes like I do, because they are so straight, over time they will straighten again and not keep their curl.</li>
            <li>Definitely lengthens and thickens my already nice, blonde lashes.</li>
            <li>Love the way they make my natural lashes look, without the damage of putting individual lashes on!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Applied Maybelline clear mascara&lt;br /&gt;Applied the gel all over my top lashes, from the inner to outer</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to get it right, but when you do it looks amazing.  </li>
            <li>My younique representative sent me a new tube of the gel and after the first time I applied it</li>
            <li>Please order through someone that may sell this to ensure you get the 14 day guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;Please if you need help finding the right channels I can direct you there</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried ALOT of other lash extending products,  but this is the best,  hands down!!!  </li>
            <li>Makes then burn much more than other mascaras.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I tried this one first for the last several days.  </li>
            <li>I was extremely excited when i finally recieved this in the mail.</li>
            <li>and I really love it, definitely adds volume like no other mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>Younique Moodstruck 3D Fiber Mascara is the best mascara if you are looking for long and thick eyelashes naturally.  </li>
            <li>You have to be very careful how you put it on like most mascaras it gets clumpy if you don&#x27;t take you time and its a bit stubborn to come off.</li>
            <li>I used to have nice eyelashes before using this product and this is the only new product I&#x27;ve used in the last month.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I couldn’t believe my eyelashes could look so long and full.  </li>
            <li>I actually think it looks better, more natural, for daily use if I apply just one or two coats verses several.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s make-up, not a piece of jewelry, not a fancy designer pen, and certainly after using it, not something worthy of such an ostentatious box.</li>
            <li>I have super long lashes now.... very easy to wash away unlike other brands..</li>
            <li>I guess I had really high expectations, this mascara turns ashy and clumby from the very beginning.  </li>
            <li>Seems too strong for sensitive eyes, and fibers clump and later in day fall off.</li>
            <li>My natural eyelashes are not long in length and are light in color</li>
            <li>Also, you shouldn&#x27;t walk around with a face full of massive monster lashes either.  </li>
            <li>So although I would absolutely recommend this product I really would advise you to go to the website and order direct to ensure the product is real and not expired or damaged.</li>
            <li>so I cleaned them up, added some more gel to seal the fibers back in and wore the mascara a whole extra day.</li>
            <li>The fibers are high in quantity and the gel is nice and slick.</li>
            <li>and if u put too much on it clumps but other than that pretty cool</li>
            <li>The product is okay, but doesn&#x27;t look much different from my regular mascara.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re older, this is not for you.</li>
            <li>Initially does make lashes look super.</li>
            <li>I will now be a steady customer.  </li>
            <li>It definitely gives that bold effect.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE the way it makes my tiny, blonde eye lashes look, but omg, it irritates my eyes.</li>
            <li>I really like how full an long this make my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Cost more but doesn&#x27;t work any better then the lease expensive brandz on here...  </li>
            <li>My lash length are decent but I wanted see if this mascara makes a difference.</li>
            <li>Really gave my lashes volume, however I have sensitive eyes and will only use it for special occasions.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone using falsies.</li>
            <li>price is high.</li>
            <li>I tried to make this work many different ways and many different times, it always looked clumpy and uneven and bumpy.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>it is only available through a representative of Younique, I am impatient and I want to be able to go to Ulta and buy it directly.</li>
            <li>Just be careful when applying not to get into eyes and you will be fine.</li>
            <li>A SMART CONSUMER AS WITH ANY PROFESSIONAL PRODUCT ON HERE.</li>
            <li>My lashes look so full, long and lush!!</li>
            <li>her Eyelashes looked Fake, thats how great this works.</li>
            <li>A couple of my girlfriends that were use to buying expensive mascara are now getting this one because the results are that great.  </li>
            <li>This would be worth $30 if it actually worked the way it should.</li>
            <li>Since getting this I have been wearing it with mascara daily, cause it&#x27;s just so much fun</li>
            <li>Had to experiment a few times before I thought it looked okay.</li>
            <li>While it looks nice if you spend 30 minutes combing the clumps out of your lashes and reapplying multiple times, it&#x27;s not worth the time or money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try using it a few more times</li>
            <li>but I applied mines both ways and got the same results, so you really don&#x27;t have to use mascara first.</li>
            <li>To start off application you put on a layer of any normal mascara, then you apply the transplanting gel, which is what the fibers stick to.  </li>
            <li>It might seem like a lot longer process than normal mascara</li>
            <li>but again this is more for a glam look rather than an everyday look,</li>
            <li>I am a Younique presenter and only became one because I love these lashes so much (as well as the other Younique products).</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m always trying out new products</li>
            <li>These definately live up to all the hype.  </li>
            <li>Factory sealed an in new condition</li>
            <li>Then add it alternating quickly so it doesn&#x27;t dry in between.</li>
            <li>My lashes look exactly the same as if I put on my normal mascara.</li>
            <li>wait for the mascara to dry and comb it OR separate your lashes individually (gently while wet) before applying this product to get a more even look.  </li>
            <li>I am very sensitive and have not had any issues as of yet.</li>
            <li>I also wouldn&#x27;t feel comfortable using this for special events such as weddings or situations that require several hours of wear due to the smudging.</li>
            <li>Yet that in no way made up for the stinging pain in my eyes from the fibers clearly falling into them!</li>
            <li>(when I first used them) and yes, it did make my eye tear up, but no actual irritation occurred.  </li>
            <li>Their fibres are natural but their Transplanting Gel isn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also one that will tell her friends when something is cute and not cute and ladies, this is not cute!ething is cute and not cute and</li>
            <li>you have sensitive eyes - beware!</li>
            <li>My eyes were red and itchy after the first application.</li>
            <li>however this mascara is unlike any other and is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>the fibers all over&lt;br /&gt;Repeated on second eye before I sealed the first eye -</li>
            <li>Looked like I had been swimming by the end of the day when it was hot outside</li>
            <li>followed all of the instructions exactly as Younique recommends and also tried various tips and tricks found online.  </li>
            <li>Upon initial application I was excited that my lashes did look thicker &amp; possibly longer.  </li>
            <li>I try it again the next day, thinking possibly I did not apply enough top coat, and the brush to the \\&quot;fiber\\&quot; tube breaks off into the tube.</li>
            <li>I purchased the mascara first for my daughter, then for myself about a month later.</li>
            <li>The lashes weren&#x27;t as full as I expected</li>
            <li>Removal of the mascara and fibers is easy but does take a little longer just like applying does.</li>
            <li>The gel mascara also smells a little off at some points but nothing too strong.</li>
            <li>I just re-bought it for $10 less and free shipping.</li>
            <li>For a long time, I have done this:  put vaseline on your fingertips and rub them on your upper eyelashes lightly, then brush on an eyeshadow powder over it.  </li>
            <li>The only way you can be assured that your 3D fiberlashs are not fake, is buy ordering directly through a Younique Presenter.</li>
            <li>I switched back to my tried &amp; true regular mascara this morning.  </li>
            <li>Souch better than just plain mascara!</li>
            <li>If you have fine hair lashes this product is definitely not worth your money!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really not much more expensive than a good drug store brand, but the difference in the finish is so worth paying a little more for!</li>
            <li>I usually only apply one coat for work but will use two maybe three coats if I&#x27;m going out and want a more dramatic look With &amp;#34;practice&amp;#34; you will be able to get it on in a very short time..</li>
            <li>Two months later I finally receive the product and I cannot wait to use it to have those stunning long eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Not only were my lashes clumpy (less is more guys)</li>
            <li>I was SO excited to get this and was completely let down from the get go.</li>
            <li>- it seriously makes my eyelashes SUPER long and full and thick - really easy (and fun, I might add) to put on</li>
            <li>it looks just a little better regular drugstore mascara.</li>
            <li>Weeks went by while it sat here, in its cute little case, similar to the one you&#x27;d carry your sunglasses in.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d give it a better try in the morning and spend a little extra time on it.</li>
            <li>You do use this with your mascara, just in case I wasn&#x27;t clear.  </li>
            <li>I was really hesitant to pay nearly 30 for mascara when you could buy 6 tubes of regular mascara for that price....</li>
            <li>The real 3D Moodstruck Mascara has a barcode on the back of the wrapped case.  </li>
            <li>Purchased directly from Younique distributor.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin &amp; allergic to some types of make up.</li>
            <li>If this describes you or if you have sensitive eyes DO NOT use this mascara.</li>
            <li>They are thinner  and a lot shorter as if the product is causing my natural lashes to fall out.</li>
            <li>Not messy for me</li>
            <li>I wonder if it&#x27;s the product or if with repeated action</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>did a comparison photo of Cherry Blooms ALL NATURAL Fibre Lashes and Younique&#x27;s 3D Fibre Lashes.</li>
            <li>You can buy this directly from a dealer for $29.00 and have a satisfaction guarantee.</li>
            <li>Even my husband noticed how long my lashes were after my first time wearing 3D</li>
            <li>This person is ripping people off and not to mention when you purchase from this person you are completely voiding the &amp;#34;Love</li>
            <li>This had become a vital part of my beauty regiment.</li>
            <li>It feels so natural like you are not even wearing mascara.  </li>
            <li>The first time I inserted the WANs with the fibers in the container, the wind curled up and would not early go into the tube.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this stuff.</li>
            <li>I tried to go without it one day and my natural ones do not seem natural anymore.  </li>
            <li>Wow, is all I can say.  </li>
            <li>I am completely turned off from this company since they are not sanitary at all.</li>
            <li>Younique products are made with no harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>but once I put younique on wow...</li>
            <li>feel the set I got was old or something</li>
            <li>So when I kept hearing about this 3D fiber stuff naturally I had to try it.</li>
            <li>but my professional eyelash opinion is that I don&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li>Not natural or pretty at all.  </li>
            <li>They just don&#x27;t look natural and my lashes look like spider legs...</li>
            <li>So 2 days ago I quit them because my eyelashes was almost completely gone.</li>
            <li>Younique products are made from natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t complete when received</li>
            <li>Almost all natural...</li>
            <li>I have nearly invisible eyelashes, so this doesn&#x27;t give the product a lot to work with.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something to enhance my eyelashes, but look fairly natural.</li>
            <li>You pay $30 for this product but you still have to keep a tube of your old mascara on hand as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You know what else is all natural?</li>
            <li>Purchased directly from Younique and got it in 3 days.</li>
            <li>None have compared to this one thus far.</li>
            <li>it appeared that my natural lashes were falling out.</li>
            <li>I had minor irritation the first couple of days.</li>
            <li>I do have slightly sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do not waste your money</li>
            <li>After trying this product only today, my eyes feel like they are ready to BLEED.</li>
            <li>As long as you follow directions and apply directly there should be not problems with this product, I would recommend to absolutely everyone I know!</li>
            <li>I have virtually NO eyelashes and have tried so many different mascaras (wasted money).</li>
            <li>I do apply a second coat of the gel after the fiber has set a few seconds to make sure they stay and not fall into my eyes or on my face.</li>
            <li>Difficult to make it look good.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking to replace these lashes with your fake lashes it might be a good switch.</li>
            <li>Afterwards, you have to apply more of the thick gel.</li>
            <li>So many people doing direct sales &amp; to be honest, I hate it.</li>
            <li>My lashes definitely look neater and better defined with just plain mascara</li>
            <li>if you re-apply with several coats your eyelashes are SUPER LONG.</li>
            <li>Have spent a fortune looking for that right one</li>
            <li>I have long eyelashes anyways, so after experimenting, this stuff looks much better when you add the fibers to the outer corner of top lashes only and leave the center and inner half normal mascara only (A Marilyn Monroe look).  </li>
            <li>I would not feel comfortable using this on clients, especially for print photography work due to the fibers coming off on the surrounding skin.  </li>
            <li>I use it daily and apply extra coats for special events for an extra pop!</li>
            <li>Second, the transplanting gel which is black, smudges easily.</li>
            <li>It worked very well first few days but not as well as time goes by</li>
            <li>no more fake eye lashes this is one of the best things i brought in the line of make up for years</li>
            <li>It takes multiple applications for it to work and there is a fine line between looking \\&quot;3D\\&quot; and a clumpy mess.</li>
            <li>Not the actual product highly dissapointed do not buy</li>
            <li>I mean, I have nice semi long lashes to begin with, but</li>
            <li>exactly what I expected I even purchased some for my mother.</li>
            <li>This definitely made my lashes look fantastic, the major drawback is that it tends to flake off and leaves black marks under my eyes within an hour.</li>
            <li>I mean put on as much gel mascara as you would like on, and then with the fibers only do a couple of light swipes at the root of my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>After tax and shipping it only comes to 38.00 give or take depending on where you live.</li>
            <li>I HAVE SHORT STRAIGHT BABY ASIAN LASHES!</li>
            <li>Get your real 3D Fiber Lashes actually from Younique and an actual Presenter</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get ripped off and buy the actual REAL mascara on a Younique Independent Presenters website.</li>
            <li>Not sure why there are negative reviews honestly!</li>
            <li>However, as the day progresses the tiny fibers ended up on the skin under and around my eyes requiring me to dust off &amp; brush that area clear several times rather than have those little fibers look like fine lines around the eyes --</li>
            <li>You first put a thin coat of your favorite mascara on, then the transplanting gel, then the fiber mascara, while the transplanting gel is still wet.</li>
            <li>Regular mascara first let dry.</li>
            <li>The fibers in Love Alpha are also very hard and bristle-like.</li>
            <li>so excited for this but after giving it weeks of practice is basically just clumps of black dust bunnie looking things that fall off your eyes and you have to keep constantly wiping off your upper cheeks.</li>
            <li>This product had great reviews so I was surprised by my disappointment!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll go back to my old drug store brand.</li>
            <li>You have to try and hold yourself back from going too far with this stuff.  </li>
            <li>If you follow the instructions, the fibers will not fall on your cheeks, and you truly do get thick and fabulous lashes.</li>
            <li>(I use a heated up curler first) and I have thick, long, flashy, beautiful eyelashes with this product.  </li>
            <li>Better then false lashes</li>
            <li>It saves me a lot of money at purchasing false lashes and having to apply them and remove them many times.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than false lashes.</li>
            <li>Normally mascara weighs my lashes down and I lose the curl I have from just curling them normally.  </li>
            <li>Applied my normal Cover Girl mascara, let it dry &amp; applied the Younique gel, the fiber &amp; another coat of gel.</li>
            <li>(I think it was by Benefit, but the fibers were white and not black like this one).</li>
            <li>so I am not so sure if this is original or not :(</li>
            <li>The process does take a couple extra minutes compared to just mascara but faster than putting on fake lashes and they look so much better!  </li>
            <li>This company should spend more money on actually developing a decent product, rather than expensive boxes to clutter up the landfills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It should last me a long time too because I don&#x27;t use much for daily wear, so the cost isn&#x27;t an issue.</li>
            <li>I think it is most dramatic on the bottom lashes.</li>
            <li>Order DIRECT from an independent presenter &amp; get the 14-day money back</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the look of thick goopy lashes, too much is too much.</li>
            <li>which im sure is definnitely not good !</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t send  it back because I figures it would cost as much  to do that it was waste of money as far as I was concerend</li>
            <li>I do have to note that I naturally have long eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Not sure if that&#x27;s normal or maybe it&#x27;s a older product.</li>
            <li>first coat is like a &amp;#34;primer&amp;#34; glue and the black stuff is this weird feather particle stuff for lack of a better description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not sure if I&#x27;m applying it right or not.</li>
            <li>I finally broke down &amp; ordered it, but I didn&#x27;t want to order from a friend, too many of them selling &amp; I didn&#x27;t want to cause any hard feelings.</li>
            <li>I really liked the product results but it doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as I had hoped for as expensive as it was.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this product, it is easier than false lashes, tickers and cheaper than extensions, and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>Also there is a less expensive brand of mascara very similar sold on HSN that does just as good as a job.  </li>
            <li>A little much.</li>
            <li>the mascara just became very clumpy on my eye lashes and left little fuzzes on the tips of my lashes.</li>
            <li>Someone commented about this product being counterfeit, and if so, you might as well just splurge a little and buy the real thing from your local seller.</li>

            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product!</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING!  </li>
            <li> Amazing the difference in my lashes!</li>
            <li> Amazing product!</li>
            <li> Amazing !</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!</li>
            <li> if you need better instructions, it works awesome!!</li>
            <li> I love it works just as it says it would very happy</li>
            <li> and you can get better results from just a good primer and Maybelline!!...</li>
            <li> When I can get it on without too many clumps, it looks great!  </li>
            <li> Honestly, these things work great and Youtube reviewer Grav3yard Girl even gave this a great review.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily, it wears great; no smudging or raccoon eyes!</li>
            <li> Received item very quickly, and I am very happy with product.</li>
            <li> And although it is easy to remove (I use baby oil) - the staying power is excellent.</li>
            <li> Maybelline great lash works better than this!</li>
            <li> and she really loved it,</li>
            <li> I loved that part of it.</li>
            <li> but…&lt;br /&gt;Adding the fibers is a good way to make your lashes look fuller and longer</li>
            <li> /&gt;I loved it.</li>
            <li> Good mascara for anything</li>
            <li> My wife absolutely loved this mascara.  </li>
            <li> Loved the look of the completed eye.</li>
            <li> If it was including a really good mascara it would be a 5 star.</li>
            <li> but while I was putting it on I honestly didn&#x27;t think it looked great.</li>
            <li> A good fiber mascara from Loreal is just as good.  </li>
            <li> would be a good product if it didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> Arrived in good condition.  </li>
            <li> and I was good to go.</li>
            <li> not as good as the one i bought from a Younique distributor.  </li>
            <li> Knock offs are not as good.</li>
            <li> i knew that it would be too good to be true!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> rep contacted me to see how much i &#x27;loved&#x27; the product.</li>
            <li> Had them for a good two weeks while wearing the mascara.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s TRUE!!!  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even apply my own mascara before applying the gel and fibers and it still looks amazing!</li>
            <li> However, I can honestly say I found it amazing!  </li>
            <li> Great and easy to use!</li>
            <li> Most people cnt afford to pay 30.00 for mascara no matter how great it is.  </li>
            <li> Coup De Theatere is a great alternative and moisturizes your lashes more...</li>
            <li> Looks great and much better than \\&quot;spider leg\\&quot; eyes.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this purchase</li>
            <li> At first I loved the mascara and was so impressed, after a week or so of using it</li>
            <li> I was able to keep it on all day and it looked great.  </li>
            <li> ok, if the product had been great, I&#x27;d have given the packaging a pass.</li>
            <li> Can make even the crappiest mascara you own look good.</li>
            <li> I thought I would give this product a go as I see so many people selling and buying this product!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> First off, the mascara is awesome.</li>

            <li> OMG, this product is amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and have amazing lashes.  </li>
            <li> But it is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> I received this product as gift for Christmas and it is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Amazing difference in lashes.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing .</li>
            <li> My lashes look amazing.</li>
            <li> The opportunity to share these amazing products should be considered as well.</li>
            <li> it says to apply with your own mascara.</li>
            <li> I must say  though that it works wonderfully, and makes her eyelashes look much thicker.</li>
            <li> and I reeeaaally liked it.</li>
            <li> Kind of clumps.</li>
            <li> I have used the real product and it&#x27;s awesome and did not come in a package mailed from China.</li>
            <li> That may be why I&#x27;m loving it.  </li>
            <li> Gives full beautiful lashes.</li>
            <li> I really liked it and it works</li>
            <li> The directions says to use your own mascara</li>
            <li> Honestly?  </li>
            <li> Save yourself some time and cash by layering your own mascara.</li>
            <li> had tried some a friend had and liked it</li>
            <li> The fibers are great, better than most</li>
            <li> (although I do use a good brand - Lancôme Definicils), but for thicker lashes with more volume, this mascara does the trick.  </li>
            <li> It makes your own lashes come off.</li>
            <li> Tried this from a friend and ordered my own.</li>
            <li> Really a nice surprise.</li>
            <li> Otherwise all was nice  </li>
            <li> And I liked the result.</li>
            <li> and I really liked it.</li>
            <li> kind of look</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear a ton of make-up but, when I do bother to put it on, I want it to look nice.  </li>
            <li> Love love love this product!!  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love this!!</li>
            <li> Package states best results after applying normal mascara.</li>
            <li> Package was great and quick delivery.  </li>
            <li> Comes off very easily with makeup remover products.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> it is very easy to remove.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara is Lash Love from Mary Kay!</li>
            <li> I love it, its amazing the results</li>
            <li> I was able to keep the nice curl along with darkening and thickening my lashes.  </li>
            <li> This a great product especially if you have a wedding or something important that you want to look your best at!</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing mascara I have ever used</li>
            <li> I must say this is the best product by far.</li>

            <li> Arrived very quickly and just as described!</li>
            <li> Stick to hydrating your lashes with a healthy oil (coconut, jojoba)  or eat healthy and you will have healthy lashes!</li>
            <li> love, love, love this!</li>
            <li> Love love love this mascara!  </li>
            <li> and it just wasn&#x27;t as good as my original.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and tried it expecting great results, but there were several disappointments that I experienced with this product.</li>
            <li> I love this best mascara I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as easy as applying normal mascara, though it does take a couple of go rounds to perfect the technique.</li>
            <li> messed up at first and got an eyeful of fibers, lol, but that was user error.</li>
            <li> Love love love love love!</li>
            <li> Great product, really makes a difference and doesn&#x27;t fall on your cheeks!</li>
            <li> Good mascara, dries out quick</li>
            <li> If you have fine skimpy lashes, the transformation is amazing.</li>
            <li> well after 1 coat my eyelashes was huge!</li>
            <li> I tried applying it with and without my mascara as well as applying a bit more gel to seal it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, but it really it is way over priced.  </li>
            <li> Please folks, why are you paying MORE for these lashes than getting them from a Younique presenter?  </li>
            <li> To get the authentic 3D Mascara, order from a presenter like myself.  </li>
            <li> Love this mascara.</li>
            <li> As a makeup artist I do not think they make your lashes look flawless at all if you have short lashes trying to build the length.</li>
            <li> do the job better.</li>
            <li> Top are now shorter than bottom lashes.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> I love the mascara</li>
            <li> It makes your eyes &amp; eyelashes look fabulous!</li>
            <li> Love it&lt;br /&gt;BUT</li>
            <li> The product is ok, but just ok.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually really simple to apply too, the brush for the gel is great!</li>
            <li> So glad I&#x27;d just tried it in the day rather than for an event or night</li>
            <li> This is ok.</li>
            <li> Buying from a rep insures authenticity and the 14 day love</li>
            <li> You either love it...or you don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I got this product</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> but the initial lok is beautiful !</li>
            <li> Love it and will be buying more.</li>
            <li> Waited many years for this.</li>
            <li> absolutely love them.</li>
            <li> I have had issues with clumping on a couple applications but have been able to use a eyelash brush to comb out and have not had any of the fibers fall off.</li>
            <li> I have better results with CHERRY BLOOMS than I did with Younique.</li>
            <li> Ladies, you won&#x27;t find a better product</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.</li>
            <li> so I know it&#x27;s authentic.  </li>
            <li> and I really love the results.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I think they will be pleased.</li>
            <li> I love the product because I don&#x27;t have to wear extensions anymore.</li>
            <li> #34;Younique mascara&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Younique fiber lashes&amp;#34; That said, you can buy the product from a presenter or from YouniqueProducts.com for $29 (and get a Love It Guarantee),</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe I found this, I paid double for iit elsewhere, a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering two more</li>
            <li> It will come with their Love</li>

            <li> I have had many compliments on the length of my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Watch out for counterfeiters and make sure you are buying from a reputable seller.  </li>

            <li> I will be contacting a Younique Rep in my area as I do LOVE this product</li>
            <li> Looks better than most mascaras--but the gel has an ingredient in it that I read is know to burn and itch,</li>
            <li> I love makeup</li>
            <li> I love this product...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the off brand mascara, Love Alpha.</li>
            <li> it fibers more gel....</li>
            <li> Extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li> :)  This person is selling this product illegitimately, and may or may not be counterfeit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The money will be going to women/children who are sexually abused.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara..</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I am sure she will help you answer any questions you may have.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> but I was thinking ok, just buy them</li>
            <li> So I kept applying more coats and it didn&#x27;t do a thing.</li>
            <li> Having used the authentic Younique brand and the knockoff for comparison, there is literally no difference.</li>
            <li> I love it and it doesn&#x27;t clump my eyelashes together at all</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely better than any of the drug store brands.</li>
            <li> it was ok.  </li>
            <li> so you have to be sure to wipe them away.  </li>
            <li> Love this fiber mascara.  </li>
            <li> Love this mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had drugstore brands that worked better than this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to get her more for her Bday.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Maybe, they need to apply it better.  </li>
            <li> I love this thing... after putting 3coats on each eye</li>
            <li> Ok I know it shows my husbands name on this as the reviewer</li>
            <li> I love the results and have never had an issue with it.  </li>
            <li> ok, they look huge!&amp;#34; Then, at the end of the day, the mascara has went under my eyes and my eyes looked horrible.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Very much enjoyed the ease of buying this product, and my daughter loves to use it, probably will buy more.</li>
            <li> it is not an authentic Younique Mascara.  </li>
            <li> I was still going to work with it and try to use it on my top lashes (</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had many satisfied customers...</li>
            <li> also you get a 14 day love it guarantee by purchasing off a presenter like me or someone you know...</li>
            <li> LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it</li>
            <li> I was okay even though I crashed at a night after the club</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Ok product, clumps up.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of the product and</li>
            <li> I did get a video up on my tablet (via youtube) before I applied, so that I could make sure it was done correctly.  </li>
            <li> this was helpful.&lt;br /&gt;:-)</li>
            <li> Such a beautiful result!</li>
            <li> Damaged my lashes for sure :</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and consider myself to be an intelligent, sensible, reasonable person.</li>
            <li> While it is OK, it does not work for ME like the picture.</li>
            <li> Ideally like the natural look</li>
            <li> Great idea, however,  much TOO CLUMPY.</li>
            <li> The mascara is just ok, it took over 3 weeks to arrive.</li>
            <li> and I feel it is a much better product.</li>
            <li> , I would like to try that.&amp;#34;  I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li> LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.</li>
            <li> but when I do it&#x27;s very easy to apply, no smudgind and comes off easily.  </li>
            <li> The lashes through younique are AMAZING and can be ordered through one of their beautiful presenters and will only cost you 29.00 plus tax, shipping and handling.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, amazing product!</li>
            <li> The results are real and the effects are amazing!</li>
            <li> My eye lashes have never looked better and the best part is they look real and soooo much longer than using mascara.  </li>
            <li> I bought this from a Younique rep and absolutely loved it the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good.</li>
            <li> If your are looking for an incredible mascara you have found it, just make sure you get it from an actual presenter</li>
            <li> This is honestly the ONLY mascara that has made me happy with the outcome.</li>
            <li> Makes your lashes very full.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really a makeup person, but I sometimes wear mascara and this just adds a lot of length that could never or hasn&#x27;t been achieved with even the best of mascaras.  </li>
            <li> If you spend $100 or more, you will also get FREE expedited shipping.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes, its great for contact lens wearers</li>
            <li> when you first get it though it&#x27;s nice and many compliments</li>
            <li> By the end of a 8 - 9 hour day the mascara is also smudging more than I am comfortable with.  </li>
            <li> My eyelashes have been abused many years, with cheap mascara.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much, now I am a sales rep.</li>
            <li> Took too much time to apply for results, might as well get good mascara or eyelash extensions.</li>
            <li> A friend tried this product and loved it so much she started selling it.</li>
            <li> My friend told me a trick to getting the fibers to adhere the best- open the tubes so you can quickly apply the gel and then the fibers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It even stayed on after a full 8 hour work day and a 2 hour workout after that!</li>
            <li> Used it today for the first time and have gotten so many compliments on my lashes!</li>
            <li> It comes off super easy with just water!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time i wore it, I fell in love!  </li>
            <li> the fibers can easily get in your eyes</li>
            <li> Younique makeup is Chemical free, Carcinogin Free, Paraben Free, Cruelty Free, Gluten Free, Hypoallergenic, Organic and just all around amazing</li>
            <li> and it removes easily with pads, some use face wash/soap/water.  </li>
            <li> and now it&#x27;s easy for me to apply.</li>
            <li> Two easy steps and POW.....</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and easy to remove.  </li>
            <li> Easy to remove.</li>
            <li> Younique comes off easy and doesn’t leave you looking like a raccoon after.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and it lasts all day and then some.</li>
            <li> With practice and a steady hand, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> The product is super easy to wash off - Sometimes I won&#x27;t have to use makeup remover after getting out of the shower and surprisingly stays on pretty well - slept with it on and still noticeably had curled eyelashes with no smudges.</li>
            <li> This mascara is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of mascaras and with this one I had instant beautiful results.</li>
            <li> And you gotta even apply your own Mascara first ??  </li>
            <li> The mascara may be nice...never tried it due to the fact that the one to try here at the fair is one that everyone here at this fair has tried.</li>
            <li> the product itself is pretty nice</li>
            <li> I would only purchase from the Younique site or from a Beautiful Younique Presenter for $29.00 US</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been just fine.</li>
            <li> The initial effect of the mascara is brilliant, full of length and body.</li>
            <li> Loved at when I first got the product although found I kept getting fibres in my eyes which would annoy and irritate my eyes to the point it just wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> Just the tansplanting gel is fine.</li>
            <li> She, too, tested the theory and the days that she didn&#x27;t wear it, her head was fine.</li>
            <li> Omg it make my eyes look super cute .</li>
            <li> the most beautiful lashes I&#x27;ve been capable of achieving thus far</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is a good product and would encourage you to not waste your money on this!</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to but this stuff is great!</li>
            <li> Very fast postage!!  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a huge difference</li>
            <li> For that I&#x27;ll just buy cheap mascara.  </li>
            <li> so yes i am happy with with the overall experience.</li>
            <li> Just look at all the cheap knockoffs of designer handbags.  </li>
            <li> Really extends lashes nicely.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and works really well if applied correctly.</li>
            <li> Use light touches.</li>
            <li> After asking a handful of my friends if they experienced the same issue in which they responded yes to, I will no longer use this product.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> The shipping was free</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product and am not too happy with it.</li>
            <li> Fabulous, it is as it describes.</li>
            <li> This mascara system is fantastic.</li>
            <li> The tips of my lashes would not get smooth, they looked like they had lots of split ends.</li>
            <li> Fabulous.  </li>
            <li> Have not tried this and the reviews don&#x27;t sound like I want to.  </li>
            <li> (to sort of smooth them</li>
            <li> the effect on my bottom lashes was totally bizarre) until the irritation started.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;If be happy to help any of you women with your lash needs properly www.misssassylashes.com</li>
            <li> I enjoy doing my makeup now</li>
            <li> wording was misspelled and the makeup was cheap quality.</li>
            <li> Just ok, seem to get the same results with a good mascara.</li>
            <li> But this is the REAL DEAL!!!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says love this xxxoooo</li>
            <li> Truly worth the money!</li>
            <li> and I was originally excited to try this product out for myself since I use Too Faced brand</li>
            <li> first theres tooo many  .  </li>
            <li> so I was excited.</li>
            <li> Sure, it makes your lashes longer but the tips look funny.</li>
            <li> Since the first application I felt in love with this mascara...</li>
            <li> Worth the money!</li>
            <li> im pretty pleased</li>
            <li> It does say to put on top of mascara first</li>
            <li> I love this product when I first get it</li>
            <li> I was excited when I got it.</li>
            <li> Was so excited, I tried it as soon as it arrived.</li>
            <li> Application is straightforward.</li>
            <li> , I was excited that this would work.  </li>
            <li> First, the product requires you to use your own mascara and apply it first, not included in the $39 price.</li>
            <li> and I notice throughout the day of wearing it I&#x27;m having to clean under my eyes.</li>
            <li> And the cool part is the directions dont say &amp;#34;use fiber with youniques mascara&amp;#34; (like most companies that only recommend their own stuff)...</li>
            <li> and I received  right on time very quickly.</li>
            <li> I placed the fiber coat on right after the transplanting gel, followed by the transplanting gel... fiber in my eyes!</li>
            <li> I got these and the first 2 times I used it, it worked great however every time I tried to apply it after those 2 times by gel wand became clumpy and the fibers only stuck to the gel wand and not my eye lashes.</li>
            <li> Lol just be careful it gets in it</li>
            <li> they make my lashes look so full.</li>
            <li> I should have known better, even the photos the gals looked like they had too much mascara on.</li>
            <li> fast shipping too will purchase again :)</li>
            <li> I could tell a difference in this and the generic brand, looks wise and the way they affected my eyes.</li>
            <li> And when you spend money on Youniques foundation (which is coming out in 2015) on an actual presenter page you will be helping for a good cause.  </li>
            <li> I love it, it really makes your eyelashes look longer and fuller.</li>
            <li> These lashes are good IF you have the time to properly apply them and separate them.</li>
            <li> Most days, it is very clumpy.  </li>
            <li> 100% True.</li>
            <li> I love it so much that I became a distributor.</li>
            <li> the brush is just one lump, kind of like it is old maybe.</li>
            <li> The lab results showed the product was full of toxins.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did because this product really works.</li>
            <li> i also tried doing my lashes twice with my regular mascara and it turned out really good.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product but would not re-purchase.</li>
            <li> Remember that if it&#x27;s too good to be true, it actually is.</li>
            <li> (I tried the Love Alpha, and the gel dries so fast, that even when quickly applying the fibers, they do not stick well to your lashes.</li>
            <li> Clumpy, lashes sticking together, leaky gel, and having to go thru a Rep and waiting for your product to come in verses going to Ulta and having my purchase right away, not buying 3d again...offered it free to my niece, my daughter, &amp; a neighbor and nobody</li>
            <li> I mainly wear mascara on top lashes.</li>
            <li> After many friends trying to push it at me, I decided to give it a try, against my better judgement more or less.  </li>
            <li> Following the directions exactly, it works amazingly!</li>
            <li> best thing that my sis showed me.. better than wearing false eyelashes!  </li>
            <li> but the mascara/glue dries out too quickly...</li>
            <li> sometimes it&#x27;s a lucky shot to get something at a lower price, but not in this case.</li>
            <li> The idea of the product is brilliant and effective but the wear of the product is flawed.</li>
            <li> I received my order quickly and it worked well.</li>
            <li> Love it, but you are selling this too high....</li>
            <li> Love love love this 3D Fiber lash mascara,  as long as its real.</li>
            <li> For special occasions it&#x27;s totally worth it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> This product is so fantastic and is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty darn good but not worth the price on top of a mascara.</li>
            <li> The transplanting gel was nice and thin and did not clump in the slightest - considering it was on top of a layer of my own Avon mascara.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> If anyone has any questions or wants to discuss Younique and the quality of the products that TRUE presenters stand by, please feel free to reach out to me.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and really make your lashes pop according to my wife.</li>
            <li> with my fair skin, even though I have dark brown hair, my lashes are quite light</li>
            <li> younique  Moodstruck is easy to apply and does really enhance the fullness of your eyelashes.</li>
            <li> This product can easily look too much.</li>
            <li> Shipping was so fast - so thank you!!  </li>
            <li> Several of my friends bought it too and all love it as well!</li>
            <li> I would recommend these to anyone that wants fuller lashes!!</li>
            <li> I knew as soon as I used this mascara the first time, all ladies would want it!  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Really like this mascara!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard about the mascara and was interested in it and when she offered this a a form of payment to me, I thought what the heck!</li>
            <li> I will absolutely spend the $29!!</li>
            <li> It really did what it said it would do!!</li>
            <li> I bought it from a younique distributor so it is absolutely not fake!  </li>
            <li> , it was great lasted almost 6 months, this stuff now is one clumpy mess,  </li>
            <li> And I realize BLACK mascara is the most prevalent kind, and I prefer brown.</li>
            <li> but it actually goes on really quick and the results are astounding.  </li>
            <li> they look cool if you are very gentle with putting them on.</li>
            <li> Wonderful I Abe been using it everyday!!!</li>
            <li> Cannot believe how great it is for one who has so few lashes.</li>
            <li> I bought for my wife and she absolutely loves this.&lt;br /&gt;Coming from a woman in the beauty business this is a huge compliment.</li>
            <li> only it makes my lashes amazing.</li>
            <li> this is an amazing product order from someone who actually sells and knows about our products</li>
            <li> The product is great - it took a few weeks to be delivered though and didn&#x27;t come with any instructions.</li>
            <li> Def worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Even though the mascara it comes with is pretty cool by itself.</li>
            <li> The problem is I&#x27;ve noticed that my natural lashes are much more scarce.</li>
            <li> This is truly worth every penny.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t worth 35$ .</li>
            <li> However, after getting the product, I don&#x27;t think it was worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I would stick with the drugstore brand to create more natural looking lashes.</li>
            <li> What I got was the same result as two coats of regular mascara, and incredibly itchy eyes from the fibers.</li>
            <li> You are better off using latisse, or the generic stuff, strip lashes or even the lash extensions, which maintenance wise is only about $40 every 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I spent a good chunk of money growing them with LiLash and after wearing this maybe three times I noticed my lashes were severely damaged.</li>
            <li> Takes time to get used to but worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I am not trying to call out the seller, but I have been doing professional makeup for several years now</li>
            <li> Is it worth $29?</li>
            <li> Worth it.  </li>
            <li> The results arent worth &amp;#34;falking&amp;#34; lashes.</li>
            <li> honestly didn&#x27;t think a mascara could possibly make my lashes so noticeably longer &amp; fuller.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it -</li>
            <li> So worth the money</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> While I liked the way it made my  lashes look, I noticed that the fibers dropped onto my face constantly and in my eyes as soon as I put it on.</li>
            <li> I via my lashes once for a more natural with a splash of drama</li>
            <li> I like more natural looking</li>
            <li> It took only two tries for me to get it right, but the end results are beautiful!!!</li>
            <li> Since I have been happy with fibers I wanted to find something even more dramatic; I found younique</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found other mascara products.without fibers in them that works just as good and do not irritate your eyes.</li>
            <li> Was a great buy, got here fast and exactly what I had expected.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are TOO long if I use more than 1 coat!</li>
            <li> Fibers dont stick right and</li>
            <li> Also as the day goes on the fibers get on to your skin right underneath your eye making it look like you have raccoon eyes.  </li>
            <li> so it takes me a while to get it right.</li>
            <li> i had to practice 2 times before getting it right</li>
            <li> And they all place an order right then at [...]  </li>
            <li> Below, on the right, is just my CG Bombshell.</li>
            <li> and it comes right off.</li>
            <li> but they brush right off and don’t leave any marks.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t apply the gel right then the fibers will get in your eyes and on your cheeks.  </li>
            <li> but it definitely needs to be authentic or you&#x27;ll be wearing full falsies.</li>
            <li> As I use it more, I do a better job and it looks less spidery and clumpy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good product , but it&#x27;s to expensive , you can get around 10$ ,,,,,))) and same quality , go to - aliexpress.com , good luck , on this site , they overcharging ))))</li>
            <li> Yes your lashes look great but no better than any lash thickening and lengthening mascara.  </li>
            <li> looked fabulous, then I came home and used eye makeup remover and my normal face wash</li>
            <li> It does give your lashes a great extension but, honestly, there are a lot of good mascara&#x27;s out there that do the same thing ...without flaking fibers in your tear ducts :(</li>
            <li> This a great product, sold for only 29.00 on Younique (or any independent sellers&#x27;) webpage.</li>
            <li> If you love long full lashes this is a must buy</li>
            <li> the fibers would be in my eyes, the mascara wand was kind of dry</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast as well.</li>
            <li> Just because it is natural does not mean it is safe or that you won&#x27;t react to it.</li>
            <li> Great product but be careful using as the fibers can get in your eyes if you are not careful.  </li>
            <li> There are many product with the same ingredients for 1/2 the price.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only way to get it!&lt;br /&gt;Order the authentic fiber lashes at www.youniqueproducts.com/NancyRusso&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product really does as advertised!</li>
            <li> I put my contacts in first and do it</li>
            <li> Used this for the first time today.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> and I wanted it;).</li>
            <li> Only sites with youniqueproducts.com in the name are authentic.</li>
            <li> so it is not a fake, damaged or expired.</li>
            <li> although it seems to be better from actual company.</li>
            <li> the mascara I received from actual company was much better quality.</li>
            <li> After first eye application the applicator broke inside tube.</li>
            <li> Be aware that these are not waterproof and can smear from sweat  or moisture.</li>
            <li> I put it on exactly like</li>
            <li> This really works wonders!</li>
            <li> Find a presenter instead of buying here because then you get the terrific return policy and the Love</li>
            <li> Better then Flash Lashes which uses the white fibers....</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Makes my eyelashes much longer!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not even funny.  </li>
            <li> Please be aware of this in your presenter agreement.  </li>
            <li> I am absolutely amazed at the results!</li>
            <li> The shipping waa extremely fast and it came in a protective package!</li>
            <li> I love it and it makes a big difference in length of lashes</li>
            <li> When you walk into a room or take a photo, the first thing seen shouldn&#x27;t be lashes up to your forehead.  </li>
            <li> Thank you to them for being a stand up company ;)</li>
            <li> Product is exactly what it claims it is and does</li>
            <li> you are interested, or want to verify this information</li>
            <li> It most definitely does not look like falsies.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Make sure youre doing the steps correctly and actually buying the correct mascara.</li>
            <li> It literally doesn&#x27;t matter if they are the authentic Younique brand or the knock off version, they all come from a factory in China and the ingredients are the same.</li>
            <li> I suspect most of the 5 star reviews come from the presenters themselves and not actual customers buying the product.</li>
            <li> And I broke out around my eyes after the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li> These are most likely not what they state</li>
            <li> This is for real!</li>
            <li> Also, the fibers will fall off at first</li>
            <li> I have definitely come to love this mascara.</li>
            <li> I just tried this for the first time...</li>
            <li> The fibers kept falling off on top of my cheeks and made me look like I just got back from coal mining.</li>
            <li> I am a makeup artist but this was my first experience with fiber lashes.</li>
            <li> and she said that many people don&#x27;t apply the second coat of gel after applying fibers and if i do i need to apply more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First it took forever to receive.</li>
            <li> There is a YouTube video with a lady doing a demonstration on her eyes and you have to see the results, and she does it without the masacara being applied first.</li>
            <li> Tried the system on, at first, it was, &amp;#34;Wow..</li>
            <li> So, I curled them, first.</li>
            <li> The first application of the gel, I noticed,</li>
            <li> Adding more onto the already gross looking lashes...dislike this product!</li>
            <li> The product if great just doesn&#x27;t last as long as you would think.</li>
            <li> final note: Younique presenters love to push that this is &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I love the way my very blonde lashes look with this</li>
            <li> The recommendations to do one eye at a time helps, that&#x27;s what I did the first time</li>
            <li> would most definitely recommend this product to anyone &amp; I do!</li>
            <li> The mascara smells funny and the fibers are always falling off and it looks like dirt on your face.  </li>
            <li> I am smiling with my eyes thanks to #Younique 3d mascara!  </li>
            <li> First time I bought it at the beauty show in Vegas</li>
            <li> This is the second time I purchased this product I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> One word,  WOW!!!!  </li>
            <li> For the amount of money that this costs, I will continue go to Sephora or Ulta and buy a much better mascara that I know works and won&#x27;t cause irritation or make a huge mess.</li>
            <li> just isn&#x27;t ever enough for an evening or special occasion look, I finally found djv fiberwig mascara which is another kind of fiber mascara</li>
            <li> Younique offers the ORIGINAL 3D fiberlash mascara.</li>
            <li> and it does not even work the same as an original Younique!</li>
            <li> and at night I washed it off with warm water and baby shampoo where its gentle and wouldn&#x27;t be rough on my eyes.</li>
            <li> Make sure you get the real thing from the actual company.  </li>
            <li> but they fill out my lashes so much i never need more than 2 coats on and will definitely get this product again.</li>
            <li> not a difference really from regular mascara, just more things to do..</li>
            <li> I ave not used it since and have returned to good ole fashioned Loreal Voluminous until I have the same length back.</li>
            <li> I have heard many say the Younique 3D Fiber Mascara that is sold on Amazon is a knock off, so beware..to get the real deal like I did and to only pay $29</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, you still have to own your old regular mascara, because the instructions say to put on 1 coat of that before the Younique product.  </li>
            <li> I have short, sparse, fine lashes and have tried so many different mascaras.</li>
            <li> Really easy and saved loads of money by not buying false eyelashes, very pleased</li>
            <li> Made my eyelashes really love long</li>
            <li> I bought the real mascara from a seller, and at first my lashes looked fuller... for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Fast fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I just wanted to be honest, but its NOT worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love Amazon, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this here, as many have said it&#x27;s not a good idea.</li>
            <li> Washes off easily with dial soap, unlike regular mascaras.</li>
            <li> It is easily removed with my regular eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply, the only thing I didn&#x27;t care for was</li>
            <li> The only dislike is that the fibers I find on my cheeks but that being said still so worth the money an how full my lashes are.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pure nastiness of gunk around your eyes</li>
            <li> Now my lashes look full and super long!</li>
            <li> that is the only way to ensure that you are getting the TRUE product and an HONEST person on the other end of the transaction.  </li>
            <li> I thought this would be a great product, until the little fibers from the fiber wand starting flaking into my eyes.</li>
            <li> Do I want to buy an item that is not guaranteed by the manufacturer because it is not being sold ethically?</li>
            <li> My eyes bothered me the whole night.</li>
            <li> This really irritated my eyes.</li>
            <li> THEN YOU ARE NOT ASSURED YOU ARE GETTING THE REAL THING!&lt;br /&gt;BE</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t cost this much, and you may and probably are getting fakes.  </li>
            <li> I intensely DISLIKE this mascara.  </li>
            <li> And you know you are getting the real deal!&lt;br /&gt;Https://www.youniqueproducts.com</li>
            <li> Really irritates my eyes.</li>
            <li> Irritated my eyes so much</li>
            <li> you really have to follow the directions otherwise</li>
            <li> I like it very well.</li>
            <li> I really wish I can give this a zero star rating.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not the real Younique product.</li>
            <li> can understand why some might not like it, but it&#x27;s honestly a really neat product</li>
            <li> Really works, but I suck at applying it</li>
            <li> The fibers last all day and look fantastic.</li>
            <li> Once again, I was very hesitant.</li>
            <li> This coming from a gal who absolutely hates mascara and tried everything from drug store mascaras to Dior mascaras.</li>
            <li> package arrived really</li>
            <li> I have been fighting straight, straggly eyelashes my whole life and this is the 1st product that ever lived up to it&#x27;s promises.  </li>
            <li> Besides, permanent lashes removes your real lashes after time.</li>
            <li> This is the real product.</li>
            <li> Within 5 minutes my eyelids started burning andfeeling very itchy..</li>
            <li> thanks for making it</li>
            <li> Too much fall out on your face</li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t like how it looks.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It did take me about 3 times before I really got the hang of it</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really noticed any benefit, it can  be very flakey.</li>
            <li> so I really can&#x27;t complain too much about the shipping time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The gel doesn&#x27;t really apply anything and when I use the fiber wand, it gets fibers all over my face.  </li>
            <li> Also, A LOT of the 3D fiber lash mascaras on here arent real.</li>
            <li> So I can assure you that my product was the real deal and not counterfeit.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product...</li>
            <li> Not the real Younique 3D Mascara.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t use too much of it.</li>
            <li> So I absolutely don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was really gentle.</li>
            <li> This one though, really does work.  </li>
            <li> She was absolutely spot on in her recommendation &amp; I definately think the manufacturer should include a separating spoolie in the kit.  </li>
            <li> If u really want this mascara just buy from the site.</li>
            <li> U know it&#x27;ll be 100% real.</li>
            <li> This mascara really does make you lashes seem longer and fuller.</li>
            <li> FAST SHIPPING.</li>
            <li> but i don&#x27;t really care its cheaper then eye lash extensi&amp;oacute;ns</li>
            <li> For the natural lash gals I would recommend just boosting your own mascara a few extra times it will look so very much better.</li>
            <li> &quot; that have miraculously come out of the tube, with much effort, proceed to fall off of my lashes all day and onto my face which causes some severe skin iirritation.</li>
            <li> Resulting look is what I call &amp;#34;spidery&amp;#34;, like 8 clumped up very sticky eyelashes.</li>
            <li> but this product really does work.  </li>
            <li> I consider myself a makeup snob, I spend too much money on makeup</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, quality product.  </li>
            <li> My order was shipped very quickly!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is a very noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> At 1st I was very hesitant about spending $30 on a mascara, but decided to splurge on my self</li>
            <li> It really does make them look much longer.</li>
            <li> No matter how gently I removed the stuff.  </li>
            <li> The fibers went straight on and stuck immediately to my lashes, not even one flaked off immediately or otherwise.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everytime I&#x27;d wear it, I&#x27;d have &amp;#34;grainy&amp;#34; eyes all day, very irratating.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really like waterproof mascara</li>
            <li> might want to try djv if that&#x27;s what you want but that one gives length and really lacks in volume.</li>
            <li> and I really like how it makes my eye lashes look longer and a bit fuller.</li>
            <li> My mom actually sells Younique products and gave me this one for free.</li>
            <li> It really works well.</li>
            <li> so if you curl your lashes like I do, because they are so straight, over time they will straighten again and not keep their curl.</li>
            <li> Definitely lengthens and thickens my already nice, blonde lashes.</li>
            <li> Love the way they make my natural lashes look, without the damage of putting individual lashes on!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Applied Maybelline clear mascara&lt;br /&gt;Applied the gel all over my top lashes, from the inner to outer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get it right, but when you do it looks amazing.  </li>
            <li> My younique representative sent me a new tube of the gel and after the first time I applied it</li>
            <li> Please order through someone that may sell this to ensure you get the 14 day guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;Please if you need help finding the right channels I can direct you there</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried ALOT of other lash extending products,  but this is the best,  hands down!!!  </li>
            <li> Makes then burn much more than other mascaras.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that I tried this one first for the last several days.  </li>
            <li> I was extremely excited when i finally recieved this in the mail.</li>
            <li> and I really love it, definitely adds volume like no other mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> Younique Moodstruck 3D Fiber Mascara is the best mascara if you are looking for long and thick eyelashes naturally.  </li>
            <li> You have to be very careful how you put it on like most mascaras it gets clumpy if you don&#x27;t take you time and its a bit stubborn to come off.</li>
            <li> I used to have nice eyelashes before using this product and this is the only new product I&#x27;ve used in the last month.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I couldn’t believe my eyelashes could look so long and full.  </li>
            <li> I actually think it looks better, more natural, for daily use if I apply just one or two coats verses several.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s make-up, not a piece of jewelry, not a fancy designer pen, and certainly after using it, not something worthy of such an ostentatious box.</li>
            <li> I have super long lashes now.... very easy to wash away unlike other brands..</li>
            <li> I guess I had really high expectations, this mascara turns ashy and clumby from the very beginning.  </li>
            <li> Seems too strong for sensitive eyes, and fibers clump and later in day fall off.</li>
            <li> My natural eyelashes are not long in length and are light in color</li>
            <li> Also, you shouldn&#x27;t walk around with a face full of massive monster lashes either.  </li>
            <li> So although I would absolutely recommend this product I really would advise you to go to the website and order direct to ensure the product is real and not expired or damaged.</li>
            <li> so I cleaned them up, added some more gel to seal the fibers back in and wore the mascara a whole extra day.</li>
            <li> The fibers are high in quantity and the gel is nice and slick.</li>
            <li> and if u put too much on it clumps but other than that pretty cool</li>
            <li> The product is okay, but doesn&#x27;t look much different from my regular mascara.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re older, this is not for you.</li>
            <li> Initially does make lashes look super.</li>
            <li> I will now be a steady customer.  </li>
            <li> It definitely gives that bold effect.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the way it makes my tiny, blonde eye lashes look, but omg, it irritates my eyes.</li>
            <li> I really like how full an long this make my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Cost more but doesn&#x27;t work any better then the lease expensive brandz on here...  </li>
            <li> My lash length are decent but I wanted see if this mascara makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Really gave my lashes volume, however I have sensitive eyes and will only use it for special occasions.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone using falsies.</li>
            <li> price is high.</li>
            <li> I tried to make this work many different ways and many different times, it always looked clumpy and uneven and bumpy.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> it is only available through a representative of Younique, I am impatient and I want to be able to go to Ulta and buy it directly.</li>
            <li> Just be careful when applying not to get into eyes and you will be fine.</li>
            <li> A SMART CONSUMER AS WITH ANY PROFESSIONAL PRODUCT ON HERE.</li>
            <li> My lashes look so full, long and lush!!</li>
            <li> her Eyelashes looked Fake, thats how great this works.</li>
            <li> A couple of my girlfriends that were use to buying expensive mascara are now getting this one because the results are that great.  </li>
            <li> This would be worth $30 if it actually worked the way it should.</li>
            <li> Since getting this I have been wearing it with mascara daily, cause it&#x27;s just so much fun</li>
            <li> Had to experiment a few times before I thought it looked okay.</li>
            <li> While it looks nice if you spend 30 minutes combing the clumps out of your lashes and reapplying multiple times, it&#x27;s not worth the time or money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try using it a few more times</li>
            <li> but I applied mines both ways and got the same results, so you really don&#x27;t have to use mascara first.</li>
            <li> To start off application you put on a layer of any normal mascara, then you apply the transplanting gel, which is what the fibers stick to.  </li>
            <li> It might seem like a lot longer process than normal mascara</li>
            <li> but again this is more for a glam look rather than an everyday look,</li>
            <li> I am a Younique presenter and only became one because I love these lashes so much (as well as the other Younique products).</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m always trying out new products</li>
            <li> These definately live up to all the hype.  </li>
            <li> Factory sealed an in new condition</li>
            <li> Then add it alternating quickly so it doesn&#x27;t dry in between.</li>
            <li> My lashes look exactly the same as if I put on my normal mascara.</li>
            <li> wait for the mascara to dry and comb it OR separate your lashes individually (gently while wet) before applying this product to get a more even look.  </li>
            <li> I am very sensitive and have not had any issues as of yet.</li>
            <li> I also wouldn&#x27;t feel comfortable using this for special events such as weddings or situations that require several hours of wear due to the smudging.</li>
            <li> Yet that in no way made up for the stinging pain in my eyes from the fibers clearly falling into them!</li>
            <li> (when I first used them) and yes, it did make my eye tear up, but no actual irritation occurred.  </li>
            <li> Their fibres are natural but their Transplanting Gel isn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also one that will tell her friends when something is cute and not cute and ladies, this is not cute!ething is cute and not cute and</li>
            <li> you have sensitive eyes - beware!</li>
            <li> My eyes were red and itchy after the first application.</li>
            <li> however this mascara is unlike any other and is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> the fibers all over&lt;br /&gt;Repeated on second eye before I sealed the first eye -</li>
            <li> Looked like I had been swimming by the end of the day when it was hot outside</li>
            <li> followed all of the instructions exactly as Younique recommends and also tried various tips and tricks found online.  </li>
            <li> Upon initial application I was excited that my lashes did look thicker &amp; possibly longer.  </li>
            <li> I try it again the next day, thinking possibly I did not apply enough top coat, and the brush to the \\&quot;fiber\\&quot; tube breaks off into the tube.</li>
            <li> I purchased the mascara first for my daughter, then for myself about a month later.</li>
            <li> The lashes weren&#x27;t as full as I expected</li>
            <li> Removal of the mascara and fibers is easy but does take a little longer just like applying does.</li>
            <li> The gel mascara also smells a little off at some points but nothing too strong.</li>
            <li> I just re-bought it for $10 less and free shipping.</li>
            <li> For a long time, I have done this:  put vaseline on your fingertips and rub them on your upper eyelashes lightly, then brush on an eyeshadow powder over it.  </li>
            <li> The only way you can be assured that your 3D fiberlashs are not fake, is buy ordering directly through a Younique Presenter.</li>
            <li> I switched back to my tried &amp; true regular mascara this morning.  </li>
            <li> Souch better than just plain mascara!</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair lashes this product is definitely not worth your money!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not much more expensive than a good drug store brand, but the difference in the finish is so worth paying a little more for!</li>
            <li> I usually only apply one coat for work but will use two maybe three coats if I&#x27;m going out and want a more dramatic look With &amp;#34;practice&amp;#34; you will be able to get it on in a very short time..</li>
            <li> Two months later I finally receive the product and I cannot wait to use it to have those stunning long eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Not only were my lashes clumpy (less is more guys)</li>
            <li> I was SO excited to get this and was completely let down from the get go.</li>
            <li> - it seriously makes my eyelashes SUPER long and full and thick - really easy (and fun, I might add) to put on</li>
            <li> it looks just a little better regular drugstore mascara.</li>
            <li> Weeks went by while it sat here, in its cute little case, similar to the one you&#x27;d carry your sunglasses in.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d give it a better try in the morning and spend a little extra time on it.</li>
            <li> You do use this with your mascara, just in case I wasn&#x27;t clear.  </li>
            <li> I was really hesitant to pay nearly 30 for mascara when you could buy 6 tubes of regular mascara for that price....</li>
            <li> The real 3D Moodstruck Mascara has a barcode on the back of the wrapped case.  </li>
            <li> Purchased directly from Younique distributor.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin &amp; allergic to some types of make up.</li>
            <li> If this describes you or if you have sensitive eyes DO NOT use this mascara.</li>
            <li> They are thinner  and a lot shorter as if the product is causing my natural lashes to fall out.</li>
            <li> Not messy for me</li>
            <li> I wonder if it&#x27;s the product or if with repeated action</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> did a comparison photo of Cherry Blooms ALL NATURAL Fibre Lashes and Younique&#x27;s 3D Fibre Lashes.</li>
            <li> You can buy this directly from a dealer for $29.00 and have a satisfaction guarantee.</li>
            <li> Even my husband noticed how long my lashes were after my first time wearing 3D</li>
            <li> This person is ripping people off and not to mention when you purchase from this person you are completely voiding the &amp;#34;Love</li>
            <li> This had become a vital part of my beauty regiment.</li>
            <li> It feels so natural like you are not even wearing mascara.  </li>
            <li> The first time I inserted the WANs with the fibers in the container, the wind curled up and would not early go into the tube.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this stuff.</li>
            <li> I tried to go without it one day and my natural ones do not seem natural anymore.  </li>
            <li> Wow, is all I can say.  </li>
            <li> I am completely turned off from this company since they are not sanitary at all.</li>
            <li> Younique products are made with no harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> but once I put younique on wow...</li>
            <li> feel the set I got was old or something</li>
            <li> So when I kept hearing about this 3D fiber stuff naturally I had to try it.</li>
            <li> but my professional eyelash opinion is that I don&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li> Not natural or pretty at all.  </li>
            <li> They just don&#x27;t look natural and my lashes look like spider legs...</li>
            <li> So 2 days ago I quit them because my eyelashes was almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> Younique products are made from natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t complete when received</li>
            <li> Almost all natural...</li>
            <li> I have nearly invisible eyelashes, so this doesn&#x27;t give the product a lot to work with.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to enhance my eyelashes, but look fairly natural.</li>
            <li> You pay $30 for this product but you still have to keep a tube of your old mascara on hand as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You know what else is all natural?</li>
            <li> Purchased directly from Younique and got it in 3 days.</li>
            <li> None have compared to this one thus far.</li>
            <li> it appeared that my natural lashes were falling out.</li>
            <li> I had minor irritation the first couple of days.</li>
            <li> I do have slightly sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do not waste your money</li>
            <li> After trying this product only today, my eyes feel like they are ready to BLEED.</li>
            <li> As long as you follow directions and apply directly there should be not problems with this product, I would recommend to absolutely everyone I know!</li>
            <li> I have virtually NO eyelashes and have tried so many different mascaras (wasted money).</li>
            <li> I do apply a second coat of the gel after the fiber has set a few seconds to make sure they stay and not fall into my eyes or on my face.</li>
            <li> Difficult to make it look good.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking to replace these lashes with your fake lashes it might be a good switch.</li>
            <li> Afterwards, you have to apply more of the thick gel.</li>
            <li> So many people doing direct sales &amp; to be honest, I hate it.</li>
            <li> My lashes definitely look neater and better defined with just plain mascara</li>
            <li> if you re-apply with several coats your eyelashes are SUPER LONG.</li>
            <li> Have spent a fortune looking for that right one</li>
            <li> I have long eyelashes anyways, so after experimenting, this stuff looks much better when you add the fibers to the outer corner of top lashes only and leave the center and inner half normal mascara only (A Marilyn Monroe look).  </li>
            <li> I would not feel comfortable using this on clients, especially for print photography work due to the fibers coming off on the surrounding skin.  </li>
            <li> I use it daily and apply extra coats for special events for an extra pop!</li>
            <li> Second, the transplanting gel which is black, smudges easily.</li>
            <li> It worked very well first few days but not as well as time goes by</li>
            <li> no more fake eye lashes this is one of the best things i brought in the line of make up for years</li>
            <li> It takes multiple applications for it to work and there is a fine line between looking \\&quot;3D\\&quot; and a clumpy mess.</li>
            <li> Not the actual product highly dissapointed do not buy</li>
            <li> I mean, I have nice semi long lashes to begin with, but</li>
            <li> exactly what I expected I even purchased some for my mother.</li>
            <li> This definitely made my lashes look fantastic, the major drawback is that it tends to flake off and leaves black marks under my eyes within an hour.</li>
            <li> I mean put on as much gel mascara as you would like on, and then with the fibers only do a couple of light swipes at the root of my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> After tax and shipping it only comes to 38.00 give or take depending on where you live.</li>
            <li> I HAVE SHORT STRAIGHT BABY ASIAN LASHES!</li>
            <li> Get your real 3D Fiber Lashes actually from Younique and an actual Presenter</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get ripped off and buy the actual REAL mascara on a Younique Independent Presenters website.</li>
            <li> Not sure why there are negative reviews honestly!</li>
            <li> However, as the day progresses the tiny fibers ended up on the skin under and around my eyes requiring me to dust off &amp; brush that area clear several times rather than have those little fibers look like fine lines around the eyes --</li>
            <li> You first put a thin coat of your favorite mascara on, then the transplanting gel, then the fiber mascara, while the transplanting gel is still wet.</li>
            <li> Regular mascara first let dry.</li>
            <li> The fibers in Love Alpha are also very hard and bristle-like.</li>
            <li> so excited for this but after giving it weeks of practice is basically just clumps of black dust bunnie looking things that fall off your eyes and you have to keep constantly wiping off your upper cheeks.</li>
            <li> This product had great reviews so I was surprised by my disappointment!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll go back to my old drug store brand.</li>
            <li> You have to try and hold yourself back from going too far with this stuff.  </li>
            <li> If you follow the instructions, the fibers will not fall on your cheeks, and you truly do get thick and fabulous lashes.</li>
            <li> (I use a heated up curler first) and I have thick, long, flashy, beautiful eyelashes with this product.  </li>
            <li> Better then false lashes</li>
            <li> It saves me a lot of money at purchasing false lashes and having to apply them and remove them many times.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than false lashes.</li>
            <li> Normally mascara weighs my lashes down and I lose the curl I have from just curling them normally.  </li>
            <li> Applied my normal Cover Girl mascara, let it dry &amp; applied the Younique gel, the fiber &amp; another coat of gel.</li>
            <li> (I think it was by Benefit, but the fibers were white and not black like this one).</li>
            <li> so I am not so sure if this is original or not :(</li>
            <li> The process does take a couple extra minutes compared to just mascara but faster than putting on fake lashes and they look so much better!  </li>
            <li> This company should spend more money on actually developing a decent product, rather than expensive boxes to clutter up the landfills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It should last me a long time too because I don&#x27;t use much for daily wear, so the cost isn&#x27;t an issue.</li>
            <li> I think it is most dramatic on the bottom lashes.</li>
            <li> Order DIRECT from an independent presenter &amp; get the 14-day money back</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the look of thick goopy lashes, too much is too much.</li>
            <li> which im sure is definnitely not good !</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t send  it back because I figures it would cost as much  to do that it was waste of money as far as I was concerend</li>
            <li> I do have to note that I naturally have long eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Not sure if that&#x27;s normal or maybe it&#x27;s a older product.</li>
            <li> first coat is like a &amp;#34;primer&amp;#34; glue and the black stuff is this weird feather particle stuff for lack of a better description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;m applying it right or not.</li>
            <li> I finally broke down &amp; ordered it, but I didn&#x27;t want to order from a friend, too many of them selling &amp; I didn&#x27;t want to cause any hard feelings.</li>
            <li> I really liked the product results but it doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as I had hoped for as expensive as it was.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this product, it is easier than false lashes, tickers and cheaper than extensions, and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> Also there is a less expensive brand of mascara very similar sold on HSN that does just as good as a job.  </li>
            <li> A little much.</li>
            <li> the mascara just became very clumpy on my eye lashes and left little fuzzes on the tips of my lashes.</li>
            <li> Someone commented about this product being counterfeit, and if so, you might as well just splurge a little and buy the real thing from your local seller.</li>
            <li> However I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this product off Amazon or Any other of out products because they could be old products or expired or possibly tampered with..</li>
            <li> The instructions do warn you to not put too much of the fibres on as it could cause them to fall off....but one sweep of the fibres is enough to achieve the length!&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, rather than fibres sitting randomly under my eyes, it&#x27;s like the whole mascara had bled to give me the blackest eye!</li>
            <li> so if you know you&#x27;re sensitive, then heed other reviewers considerations.</li>
            <li> You decide how dramatic you want them with how many coats you put on just like any other mascara.</li>
            <li> Younique uses tiny black natural fibers to build thickness and length onto your eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> A bit disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve previously been using Better Than False Eyelashes by Two Faced</li>
            <li> I have also noticed breakage with my real lashes not sure if this is from this product.</li>
            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> Definitely makes your lashes thicker and longer but crumbles onto your face all day long.</li>
            <li> My lashes went completely flat and clumpy within the hour.</li>
            <li> I normally have short, blonde, wimpy, sparse lashes, but no more.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally long lashes, and this mascara helps to not only lengthen them, but thicken them as well.</li>
            <li> The fiber container has what looks like a sticker that has been ripped off but not completely, leaving a white residue.  </li>
            <li> so I resisted for a long time but finally decided to take advantage of a promotion she was doing.</li>
            <li> Made my lashes look much thicker only drawback was it was hard to keep it from making my lashes look clumpy</li>
            <li> There are are several thing to note here, so this might be a long review!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, no mess and my lashes are crazy long.</li>
            <li> The instructions say to have a layer of mascara dry onto your lashes before starting with the product!</li>
            <li> Apply your regular mascara and let dry.</li>
            <li> and after I was done, my natural lashes were half their size.  </li>
            <li> My wife has very short eyelashes and has complained for over 30 years about how none of the advertised products for lengthening eyelashes really work.  </li>
            <li> I occasionally need to use my lash comb if I apply it too thick, but I don&#x27;t on a normal, daily basis.</li>
            <li> I may be sounding dramatic but between the raccoon rings and the fact that I had to buy special make up remover to get the remains</li>
            <li> I am a Younique Independent Presenter and we&#x27;re NOT allowed to sell them on any other website besides the actual Younique websites we have.</li>
            <li> I so desperately wanted to love this product.  </li>
            <li> Product does not make your lashes look as long as they do in the advertised pictures and videos.  </li>
            <li> but not nearly what is advertised.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how long they get.</li>
            <li> but I find bits of fibers on my face all day long.</li>
            <li> I have long lashes to begin with.  </li>
            <li> A complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> as long as you put the gel on after the fiber it won&#x27;t flake.</li>
            <li> I bought this from an actual consultant and still not really sold.</li>
            <li> I already have long eyelashes</li>
            <li> Green tea fibers are natural and made in USA.</li>
            <li> which it did all day long.  </li>
            <li> The product seems like it&#x27;s old and dried out.  </li>
            <li> I had naturally long eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I started using this product and people now comment on my long lashes.  </li>
            <li> Everyone I show this too is blown away at how long your lashes look.  </li>
            <li> I had to use Latisse to get my lashes long.</li>
            <li> If I wear this too long, regardless of what the application says, the fibers do no stick all day.</li>
            <li> I already have long lashes and this product just makes my lashes look fury and tooooo long....</li>
            <li> it does make your lashes really long</li>
            <li> I have been wearing false eyelashes for 15 years, I&#x27;ve had eyelash extensions done at various times throughout the years, I&#x27;ve done the whole Latisse prescription bit, I&#x27;ve used every different type of mascara on the planet...</li>
            <li> A couple of pointers- 1) start with a good mascara base-</li>
            <li> if you put like 1 coat its the same as putting regular mascara 20 times they&#x27;ll just go down</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are long and long!</li>
            <li> I have the most pathetic short and straight lashes, I do not like falsies and regular mascara</li>
            <li> my lashes are so darn straight is once everything has dried is to give it one last good curl at the base of my lashes with my Panasonic heated eyelash curler and bam!!</li>
            <li> I think there is a lot of positive reviews, but my experience was not good.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products that are similar.</li>
            <li> Make lashes so long!</li>
            <li> I have ordered this and other brandz and they all work the same!!!</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and used the product on one eye then used my regular go to stuff on the other.</li>
            <li> I went ahead and did the other eye and found that it looked similar when I applied extra mascara to my other eye.</li>
            <li> , it drove me mad to keep touching up the rest of my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is so the fibers have time to dry to the gel for a bit&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> The gel WILL dry quicker than you think it will, and then the flakes will not stick as well.</li>
            <li> I made fun of her since she&#x27;s such a makeup queen and told her maybe she applied it wrong.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, having longer fuller lashes isn&#x27;t worth this type of pain or discomfort, especially at that price.</li>
            <li> The reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars was a few times, not everytime but when I wore contacts, several hours later it bothered my eyes.</li>
            <li> It does not really do much more than any other decent mascara.</li>
            <li> I did it exactly as the directions stated too !!!!  :(</li>
            <li> but, I haven&#x27;t had a single problem with the fibers bothering me.</li>
            <li> I use it every single day before work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t send it back  right away.</li>
            <li> I have it average because it does wonders for lashes...but sometimes the tiny fibers some how get in my eye and irritates the hell out of them, esp since I wear contacts.</li>
            <li> Also the application process is too time consuming (at least 3X the amount of normal mascara).</li>
            <li> then spent a long time try to wash it out.</li>
            <li> The first time I got some of the fibers in my eye and it was extremely irritating.</li>
            <li> and I was really excited to try it because I always use false lashes and wanted something for when I go out and don&#x27;t feel like going through all the trouble.</li>
            <li> I thought this product would make my lashes look like false lashes, not so much!</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product, everyone thought I was wearing false eyelashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not like fake eyelashes, but not bad.</li>
            <li> sometimes I have loose fibers around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for less than a week</li>
            <li> I heard some complaints about the tiny fibers falling onto people’s cheeks, this did slightly happen to me</li>
            <li> I get the same look for less.</li>
            <li> NOT SUITABLE FOR SENSITIVE EYES!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> By the end of the 2nd month, it was nearly dry and hardly any fibers left.  </li>
            <li> l like it make my lashes fuller what little I have left</li>
            <li> I am a little irritated that I paid $28 +$5 s&amp;h last week and</li>
            <li> transplant gel is very thick and very clumpy.</li>
            <li> , it is hypoallergenic, it&#x27;s sweat proof, water resistant, smudge proof and lasts all day long!!!  </li>
            <li> nothing real cheap that flakes and falls off your lashes all day because this is literally the base for the fibers/glue. 2)</li>
            <li> Knock off product be careful.  </li>
            <li> the product is what I expected it would be.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I find it to be fun when I&#x27;m bored ...</li>
            <li> It had absolutely NO affect on my lashes.</li>
            <li> Not really what I thought it would be....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just coming from someone who has spent hours and $$ looking for an answer</li>
            <li> not what I expected, will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> accidentally got my lashes wet when I decided to wash my face</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> If done correctly the product works as expected.</li>
            <li> By the next morning (8 hors of sleeping)there are a few flakes</li>
            <li> Works exactally like I expected.</li>
            <li> Well, my mascara arrived last week, I&#x27;ve used the product everyday</li>
            <li> Big waste of money..Does not extend eyelashes as advertised and the fibers fall onto your face during the day..</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much difference - it&#x27;s clumpy.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t worn it on a day where it didn&#x27;t get in my eyes, no matter how careful I am.</li>
            <li> I just spent $29 for nothing.</li>
            <li> A total waste of money and anticipation for me.</li>
            <li> Tried a few times, following instructions, and still looked &amp;#34;spidery&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Be careful, beware, I purchased the item for my wife and it turns out to be</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> The only thing I still have trouble with is when I reapply the gel after the fibers, I seem to take some of them off.  </li>
            <li> Be careful if you wear contacts.</li>
            <li> Took longer than I expected, but thank you anyway.</li>
            <li> and I went back to the pink and green tube I&#x27;ve always used.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll be buying this mascara for life, so much easier than false lashes</li>
            <li> i was being told it had black fibers under my eyes alllll day long</li>
            <li> I looked a mess and my eyes were irritated all day long</li>
            <li> So I am somewhat of an eyelash expert due to my lifelong obsession with eyes and eye makeup.  </li>
            <li> Also I&#x27;m not sure why anyone would overpay for a product that may not be authentic, that&#x27;s crazy.</li>
            <li> However, just 2 hours later I noticed i had little black flakes all over my cheeks and undereyes.</li>
            <li> well after a week my natural eyelashes started getting less thick and started falling out.</li>
            <li> Unless you are buying FROM a rep (or presenter as they are called) your product IS a fake, just perhaps a better fake than others, OR it is being sold by a presenter who is trying to make a double profit because she gets paid once for buying them (to sell) and</li>
            <li> I have also added a pic of my eyes, one in younique and the other in maybelline to show the difference.</li>
            <li> I only used it maybe 4 to 5 days a week and no more than 2 applications.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the women who complain about fibers in their eyes are using ti correctly, if you don&#x27;t &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; the fibers with the gel enough they will fall on your cheek or in your eyes.</li>
            <li> I am extremely picky when it comes to mascara.</li>
            <li> Younique 3D lash can not be sold on this site nor any other site that is not affiliated with younique.</li>
            <li> It takes a long time and is messy.</li>
            <li> It was extremely clumpy.</li>
            <li> My other eye had 2 coats of my mascara.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll have to buy from the company itself to be sure to not get a recycled set.  :(</li>
            <li> I did one side with 3d and other side with just mascara.</li>
            <li> I was so worried based on the other reviews from sellers and &amp;#34;like products&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> All day, there were dark circles beneath my eyes, and I look as though I have pink eye.</li>
            <li> Then you have to apply the fibers, which must be done very carefully lest they get in your eye.  </li>
            <li> The actual company behind the product does have a money back guarantee.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed and can&#x27;t understand any of the good reviews.</li>
            <li> It runs down face if you sweat even minimally!</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> But this is just not worth the pain.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Whatever it is, it&#x27;s not worth</li>
            <li> Just be diligent in watching for the dark circles/residual under your eye and be prepared to spend a minute here and there in the mirror getting fibers out of your eye.</li>
            <li> I suggest you do the same before it&#x27;s too late.</li>
            <li> Not worth $30.  </li>
            <li> All the pictures I see online for people promoting the mascara are really unattractive to me because they look really fake.</li>
            <li> However, the product itself is not worth it to me.</li>
            <li> Not worth the $</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the price tag.</li>
            <li> and I know they say beauty is pain, but it&#x27;s not worth the eye doctor bill I had to pay when a fiber scratched my eye...</li>
            <li> Not worth the price, fibers fall into your eyes and it leaves lashes clumpy.</li>
            <li> I have had a representative from this company yall about my mentally and physically disabled daughter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this product for over a month, my eyelashes have shortened, thinned out and the actual eyelash itself is no longer thick.</li>
            <li> and I am hooked on this product, they are your lashes on sterriods, not those false things that look like you have catapillars on your eyelids, so natural looking</li>
            <li> $30 down the drain.</li>
            <li> I went to my chiropractor today and had to lay down on a table.</li>
            <li> until my lashes started falling out, then the glues from falsies bothered my eyes, plus my eye lids always felt weighted down wearing falsies.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars, was because if your not careful when applying, it will get into your eyes and its very irritating.</li>
            <li> Not to mention, those tiny little fibers you put on all into your eyes and hurt, no matter how hard you try not to.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is taking it off the little fibers</li>
            <li> I had black flecks all over my under eyes and cheek bones.</li>
            <li> It does make them thicker and slightly longer</li>
            <li> It gives you a slightly longer lash.</li>
            <li> But this is really really really BLACK.</li>
            <li> the gel is black</li>
            <li> Made my lashes look like  look like black widow spiders</li>
            <li> Otherwise it&#x27;s a clumpy mess with black spider leg fibers on your face.</li>
            <li> The fibers fall off and make a mess all over your face and can make your eyelashes look clumpy and all &amp;#34;spidery&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> and I was concerned  about it but for my surprise they look so long n thick.</li>
            <li> I have seen several pictures of how to spot the real vs fake ones, but I&#x27;ll give you the real scoop.</li>
            <li> Then that burns a little.</li>
            <li> I applied it as told, but I found it to be a little clumpy, but over all it lengthened my lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but the office look (it looks unnatural and a little clumpy).</li>
            <li> The product ran under my eye a little.</li>
            <li> I even used my little lash brush to try and brush them out.</li>
            <li> A little clumpy if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li> I tried using a lash comb and it helps a little.</li>
            <li> The fibers are literally little hairs, sometimes they bunch up</li>
            <li> Not very impressed, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> few people on Facebook and instagram trying to sell it and rave about it.  </li>
            <li> So my husband bought the product for me to stop crying and than never resecived it.</li>
            <li> Waste of my money.  </li>
            <li> Fibers are messy and gets in your eyes and falls on your face during the day.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I have very short thin lashes</li>
            <li> If you are unsure watch a few YouTube tutorials to get a feel for it.</li>
            <li> The  fiber is dried out  and flakes get  into my eyes..</li>
            <li> But the worst part is that it seems to take some of my own eyelashes with it when i remove it with my neutrogena eye makeup remover.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear it everyday</li>
            <li> Waste of money the fibers fall off through out the day and Your eyes become itchy.</li>
            <li> have trouble with clumping and flaking.  </li>
            <li> The gel part is dried out.</li>
            <li> However, the fibers get in the eyes and cause irritation even when directions are followed to the T. Waste of money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and it makes my eyes pop because it looks like I&#x27;m wearing lashes.</li>
            <li> $30 waste of money.</li>
            <li> but I do not wear everyday.</li>
            <li> Granted a few instances of flaking of the fibers will occur but it beats spending $150 plus at a lash salon.</li>
            <li> This seller has disabled editing posts</li>
            <li> Not smooth.</li>
            <li> Not best for those with sensitive eyes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the mascara a few times</li>
            <li> I used 2 coats and the fibers would be all under my eyes after a few hours.</li>
            <li> It seemed to be dried out.</li>
            <li> and I myself never have any trouble.</li>
            <li> ( mascara is the one product I use everyday) and haven&#x27;t had any issues.</li>
            <li> Waste of money, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I noticed my eyelashes were getting thin and falling out, definitely would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Not even heavy on your eyes.</li>
            <li> So, the \\&quot;fiber\\&quot; tube seems to be all dried up.</li>
            <li> Then I heat my eyelash curler with a blow dryer for a few seconds and then I curl my lashes.  </li>
            <li> they didn&#x27;t separate my lashes my lashes, but made them globby and clumpy and heavy.</li>
            <li> Then, I did the fibers, which makes the lashes even worse.it makes them stick together and just looks messy.</li>
            <li> The fibers can get heavy...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care how carefully and slowly you apply this mascara</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money...</li>
            <li> I saw a few people review this product on you tube and thought &amp;#34;hmmm</li>
            <li> It really does add length and volume and in my 4 months of wearing it, I have only had one incident where I accidentally took the fibers too close to the base of my lashes (my fault)</li>
            <li> The process is simple, and it is truly a false lash alternative.</li>
            <li> and when I wanted a falsie look I would just add a few false individual lashes to the ends.</li>
            <li> I also recommend to just apply the product to the tips to get maximum length and less clumps!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to see these at a bridal show this past weekend but was disappointed from the start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy to apply and it&#x27;s messy.</li>
            <li> I hate feeling pressured to buy anything, but now I see why everyone&#x27;s so excited about this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not as dramatic as I thought but definitely does the job.</li>
            <li> only it&#x27;s an all in one and not as dramatic an effect as younique and I</li>
            <li> I am usually hesitant to believe when mascara companies claim that their product will give the appearance of fake eyelashes naturally</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy and weighed my lashes down and it&#x27;s too thick and clumpy.</li>
            <li> Thats just a mess!</li>
            <li> And omg taking all the layers of mascara,  gel &amp; fibers off Talk about a mess!</li>
            <li> I have long lashes but not very full or thick lashes and this changes the game.</li>
            <li> It was slightly hard to get off with soap and water, and I did have slight panda eyes but got into bed and in the morning used a baby wipe to get the excess off.&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li> Your lashes do not always come out looking like those crazy scary pictures of the huge lashes-- spidery lashes--</li>
            <li> That means less tugging around the eyes so fewer wrinkles for your delicate eye skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would recommend not applying it at the base of the lash because it can be clumpier that way and more irritating to your eye.</li>
            <li> but it can get a little clumpy!</li>
            <li> And worst if all, you can&#x27;t quickly rub it away with your finger, you need to have make-up remover with you in the day to get it off!!</li>
            <li> It probably has to be in order for the fibers to stick, but no matter how carefully I apply it it still looks very thick.  </li>
            <li> do I want to buy from someone who is doing something shady?  </li>
            <li> i let my co-worker try it since she has really small lashed</li>
            <li> i was worried on how much she disliked it and it was a total disappointment!!!</li>
            <li> Big sad face</li>
            <li> but I get small fibers in my eyes all the time.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Thank you for your support with my small business, and the world.</li>
            <li> Not sure.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the craze is all about with this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is not cute, you&#x27;re not rockin it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> If you are usually a mascara-and-go person, you will no longer be after using this mascara.</li>
            <li> Just a thought :/ here is a link to my rep.</li>
            <li> It wears as well as my usual mascara</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why people are saying this product doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This stuff has to be the LEAST waterproof substance on earth so please don&#x27;t even think about having watery eyes or God forbid crying while wearing it...</li>
            <li> Unbelievable mascara/  </li>
            <li> I usually end up with fibers in my eyes and all over my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed, I only use it when I go out if that.  </li>
            <li> And no its not because i did it wrong, if you look at sellers pictures on facebook who are trying to promote it, it looks gross as well!</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; it creates is very messy and spidery.  </li>
            <li> This is okay if you are not attempting the natural look, BUT in addition to my lashes looking horribly clumpy they broke them down like crazy!</li>
            <li> Its clumpy, messy and just not good mascara.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve not experienced any eyelash loss as mentioned in previous comments</li>
            <li> but if you put too much it looks fake and not a good fake.  </li>
            <li> Other fiber mascaras I have used would leave messy black fibers all around my eyes or be impossible to get off in the shower.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s hard to do.</li>
            <li> I wear hard contacts and was nervous about this mascara</li>
            <li> Removing the mascara before bed is ridiculously hard.  </li>
            <li> , i have a hard time to keep my lashes up</li>
            <li> sometimes if you wear it all day its hard for the fibers to come off</li>
            <li> I have gotten it on my face and it is really hard to remove it.  </li>
            <li> Hard to use and flakes off &amp; gets in my eyes.</li>
            <li> I could hardly believe it.  </li>
            <li> So  I&#x27;m just warning  yall I wish I had a warning because now I have no eyelashes hardly at all.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to tell I have any.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to get lashes that aren&#x27;t clumped...still practicing.</li>
            <li> whoever is selling this is selling OLD OLD BAD product giving Younique a bad name as well as image.</li>
            <li> I looked rough and tired!</li>
            <li> its like there stuck to your lashes and it sucks</li>
            <li> I am an everyday false eyelash wearer...</li>
            <li> and i found myself picking at my lashes as they were so thick.  </li>
            <li> thick, clumpy gobs of fibers.  </li>
            <li> THIS stuff is absolute crap.</li>
            <li> but after about 2 weeks it just doesn&#x27;t go  on as thick as it did.</li>
            <li> It works amazingly, not gonna lie</li>
            <li> It just looked like I had thick mascara on..</li>
            <li> They were literally broken in half!  </li>
            <li> Total fake!</li>
            <li> I took before and after pictures and the results are unbelievable!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure why you&#x27;d buy them from this seller!</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m a little disappointed</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
            <li> ladies, this is not cute!</li>
            <li> have very small lashes</li>
            <li> She only wore the mascara for two days and then got very ill.</li>
            <li> Seriously when did clumpy spider leg lashes become fashionable?</li>
            <li> Seriously?</li>
            <li> Would recommend to all you ladies who want long lashes without wearing fake ones!</li>
            <li> This is not good mascara.  </li>
            <li> My pruduct was not good.  </li>
            <li> which is not a good look for anyone.</li>
            <li> The gel is very thick and it&#x27;s very messy!</li>
            <li> we are talking about and we cannot afford to lose our eyesight by putting fake Moodstruck 3d fiber mascaras, which ingredients are not sure to be safe.&lt;br</li>
            <li> YOUNIQUE SUCKS!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in both the shipping time and the actual quality of the mascara.  </li>
            <li> I received mine as a present and have to admit I have no idea whether it&#x27;s real or fake after seeing some of the pictures and reviews on here.  </li>
            <li> Since this has happened the co-worker has been contacted by two other people near by who had terrible problems with this product and one is now 30% blind in one eye.</li>
            <li> Personally, I really hate the clumpy looking lashes because it looks like I used a cheap drugstore mascara. :(</li>
            <li> Faced with the exception of black fibers vs white fibers, the 3d Fiber Lashes and the way it clumped and at the end of the day and made my eyes look awful!!</li>
            <li> So those who have lashes like me don&#x27;t waste your pennies!!!</li>
            <li> Not happy....</li>
            <li> Product was broken when received.</li>
            <li> It could just be that my lashes are too thick, or my eyes are the wrong shape or?</li>
            <li> I would have given the overall finish a 4 star if not for the price and the annoying application process.</li>
            <li> The longer I sat the worse</li>
            <li> my eyelashes wasn&#x27;t brittle and thin at all before.</li>
            <li> It was broken.  </li>
            <li> Not happy with this item.</li>
            <li> Alas, it was not to be.</li>
            <li> One time wear false lashes</li>
            <li> Personally I feel it&#x27;s over priced for getting crap in my eyes and irritating my eyes all day.  </li>
            <li> Plus my lashes don&#x27;t fall out like they do when you wear false lashes.</li>
            <li> Made my lashes look like I had false lashes on.</li>
            <li> When I apply it you would think I am wearing false lashes.  </li>
            <li> and it looks like I have on false eyelashes when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> It is like wearing false eyelashes every day, without any hassle at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never go back to plain, boring lashes when I can use this.</li>
            <li> fibers were really dry and flaky and I had to watch a you tube video to apply it because it came with no directions at all&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed :(</li>
            <li> NO GOOD!</li>
            <li> No more fake eyelashes glued to this girl&#x27;s eyelids anymore!  </li>
            <li> This stuff is no good and is a knock off!</li>
            <li> Not a good look for me!</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed that the product didn&#x27;t agree with my oily skin.</li>
            <li> the little fibers irritate my eyes :(  </li>
            <li> One of the reasons I hate this mascara because the little fibers get EVERYWHERE.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this product is expensive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying makeup for over 40 years and had a difficult time with this not smearing all over my eyes.  </li>
            <li> The gals at work had done the fake eyelash extensions</li>
            <li> Made my eye lashes look like creepy spider legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It can become really uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> This makeup is FAKE</li>
            <li> In these photos, you can tell the difference that this is fake.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical...</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> However.. I rather just wear fake lashes.</li>
            <li> Fail.</li>
            <li> These are fake..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need fake eyelashes anymore.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with the product or the sales reps.</li>
            <li> THIS ITEM COULD BE FAKE.</li>
            <li> I paid months for expensive lash extensions,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming I received a fake one, but no longer have the packaging and cannot tell from the foil imprint in the case to confirm.</li>
            <li> This is a fake replica of Younique&#x27;s mascara.</li>
            <li> Any where you get Younique 3D mascara on amazon is probably fake.</li>
            <li> Lashes look clumpy and sometimes the tips bend in weird ways.</li>
            <li> Ill just stick to mascara for now.</li>
            <li> I even had fake eyelashes on my car, but I digress...</li>
            <li> This is fake.</li>
            <li> But sadly it irritates my eyes.</li>
            <li> It made my lashes clump together and made them look bumpy and weird.</li>
            <li> After I waited a month I contacted them and they discovered they had sent my purchase to the wrong address.</li>
            <li> but I think the price is too expensive and</li>
            <li> This mascara is fake</li>
            <li> Sorry to say I don&#x27;t think I will be.  </li>
            <li> There are all kinds of things wrong with this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> I no longer have to pay for those expensive eyelash extensions.</li>
            <li> I wore Fake eyelashes for years....</li>
            <li> My friends were asking me if I had fake eye lashes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m instantly skeptical about miracle products</li>
            <li> expensive for how it works.  </li>
            <li> and she was really rude and tried to make me out as stupid.</li>
            <li> They can be irritating to the eyes but not too bad.</li>
            <li> This mascara absolutely sucks!!!</li>
            <li> was very disappointed  in this was dried out</li>
            <li> I am unhappy.</li>
            <li> The specialist said the fibers get under the eye and start cutting, and releasing toxins.</li>
            <li> I have noticed my lashes are broken off!!</li>
            <li> AND EVERYONE THINKS I HAVE FAKE LASHES!</li>
            <li> This was a fake product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M SO ANGRY!</li>
            <li> Am I mad and upset with this product??</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT YOUNIQUE ITS FAKE!</li>
            <li> He asked me if I had fake lashes on my eye!</li>
            <li> You will feel like you are wearing false eyelashes!!</li>
            <li> Was very difficult to apply without getting fibers in your eyes, and time consuming.</li>
            <li> Very sad I gave in to the hope of this product.</li>
            <li> Very irritating!</li>
            <li> I mean, it&#x27;s shocking!</li>
            <li> Almost impossible to get any product out of it.</li>
            <li> My eyes hurt so bad.</li>
            <li> I would give this 5 stars if they didn&#x27;t irritate your eyes so badly.</li>
            <li> She also told me I was ugly unless I had these.</li>
            <li> and she got severely sick.</li>
            <li> I will basically be throwing in the garbage! :(</li>
            <li> I had my fake eye lash extensions removed after using them for 8 months - I looked horrible once they were removed.  </li>
            <li> Real or fake product dont buy it</li>
            <li> I am alittle disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> This is the fake one very disappointed!</li>
            <li> In the trash:(</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m disappointed and unimpressed.</li>
            <li> This along with the clumped, spider leg looking lashes leaves me disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed... did not work...</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed in the product, not the service of receiving it.</li>
            <li> I am DISAPPOINTED</li>
            <li> I do not know if the daughter&#x27;s product was real or fake</li>
            <li> then they were before :(</li>
            <li> Very disappointing</li>
            <li> I was so mad!</li>
            <li> something was stuck on my lashes, you know, that annoying feeling like lint is on your lashes?</li>
            <li> The gel mascara also burns the crap out of my eyes.</li>
            <li> and if you hate them call it a loss.</li>
            <li> It gets in my eyes or all over my face and its annoying.</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate this mascara.</li>
            <li> tend to fall into my eyes and that&#x27;s annoying</li>
            <li> It was an awful painful feeling that lasted for hours.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> It was terrible.</li>
            <li> I was expecting insane results.</li>
            <li> All my lashes were clumped together and nasty!!</li>
            <li> Just all caked on all over her lashes all nasty looking?</li>
            <li> It was just so nasty.</li>
            <li> but my eyes are still burning badly!!</li>

            <li> it is the worst mascara I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> But the worst part is how it flakes off!!</li>
            <li> This product was awful.</li>
            <li> I have seen a lot of fakes and the reactions are terrible.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>

            <li> Makes you look like you have nasty clumpy spider leg eye lashes.</li>
            <li> Worst.</li>
            <li> I want to scratch my eyes out, it is so awful!</li>
            <li> It added furry like clumps to the ends of my lashes which looked terrible!!</li>
            <li> I hate this mascara!</li>
            <li> The fibers get in your eyes very bad!</li>
            <li> Horrible product!</li>

            <li> Yes, my lashes looked thicker. Yet that in no way made up for the stinging pain in my eyes from the fibers clearly falling into them! I placed the fiber coat on right after the transplanting gel, followed by the transplanting gel... fiber in my eyes! I immediately removed the product with eye make up remover, and followed it up with a bilateral eye rinse. I will not be recommending this product to anyone as in my opinion, it is a health hazard! Not to mention, that fiber brush will pick up a lot of bacteria.</li>
            <li> This is not good mascara.  I don&#x27;t know why this product is expensive.  Its clumpy, messy and just not good mascara.  I see s few people on Facebook and instagram trying to sell it and rave about it.  If you see the pictures the eyelashes look clumpy.  For that I&#x27;ll just buy cheap mascara.  Younique 3D lashes suck bottom line.  Do not buy it.</li>
            <li> Younique reps are not allowed to sell on Amazon.  So you have to ask yourself- do I want to buy from someone who is doing something shady?  Do I want to buy an item that is not guaranteed by the manufacturer because it is not being sold ethically? And finally- WHY is the price so low, is it out of date or a knockoff?  Younique reps have to buy the makeup they sell at list price- then get commission after and it is NOT 50% off. So why would they take a loss to sell this to you at half-off?  You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Order DIRECT from an independent presenter &amp; get the 14-day money back guarantee!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product. Yes your lashes look great but no better than any lash thickening and lengthening mascara.  The fibres fall off into my yeses and on to my face. My eyes bothered me the whole night. Itchy and irritable when I looked in the mirror I had black flecks all over my under eyes and cheek bones. If I knew where to return it to get a refund as stated when I purchased it I would. Mine is in the garbage tonight. Also the ingredients.....propylene Glycol .......this is anti freeze. It states in the product...keep away from eyes. Hello....it&#x27;s a freaking mascara that&#x27;s hard to do.</li>
            <li> I have had a representative from this company yall about my mentally and physically disabled daughter. She also told me I was ugly unless I had these. So my husband bought the product for me to stop crying and than never resecived it.</li>
            <li> Not worth it. The fibers do not stay in place the fibers either get into my eyes or all on my cheeks. This really irritated my eyes. I tried applying it with and without my mascara as well as applying a bit more gel to seal it. This would be worth $30 if it actually worked the way it should. Save yourself the hassle of returning the item and having to pay for shipping both ways and find another product that actually works. I purchased this from Younique website not Amazon.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and she really loved it, so yes i am happy with with the overall experience.</li>
            <li> Love love love this 3D Fiber lash mascara,  as long as its real. Dont won&#x27;t to risk it order from a presenter you won&#x27;t be sorry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.youniqueproducts.com/JeanneJones1</li>
            <li> This is a great product, but it really it is way over priced.  There are many product with the same ingredients for 1/2 the price.  Most people cnt afford to pay 30.00 for mascara no matter how great it is.  I just wanted to be honest, but its NOT worth the price.</li>
            <li> IF YOU ARE BUYING THIS PRODUCT FROM THIS WEBSITE THEN YOU ARE NOT ASSURED YOU ARE GETTING THE REAL THING!&lt;br /&gt;BE A SMART CONSUMER AS WITH ANY PROFESSIONAL PRODUCT ON HERE. SALON PRODUCTS AS WELL AS THINGS LIKE DOTERRA OILS AND YOUNIQUE THAT ARE SOLD BY PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR THE DISTRIBUTOR AND ARE TRAINED ON THE PRODUCTS.&lt;br /&gt;THE INTEGRITY OF THE PRODUCTS AND THE COMPANIES THAT MANUFACTURE THEM IS NOT RESPECTED BY THOSE WHO SELL THESE ITEMS HERE.

FORGET ABOUT THE GUARENTEE IF YOU BUY HERE!&lt;br /&gt;BUYER BEWARE!</li>
            <li> I think I am allergic to something in it. When I wear it my eyes itch!!!!</li>
            <li> Please folks, why are you paying MORE for these lashes than getting them from a Younique presenter?  They don&#x27;t cost this much, and you may and probably are getting fakes.  The real 3D Moodstruck Mascara has a barcode on the back of the wrapped case.  Just goes to show when there&#x27;s a great product out there, people will try to duplicate.  Just look at all the cheap knockoffs of designer handbags.  To get the authentic 3D Mascara, order from a presenter like myself.  That&#x27;s the only way to get it!&lt;br /&gt;Order the authentic fiber lashes at www.youniqueproducts.com/NancyRusso&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> Love this mascara. Def worth the money.  Ur eyelashes look thicker &amp; longer instantly</li>
            <li> This product had great reviews so I was surprised by my disappointment! It runs down face if you sweat even minimally! I will basically be throwing in the garbage! :(</li>
            <li> This product really does as advertised! Makes your lashes thicker and fuller...no need for falsies anymore. Comes off very easily with makeup remover products. This is part of my makeup staples from now on.</li>
            <li> Purchased directly from Younique distributor. Was very difficult to apply without getting fibers in your eyes, and time consuming. As a makeup artist I do not think they make your lashes look flawless at all if you have short lashes trying to build the length. One time wear false lashes do the job better. I gave it a break and then came back to it, after using for a week I have noticed my lashes are broken off!! Top are now shorter than bottom lashes. I mainly wear mascara on top lashes. Do not buy this product. Stick to hydrating your lashes with a healthy oil (coconut, jojoba)  or eat healthy and you will have healthy lashes! Very sad I gave in to the hope of this product.</li>
            <li> Amazed. The fibers stick! And the cool part is the directions dont say &amp;#34;use fiber with youniques mascara&amp;#34; (like most companies that only recommend their own stuff)... it says to apply with your own mascara. Even though the mascara it comes with is pretty cool by itself. Long lasting. I got lots of compliments. Lasted about six weeks and I needed a refill.</li>
            <li> I bought this after a friend had used it &amp; said it was better than fake eyelashes. I bought it, used it as directed by the Yonquie Rep and after only two days of wearing it my eyelashes fell out in chunks! I have sensitive skin &amp; allergic to some types of make up. If this describes you or if you have sensitive eyes DO NOT use this mascara. I regret ever purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> I had my fake eye lash extensions removed after using them for 8 months - I looked horrible once they were removed.  I used this while I was waiting for my lashes to grow back - this was a LIFE SAVER!</li>
            <li> Very nice, improves lashes and easy to apply and remove.. Does flake.</li>
            <li> If I could give it a no star I would!!! Horrible product I just bought this product last week and I spend $37 in this mascara from the younique website i let my co-worker try it since she has really small lashed and it didn&#x27;t seem to work for her she said she didn&#x27;t like it and she would stick to falsies. I made fun of her since she&#x27;s such a makeup queen and told her maybe she applied it wrong.  I tried it the next day(i wanted to wait till thanksgiving to impress everyone in our dinner)  i was worried on how much she disliked it and it was a total disappointment!!! Real or fake product dont buy it you will waist time and money. Fibers dont stick right and the lenght this mascara gave me was the same as when i applied my covergirl lashblast volume mascara. Comment posted 11-21-2014</li>
            <li> I bought this from a presenter and not Amazon. I wear hard contacts and was nervous about this mascara but, I haven&#x27;t had a single problem with the fibers bothering me. I put my contacts in first and do it and it&#x27;s been just fine. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks now.</li>
            <li> I intensely DISLIKE this mascara.  I&#x27;ve been applying makeup for over 40 years and had a difficult time with this not smearing all over my eyes.  The flaking is horrible.  I can&#x27;t wait to get home &amp; take it OFF!  Waste of my money.  I&#x27;ll go back to my old drug store brand.</li>
            <li> Used this for the first time today. It does exactly what it says it will do. My eyelashes looked way thicker and longer. I loved that part of it. However,  even though I followed the directions, the fibers got all over in my eyes. Very irritating! My eyes hurt so bad. I would give this 5 stars if they didn&#x27;t irritate your eyes so badly. But this is just not worth the pain. $30 down the drain.</li>
            <li> Love it. My friend had me try hers around Christmas and I wanted it;). The gals at work had done the fake eyelash extensions but I didn&#x27;t want to keep paying for the up keep. This is something I can use when I feel like it. Just make sure you follow the instructions. Regular mascara first let dry. Then add it alternating quickly so it doesn&#x27;t dry in between.</li>
            <li> Fibers are messy and gets in your eyes and falls on your face during the day.  Do not like it at all</li>
            <li> excellent!! I love it!!</li>
            <li> I love the mascara but…&lt;br /&gt;Adding the fibers is a good way to make your lashes look fuller and longer and I have received a lot of compliments. The problem is I&#x27;ve noticed that my natural lashes are much more scarce. They are thinner  and a lot shorter as if the product is causing my natural lashes to fall out. NO GOOD! ;(</li>
            <li> Make sure you get the real thing from the actual company.  These are your eyes we are talking about and we cannot afford to lose our eyesight by putting fake Moodstruck 3d fiber mascaras, which ingredients are not sure to be safe.&lt;br /&gt;https://www.youniqueproducts.com/tezcb/</li>
            <li> Seriously when did clumpy spider leg lashes become fashionable? I thought I would give this product a go as I see so many people selling and buying this product! What a waste of my money. Not only were my lashes clumpy (less is more guys) the fibers get into ur eyes! My eyes were blood shot red then spent a long time try to wash it out. I looked a mess and my eyes were irritated all day long, no one looks good with blood shot eyes! I don&#x27;t get the 5 star reviews. How have they not got the fibers in their eyes? As they sprinkle everywhere. Big sad face</li>
            <li> Really easy and saved loads of money by not buying false eyelashes, very pleased</li>
            <li> Cheaper if you buy from a rep! And you know you are getting the real deal!&lt;br /&gt;Https://www.youniqueproducts.com/DanikaD/</li>
            <li> Knock off product be careful.  Not happy....</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY!!!! This masacara (from an independent Younique advisor) gave me a corneal abrasion. My sight still hasn&#x27;t returned properly in my left eye. It goes on clumpy and sticky! Not worth the money. I&#x27;d give it 0 stars if I could.</li>
            <li> first coat is like a &amp;#34;primer&amp;#34; glue and the black stuff is this weird feather particle stuff for lack of a better description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Made my eye lashes look like creepy spider legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The feather particle things from the second part of the application fall off all over my face as the day wears on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Really irritates my eyes. Makes then burn much more than other mascaras.</li>
            <li> Only fiber mascara that works.</li>
            <li> I am an everyday false eyelash wearer... I wanted to see what all the hype was about so I thought I would give this a whirl. OMG! So amazing. I have very short thin lashes I got great volume and length. This is truly worth every penny. If you are unsure watch a few YouTube tutorials to get a feel for it. Btw I do wear contacts with it and have no problems. Definitely remove at night though I don&#x27;t recommend sleeping in it.</li>
            <li> Great product, will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Irritated my eyes so much and i found myself picking at my lashes as they were so thick.  My favorite mascara is Lash Love from Mary Kay!</li>
            <li> This was on my daughter&#x27;s &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; list for Christmas. I must say  though that it works wonderfully, and makes her eyelashes look much thicker. I may have to purchase this for myself</li>
            <li> exactly what I expected I even purchased some for my mother.</li>
            <li> This is an incredible product! I am impressed with it! It goes on easily, it wears great; no smudging or raccoon eyes! It makes your eyes &amp; eyelashes look fabulous! I will purchase this again!</li>
            <li> Love it&lt;br /&gt;BUT you really have to follow the directions otherwise the fibers can easily get in your eyes</li>
            <li> Product does not make your lashes look as long as they do in the advertised pictures and videos.  It does make them thicker and slightly longer but not nearly what is advertised.  Also as the day goes on the fibers get on to your skin right underneath your eye making it look like you have raccoon eyes.  The mascara also is clumpy.  Not a bad product but would not re-purchase.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Doubled the length of my lashes!!!</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a great product, until the little fibers from the fiber wand starting flaking into my eyes. The product is ok, but just ok. It can become really uncomfortable. It does give your lashes a great extension but, honestly, there are a lot of good mascara&#x27;s out there that do the same thing ...without flaking fibers in your tear ducts :(</li>
            <li> Really extends lashes nicely. I recommend using a lash brush after each application to prevent clumping.</li>
            <li> It does work well but I get small fibers in my eyes all the time.</li>
            <li> the product is what I expected it would be. thank you</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever ordered in my life!!! I will never buy another mascara again!</li>
            <li> Great deal! Great pkg</li>
            <li> I like it very well.Its the best mascara that I have used.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says love this xxxoooo</li>
            <li> I love it! It requires a little time to apply for the best results, but I am really impressed and would recommend it!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed! The initial effect of the mascara is brilliant, full of length and body. It&#x27;s actually really simple to apply too, the brush for the gel is great! The instructions do warn you to not put too much of the fibres on as it could cause them to fall off....but one sweep of the fibres is enough to achieve the length!&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, rather than fibres sitting randomly under my eyes, it&#x27;s like the whole mascara had bled to give me the blackest eye! I mean, it&#x27;s shocking! I looked rough and tired! And worst if all, you can&#x27;t quickly rub it away with your finger, you need to have make-up remover with you in the day to get it off!! The mascara then needs reapplying and it becomes a viscous circle! What a waste of money! So glad I&#x27;d just tried it in the day rather than for an event or night out!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve not experienced any eyelash loss as mentioned in previous comments but I&#x27;ve stopped using it after a couple of days!&lt;br /&gt;Sticking to benefit lengthening mascara!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! AND EVERYONE THINKS I HAVE FAKE LASHES!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as the feed back I got . wasn&#x27;t worth 35$ .</li>
            <li> Great product. My eye lashes now touch my eye brows. That&#x27;s how long they get.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST mascara I have ever worn! No flaking, no irritation, amazing effects. Quick, easy and gorgeous! If you buy from a presenter, it&#x27;s 100% guaranteed. www.youniqueproducts.com/principessalashes</li>
            <li> This is ok. It gives you a slightly longer lash. The part I don&#x27;t like is the fiber...it makes my eyes water from the smell. Then that burns a little.</li>
            <li> There are are several thing to note here, so this might be a long review! First off, the mascara is awesome. It really does add length and volume and in my 4 months of wearing it, I have only had one incident where I accidentally took the fibers too close to the base of my lashes (my fault) and so I did get some fibers in my eye but nothing a couple eye drops couldn&#x27;t get out of my eye. I have always purchased from lashalert.com. I have seen several pictures of how to spot the real vs fake ones, but I&#x27;ll give you the real scoop. Unless you are buying FROM a rep (or presenter as they are called) your product IS a fake, just perhaps a better fake than others, OR it is being sold by a presenter who is trying to make a double profit because she gets paid once for buying them (to sell) and then again when she sells it. The presenters are forbidden to sell on any external sites. Only sites with youniqueproducts.com in the name are authentic. My rep has her link lashalert.com and then it takes you to youniqueproducts.com/lashalert. Every product is sent FROM YOUNIQUE and NEVER from the presenter. Your box will come from Utah, and also have the younique tissue paper. If your are looking for an incredible mascara you have found it, just make sure you get it from an actual presenter so it is not a fake, damaged or expired. I have also added a pic of my eyes, one in younique and the other in maybelline to show the difference.</li>
            <li> This is the best Mascara!!  Always buy from a Rep that has a website that actually takes you to all youniques products! Buying from a rep insures authenticity and the 14 day love it guarantee!! www.B3DLashed.com</li>
            <li> I really wish I can give this a zero star rating. This makeup is FAKE it&#x27;s not the real Younique product. In these photos, you can tell the difference that this is fake. Your eyelashes fall out and the formula is even different than the product we sell. Remember that if it&#x27;s too good to be true, it actually is. Plus, this is more expensive than if you were to buy it from a representative.</li>
            <li> You either love it...or you don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved it. My mom picked up a kit and gave it to me to try. I was skeptical...like with most things bought from a random rep, but I saw something similar that day at Ulta. (I think it was by Benefit, but the fibers were white and not black like this one). ANYWAYS, I gave it a go and I reeeaaally liked it. I applied it as told, but I found it to be a little clumpy, but over all it lengthened my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I messed up at first and got an eyeful of fibers, lol, but that was user error. I put the fiber brush too far/close to my inner eyelid and blinked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can understand why some might not like it, but it&#x27;s honestly a really neat product and I&#x27;d recommend it! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I am alittle disappointed with this product. I had heard such hype about it and wanted to try it. The coverage is great but I find bits of fibers on my face all day long.</li>
            <li> I have long lashes to begin with.  Personally I feel it&#x27;s over priced for getting crap in my eyes and irritating my eyes all day.  Flakes come off all day as well. Removing the mascara before bed is ridiculously hard.  I shouldn&#x27;t have to scrub my eyelashes. Next time I&#x27;ll stick to my drugstore mascara.  Not impressed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I got this product it&#x27;s so awesome</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Package was great and quick delivery.  I will purchase this product again and again and again!!</li>
            <li> I love it it&#x27;s  amazing, i have a hard time to keep my lashes up and I was concerned  about it but for my surprise they look so long n thick.</li>
            <li> You can only buy this product from a Younique presenter on their official site at youniqueproducts.com . These are either someone reselling theirs on Amazon or knock offs. And for those who say the fibers got in your eyes - you must not be doing the third step where you use the transplant gel again to seal the fibers to your lashes. Not messy for me and they don&#x27;t get in my eyes.</li>
            <li> I love it, its amazing the results</li>
            <li> Idk I haven had the best experience. Not sure if I&#x27;m applying it right or not. I wear contacts and the fiber lashes are short and out of control. They get stuck on my eyeballs. Not feeling this product as of yet.</li>
            <li> I really liked the product results but it doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as I had hoped for as expensive as it was.  By the end of the 2nd month, it was nearly dry and hardly any fibers left.  I only used it maybe 4 to 5 days a week and no more than 2 applications.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the women who complain about fibers in their eyes are using ti correctly, if you don&#x27;t &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; the fibers with the gel enough they will fall on your cheek or in your eyes. I use it every single day before work. I usually only apply one coat for work but will use two maybe three coats if I&#x27;m going out and want a more dramatic look With &amp;#34;practice&amp;#34; you will be able to get it on in a very short time..I use ALL the Younique products, also. There just isn&#x27;t any mascara out there ~ at this price~  that gives these type of results.They should look like this..below</li>
            <li> Came on time&lt;br /&gt;Works perfect&lt;br /&gt;Just great!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely buying again when I run out</li>
            <li> I LOVE the Younique 3D fiberlash mascara ! I have tried other products that are similar. I tried the ones with the white fibers, and they peak through your regular mascara, and it looks like &amp;#34;lash dandruff&amp;#34;. (I tried the Love Alpha, and the gel dries so fast, that even when quickly applying the fibers, they do not stick well to your lashes. The fibers in Love Alpha are also very hard and bristle-like. I had gotten one in my eye, and it felt like a wood chip.) Younique offers the ORIGINAL 3D fiberlash mascara. It increases your lashes by 300% in fullness and length. The process is simple, and it is truly a false lash alternative. If you would like to purchase yours, you can follow my website www.lashdollhouse.com . I donate 3% of my income to non-profit organizations. Thank you for your support with my small business, and the world.</li>
            <li> so excited for this but after giving it weeks of practice is basically just clumps of black dust bunnie looking things that fall off your eyes and you have to keep constantly wiping off your upper cheeks.</li>
            <li> This is the fake one very disappointed!</li>
            <li> I feel like I got a already used mascara? There was no packaging for me to open or anything. I will be contacting the buyer to see what&#x27;s up with that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what I expected. The  fiber is dried out  and flakes get  into my eyes..</li>
            <li> Def will be buying again!</li>
            <li> Takes a lot of time and effort. I find it to be fun when I&#x27;m bored ... So no complaints here. However.. I rather just wear fake lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for less than a week but I have to stop. After the second day I was trying to think of a way to get my money back. I felt like I had spider legs for eyelashes and they stick together. It&#x27;s so gross. I went to my chiropractor today and had to lay down on a table. Of course I knew I would have to make adjustments when I got up. OMG it was so embarrassing I had to run to the bathroom because all of my lashes were stuck together in like two or three clumps. I looked like I had a disease. It was terrible. I may be sounding dramatic but between the raccoon rings and the fact that I had to buy special make up remover to get the remains off I&#x27;m done. DONE.</li>
            <li> Please only buy from a VERIFIED Younique presenter...that is the only way to ensure that you are getting the TRUE product and an HONEST person on the other end of the transaction.  I am a presenter myself and have been answering questions constantly about the pictures being posted of people with eye infections and eye damage.  I wear contacts and have had the fibers get into my eyes (when I first used them) and yes, it did make my eye tear up, but no actual irritation occurred.  The counterfeit lashes contain FIBERGLASS particles in them which is what is causing corneal abrasions, irritation, etc.  If anyone has any questions or wants to discuss Younique and the quality of the products that TRUE presenters stand by, please feel free to reach out to me.  I am happy to help!&lt;br /&gt;www.biglashlove.com</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this product,.it flakes off and irritates your eyes.</li>
            <li> Really works, but I suck at applying it so it takes me a while to get it right. but practice makes perfect.</li>
            <li> sometimes if you wear it all day its hard for the fibers to come off its like there stuck to your lashes and it sucks and i end up just sleeping in it which im sure is definnitely not good ! but the initial lok is beautiful !</li>
            <li> best mascara I have ever used.  Normally mascara weighs my lashes down and I lose the curl I have from just curling them normally.  I found with Younique 3d lashes I was able to keep the nice curl along with darkening and thickening my lashes.  Love the fibers!</li>
            <li> Flaked all over my face throughout the day. Made my eyes itch. Turned into oozy gunk within a month. Toxic ingredients. Fail.</li>
            <li> Awesome! I didn&#x27;t even apply my own mascara before applying the gel and fibers and it still looks amazing!</li>
            <li> I do not like this product at all. Heard great things about it. I applied it according to the directions and it clumps alot.  But the worst part is that it seems to take some of my own eyelashes with it when i remove it with my neutrogena eye makeup remover.  So i stopped using it after only 4-5 days of use. A complete waste of money.  Wish i could return it.</li>
            <li> Thought it was mascara.  But you use it over your mascara. Kind of clumps.</li>
            <li> Good mascara for anything but the office look (it looks unnatural and a little clumpy). Love it and will be buying more.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this mascara! Makes my eyes POP!!</li>
            <li> Flaky.  Did not last all day.</li>
            <li> Loved at when I first got the product although found I kept getting fibres in my eyes which would annoy and irritate my eyes to the point it just wasn&#x27;t worth it. Used it the over day and got a fibre stuck in my eye, I left it in there through out the day as I couldn&#x27;t find it in my eye until eventually it comes out later on my eye becomes red, swollen and itchy and had to go to the doctors for eye drops! Would not recommend this product to anyone! I&#x27;ve thrown mine away</li>
            <li> These are fake.. Only buy from a younique presenter. [...]</li>
            <li> I have it average because it does wonders for lashes...but sometimes the tiny fibers some how get in my eye and irritates the hell out of them, esp since I wear contacts. It&#x27;s been hurting all day</li>
            <li> The product is great!!!! No problem with the quality although the merchandise came from China so I am not so sure if this is original or not :( The product arrived after 1 month...</li>
            <li> This mascara did not work at all. The fibers get every where and fall into your eyes. I would never buy it again.</li>
            <li> This was a fake product! It had absolutely NO affect on my lashes. I have used the real product and it&#x27;s awesome and did not come in a package mailed from China. Total fake!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do well with contacts</li>
            <li> Really gave my lashes volume, however I have sensitive eyes and will only use it for special occasions.</li>
            <li> Clumpy&lt;br /&gt;Only use the coating</li>
            <li> Absolutely phenomenal !  Waited many years for this. The difference in lashes is great. Bought another for my youngest daughter.</li>
            <li> Shipping was so fast - so thank you!!  However, after getting the product, I don&#x27;t think it was worth the money.  I watched about 5 tutorials on the product before even buying it - my loreal looks just the same with two coats and I got 3 different co workers to view it.....</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I don&#x27;t wear it everyday but when I do it&#x27;s very easy to apply, no smudgind and comes off easily.  Only problem is I noticed a spot on my left eye where my eye lashes are now gone.  I never had that happen before.  I wonder if it&#x27;s the product or if with repeated action its pulling the lash out?  Not sure.  I&#x27;m going to lower my star rating until further investigation.</li>
            <li> People saying it comes off aren&#x27;t sealing with the gel after applying the fiber.  I LOVE this product, it is easier than false lashes, tickers and cheaper than extensions, and long lasting.  Youtube videos if you need better instructions, it works awesome!!</li>
            <li> Waste of money the fibers fall off through out the day and Your eyes become itchy. For the price u would think it would be a quality product.</li>
            <li> Very nice!!!! Better then false lashes</li>
            <li> My wife absolutely loved this mascara.  Said it was the best she&#x27;s even used.</li>
            <li> Definitely NOT something I&#x27;d buy again.  Lashes look clumpy and unnatural.  I&#x27;ve tried adjusting the way I apply it, but it still has the same effect..thick, clumpy gobs of fibers.  I would stick with the drugstore brand to create more natural looking lashes.</li>
            <li> Great product! I don&#x27;t need fake eyelashes anymore.</li>
            <li> absolutely love them. i had to practice 2 times before getting it right but they fill out my lashes so much i never need more than 2 coats on and will definitely get this product again. I have sensitive eyes and this doesnt bother them in anyway.</li>
            <li> Not sure why there are negative reviews honestly! This product is AMAZING. My eyelashes are so tiny after I use the product I actually look like I have lashes finally....I can&#x27;t help looking at myself in the mirror! I have had issues with clumping on a couple applications but have been able to use a eyelash brush to comb out and have not had any of the fibers fall off. The fibers last all day and look fantastic. As long as you follow directions and apply directly there should be not problems with this product, I would recommend to absolutely everyone I know!</li>
            <li> Beware. Younique is only sold through Younique websites! You may not be getting actual Younique products here. Guaranteed only when purchased from Younique. This is 2nd hand sales as told to me by the seller. They buy it at craft / garage sales, so who knows what formula it is. Risky business for you customers. You deserve to know.</li>
            <li> This is not a Younique presenter!!! Younique only sells these for $29 and it comes with the proper directions ect!!!!! This mascara is amazing if used correctly!!!!</li>
            <li> The product is okay, but doesn&#x27;t look much different from my regular mascara.</li>
            <li> Product was broken when received.</li>
            <li> I was expecting insane results. What I got was the same result as two coats of regular mascara, and incredibly itchy eyes from the fibers. Not impressed.</li>
            <li> DO YOUR RESEARCH PEOPLE! Their fibres are natural but their Transplanting Gel isn&#x27;t! Their product contains Propylene Glycol which has been associated with irritant and allergic contact dermatitis as well as contact urticaria. NOT SUITABLE FOR SENSITIVE EYES!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a comparison photo of Cherry Blooms ALL NATURAL Fibre Lashes and Younique&#x27;s 3D Fibre Lashes. I have better results with CHERRY BLOOMS than I did with Younique. I can&#x27;t believe all these Younique sales people are attacking me saying I didn&#x27;t use Younique! OF COURSE I DID! I DID A COMPARISON PHOTO TO SHOW YOU MY RESULTS! I HAVE SHORT STRAIGHT BABY ASIAN LASHES! YOUNIQUE SUCKS! I&#x27;M SO ANGRY! Not only that, when my Younique Fibre Lashes arrived, I opened it to find the gel had also leaked out of the tube too! The gel is very thick and it&#x27;s very messy! Not impressed with the product or the sales reps.</li>
            <li> Give me drug store brand. This mascara did nothing that it claims. If you&#x27;re older, this is not for you. It&#x27;s heavy and weighed my lashes down and it&#x27;s too thick and clumpy. Into the trash and my money went along with it.</li>
            <li> You can buy this directly from a dealer for $29.00 and have a satisfaction guarantee. Plus the person that is providing this product on here is violating the presenters contract with Younique.</li>
            <li> Since I was a preteen I&#x27;ve wanted longer, fuller lashes. I&#x27;ve tried everything from Maybelline to Dior mascara trying to achieve the lashes I&#x27;ve always longed for. This is honestly the ONLY mascara that has made me happy with the outcome. It&#x27;s as easy as applying normal mascara, though it does take a couple of go rounds to perfect the technique. I took before and after pictures and the results are unbelievable! Truly worth the money! Even my husband noticed how long my lashes were after my first time wearing 3D and he doesn&#x27;t notice anything like that!!! Ladies, you won&#x27;t find a better product AND it&#x27;s ORGANIC! Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Made my eyelashes really love long</li>
            <li> l like it make my lashes fuller what little I have left</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. although it seems to be better from actual company. the mascara I received from actual company was much better quality.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much, now I am a sales rep.</li>
            <li> as long as you put the gel on after the fiber it won&#x27;t flake. if you re-apply with several coats your eyelashes are SUPER LONG. love, love, love this! won&#x27;t ever buy another mascara again.</li>
            <li> Beware that Younique sell via a MLM.  MLM&#x27;s have been described as Pyramid Selling, but including a product.</li>
            <li> This seller is misrepresenting the company. Younique products are not allowed to be sold on websites like Amazon only through the corporate website and presenters like myself. Not only that but they are $29 not $55!!! When you purchase from a presenter, you are helping someone pay their bills as they get paid commission on each and every sale. This person is ripping people off and not to mention when you purchase from this person you are completely voiding the &amp;#34;Love It Guarantee&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> Not really what I thought it would be....have trouble with clumping and flaking.  I have gotten it on my face and it is really hard to remove it.  For the price, am thinking about returning it.</li>
            <li> I got my product through the company so I know it&#x27;s authentic.  That may be why I&#x27;m loving it.  I&#x27;m not really a makeup person, but I sometimes wear mascara and this just adds a lot of length that could never or hasn&#x27;t been achieved with even the best of mascaras.  Since getting this I have been wearing it with mascara daily, cause it&#x27;s just so much fun and I really love the results.  You do use this with your mascara, just in case I wasn&#x27;t clear.  I love Amazon, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this here, as many have said it&#x27;s not a good idea. The actual company behind the product does have a money back guarantee.  Also I&#x27;m not sure why anyone would overpay for a product that may not be authentic, that&#x27;s crazy.</li>
            <li> Love it. Works just as the information says it would . Have recommended it to several people . I think they will be pleased.</li>
            <li> Love love love this mascara!  Several of my friends bought it too and all love it as well! So easy to use!</li>
            <li> I received alot of compliments. I was told my lakes looked like I had lashes applied. I was a little disappointed that the product didn&#x27;t agree with my oily skin. The product ran under my eye a little.</li>
            <li> I love the product because I don&#x27;t have to wear extensions anymore. I will continue buying this product.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> The gel part is dried out. When you finally get the gel on, lashes clump together. Nothing like it was described or the results shown.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and works really well if applied correctly. There are lots of great YouTube videos that show how to do it if you search for &amp;#34;Younique mascara&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Younique fiber lashes&amp;#34; That said, you can buy the product from a presenter or from YouniqueProducts.com for $29 (and get a Love It Guarantee), so I&#x27;m not sure why you&#x27;d buy them from this seller!</li>
            <li> Great product! Souch better than just plain mascara! This had become a vital part of my beauty regiment. Can&#x27;t do without now!</li>
            <li> After first eye application the applicator broke inside tube. Loved the look of the completed eye. Would like to try another and see if I received a defective applicator brush.</li>
            <li> Initially does make lashes look super. However, the fibers get in the eyes and cause irritation even when directions are followed to the T. Waste of money in my opinion. In the trash:(</li>
            <li> I give it a 5 star rating !!! they make my lashes look so full. I would recommend these to anyone that wants fuller lashes!!</li>
            <li> I WOULD ONLY BUY THIS FROM A YOUNIQUE PRESENTER - THIS ITEM COULD BE FAKE.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe I found this, I paid double for iit elsewhere, a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I have never had great lashes until now!  This product made my lashes look amazing.  The more you apply, the longer the lashes!  Would recommend to all you ladies who want long lashes without wearing fake ones! This product delivers!</li>
            <li> This product works great. It is easy to apply and really make your lashes pop according to my wife. Be aware that these are not waterproof and can smear from sweat  or moisture. Overall my wife loves them.</li>
            <li> This is the best product ever!!!! I&#x27;m ordering two more so I don&#x27;t run out. I use it everyday and it makes my eyes pop because it looks like I&#x27;m wearing lashes. Plus my lashes don&#x27;t fall out like they do when you wear false lashes. It TOTALLY goes beyond meeting my expectations!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is so fantastic and is exactly as described.  I totally LOVE it!  It feels so natural like you are not even wearing mascara.  In fact my eyelashes feel healthier.</li>
            <li> Love it and I will be ordering it again!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. Made my lashes look like I had false lashes on. I will always keep my makeup kit stocked with this item.</li>
            <li> You can buy this cheaper through Younique&#x27;s website for $29. It will come with their Love It Guarantee as well. If you spend $100 or more, you will also get FREE expedited shipping. To learn more, go to BeYourGorgeousSelf dot com.</li>
            <li> Great and easy to use!</li>
            <li> Now my lashes look full and super long!</li>
            <li> not a difference really from regular mascara, just more things to do..</li>
            <li> I bought this from an actual consultant and still not really sold. It does not really do much more than any other decent mascara. I put it on exactly like the instructions said and still ended up with clumping. Then when you try to brush out the clumps all the &amp;#34;fibers&amp;#34; are removed and.. it looks just a little better regular drugstore mascara. It could just be that my lashes are too thick, or my eyes are the wrong shape or? Whatever it is, it&#x27;s not worth 35$. Also the application process is too time consuming (at least 3X the amount of normal mascara). Some people do love this, but I don&#x27;t. I would have given the overall finish a 4 star if not for the price and the annoying application process.</li>
            <li> This a great product especially if you have a wedding or something important that you want to look your best at! This really works wonders!</li>
            <li> I already have long eyelashes but I thought I&#x27;d give these a try. These made my eyelashes look clumpy. I followed the directions to a tee. By the end of the day, the fibers were on my cheekbones. They fall off during the day. They also get into my eye and makes my eyes irritated. I will stick with drug store mascara. Maybelline is the best!!!</li>
            <li> bought thru recommendation from my daughter.  worked wonders on her.  will be utilizing it soon can&#x27;t wait to see the results on me</li>
            <li> I have never had lashes like I do with this product. I have tried a lot of mascaras and with this one I had instant beautiful results. I will never buy anything else. This is really awesome mascara!!</li>
            <li> RIP OFF. Not actually Younique either that or whoever is selling this is selling OLD OLD BAD product giving Younique a bad name as well as image. Younique makeup is Chemical free, Carcinogin Free, Paraben Free, Cruelty Free, Gluten Free, Hypoallergenic, Organic and just all around amazing so be sure you are ordering the correct item.  Get your real 3D Fiber Lashes actually from Younique and an actual Presenter go to [...]</li>
            <li> Definitely took me a couple of trial runs with this mascara. Had to experiment a few times before I thought it looked okay. In the end what worked best for me was to curl my eyelashes, generously, I mean put on as much gel mascara as you would like on, and then with the fibers only do a couple of light swipes at the root of my eyelashes. The fibers fall off and make a mess all over your face and can make your eyelashes look clumpy and all &amp;#34;spidery&amp;#34;. The gel mascara also smells a little off at some points but nothing too strong. The product is super easy to wash off - Sometimes I won&#x27;t have to use makeup remover after getting out of the shower and surprisingly stays on pretty well - slept with it on and still noticeably had curled eyelashes with no smudges. Overall I&#x27;m a little disappointed but it&#x27;s an okay mascara!</li>
            <li> I am extremely picky when it comes to mascara. I also do not write reviews on products either. However, I am making an exception with this product.  This is THE best mascara I have EVER used. If you follow the instructions, the fibers will not fall on your cheeks, and you truly do get thick and fabulous lashes. Well done, Younique!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and tried it expecting great results, but there were several disappointments that I experienced with this product. First, the product requires you to use your own mascara and apply it first, not included in the $39 price. Second, the transplanting gel which is black, smudges easily. Third, I found that the fibers scratched my eyes. I would not recommend this product to anyone! Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> I am a Younique presenter and only became one because I love these lashes so much (as well as the other Younique products). Only Independent Presenters are supposed to sell this, as it is our business and supports our families. This product is amazing and makes my eyes pop. Find a presenter instead of buying here because then you get the terrific return policy and the Love It Guarantee!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!! I purchased this product from a friend who&#x27;s sister in law is a Younique Rep and I was originally excited to try this product out for myself since I use Too Faced brand Better then Flash Lashes which uses the white fibers....this is no different from Too Faced with the exception of black fibers vs white fibers, the 3d Fiber Lashes and the way it clumped and at the end of the day and made my eyes look awful!! All my lashes were clumped together and nasty!! Couldn&#x27;t wait to get home and wash my face so I ended up washing my face in the bathroom at the restaurant we were having dinner at and had to redo my entire face there with just my regular mascara in my purse. my eyes looked better using Too Faced then Younique!! Clumpy, lashes sticking together, leaky gel, and having to go thru a Rep and waiting for your product to come in verses going to Ulta and having my purchase right away, not buying 3d again...offered it free to my niece, my daughter, &amp; a neighbor and nobody wanted it! $30 waste of money. DON&#x27;T BUY THIS PRODUCT. Reps swear buy this product because they want to make a SALE so that they can get PAID! It&#x27;s a crappy product! I use Too Faced, yes the fibers are white, no it doesn&#x27;t clump because I don&#x27;t pile on 5-6 coats on like some UTube videos show. &amp; I have never had to wash my face at dinner in the bathroom of the restaurant till I used Younique 3d Fiber Lashes!!  Am I mad and upset with this product?? YES!!!! Don&#x27;t  purchase this product unless you don&#x27;t care about wasting $30.</li>
            <li> My pruduct was not good.  The first time I inserted the WANs with the fibers in the container, the wind curled up and would not early go into the tube.  Every time if pulled out the want, clumps do the fibers came out.  I used the product 3 times until the curled applicator would not work,  would not buy product again.</li>
            <li> dries out thru day get&#x27;s flakey</li>
            <li> Looooove this product does as said.&lt;br /&gt;Must have.</li>
            <li> A friend referred me to this product. It is everything both she &amp; the product advertised. Have referred to friends &amp; they also are ordering. Makes your lashes very full. Love it!</li>
            <li> Received item very quickly, and I am very happy with product.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!!! It took only two tries for me to get it right, but the end results are beautiful!!!</li>
            <li> This mascara really os fantastic! Gives full beautiful lashes. Just be diligent in watching for the dark circles/residual under your eye and be prepared to spend a minute here and there in the mirror getting fibers out of your eye. For special occasions it&#x27;s totally worth it but I do not wear everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the craze is all about with this stuff. After many friends trying to push it at me, I decided to give it a try, against my better judgement more or less.  So I purchased it through a friend off the companies website. Weeks went by while it sat here, in its cute little case, similar to the one you&#x27;d carry your sunglasses in. One Sunday, with nowhere to go and nothing to do, my husband took the kids out, left me all alone with some peace and quiet and I decided to give them a try. Once again, I was very hesitant. I mean, I have nice semi long lashes to begin with, but with my fair skin, even though I have dark brown hair, my lashes are quite light so you would never know until I put mascara on. I followed the directions to a &amp;#34;T&amp;#34;. Have you ever seen a girl or should I say lady, that looked like she put 20 coats of mascara on? Just all caked on all over her lashes all nasty looking? Well, that&#x27;s how I looked with just one coat of this stuff. My husband came home and walked in asking wth happened to my eyes. How embarrassing. I should have known better, even the photos the gals looked like they had too much mascara on. Not to mention, those tiny little fibers you put on all into your eyes and hurt, no matter how hard you try not to. I even used my little lash brush to try and brush them out. It was just so nasty. Just looking at my husband I can see the stuff caked around my eyes like something was stuck on my lashes, you know, that annoying feeling like lint is on your lashes? Yeah, like that! Do not waste your money on this stuff. You are better off using latisse, or the generic stuff, strip lashes or even the lash extensions, which maintenance wise is only about $40 every 3 weeks. Same as getting your nails done ladies. This is not cute, you&#x27;re not rockin it. It&#x27;s pure nastiness of gunk around your eyes and I&#x27;m one that will not leave the house without her make up on, call me vain, don&#x27;t care.  I&#x27;m also one that will tell her friends when something is cute and not cute and ladies, this is not cute!ething is cute and not cute and ladies, this is not cute!</li>
            <li> Definitely makes your lashes thicker and longer but crumbles onto your face all day long. Not for me</li>
            <li> I love it!  I will now be a steady customer.  I tried to go without it one day and my natural ones do not seem natural anymore.  The Younique set is a must have. My eye lashes have never looked better and the best part is they look real and soooo much longer than using mascara.  Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, amazing product!</li>
            <li> Hard to use and flakes off &amp; gets in my eyes.</li>
            <li> The fibers did make my lashes fuller but didn&#x27;t see any cbange in length.  Fibers at the end of the day did bother my contacts.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to see these at a bridal show this past weekend but was disappointed from the start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive eyes - beware! My eyes were red and itchy after the first application. I just thought something so expensive would have been better quality.</li>
            <li> Follow the directions. I love this best mascara I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> Works just like it says.  Makes my eyelashes much longer!  Love it.</li>

            <li> I really liked it and it works just didn&#x27;t like that the fibers get in to my eyes n it hurts all day</li>
            <li> Difficult to make it look good.  It takes a long time and is messy.</li>
            <li> Cannot believe how great it is for one who has so few lashes.</li>
            <li> This is okay if you are not attempting the natural look, BUT in addition to my lashes looking horribly clumpy they broke them down like crazy! I spent a good chunk of money growing them with LiLash and after wearing this maybe three times I noticed my lashes were severely damaged. I ave not used it since and have returned to good ole fashioned Loreal Voluminous until I have the same length back. If you look at the demo of the lady who runs the company putting this on, on YouTube, you will notice that she wears an UNGODLY amount of makeup. So the look might blend in with a great deal of eyeshadow, but not day-to-day. Not my fave. I do like Bourjouis&#x27; Coup De Theatere is a great alternative and moisturizes your lashes more...</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair lashes this product is definitely not worth your money! There&#x27;s only one mascara that can hold my lashes in a curl. I was assured that this would hold. My lashes went completely flat and clumpy within the hour. So those who have lashes like me don&#x27;t waste your pennies!!!</li>
            <li> Everything it claims!</li>
            <li> Im sooon over people gushing over this &amp;#34;over priced&amp;#34;Youngwhatever ...first theres tooo many  .  Steps! And you gotta even apply your own Mascara first ??  I bought some not from a pushy dealer but over eBay! Cheaper! The fibers get in my eyes and I wear contacts! Thats just a mess! Ive used plenty of drug store brands that workn just as well. And omg taking all the layers of mascara,  gel &amp; fibers off Talk about a mess! Gross.. #notaFan</li>
            <li> I bought this from a Younique sales rep and I have to say that I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. It even stayed on after a full 8 hour work day and a 2 hour workout after that! Amazing! Granted a few instances of flaking of the fibers will occur but it beats spending $150 plus at a lash salon. I just rinse out my contacts if some fibers fall in my eye but no smudging for me. Follow the directions to the tee, use a magnifying mirror and voila! Falsie looking lashes. Use light touches. Use one to two layers to avoid the gunky look. I use shu uemura curler then do one eye at a time to ensure that the fibers will stay put. Green tea fibers are natural and made in USA. Washes off easily with dial soap, unlike regular mascaras. That means less tugging around the eyes so fewer wrinkles for your delicate eye skin. The directions says to use your own mascara but I get fab results with using only the bottles included. I highly recommend this to anyone using falsies. I&#x27;ve used glue on falsies for 7 plus years but I am switching over to this falsies in a bottle now. This coming from a gal who absolutely hates mascara and tried everything from drug store mascaras to Dior mascaras. Ok that is saying a lot. Oh one more thing-Find a Younique seller in your area and buy it for $30 and with the satisfaction guarantee.</li>
            <li> Wow, is all I can say.  I got this 3D Fiber Mascara for Mother&#x27;s Day!  I Love mascara&#x27;s and I have tried so many it&#x27;s not even funny.  I applied it as soon as I opened it up...Before my eyes, my lashes were growing in front of me.  I could hardly believe it.  I normally have short, blonde, wimpy, sparse lashes, but no more.  I love this 3D Fiber Mascara.  I paid months for expensive lash extensions, until my lashes started falling out, then the glues from falsies bothered my eyes, plus my eye lids always felt weighted down wearing falsies.  I knew as soon as I used this mascara the first time, all ladies would want it!  I have since had several family and friends try it as well at my home, and they are blown away how it just pops their eyes open. And they all place an order right then at [...]  All you can do is try it, if you don&#x27;t love it, with this mascara there is a 14 day return policy.  I have sensitive eyes, its great for contact lens wearers, it is hypoallergenic, it&#x27;s sweat proof, water resistant, smudge proof and lasts all day long!!!  I have always used make up remover pads and it removes easily with pads, some use face wash/soap/water.  Try it, and what I like best, you order today, and you will receive in 3-4 days via the mail.  It truly is the best mascara I have ever used, I am being sincere!  It works!!! I ordered mine from [...] for $29 mine has lasted 3 1/2 months...if you apply it correctly it won&#x27;t flake off...always apply the gel, fibers then the gel to seal the fibers, and apply a second coat, depending upon the look and length you want. I have heard many say the Younique 3D Fiber Mascara that is sold on Amazon is a knock off, so beware..to get the real deal like I did and to only pay $29 I ordered mine from [...]</li>
            <li> the little fibers irritate my eyes :(  but it sure adds length and volume to my lashes :)</li>
            <li> As a Younique presenter, you ARE NOT ALLOWED TO SELL ONLINE! Please be aware of this in your presenter agreement.  Compliance department.</li>
            <li> younique  Moodstruck is easy to apply and does really enhance the fullness of your eyelashes. I would purchase it again. I have had many compliments on the length of my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> Amazing results!&lt;br /&gt;The package arrived really quickly!&lt;br /&gt;Very happy!</li>
            <li> Even after following the directions of applying the 3D fiber mascara, I would end up with the finders falling into my eyes and on my cheeks. My eyes would bother me until I washed the fiber mascara off. I&#x27;ve heard feedback from several woman who have had this same problem with the 3D fiber mascara. I&#x27;ve found other mascara products.without fibers in them that works just as good and do not irritate your eyes.</li>
            <li> I have been fighting straight, straggly eyelashes my whole life and this is the 1st product that ever lived up to it&#x27;s promises.  I am absolutely amazed at the results! No more fake eyelashes glued to this girl&#x27;s eyelids anymore!  The process does take a couple extra minutes compared to just mascara but faster than putting on fake lashes and they look so much better!  Whatever is in the gel also helps keep my lashes curled (I use a heated up curler first) and I have thick, long, flashy, beautiful eyelashes with this product.  I do not work for them or have anything to gain from this review.  It&#x27;s just coming from someone who has spent hours and $$ looking for an answer and I found it.  Watch out for counterfeiters and make sure you are buying from a reputable seller.  WONDERFUL product!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty darn good but not worth the price on top of a mascara. If it was including a really good mascara it would be a 5 star.</li>
            <li> I love this product because I don&#x27;t have to spend a lot of money on fake lashes and sit or lay somewhere for an hour to have the so call permanent lashes put on.  Besides, permanent lashes removes your real lashes after time. I know from experience. My girlfriends also love the moodstruck 3d fiber lashes. I give it out as birthday presents.</li>
            <li> The only way you can be assured that your 3D fiberlashs are not fake, is buy ordering directly through a Younique Presenter. As presenters, we are not allowed to sell on Amazon or Ebay...So buyer beware</li>
            <li> This is not sold from Younique. You can only order from a presenter. Save yourself an eye infection and buy from a presenter. Like myself</li>
            <li> It works good to a point! The instructions say to have a layer of mascara dry onto your lashes before starting with the product! That makes the lashes look clumpy. I also recommend to just apply the product to the tips to get maximum length and less clumps! I thought this product would make my lashes look like false lashes, not so much! But it is still a great product!</li>
            <li> This seller has disabled editing posts so I couldn&#x27;t update my review from October so I&#x27;m re-posting it to warn everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received this in 4 business days and it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted! Used it today for the first time and have gotten so many compliments on my lashes! Definitely lengthens and thickens my already nice, blonde lashes. I think I&#x27;ll be buying this mascara for life, so much easier than false lashes and it looks almost the same! Every girl should have this in their Makeup Arsenal! I am a little irritated that I paid $28 +$5 s&amp;h last week and this week it&#x27;s only $21. That&#x27;s the only reason I gave it 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT UPDATE 12/12/14:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for over a month, my eyelashes have shortened, thinned out and the actual eyelash itself is no longer thick. I used to have nice eyelashes before using this product and this is the only new product I&#x27;ve used in the last month. I&#x27;m assuming I received a fake one, but no longer have the packaging and cannot tell from the foil imprint in the case to confirm. I&#x27;ve returned this item for a refund. I suggest you do the same before it&#x27;s too late. I will be contacting a Younique Rep in my area as I do LOVE this product but it definitely needs to be authentic or you&#x27;ll be wearing full falsies.</li>
            <li> Looks better than most mascaras--but the gel has an ingredient in it that I read is know to burn and itch, which it did all day long.  Plus had a bit of flaking and running throughout the day.  Not worth $30.  Wear falsies if you need some glamour.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product!!  When I apply it you would think I am wearing false lashes.  My lashes look so full, long and lush!!</li>
            <li> Love the way they make my natural lashes look, without the damage of putting individual lashes on!!!</li>
            <li> Was a great buy, got here fast and exactly what I had expected.</li>
            <li> Really like this mascara!! Make lashes so long!</li>
            <li> The mascara may be nice...never tried it due to the fact that the one to try here at the fair is one that everyone here at this fair has tried. I find it very gross that everyone uses the same brushes and wands to try their makeup.  I am completely turned off from this company since they are not sanitary at all. Yuck!!!!  I was taught to never share eye or lip makeup.</li>
            <li> Love love love love love! I was really hesitant to pay nearly 30 for mascara when you could buy 6 tubes of regular mascara for that price....however this mascara is unlike any other and is worth every penny! I have naturally long lashes, and this mascara helps to not only lengthen them, but thicken them as well. I use it daily and apply extra coats for special events for an extra pop! The shipping waa extremely fast and it came in a protective package! This mascara is second to none and I will never use a different type ever again!</li>
            <li> This is the real product. Following the directions exactly, it works amazingly! Apply your regular mascara and let dry. Then, do one eye at a time with the Younique. Below, on the right, is just my CG Bombshell. On the left, the Younique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This price is high. I just re-bought it for $10 less and free shipping.</li>
            <li> This is a fake replica of Younique&#x27;s mascara. No wonder eyelashes fall out! This stuff is no good and is a knock off!</li>
            <li> not what I expected, will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> This mascara absolutely sucks!!! Don&#x27;t waste your money! I got this product today from a Younique presenter as part of a payment she owed me for something I was selling to her. I&#x27;ve heard about the mascara and was interested in it and when she offered this a a form of payment to me, I thought what the heck! Why not!? I love makeup and I&#x27;m always trying out new products so I was excited. When I got home I washed my face bc I couldn&#x27;t wait to apply it. I didnt have any problems applying the mascara but while I was putting it on I honestly didn&#x27;t think it looked great. It was extremely clumpy. Not smooth. Flaky looking. I thought I&#x27;d give it a better try in the morning and spend a little extra time on it. Within 5 minutes my eyelids started burning andfeeling very itchy..The longer I sat the worse it started to get!!! I went and washed it off but my eyes are still burning badly!! Also now my face is getting itchy!!! I have never had any sort of reaction to any makeup.EVER!! THIS stuff is absolute crap. I wish she&#x27;d have just paid me bc I&#x27;ll never put this garbage on my face again. Y&#x27;all beware!! I give it a big 0</li>
            <li> I love it and it makes a big difference in length of lashes</li>
            <li> Made my lashes look much thicker only drawback was it was hard to keep it from making my lashes look clumpy</li>
            <li> Honestly?  A good fiber mascara from Loreal is just as good.  Also, you shouldn&#x27;t walk around with a face full of massive monster lashes either.  You have to try and hold yourself back from going too far with this stuff.  When you walk into a room or take a photo, the first thing seen shouldn&#x27;t be lashes up to your forehead.  I have long eyelashes anyways, so after experimenting, this stuff looks much better when you add the fibers to the outer corner of top lashes only and leave the center and inner half normal mascara only (A Marilyn Monroe look).  Looks great and much better than \\&quot;spider leg\\&quot; eyes.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product, everyone thought I was wearing false eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;The results you get with this are amazing.</li>
            <li> would be a good product if it didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> I love this product...thanks for making it lol....fast shipping too will purchase again :)</li>
            <li> I bought this product on ebay for a cheaper price. I&#x27;ve used the off brand mascara, Love Alpha. I must say, I am in LOVVVVVE!! I could tell a difference in this and the generic brand, looks wise and the way they affected my eyes. This gel does not irritate my eyes, nor do the fibers when they get on my pupil. The fibers are high in quantity and the gel is nice and slick. Just applying the gel, it emphasized my lashes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I did:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applied Maybelline clear mascara&lt;br /&gt;Applied the gel all over my top lashes, from the inner to outer&lt;br /&gt;Applied the fibers all over&lt;br /&gt;Repeated on second eye before I sealed the first eye - this is so the fibers have time to dry to the gel for a bit&lt;br /&gt;Then I sealed and reapplied the fibers, and repeated on second eye&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only did two layers because I was going to the dentist office. I didn&#x27;t get any fibers in my eye during application, and they didn&#x27;t fall off through out the day. I removed the excess fibers on my lid with an alcohol q-tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I accidentally got my lashes wet when I decided to wash my face - I wanted to go to sleep with them to see if they would last - which they did. The mascara neatly clumped together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(In the photo, you can&#x27;t tell that I put on three layers. It shows more in person!)</li>
            <li> I like it. It definitely gives that bold effect. You have to be very careful how you put it on like most mascaras it gets clumpy if you don&#x27;t take you time and its a bit stubborn to come off.</li>
            <li> I do not use it every day, but it does make a difference in the appearance of your lashes.  Very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I love it works just as it says it would very happy I got it</li>
            <li> Too much fall out on your face</li>
            <li> Worst product ever....Looked like I had been swimming by the end of the day when it was hot outside it was all under my eyes!! I tried all of the items that were mentioned gel on coat it fibers more gel....HOLY CRAP!! I was starting to look like Tammy Faye Bakker!! I think this stuff is over priced and you can get better results from just a good primer and Maybelline!!...PS Maybelline is $5 and did you know that many Hollywood makeup artist swear  by it!!!  SAVE YOUR MONEY!!....The company did have great communication and did refund my money.  Thank you to them for being a stand up company ;)</li>
            <li> These definately live up to all the hype.  Lengthen and thicken lashes and easy to apply!</li>
            <li> If you are usually a mascara-and-go person, you will no longer be after using this mascara. While it looks nice if you spend 30 minutes combing the clumps out of your lashes and reapplying multiple times, it&#x27;s not worth the time or money. The problem with combing the clumps out of your lashes is that the comb pulls out the fibers, making your lashes &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; looking again. Save yourself some time and cash by layering your own mascara.</li>
            <li> Practice, practice, practice! Takes time to get used to but worth it. My lashes are fuller and longer!</li>
            <li> Arrived in good condition.  When applied it was flaky and clumpy.  Not best for those with sensitive eyes.  Took too much time to apply for results, might as well get good mascara or eyelash extensions.</li>
            <li> I bought this from a Younique rep and absolutely loved it the first time I used it. The next two times, the gel mascara was really clumped and messy and made my eyelashes look like spider legs. I&#x27;ll try using it a few more times but I&#x27;m disappointed and unimpressed. The gel mascara also burns the crap out of my eyes. This along with the clumped, spider leg looking lashes leaves me disappointed.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Extremely satisfied. I use it every day!</li>
            <li> Best mascara ever!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great concept but they can look clumpy. During the day I find fibers all over my face, which is embarrassing.</li>
            <li> Product is exactly what it claims it is and does</li>
            <li> I bought for my wife and she absolutely loves this.&lt;br /&gt;Coming from a woman in the beauty business this is a huge compliment.</li>
            <li> Great product my lashes look visibly longer and fuller</li>
            <li> I love this stuff !! My eyes look amazing I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This a great product, sold for only 29.00 on Younique (or any independent sellers&#x27;) webpage. After tax and shipping it only comes to 38.00 give or take depending on where you live. :)  This person is selling this product illegitimately, and may or may not be counterfeit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested, or want to verify this information check it out here at:&lt;br /&gt; https://www.youniqueproducts.com/MsWanaNY/products/view/US-1017-00#.U90x2KPQp3s</li>

            <li> I love it. Every one should buy. Number one.</li>
            <li> This mascara is pretty amazing. It does flake a bit and I notice throughout the day of wearing it I&#x27;m having to clean under my eyes. But it does everything it promises.</li>
            <li> Good mascara, dries out quick</li>
            <li> Fibers from the mascara were all under my eyes....it is the worst mascara I have ever used.  It must have been out of date.  Would return if I could.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.. best thing that my sis showed me.. better than wearing false eyelashes!  It comes off super easy with just water!</li>
            <li> I bought this from a distributor and I was really excited to try it because I always use false lashes and wanted something for when I go out and don&#x27;t feel like going through all the trouble. I&#x27;ve used the mascara a few times and I really don&#x27;t like how it looks. Sure, it makes your lashes longer but the tips look funny. Lashes look clumpy and sometimes the tips bend in weird ways. All the pictures I see online for people promoting the mascara are really unattractive to me because they look really fake. I used 2 coats and the fibers would be all under my eyes after a few hours. I&#x27;m a licensed cosmetologist as well as having years of experience as a make up artist and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products. I wouldn&#x27;t spend my money on this again and wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Since the first application I felt in love with this mascara... have very small lashes but once I put younique on wow... I have super long lashes now.... very easy to wash away unlike other brands.. very happy with this product....</li>
            <li> After applying as directed I found the fibers still flaked off onto my face, AND into my eyes. It was an awful painful feeling that lasted for hours. After asking a handful of my friends if they experienced the same issue in which they responded yes to, I will no longer use this product. I do NOT recommend this mascara at all!</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  The fibers do not stick well.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic. I have long lashes but not very full or thick lashes and this changes the game. I am very satisfied with this purchase and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love it. Very impressed</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I am not trying to call out the seller, but I have been doing professional makeup for several years now and I know for a fact from my Younique Representative that they are not allowed to sell from this site or any retail site. Trust me, I have been trying to talk her into selling it at my salon for years! So although I would absolutely recommend this product I really would advise you to go to the website and order direct to ensure the product is real and not expired or damaged. Just a thought :/ here is a link to my rep. [...]. I am sure she will help you answer any questions you may have.</li>
            <li> This mascara is a must have for me. If done correctly the product works as expected. Instructions included which helps.</li>
            <li> I bought this from a Younique rep and love it! It did take me about 3 times before I really got the hang of it and now it&#x27;s easy for me to apply. I have not had any issues with the fibers falling off onto my face during the day and have actually slept in it! By the next morning (8 hors of sleeping)there are a few flakes so I cleaned them up, added some more gel to seal the fibers back in and wore the mascara a whole extra day. I did get a fiber in my eye once, but had no irritation.  Just swiped it out and I was good to go. I love how my eyes look when I wear this stuff and am thrilled with this product! It wears as well as my usual mascara only it makes my lashes amazing. I love it!</li>
            <li> It flakes off throughout the day and it gets in your eyes and It hurts alot.&lt;br /&gt;I tried coating with the mascara to finish it off so it wont flake off but nothing worked.</li>
            <li> The product came within the time said. However, the product itself is not worth it to me. It most definitely does not look like falsies. I put it on one eye with 3 coats. My other eye had 2 coats of my mascara. I took a pic and asked women I know which eye they thought had Younique on, all thought it was the eye with mascara. My eye with mascara looked fuller and darker. The length was the same on both. Also, the eye with Younique had lots of flakes. My eye with mascara had none.</li>
            <li> Not the actual product highly dissapointed do not buy</li>
            <li> I love it, it really makes your eyelashes look longer and fuller.</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to but this stuff is great!</li>
            <li> Great product but be careful using as the fibers can get in your eyes if you are not careful.  I have sparse and short eyelashes and it looks like I have on false eyelashes when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really noticed any benefit, it can  be very flakey.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t thrilled&lt;br /&gt;I had tried some a friend had and liked it&lt;br /&gt;I feel the set I got was old or something&lt;br /&gt;The fibers were really dry and flaky and I had to watch a you tube video to apply it because it came with no directions at all&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed :(</li>
            <li> I think there is a lot of positive reviews, but my experience was not good. It seemed to be dried out. So might just have been the one I received. I got my money back and shipped back so all is well. Ill just stick to mascara for now. ;)</li>
            <li> It was exactally what I ordered. Works exactally like I expected. I will purchase this product again in the future.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in both the shipping time and the actual quality of the mascara.  The shipping was free so I really can&#x27;t complain too much about the shipping time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read several &amp;#34;How To&amp;#34; articles on applying this mascara correctly.  I also watched videos on applying it correctly for the desired look.  When I received my 3D Fiber Mascara I was anxious to try and did exactly as instructed.  Though it did seem to make my lashes a bit longer, the flaking of the fibers was a problem.  I wear contacts and the fiber flakes did get into my eyes.  Since my initial application I have worn this mascara several times.  It does make your lashes appear a tiny bit longer and thicker, but the flaking of the fibers and the price of the mascara are big negatives.  I won&#x27;t be purchasing this mascara again.  It is easily removed with my regular eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product!</li>
            <li> The results are real and the effects are amazing!</li>
            <li> I got these and the first 2 times I used it, it worked great however every time I tried to apply it after those 2 times by gel wand became clumpy and the fibers only stuck to the gel wand and not my eye lashes. My younique representative sent me a new tube of the gel and after the first time I applied it the mascara just became very clumpy on my eye lashes and left little fuzzes on the tips of my lashes. I wont be buying this again. Maybelline great lash works better than this!</li>
            <li> Stick to the mascara with dual ends, this stuff flakes in your eyes and gets on your face. Not worth the $</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve heard the hype...and it&#x27;s TRUE!!!  I have virtually NO eyelashes and have tried so many different mascaras (wasted money). But this is the REAL DEAL!!! You will feel like you are wearing false eyelashes!! Two easy steps and POW.....your eyes are transformed! I recommend Younique&#x27;s eyeliner as well, as it doesn&#x27;t run!!</li>
            <li> I found this clumps and gives me panda eyes after a couple of hours. Definitely not worth the price tag. Lovely packaging though!</li>
            <li> The product seems like it&#x27;s old and dried out.  The gel doesn&#x27;t really apply anything and when I use the fiber wand, it gets fibers all over my face.  I&#x27;m disappointed.  It also doesn&#x27;t increase the length of my lashes.  I&#x27;ve tried this product before and was impressed but the one I received isn&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li> The fibers are great, better than most but the mascara/glue dries out too quickly...when you first get it though it&#x27;s nice and many compliments</li>
            <li> This mascara actually delivers everything it says it will. Love this product.</li>
            <li> I am a younique presenter and you do not need to use another mascara for this. Just the tansplanting gel is fine. Also, A LOT of the 3D fiber lash mascaras on here arent real. I have never had a customer complain about the mascara and I myself never have any trouble. Make sure youre doing the steps correctly and actually buying the correct mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why people are saying this product doesn&#x27;t work. I LOVE it!!! I got suckered into buying this from my sister in law who was having a younique party. I was horrified when I saw the price but I was thinking ok, just buy them and if you hate them call it a loss. Well, my mascara arrived last week, I&#x27;ve used the product everyday ( mascara is the one product I use everyday) and haven&#x27;t had any issues. The fibers do not fall on my face and all I use is a Neutrogena make up remover cloth and it comes right off. I am very sensitive and have not had any issues as of yet. I will absolutely spend the $29!!</li>
            <li> Product burned and created rash and then eye lashes fell out.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. I bought the real mascara from a seller, and at first my lashes looked fuller... for about 5 minutes. So I kept applying more coats and it didn&#x27;t do a thing. My lashes look exactly the same as if I put on my normal mascara. Was not any longer, fuller, nothing. Waste of money, in my opinion. I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
            <li> was very disappointed  in this was dried out didn&#x27;t send  it back because I figures it would cost as much  to do that it was waste of money as far as I was concerend</li>
            <li> These lashes are good IF you have the time to properly apply them and separate them. Otherwise it&#x27;s a clumpy mess with black spider leg fibers on your face. If you buy them, do your research. It literally doesn&#x27;t matter if they are the authentic Younique brand or the knock off version, they all come from a factory in China and the ingredients are the same. Having used the authentic Younique brand and the knockoff for comparison, there is literally no difference. None. Don&#x27;t let the makeup cult queens convince you otherwise. I suspect most of the 5 star reviews come from the presenters themselves and not actual customers buying the product.</li>
            <li> So I am somewhat of an eyelash expert due to my lifelong obsession with eyes and eye makeup.  I have been wearing false eyelashes for 15 years, I&#x27;ve had eyelash extensions done at various times throughout the years, I&#x27;ve done the whole Latisse prescription bit, I&#x27;ve used every different type of mascara on the planet...trust me if there&#x27;s an eyelash product or service on the market I&#x27;ve done it!  I even had fake eyelashes on my car, but I digress...So when I kept hearing about this 3D fiber stuff naturally I had to try it. (Side note: I purchased this item from a friend who is Younique dealer, not on Amazon.  So I can assure you that my product was the real deal and not counterfeit.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed all of the instructions exactly as Younique recommends and also tried various tips and tricks found online.  I really wanted to like this product...but my professional eyelash opinion is that I don&#x27;t like it.  The &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; it creates is very messy and spidery.  Not natural or pretty at all.  But the worst part is how it flakes off!! It flakes off constantly, while applying AND while wearing.  This stuff has to be the LEAST waterproof substance on earth so please don&#x27;t even think about having watery eyes or God forbid crying while wearing it...what a disaster.</li>
            <li> I feel like some of the reviews are made by people who don&#x27;t know how to use the product. I love it and it doesn&#x27;t clump my eyelashes together at all</li>
            <li> Big waste of money..Does not extend eyelashes as advertised and the fibers fall onto your face during the day..I was constantly wiping them away. DO NOT recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product and am not too happy with it. As i am applying the fibers they are clumping up and flaky. They just don&#x27;t look natural and my lashes look like spider legs...I have also noticed breakage with my real lashes not sure if this is from this product. Is there anyone else experiencing the same?</li>
            <li> Does it do what it says it&#x27;s supposed to? yes. Is it worth $29? I personally don&#x27;t think so. It&#x27;s definitely better than any of the drug store brands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good stuff! Lol just be careful it gets in it eyes sometimes and if u put too much on it clumps but other than that pretty cool</li>
            <li> This is fake.Not the real Younique 3D Mascara. And I broke out around my eyes after the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li> This product contains collagen. Do you know where that comes from???  Animals. Do your homework. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Fabulous, it is as it describes. My lashes look fuller. I just can&#x27;t use too much of it. It tends to clump and I get extra lashes that tends to fall off into my eye. It saves me a lot of money at purchasing false lashes and having to apply them and remove them many times. With this product I may get away with it a second day.</li>
            <li> i got this because of all the 5 star reviews. well I got it and tried it I was amazed! well after 1 coat my eyelashes was huge! and at night I washed it off with warm water and baby shampoo where its gentle and wouldn&#x27;t be rough on my eyes. well after a week my natural eyelashes started getting less thick and started falling out. I had naturally long eyelashes. So 2 days ago I quit them because my eyelashes was almost completely gone. so I am having to use Vaseline and biotin to get them to grow back. I was so mad! So I absolutely don&#x27;t recommend this product. I haven&#x27;t seen anyone else have this problem. my eyelashes wasn&#x27;t brittle and thin at all before. When I took off the mascara I was really gentle. So everyone beware. I talked to a representator of the mascara and she was really rude and tried to make me out as stupid. she it was just the fibers coming off. I know what the fibers look like. my eyelashes got thinner each time I used it.. So  I&#x27;m just warning  yall I wish I had a warning because now I have no eyelashes hardly at all.</li>
            <li> Buyers beware!!  I am a Younique presenter. I can tell you from the pictures of this product, this is a counterfeit and is not made by Younique. Younique products are made from natural ingredients. These are most likely not what they state they are. Buy from the company, it is against Younique regulations to sell in a retail environment.[...]</li>
            <li> Well, this mascara definitely makes my lashes look thicker and longer.  When I can get it on without too many clumps, it looks great!  Most days, it is very clumpy.  I&#x27;ve tried using one thicker coat and I&#x27;ve also tried using two lighter coats.  There&#x27;s not much difference - it&#x27;s clumpy.  My lashes definitely look neater and better defined with just plain mascara (although I do use a good brand - Lancôme Definicils), but for thicker lashes with more volume, this mascara does the trick.  Personally, I really hate the clumpy looking lashes because it looks like I used a cheap drugstore mascara. :(</li>
            <li> Too clumpy will just stick regular mascara!</li>
            <li> Omg ! Where has this mascara  been all my life . If you love long full lashes this is a must buy</li>
            <li> Very good no fibre in eyes</li>
            <li> It was broken.  I couldn&#x27;t use it and can&#x27;t return it because it was opened.</li>
            <li> The set I received looks like it&#x27;s been used before.  The fiber container has what looks like a sticker that has been ripped off but not completely, leaving a white residue.  I am returning it tomorrow to get my money back.  I guess I&#x27;ll have to buy from the company itself to be sure to not get a recycled set.  :(</li>
            <li> you will not believe the length of your lashes. I am 67 and my lashes are sparse and short. I started using this product and people now comment on my long lashes.  This is for real! you need to try this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the way it makes my tiny, blonde eye lashes look, but omg, it irritates my eyes. I haven&#x27;t worn it on a day where it didn&#x27;t get in my eyes, no matter how careful I am. It gets in my eyes or all over my face and its annoying. It&#x27;s awesome looking and I know they say beauty is pain, but it&#x27;s not worth the eye doctor bill I had to pay when a fiber scratched my eye... I gave it away and I went back to the pink and green tube I&#x27;ve always used.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING!  A friend introduced me to it and now I tell everyone about it.  Everyone I show this too is blown away at how long your lashes look.  I think it is most dramatic on the bottom lashes.</li>
            <li> This mascara system is fantastic. It is like wearing false eyelashes every day, without any hassle at all. And although it is easy to remove (I use baby oil) - the staying power is excellent. If you have fine skimpy lashes, the transformation is amazing.</li>
            <li> it was ok.  not as good as the one i bought from a Younique distributor.  the fibers would be in my eyes, the mascara wand was kind of dry and it just wasn&#x27;t as good as my original. sometimes it&#x27;s a lucky shot to get something at a lower price, but not in this case.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t understand the hype. I did one side with 3d and other side with just mascara. No difference at all. I just spent $29 for nothing. Very disappointed and can&#x27;t understand any of the good reviews.</li>
            <li> It really did what it said it would do!! But sadly it irritates my eyes. Try it though! You will love what it does to your lashes!</li>
            <li> It does make your eyelashes fuller but if you put too much it looks fake and not a good fake.  Also, the fibers will fall off at first so you have to be sure to wipe them away.  They can be irritating to the eyes but not too bad.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Wear it all the time! Shipping was very fast as well.</li>
            <li> Excellent service. Excellent price. Will be reordering</li>
            <li> It makes your own lashes come off. When it is time to remove the makeup off</li>
            <li> I loved this product!  I put in on Andy lashes looked fabulous, then I came home and used eye makeup remover and my normal face wash and after I was done, my natural lashes were half their size.  They were literally broken in half!  I will never use again!!!!</li>
            <li> I have definitely come to love this mascara. I do have to note that I naturally have long eyelashes. It isn&#x27;t a huge difference but I put it on the outside corners and it makes them look thicker and longer.</li>
            <li> I just tried this for the first time... One word,  WOW!!!!  As you can see from the picture the difference is astounding!!  That&#x27;s just one coat,  just testing it out. I&#x27;ve tried ALOT of other lash extending products,  but this is the best,  hands down!!!  Worth the money!</li>
            <li> Love this fiber mascara.  Knock offs are not as good.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are TOO long if I use more than 1 coat! This mascara is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Tried this from a friend and ordered my own.</li>
            <li> The fibers kept falling off on top of my cheeks and made me look like I just got back from coal mining. Not happy with this item.</li>
            <li> I am so upset!  After using this product only three times I literally almost have no eyelashes left!!!  I bought it from a younique distributor so it is absolutely not fake!  The product worked well and made my eyelashes look great, however, now I have almost no lashes.  I am beyond upset by this!  I contacted the company and am waiting to hear back.</li>
            <li> With practice and a steady hand, it&#x27;s a good product. I would not recommend it to the low matanence &amp;#34;in a hurry&amp;#34; type. It&#x27;s takes time to keep your eyelashes from looking like Tarantula legs.</li>
            <li> Best thing ever for eyelashes.  My daughter found this product and introduced it to my wife.  My wife LOVES this 3d fiber lash maskera.  My wife has very short eyelashes and has complained for over 30 years about how none of the advertised products for lengthening eyelashes really work.  This one though, really does work.  She is so happy to have longer, visible eyelashes now. I bought her, my daughter and my mother-in-law one for Christmas.  This product works!</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT YOUNIQUE ITS FAKE!</li>
            <li> 100% True. This Mascara is wonderfull!</li>
            <li> Love this mascara. Really a nice surprise.</li>
            <li> Wonderful I Abe been using it everyday!!!</li>
            <li> Worth it.  My daughter and I will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> The seller mailed this promptly &amp; I had it within a week &amp; 1/2 of purchase. I am a makeup artist but this was my first experience with fiber lashes. A coworker had recommended it so I&#x27;ve been trying it for the last week.  She suggested using a spoolie after application to help seperate the lashes &amp; to keep them from clumping together.  She was absolutely spot on in her recommendation &amp; I definately think the manufacturer should include a separating spoolie in the kit.  Upon initial application I was excited that my lashes did look thicker &amp; possibly longer.  However, as the day progresses the tiny fibers ended up on the skin under and around my eyes requiring me to dust off &amp; brush that area clear several times rather than have those little fibers look like fine lines around the eyes -- definately not a look I was going for.  By the end of a 8 - 9 hour day the mascara is also smudging more than I am comfortable with.  I like to try products on myself prior to use on clients makeup &amp; I&#x27;m glad that I tried this one first for the last several days.  I switched back to my tried &amp; true regular mascara this morning.  I would not feel comfortable using this on clients, especially for print photography work due to the fibers coming off on the surrounding skin.  I also wouldn&#x27;t feel comfortable using this for special events such as weddings or situations that require several hours of wear due to the smudging.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara! Amazing the difference in my lashes!</li>
            <li> This product was awful. It made my lashes clump together and made them look bumpy and weird. The tips of my lashes would not get smooth, they looked like they had lots of split ends. I tried to make this work many different ways and many different times, it always looked clumpy and uneven and bumpy. This works for people with already longer lashes. I&#x27;ve had drugstore brands that worked better than this.</li>
            <li> At first I loved the mascara and was so impressed, after a week or so of using it I noticed my eyelashes were getting thin and falling out, definitely would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> This definitely made my lashes look fantastic, the major drawback is that it tends to flake off and leaves black marks under my eyes within an hour.</li>
            <li> I was extremely excited when i finally recieved this in the mail. I thought this was going to be a life changer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time i wore it, I fell in love!  However, just 2 hours later I noticed i had little black flakes all over my cheeks and undereyes. It ruined the &amp;#34;flawless, natural&amp;#34; look I was going for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it another try a day or two later with only one coat... same thing happened. The results arent worth &amp;#34;falking&amp;#34; lashes.</li>
            <li> Very happy with product, bought three for Christmas gifts and all were thrilled with the product.</li>
            <li> Disappointed... did not work...</li>
            <li> OMG, this product is amazing. This was a gift for my daughter and when she wore it to ball last week her Eyelashes looked Fake, thats how great this works. I&#x27;m going to get her more for her Bday.</li>
            <li> Do not buy from here!!! It is fake!!! Don&#x27;t chance it. I have seen a lot of fakes and the reactions are terrible. If u really want this mascara just buy from the site. U know it&#x27;ll be 100% real. And u won&#x27;t be chancing ur health!!!</li>
            <li> This mascara really does make you lashes seem longer and fuller. It is easy to apply, the only thing I didn&#x27;t care for was sometimes I have loose fibers around my eyes.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. My natural eyelashes are not long in length and are light in color so it&#x27;s hard to tell I have any. This product does wonders. It&#x27;s better than false lashes. I&#x27;m one happy customer.</li>
            <li> PERFECT PRODUCT. FAST SHIPPING. LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t complete when received</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have tiny eyelashes, and what a difference.  I did not have any flakiness like some women here claim to have.  Maybe, they need to apply it better.  It is easy to apply and easy to remove.  I love it so much that I became a distributor.</li>
            <li> I really like how full an long this make my eyelashes. I had to use Latisse to get my lashes long. But with this I won&#x27;t  . The only dislike is that the fibers I find on my cheeks but that being said still so worth the money an how full my lashes are. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Cost more but doesn&#x27;t work any better then the lease expensive brandz on here...  I have ordered this and other brandz and they all work the same!!!</li>
            <li> I love this thing... after putting 3coats on each eye just makes my eyes gorgeously beautiful if you put like 1 coat its the same as putting regular mascara 20 times they&#x27;ll just go down but after 3coats its awesome although you have to plan ahead of time cuase it does take a while but i don&#x27;t really care its cheaper then eye lash extensi&amp;oacute;ns but it defenetly works miracles i get alot of complaments too im pretty pleased</li>
            <li> Ok I know it shows my husbands name on this as the reviewer but I am a lady, I promise. I purchased the Younique Moodstruck 3d fiber lashes at a bridal show this weekend. UGGG! they look cool if you are very gentle with putting them on. Let me explain further. I don&#x27;t like the look of thick goopy lashes, too much is too much. This product can easily look too much. If you are looking to replace these lashes with your fake lashes it might be a good switch. For the natural lash gals I would recommend just boosting your own mascara a few extra times it will look so very much better. I followed the instructions and used the product on one eye then used my regular go to stuff on the other. I found that it looked clumpy and goopy on the one I used younique. I went ahead and did the other eye and found that it looked similar when I applied extra mascara to my other eye. I don&#x27;t think this is a good product and would encourage you to not waste your money on this!</li>
            <li> Did have a lot of fibers coming off.think  maybe  didn&#x27;t  apply correctly. Otherwise all was nice  and I received  right on time very quickly.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good. A little clumpy if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing. Overall definitely puts some weight on your lashes.</li>
            <li> I purchased my 3d fiber lashes through a rep of the company in my area, after watching numerous application videos online by bloggers i was amazed and had to try it... i knew that it would be too good to be true!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On application of the gel, then fibers then gel again the lashes do indeed look longer and fuller, just what i wanted. However, by the time  got to work i was being told it had black fibers under my eyes alllll day long, it drove me mad to keep touching up the rest of my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My rep contacted me to see how much i &#x27;loved&#x27; the product. I told her my issues and she said that many people don&#x27;t apply the second coat of gel after applying fibers and if i do i need to apply more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried various amounts to see how to prevent the issue but to no avail, if i applied any more gel i think ill need assistance in opening my eyes. The idea of the product is brilliant and effective but the wear of the product is flawed.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable mascara/  Not even heavy on your eyes.</li>
            <li> The best mascara I ever had! Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> If you want to spend extra money to just put application over application over application then purchase. Package states best results after applying normal mascara. Seriously?</li>
            <li> Fabulous.  Does what it says it will.  Easy to remove.</li>
            <li> Great product!!  Very fast postage!!  Was a gift and the recipient was overjoyed!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely in love with the 3-D fiber mascara ! I will never go with another mascara ever again ❤️❤️❤️❤️</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because I heard wonderful things about it. Almost all natural...blah, blah. First it took forever to receive. After I waited a month I contacted them and they discovered they had sent my purchase to the wrong address. Next delay was that it back ordered. Two months later I finally receive the product and I cannot wait to use it to have those stunning long eyelashes. So, the \\&quot;fiber\\&quot; tube seems to be all dried up. Almost impossible to get any product out of it. I follow the directions and apply the topcoat and the \\&quot;fibers\\&quot; that have miraculously come out of the tube, with much effort, proceed to fall off of my lashes all day and onto my face which causes some severe skin iirritation. I could not wait to get home that day and scrub my face. I try it again the next day, thinking possibly I did not apply enough top coat, and the brush to the \\&quot;fiber\\&quot; tube breaks off into the tube. A total waste of money and anticipation for me.</li>
            <li> This is the simplest product I&#x27;ve used.  I love the results and have never had an issue with it.  I followed the directions and have amazing lashes.  A couple of my girlfriends that were use to buying expensive mascara are now getting this one because the results are that great.  Best of all it is very easy to remove. I love this product!</li>
            <li> It is against guidelines of younique to be sold on amazon ebay etsy etc can only be bought through an actual presenter such as myself and is cheaper to do so don&#x27;t get ripped off people this is an amazing product order from someone who actually sells and knows about our products</li>
            <li> Not worth the price, fibers fall into your eyes and it leaves lashes clumpy. Very disappointing</li>
            <li> Superb lashes!  Easy to use and remove!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the clumpy spider like look that it gives. Prefer my regular mascara over this.</li>
            <li> I would never recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this!!</li>
            <li> Getting the hang of it. Soo cooool!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome and does what it says. It does say to put on top of mascara first but I applied mines both ways and got the same results, so you really don&#x27;t have to use mascara first. Yes there is two tubes that you apply to each eye but for the results you get  I can deal with that. I would have given this product a 5 but I think the price is too expensive and it is only available through a representative of Younique, I am impatient and I want to be able to go to Ulta and buy it directly. But it is an amazing product. There is a YouTube video with a lady doing a demonstration on her eyes and you have to see the results, and she does it without the masacara being applied first. that&#x27;s what made me try it and I am hooked on this product, they are your lashes on sterriods, not those false things that look like you have catapillars on your eyelids, so natural looking</li>
            <li> Have not tried this and the reviews don&#x27;t sound like I want to.  For a long time, I have done this:  put vaseline on your fingertips and rub them on your upper eyelashes lightly, then brush on an eyeshadow powder over it.  It adds thickness.  Then I heat my eyelash curler with a blow dryer for a few seconds and then I curl my lashes.  Use your best mascara after that.  It is a lot cheaper and does make a difference.  Not like fake eyelashes, but not bad.</li>
            <li> So, a friend was selling these lashes. I thought I&#x27;d buy some. $30.00, for them... A little much. Tried the system on, at first, it was, &amp;#34;Wow..ok, they look huge!&amp;#34; Then, at the end of the day, the mascara has went under my eyes and my eyes looked horrible.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it again, a week later. My mascara, gel, fiber lashes then gel to seal. I have big lashed as it is. So, I curled them, first. The first application of the gel, I noticed, this time- they didn&#x27;t separate my lashes my lashes, but made them globby and clumpy and heavy. Then, I did the fibers, which makes the lashes even worse.it makes them stick together and just looks messy. Them, you apply another gel coat. Adding more onto the already gross looking lashes...dislike this product! There is a warranty. Don&#x27;t get this.</li>
            <li> Very much enjoyed the ease of buying this product, and my daughter loves to use it, probably will buy more.</li>
            <li> yes this is great, I would suggest viewing the youtube video before applying.</li>
            <li> I love it--it makes me look like I have eyelashes!!</li>
            <li> I love this product when I first get it but after about 2 weeks it just doesn&#x27;t go  on as thick as it did. The product if great just doesn&#x27;t last as long as you would think.</li>
            <li> I was very happy when my packaged arrived and it wasn&#x27;t a knock off! It was my best friends Christmas gift and she loved it! Totally amazing lashes!!!</li>
            <li> I have nearly invisible eyelashes, so this doesn&#x27;t give the product a lot to work with. I was looking for something to enhance my eyelashes, but look fairly natural. My beautician was wearing this product - it looked a bit clumpy on her, but I decided to try it anyway. Resulting look is what I call &amp;#34;spidery&amp;#34;, like 8 clumped up very sticky eyelashes. Tried a few times, following instructions, and still looked &amp;#34;spidery&amp;#34;. And I realize BLACK mascara is the most prevalent kind, and I prefer brown. But this is really really really BLACK. Not a good look for me!</li>
            <li> Younique Moodstruck 3D Fiber Mascara is the best mascara if you are looking for long and thick eyelashes naturally.  I am usually hesitant to believe when mascara companies claim that their product will give the appearance of fake eyelashes naturally but this product really does work.  I received this product as gift for Christmas and it is amazing.  The first time I used it I couldn’t believe my eyelashes could look so long and full.  Younique uses tiny black natural fibers to build thickness and length onto your eyelashes.  I heard some complaints about the tiny fibers falling onto people’s cheeks, this did slightly happen to me but they brush right off and don’t leave any marks. To start off application you put on a layer of any normal mascara, then you apply the transplanting gel, which is what the fibers stick to.  Then immediately after applying the gel you apply the fibers.  Finally, you apply another coat of the transplanting gel and you’re done.  It might seem like a lot longer process than normal mascara but it actually goes on really quick and the results are astounding.  Other fiber mascaras I have used would leave messy black fibers all around my eyes or be impossible to get off in the shower.  Younique comes off easy and doesn’t leave you looking like a raccoon after.  I will never buy fiber mascara that is not by Younique.  Their product actually works, it’s affordable, and it isn’t a hassle to use.</li>
            <li> Excellent!!! Love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed with this product. The fibers look like the fuzzy particles you find on pipe cleaners and the gel smells like Elmer&#x27;s Glue. I was SO excited to get this and was completely let down from the get go. It took almost 2 weeks after I ordered for it to arrive. Also, it made my lashes look clumpy - which is not a good look for anyone. I will not be recommending this to anyone!</li>
            <li> This mascara is fake it is not an authentic Younique Mascara.  You can smell the chemicals in the Mascara and it does not even work the same as an original Younique!</li>
            <li> Clumpy feels like I always have dirt in my eyes.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t apply the gel right then the fibers will get in your eyes and on your cheeks.  One application DOES make a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the gel is black so it has a tendency to rub off on your eye and looks like runny mascara.</li>
            <li> This product DOES make you lashes appear fuller and thicker…..for maybe an hour.  It is embarrassing, however, when the &amp;#34;fibers&amp;#34; begin to flake off and cover your face.  Unless I check my face in a mirror every 30 minutes when wearing this, I never know.  Not very impressed, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I did not buy this product on Amazon, I received it as a gift. I absolutely hate this mascara. It&#x27;s not easy to apply and it&#x27;s messy. I consider myself a makeup snob, I spend too much money on makeup and I heard a ton of reviews on this, so I was excited when I got it. One of the reasons I hate this mascara because the little fibers get EVERYWHERE. If I wear this too long, regardless of what the application says, the fibers do no stick all day. I usually end up with fibers in my eyes and all over my face. I don&#x27;t have the time or the patience to put this stuff on either. It takes multiple applications for it to work and there is a fine line between looking \\&quot;3D\\&quot; and a clumpy mess. For the amount of money that this costs, I will continue go to Sephora or Ulta and buy a much better mascara that I know works and won&#x27;t cause irritation or make a huge mess.</li>
            <li> I so desperately wanted to love this product.  I purchased it from a presenter in hopes of using it for my sister&#x27;s wedding. (which is not until May, but I wanted some time to learn to use it.) Sorry to say I don&#x27;t think I will be.  There are all kinds of things wrong with this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, you still have to own your old regular mascara, because the instructions say to put on 1 coat of that before the Younique product.  Yes, you read that correctly.  You pay $30 for this product but you still have to keep a tube of your old mascara on hand as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The transplant gel is very thick and very clumpy. It probably has to be in order for the fibers to stick, but no matter how carefully I apply it it still looks very thick.  Then you have to apply the fibers, which must be done very carefully lest they get in your eye.  Afterwards, you have to apply more of the thick gel. I found my lashes to look so clumpy that I had to go over them with the brush from my Cover Girl mascara. (to sort of smooth them out.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overall effect is that yes, lashes are longer, but the clumpiness is a turn off for me.  Fibers do drop off onto your cheeks, so you need to watch that as well. I was still going to work with it and try to use it on my top lashes (the effect on my bottom lashes was totally bizarre) until the irritation started.  It doesn&#x27;t make my eyes red, but they do feel a tad itchy and they feel like I have been crying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A final note: Younique presenters love to push that this is &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34;.  That&#x27;s great.  You know what else is all natural? Cyanide. Just because it is natural does not mean it is safe or that you won&#x27;t react to it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I love the way my very blonde lashes look with this</li>
            <li> I wear contacts and the fiber keep getting into my eyes. Making my eyes itch and irritated.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife, and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I love it. It really works. It does everything it promises to do.</li>
            <li> I received my order quickly and it worked well.</li>
            <li> Not so happy about the product.</li>
            <li> Amazing difference in lashes. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, quality product.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing mascara I have ever used and I&#x27;ve had many satisfied customers... However I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this product off Amazon or Any other of out products because they could be old products or expired or possibly tampered with.. also you get a 14 day love it guarantee by purchasing off a presenter like me or someone you know...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If be happy to help any of you women with your lash needs properly www.misssassylashes.com</li>
            <li> It worked very well first few days but not as well as time goes by</li>
            <li> I already have long lashes and this product just makes my lashes look fury and tooooo long.... Made my lashes look like  look like black widow spiders</li>
            <li> Purchased directly from Younique and got it in 3 days. Was so excited, I tried it as soon as it arrived. I must say this is the best product by far. Easy to apply, no mess and my lashes are crazy long. I have short, sparse, fine lashes and have tried so many different mascaras. None have compared to this one thus far.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! I&#x27;ll admit, I was skeptical. I&#x27;d seen all the before &amp; after pics, everywhere. So many people doing direct sales &amp; to be honest, I hate it. I hate feeling pressured to buy anything, but now I see why everyone&#x27;s so excited about this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;I honestly didn&#x27;t think a mascara could possibly make my lashes so noticeably longer &amp; fuller. I thought those pics had to be enhanced or photoshopped... I finally broke down &amp; ordered it, but I didn&#x27;t want to order from a friend, too many of them selling &amp; I didn&#x27;t want to cause any hard feelings. I just decided to order from Amazon. My order was shipped very quickly!&lt;br /&gt;I read the instructions. Applied my normal Cover Girl mascara, let it dry &amp; applied the Younique gel, the fiber &amp; another coat of gel. The recommendations to do one eye at a time helps, that&#x27;s what I did the first time &amp; I still do. I occasionally need to use my lash comb if I apply it too thick, but I don&#x27;t on a normal, daily basis. I actually think it looks better, more natural, for daily use if I apply just one or two coats verses several. If I am going out, I apply it thicker just like I would with regular make-up.&lt;br /&gt;My husband is oblivious to anything fashion or make-up related. After putting on my regular mascara &amp; applying Younique to 1 eye, I asked him to take a look. He asked me if I had fake lashes on my eye! It is a very noticeable difference. Longer, fuller lashes that look great! I enjoy doing my makeup now, it&#x27;s actually fun.&lt;br /&gt;I would most definitely recommend this product to anyone &amp; I do! I&#x27;ll never go back to plain, boring lashes when I can use this. It should last me a long time too because I don&#x27;t use much for daily wear, so the cost isn&#x27;t an issue. It&#x27;s really not much more expensive than a good drug store brand, but the difference in the finish is so worth paying a little more for!</li>
            <li> There is not a day that goes by that I don&#x27;t wear my mascara... LOVE IT</li>
            <li> great... I would buy again without hesitation</li>
            <li> Does just what it says, just follow instructions.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it</li>
            <li> Not impressed. Nothing 3d about it.</li>
            <li> Not as dramatic as I thought but definitely does the job.</li>
            <li> The fibers didn&#x27;t stay on my lashes and was finding them on my face all day. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product! I was so worried based on the other reviews from sellers and &amp;#34;like products&amp;#34;.  I can say this seller- shipped from and sold from &amp;#34;Exquisite Emporium&amp;#34; is a very nice product! A couple of pointers- 1) start with a good mascara base- nothing real cheap that flakes and falls off your lashes all day because this is literally the base for the fibers/glue. 2) wait for the mascara to dry and comb it OR separate your lashes individually (gently while wet) before applying this product to get a more even look.  3) Don&#x27;t sleep in it. Take the mascara off before bed. I was okay even though I crashed at a night after the club but I did find fibers all along my under eyelid the next morning from sleeping. Last comment- I do not tend to have a reaction to eye makeup- so if you know you&#x27;re sensitive, then heed other reviewers considerations. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Be careful, beware, I purchased the item for my wife and it turns out to be counterfeit order was fulfilled through Amazon Prime.&lt;br /&gt;The wording was misspelled and the makeup was cheap quality.</li>
            <li> At 1st I was very hesitant about spending $30 on a mascara, but decided to splurge on my self - so happy I did!! It works amazingly, not gonna lie it smells terrible but it&#x27;s worth it - who&#x27;s gonna smell your eyes anyway. So worth the money</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars, was because if your not careful when applying, it will get into your eyes and its very irritating. It&#x27;s the same with all Fiber Mascara not just this one. It really does make them look much longer. It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I hate it!!!  The mascara smells funny and the fibers are always falling off and it looks like dirt on your face.  NEVER will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Amazing ! No complaints</li>
            <li> Takes time to put on but I got used to that.  And I liked the result. What I don&#x27;t like was it appeared that my natural lashes were falling out. No matter how gently I removed the stuff.  My sister had the same problem.  I&#x27;m done using this product.</li>
            <li> I like the look of the product but it takes a bit to apply and I do not have the time needed on work days to use this. I still use it when going out with my spouse or when time allows. This does make my lashes look a LOT longer and fuller but again it takes time to apply. I also have some eye irritation with this product especially if the fibers get into my eye. Removal of the mascara and fibers is easy but does take a little longer just like applying does. But it does come off with my regular face cleaning towelette. Just be careful when applying not to get into eyes and you will be fine. I do apply a second coat of the gel after the fiber has set a few seconds to make sure they stay and not fall into my eyes or on my face. That seems to help a lot.</li>
            <li> Ok product, clumps up. Not sure if that&#x27;s normal or maybe it&#x27;s a older product. Great price compared to buying from a rep</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I no longer have to pay for those expensive eyelash extensions. I get the same look for less. Awesome product!</li>
            <li> Love it, but you are selling this too high....Younique website is showing it for $29.00. Plus shipping and handling and add sales tax.</li>
            <li> no more fake eye lashes this is one of the best things i brought in the line of make up for years</li>
            <li> The fiber particles fall off and the mascara lumps up ..This is just my experience the product itself is pretty nice so u may have a different experience .</li>
            <li> Seems too strong for sensitive eyes, and fibers clump and later in day fall off. Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I definitely do not like the Younique Moodstruck 3D Fiber Mascara.  I&#x27;ve tried it once and it left fibers all over my face, they continued to flake all during the day.  I would not recommend this mascara to anyone, not even my worst enemy,</li>
            <li> I love the idea of the product and what it does for your lashes but the fibers get into your eyes and cause a lot of irritation.  Once I put it on and got the fibers out of my eyes I was able to keep it on all day and it looked great.  The lashes weren&#x27;t as full as I expected but I will try applying it again.</li>
            <li> I love it!!! &amp;#34;Team no Falsies!&amp;#34;...Application is straightforward. For someone not in tuned with make up having to &amp;#34;figure it out&amp;#34; may be an issue. I had minor irritation the first couple of days. None now. The only downside is that there may be some fibre fall out from excess which you simply have to brush off with any type of makeup brush.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing . I could not wait to try it when I receive . Omg it make my eyes look super cute .</li>
            <li> I guess I had really high expectations, this mascara turns ashy and clumby from the very beginning.  I&#x27;m not impressed, I only use it when I go out if that.  Won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> Did not like because the fibers flaked off.  I have allergies and the fibers irritated my eyes.</li>
            <li> I like the product but I think my lashes are to short.. I&#x27;ve tried to use it as directed and it didn&#x27;t make my lashes look longer. It just looked like I had thick mascara on..</li>
            <li> I received mine as a present and have to admit I have no idea whether it&#x27;s real or fake after seeing some of the pictures and reviews on here.  However, I can honestly say I found it amazing!  I did get a video up on my tablet (via youtube) before I applied, so that I could make sure it was done correctly.  My experience was:&lt;br /&gt;1) The transplanting gel was nice and thin and did not clump in the slightest - considering it was on top of a layer of my own Avon mascara.&lt;br /&gt;2) The fibers went straight on and stuck immediately to my lashes, not even one flaked off immediately or otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;3) I applied this at 07.30 am and still had it on at 12:30 that same night.&lt;br /&gt;4) It was slightly hard to get off with soap and water, and I did have slight panda eyes but got into bed and in the morning used a baby wipe to get the excess off.&lt;br /&gt;5) I do have slightly sensitive eyes but this product did not irritate them at all - even when washing off.&lt;br /&gt;6) It&#x27;s not something I would use every day but if you are going out it is the perfect look.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this was helpful.&lt;br /&gt;:-)</li>
            <li> I purchased the mascara first for my daughter, then for myself about a month later. While I liked the way it made my  lashes look, I noticed that the fibers dropped onto my face constantly and in my eyes as soon as I put it on. Everytime I&#x27;d wear it, I&#x27;d have &amp;#34;grainy&amp;#34; eyes all day, very irratating. Then I started noticing that I was having headaches. Had them for a good two weeks while wearing the mascara. As a test, I stopped using it for a week and the headaches stopped. The day that I used it again, within 15 minutes of applying it, I had another headache starting. I asked my daughter what her experienece was and told her about my headaches. She couldn&#x27;t believe it, but she had been having headaches too, just never had made the connection. She, too, tested the theory and the days that she didn&#x27;t wear it, her head was fine. The day that she did try it again, she had a headache. Needless to say, having longer fuller lashes isn&#x27;t worth this type of pain or discomfort, especially at that price. If you&#x27;re having headaches, STOP USING THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> It definitely works.  It&#x27;s hard to get it right, but when you do it looks amazing.  The only thing I still have trouble with is when I reapply the gel after the fibers, I seem to take some of them off.  FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS.  The product works, it just takes practice and patience.</li>
            <li> Fast fast shipping! My eyelashes have been abused many years, with cheap mascara. This product is amazing! My eyelashes are long and long! Such a beautiful result!</li>
            <li> it does make your lashes really long but it can get a little clumpy! Its waterproof also but I don&#x27;t really like waterproof mascara i feel like take your lashes out</li>
            <li> This product looks horrible. Makes you look like you have nasty clumpy spider leg eye lashes. And no its not because i did it wrong, if you look at sellers pictures on facebook who are trying to promote it, it looks gross as well! Not to mention 2 weeks after i took it off (after only applying it ONE time), the stuff was still stuck to my lashes! Damaged my lashes for sure :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste your money</li>
            <li> Used it before and will continue to reorder.</li>
            <li> Worst. Mascara. Ever. After trying this product only today, my eyes feel like they are ready to BLEED. What a horror this stuff is. I followed the instructions and consider myself to be an intelligent, sensible, reasonable person. I did not purchase mine from Amazon, but from an actual dealer, via an online party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the packaging of this product immediately gave me pause. It&#x27;s make-up, not a piece of jewelry, not a fancy designer pen, and certainly after using it, not something worthy of such an ostentatious box. It&#x27;s mascara, people. This company should spend more money on actually developing a decent product, rather than expensive boxes to clutter up the landfills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But ok, if the product had been great, I&#x27;d have given the packaging a pass. Alas, it was not to be. The fibers started flaking into my eyes from the moment I applied this, and the flakes have been unrelenting for the remainder of the day; even continuing to the present moment, despite my having removed it. I want to scratch my eyes out, it is so awful! All day, there were dark circles beneath my eyes, and I look as though I have pink eye. I&#x27;ve been putting eye drops in constantly, hoping to soothe the inflammation and redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The emperor is naked, folks. Move along.</li>
            <li> My lashes look amazing. It&#x27;s easy to use and it lasts all day and then some. Great product</li>
            <li> Just ok, seem to get the same results with a good mascara. Dont like the flaking though. Clumpy also, but probably should have used a eye lash comb.</li>
            <li> This 3D Fiber Mascara is the most AMAZING product ever! I wore Fake eyelashes for years....but not anymore. I would only purchase from the Younique site or from a Beautiful Younique Presenter for $29.00 US The opportunity to share these amazing products should be considered as well. www.LindasLongLashes.com</li>
            <li> I have the most pathetic short and straight lashes, I do not like falsies and regular mascara just isn&#x27;t ever enough for an evening or special occasion look, I finally found djv fiberwig mascara which is another kind of fiber mascara only it&#x27;s an all in one and not as dramatic an effect as younique and I had been using that for about a year now and when I wanted a falsie look I would just add a few false individual lashes to the ends. Since I have been happy with fibers I wanted to find something even more dramatic; I found younique and I really love it, definitely adds volume like no other mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried. One extra step I use bc my lashes are so darn straight is once everything has dried is to give it one last good curl at the base of my lashes with my Panasonic heated eyelash curler and bam!! the most beautiful lashes I&#x27;ve been capable of achieving thus far but again this is more for a glam look rather than an everyday look, might want to try djv if that&#x27;s what you want but that one gives length and really lacks in volume.</li>
            <li> Great product, really makes a difference and doesn&#x27;t fall on your cheeks! Make sure you do the steps correctly! The reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars was a few times, not everytime but when I wore contacts, several hours later it bothered my eyes. I still wear it though but make sure you never sleep in it!</li>
            <li> Still smudges.  Cant seem to find a product that does not.  Have spent a fortune looking for that right one, I was excited that this would work.  I did it exactly as the directions stated too !!!!  :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good product , but it&#x27;s to expensive , you can get around 10$ ,,,,,))) and same quality , go to - aliexpress.com , good luck , on this site , they overcharging ))))</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed in the product, not the service of receiving it. It added furry like clumps to the ends of my lashes which looked terrible!! I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t send it back  right away.</li>
            <li> I bought this on the recommendation of a friend. While it is OK, it does not work for ME like the picture. It does for my daughter though! My suggestion is to go on YouTube and watch a video before trying to do it yourself though. The gel WILL dry quicker than you think it will, and then the flakes will not stick as well. Over all, once we figured it out, this stuff if GREAT!</li>
            <li> I am smiling with my eyes thanks to #Younique 3d mascara!  Look at my pout: #Luxe #Lucrative gloss&lt;br /&gt;Order yours today&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> I actually received this product in an instagram giveaway and I really liked it. You decide how dramatic you want them with how many coats you put on just like any other mascara. You first put a thin coat of your favorite mascara on, then the transplanting gel, then the fiber mascara, while the transplanting gel is still wet. I via my lashes once for a more natural with a splash of drama kind of look and I really like how it makes my eye lashes look longer and a bit fuller. Your lashes do not always come out looking like those crazy scary pictures of the huge lashes-- spidery lashes-- unless you want them to, you can do that. I like more natural looking and I definitely love using this product to achieve that!</li>
            <li> Ideally like the natural look it provides</li>
            <li> Great idea, however,  much TOO CLUMPY. I am DISAPPOINTED</li>
            <li> It is clumpy, every time I go to use it the brush is just one lump, kind of like it is old maybe. This is my second experience using it. First time I bought it at the beauty show in Vegas, it was great lasted almost 6 months, this stuff now is one clumpy mess,  I am unhappy.</li>
            <li> I think I just need to practice how to apply this type of mascara.</li>
            <li> My lash length are decent but I wanted see if this mascara makes a difference. It&#x27;s another step for my makeup routine which I dread but it&#x27;s does what it states. I&#x27;m still learning how to apply it without it looking clumpy ..takes some time to perfect. All in all..cool product. Better or faster than putting on fake lashes.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> had to stop wearing this as my eyes would tear guess I&#x27;m allergic</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try this product. Thank you</li>
            <li> Warning - I have a co-worker who&#x27;s daughter used this and she got severely sick. she had to have surgery on her eyes and is waiting to find out if she will have any % of blindness. The lab results showed the product was full of toxins.Her daughter had been poisoned. Since this has happened the co-worker has been contacted by two other people near by who had terrible problems with this product and one is now 30% blind in one eye. I do not know if the daughter&#x27;s product was real or fake - she got it for a Christmas gift - it was purchased at a trade show. She only wore the mascara for two days and then got very ill. The specialist said the fibers get under the eye and start cutting, and releasing toxins. BEWARE</li>
            <li> My mom actually sells Younique products and gave me this one for free. I love it! Can make even the crappiest mascara you own look good. Someone commented about this product being counterfeit, and if so, you might as well just splurge a little and buy the real thing from your local seller. Honestly, these things work great and Youtube reviewer Grav3yard Girl even gave this a great review.</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly and just as described! Factory sealed an in new condition</li>
            <li> It really works well. My friends were asking me if I had fake eye lashes on.&lt;br /&gt;I Love it!</li>
            <li> A friend tried this product and loved it so much she started selling it. I&#x27;m instantly skeptical about miracle products so I resisted for a long time but finally decided to take advantage of a promotion she was doing. I&#x27;m so glad I did because this product really works. The first time I got some of the fibers in my eye and it was extremely irritating. But since then, I haven&#x27;t had a problem. As I use it more, I do a better job and it looks less spidery and clumpy. I tried using a lash comb and it helps a little. My friend told me a trick to getting the fibers to adhere the best- open the tubes so you can quickly apply the gel and then the fibers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend not applying it at the base of the lash because it can be clumpier that way and more irritating to your eye.</li>
            <li> It does thicken your lashes. The fibers get clumpy on the brush. Have to use a lash comb. The fibers can get heavy...so if you curl your lashes like I do, because they are so straight, over time they will straighten again and not keep their curl.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care how carefully and slowly you apply this mascara I still ended up with fibers in my eyes.  Also there is a less expensive brand of mascara very similar sold on HSN that does just as good as a job.  Be careful if you wear contacts. I would not purchase this product again. I tried applying three separate occasions and still ended up with suboptimal results.  Don&#x27;t waste your money...</li>
            <li> The product is great - it took a few weeks to be delivered though and didn&#x27;t come with any instructions.</li>
            <li> Just arrived.  Took longer than I expected, but thank you anyway.</li>
            <li> My wife says it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> The mascara is just ok, it took over 3 weeks to arrive. A bit disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve previously been using Better Than False Eyelashes by Two Faced and I feel it is a much better product.</li>
            <li> I hate this mascara! I will never put it on again! The fibers get in your eyes very bad! Horrible product!</li>
            <li> I believe it is over priced! i also tried doing my lashes twice with my regular mascara and it turned out really good. So why should I spend all that money on younique?</li>
            <li> This is the second time I purchased this product I absolutely love it.  I will not wear regular mascara anymore!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear a ton of make-up but, when I do bother to put it on, I want it to look nice.  I saw a few people review this product on you tube and thought &amp;#34;hmmm, I would like to try that.&amp;#34;  I LOVE this product.  LOVE IT - it seriously makes my eyelashes SUPER long and full and thick - really easy (and fun, I might add) to put on and I will DEFINITELY purchase this in the future.  My only complaint is taking it off the little fibers tend to fall into my eyes and that&#x27;s annoying but the product is so awesome, I don&#x27;t care!</li>
            <li> expensive for how it works.  The fibers are literally little hairs, sometimes they bunch up and it&#x27;s hard to get lashes that aren&#x27;t clumped...still practicing.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. It works great and did wonders but I have been using it a lot for about 2 months and I feel like my eyelashes are shorter then they were before :(</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!!!</li>
