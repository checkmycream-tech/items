            <li>I have been using this for almost 2 years now and I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the toner at all -- I spoke to an excellent dermatologist about \\&quot;toners\\&quot; and he said they do nothing whatsoever.</li>
            <li>:D</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on the search for a great face product!</li>

            <li>So happy I found this</li>
            <li>Great price on here too.</li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never been so happy before.</li>
            <li>Works great</li>
            <li>The great thing was it continued to work throughout the day too without reapplying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bought this at 2 weeks ago and its great</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy I did.  </li>
            <li>Great price</li>
            <li>I was never so happy to be wrong!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On top of that the skin on my face has swelled up a bit to add to the misery!!  </li>
            <li>Very effective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very disappointe!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I found this through my research online and found this amazing product!</li>
            <li>My skin feels and looks amazing!</li>
            <li>and my skin looks soooo amazing!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>I was thrilled!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for a good month now and it works great.</li>
            <li>The cleanser and toner have pleasant, earthy smells.</li>
            <li>My skin doesn&#x27;t lose the bright redness for about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thats a good product, would buy it again.</li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>The moisturizer was good, I just prefer not to use it.</li>
            <li>The good news:    </li>
            <li>a good note</li>
            <li>I have always loved this product.</li>
            <li>They say it is just as good as proactive</li>
            <li>The cleanser foams up good and makes my skin glow.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a good thing to me because they&#x27;re easier to extract; no pushing and prodding is needed (I use a metal extractor).</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be good to go.  </li>
            <li>To be fair, skin products are trial and error so this may work for you.  </li>
            <li>The products feel good on the skin</li>
            <li>I loved this system.</li>
            <li>My acne was mild at best</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this skincare regime.  </li>
            <li>I am a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>They are very pleased w/ the results.</li>
            <li>I love the moisturizer that they have in this pack!</li>
            <li>My skin looks better than it has in months!.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Glad we did because this did the trick!</li>
            <li>and my skin has gotten so much better!</li>
            <li>Works better then proactive!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>I used this morning and night and after just 2 days I was able to see a difference!</li>
            <li>I love this set!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>I am in love with it!</li>
            <li>LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>the lotion/spot treatment is amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing purchase.</li>
            <li>The spot treatment is amazing as well.</li>
            <li>Really amazing.</li>
            <li>It worked better when I started being fairly liberal with the step 3 (benzoil peroxide) cream.</li>
            <li>like it does for most!I am going to buy more Proactive today because I didnt realize how good I had it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this, as directed, for over a month, and honestly, have not seen any change.</li>
            <li>Cost effective.  </li>
            <li>so I had to use my own moisturizer with it.</li>
            <li>Although Proactive was not around in my acne days (I am almost 48 now), I had heard that it was amazingly effective.</li>
            <li>I decided to buy it just to see, but to be honest</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this though--it has worked better than some prescriptions that I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>The smell is light and actually pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Its a good product because it works better then most acne treatments out there ..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>It is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Since I started using it (cleanser and moisturizer), it&#x27;s been much more effective.</li>
            <li>By far the best product I have ever used!!!</li>
            <li>Found it to be just as effective at controlling acne and even better for my skin.</li>
            <li>This works wonderfully for my 13 year old daughter, must use it as directed.</li>
            <li>awesome thanks acne free</li>
            <li>For me, the best part is that this product is fairly priced and available at your local CVS, Target, or Walgreens.</li>
            <li>all of which makes me pretty happy.  </li>
            <li>It was a bit strong for the rest of his face, but is clearing his forehead up nicely.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried Murad&#x27;s acne system, and I think Acne Free delivers better results--at a fraction of the price!</li>
            <li>I have very fair and sensitive skin, but this product didn&#x27;t irritate it.  </li>
            <li>Already, I have noticed a huge change!  </li>
            <li>Price on Amazon was a huge plus!</li>
            <li>However, when I woke up a week ago with 4 pimples I decided I needed a change, which turned out to be a HUGE mistake!</li>
            <li>La Roche Posay was the second best, leaving me with about 3-5 pimples at a time.  </li>
            <li>I have never been able to use makeup on my skin...</li>
            <li>The price was definitley a good price and made it worth buying to try.</li>
            <li>The terminator was Ok it did seem to work on developing zits</li>
            <li>I was worried, but give it a thumbs up!  :)</li>
            <li>Figured we try one more before seeing a dermatologist.</li>
            <li>Oh and that statement on the box claiming that it&#x27;s better than ProActive?</li>
            <li>It made my face break out even more.</li>
            <li>I found this product and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>well, the only results I saw in 3 days were more pimples!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Plus I am going to be more disciplined about using it morning &amp; night because I know that makes all the difference.</li>
            <li>Sometimes you just have to pay more to get something that works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****On</li>
            <li>Great product at a very competitive price.</li>
            <li>I can use all three at night, but with my aveeno calming lotion on top of everything.</li>
            <li>As soon as one disappears three more appear.</li>
            <li>I replaced the cleanser with Noxzema and used the repair lotion, and that worked better than  </li>
            <li>Those have been working much better for me</li>
            <li>Most justifiable purchase I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been to many dermatologists and tried treatments</li>
            <li>My skin looks better than ever.</li>
            <li>Ive never felt better about myself.</li>
            <li>It may be an okay product</li>
            <li>I eat a healthy diet and take care of myself well</li>
            <li>so I can not say that for sure.</li>
            <li>I am 34 and mostly break out on my chin around my time of the month.</li>
            <li>Slightly more for those who need the stronger medicine.  </li>
            <li>Will buy more</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad i did</li>
            <li>and I finally, after 5 years of acne embarrassment, I get compliments that I have \\&quot;flawless porcelain skin\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>but I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>It worked so fast and so great</li>
            <li>I still use it, and I love it.</li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>try to make sure you wash you face twice a day and keep the routine.</li>
            <li>Anyways, for me, this works WAAAY better than ProActive, and you&#x27;ll also be doing your wallet a favor.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Comparable to proactive and much more affordable .</li>
            <li>so I figured I would have him try it since it was quite inexpensive compared to many others.</li>
            <li>Then gradually use each product individually more than 1 day and see if anything happens.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products but none have worked as well as this one.</li>
            <li>I honestly love this product.</li>
            <li>AcneFree is a cheap and effective alternative.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get many breakouts anymore.</li>
            <li>you do buy this, be sure to keep moisturized.</li>
            <li>We really love it.</li>
            <li>I think the key is to find out a schedule is best for you to use it for your skin.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to everyone and believe I sound like an infomercial just talking about it!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product i have been using it for two weeks</li>
            <li>This is better than anything, even most prescription meds I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Better than proactiv.</li>
            <li>I sincerely feel this acne product deserves 5 stars .  </li>
            <li>oh im not gonna be able to use this every morning and night,</li>
            <li>and i especially love the price and that i can get it from my local drugstore or walmart, so thats my review.</li>
            <li>but that was better than the acne underneath the makeup at the time.  </li>
            <li>I have always been a faithful customer and LOVE this product, but they must have changed the formula.</li>
            <li>I have used salon strength benzoyl peroxide up to 15% and have been ok</li>
            <li>about 30 min or more before I go to sleep for the night.</li>
            <li>The toner smells fresh and clean and makes me skin feel great.</li>
            <li>I saw noticeable improvement within the first 2 days!!!</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try it out that I almost immediately washed my face when I got home.</li>
            <li>The cleanser has a nice texture but did not feel like it truely cleaned my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it works great for people who do not have sensitive skin; however, I was one of the unlucky customers.</li>
            <li>#34;the best product&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Should be accompanied by a moisturizer routine as it makes your skin dry...</li>
            <li>I found this product is so nice to my skin, very gentle and no overdrying!</li>
            <li>and you feel so clean after using it!</li>
            <li>Definitely gentler than the original one but still wors great!</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s fair to call the terminator pure genius when it comes to clearing pimples.</li>
            <li>As I said, I had high hopes for it after reading so many good reviews.</li>
            <li>So far, seems to be doing the job, that&#x27;s if she uses like she supposed to, lol.</li>
            <li>I never got a check from the pharmaceutical company, but did see that Acne Free has made it&#x27;s way to stores that sell mostly discontinued items.</li>
            <li>I never got a check from the pharmaceutical company, but did see that Acne Free has made it&#x27;s way to stores that sell mostly discontinued items.</li>
            <li>This is great for people who have sensitive skin, while also being acne prone.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend this product to anybody, first for it&#x27;s price, (can expect something to be good so cheap)</li>
            <li>After 48 hours I was happy to see the area was clear</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this has helped greatly.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, smells good, and it has a good feel to the skin.</li>
            <li>I tried the original AcneFree many years ago.</li>
            <li>Now I use a very mild cleanser in the morning and then their lotion and spot treatment.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say I&#x27;m glad that tried this system and that I would recommend it to anyone who needs something gentle that works.  </li>
            <li>And I really love the feeling of this product because not only do these products smell great</li>
            <li>I never thought that i would get into a routine of using a face washing system but its easy.  </li>
            <li>After trying many different brands, I read the great reviews on this and thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li>great product my daughter has been using it for years now used to be able to buy it a Krogers but can only get online</li>
            <li>The pimples go away a lot faster and heals very quickly, doesn&#x27;t linger for 3+ weeks like it used to before.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much that it has effectively replaced my in office dermatologist recommended brand.</li>
            <li>and I thought it would be too strong for me, so</li>
            <li>Dindt work out for me .. too strong</li>
            <li>I have very fair, sensitive skin which I why I got the Sensitive skin kind.</li>
            <li>It has been exactly 5 days since I used the system, and my acne has cleared about 70%, which is amazing.</li>
            <li>After 3 weeks, her face looks wonderful and only after about 1/2 of the first package used.  </li>
            <li>It seemed fine.</li>
            <li>and it was super itchy, plus my face was peeling!  </li>
            <li>I have suffered of mild acne through all my life and I have tried so many products.</li>
            <li>If I could post pictures of what this product did to my face most people would run as quickly as they could away from it.</li>
            <li>Doing wonders for me, though the Sensitive one is pretty good on its own.</li>
            <li>I am happy to report that I am still having good results just using the scrub (not rubbing too hard) and the cream.</li>
            <li>We have been very happy with AcneFree Sensitive so far.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve seen a huge improvement.</li>
            <li>Great product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>and I am just happy something finally worked.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really smooth on the skin.</li>
            <li>I started to use acne free again</li>
            <li>Acne Free- PLUS</li>
            <li>Obvious, maybe, but it may explain why people aren&#x27;t having great results.  </li>
            <li>All I did was get an oil free moisturizer</li>
            <li>By the second week, redness had greatly diminished.</li>
            <li>My skin looks fresh and radiant and smooth!</li>
            <li>I use gold bond ultimate healding and it works great.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product, has cleared my skin in 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>Now my cheeks are even toned and acne free....</li>
            <li>After the toner ran out, I used alcohol free witch hazel.</li>
            <li>Read some of the reviews on Acne Free and figured why not.</li>
            <li>i used to tilt my face in the light in front of the mirror</li>
            <li>AND im not required to order it online because acnefree is available in stores.der it online because acnefree is available in stores.</li>
            <li>The next day I continued to see a difference in my skin, which was great</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I am so happy, and plan to continue using this product regularly with him until he grows out of those dreaded acne years!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great price and last for about 3-4 months.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll clear up nicely &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>, I would not consider this  a good Sensitive Skin product.</li>
            <li>Because they have this Sensitive Skin formula and the reviews were good</li>
            <li>It could be better but with the price I couldn&#x27;t really expect much more.</li>
            <li>I know my review has a lot more information than one may want to know, but I hope sharing my experience helped one decide if this is the right product for them to try.</li>
            <li>My skin literally started clearing up within the first two days!!  </li>
            <li>My suggestion to any new users would be to patch test more than once, for more than one day, and see if anything happens.</li>
            <li>I was struggling because I felt so incredibly self conscious about my acne, but now, I feel like a new person!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, using once at night is best, and a sun screen SPF 15 and higher is good (I like Olay Complete Sensitive).</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sure that is why my face swelled and got irritated was because of the combination of the two medications.</li>
            <li>Was 90% better day 2 and has remained under control (when used consistently).</li>
            <li>This one has help me significantly.</li>
            <li>The first day I used these products, my skin looked immediately better.</li>
            <li>the original steps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>FYI is not Gluten friendly for my celiac people.</li>
            <li>so I guess it&#x27;s effective in that way, but I gave it a one-star rating because it specifically states on the box that it is \\&quot;gentle on easily irritated skin,\\&quot; and doesn&#x27;t advise the user to test it first.</li>
            <li>first 3 days was ok, skin wasn&#x27;t oily, no new pimples,  i was happy...</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking to get clear and beautiful skin, i highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>:) I&#x27;ll just be sure to limit my use of the mask, but it ROCKED at helping clear me up.</li>
            <li>This has made such a difference in taking away my scars and it has worked wonderful with the sensitive kit.  </li>
            <li>My face felt clean, and I went to bed.</li>
            <li>So I have discovered that my skin can handle benzoyl peroxide in lotions where it&#x27;s more controled where I apply it, but not in face washes where it can slip and slide to more sensitive areas (close to the eyes).</li>
            <li>and I could see the results right away (believe me that I am not one of those people who says this kind of line very often, but the result significantly good!)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for 6 months and have noticed amazing results, but had 100% clear skin in 2 weeks!</li>
            <li>Wow... this stuff is amazing....</li>
            <li>I look in the mirror to find my skin is bright red</li>
            <li>To be fair, I only used it for a week.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s TRUE.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been to so many dermatologists over the years, but all of their products irritated my skin too much.</li>
            <li>AcneFree had really good reviews overall</li>
            <li>but I love this product so much I had to share.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things.</li>
            <li>I have purchased so many lotions and scrubs when all I really needed is this!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fair enough.</li>
            <li>Nice on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This product has set my skin back a good 3 months which I guess is punishment for me trying to skimp on my skin care since this was about 1/2 the price of Proactive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it is not nearly as bad as it used to be.</li>
            <li>Acne Free Sensitive has made a HUGE improvement in my skin!</li>
            <li>This product ships quickly after ordering.</li>
            <li>Works halfway decently for getting rid of my acne, but it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like most treatments do.</li>
            <li>on day 5 of using this kit and I&#x27;ve already noticed a tremendous improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m twenty-eight with mild, but persistent, acne.</li>
            <li>I am in my early 40&#x27;s and have been known my whole life for having good skin.  </li>
            <li>Bought for teens - quick results and improvement of skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried alot of products and have a mild skin problem that comes and goes.</li>
            <li>Was shipped really quickly</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick as well.</li>
            <li>Best of all it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin like most other acne products.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product, wish it had been around when I was a teen.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the fact that the face wash actually CLEANSED my face,</li>
            <li>I have been applying a mint julep mask once a day and wiping it away with a very hot towel, then after drying applying terminator 10.</li>
            <li>I started to see results the very first time I used it</li>
            <li>/&gt;It just feels pretty cheap on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Although, as great as it works, there are some down sides.</li>
            <li>and now I&#x27;m using a Clean and Clear facewash that works so much better than this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a while and ordering it from here was fast and easy.</li>
            <li>However, after using the toner for a week I stopped using it in favor of a glycolic acid toner (Skin Obsession 10% Glycolic Acid Toner), as I did not feel like the toner included was doing much and it smelled as if it had a strong fragrance in it.</li>
            <li>My skin also dries out REALLY easily, to the point of looking like a reptile if I wore makeup for a whole day.  </li>
            <li>I wish they would get it back into the stores, or better yet sell the moisturizer by itself!</li>
            <li>: I think everyone&#x27;s skin is very individual, so this product may not work for you -- but lordy, I sure am grateful it has worked so well for me!  </li>
            <li>This system works really well with consistent use, and is a good option for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This is the first time in almost 3 years that I can say that!</li>
            <li>and this got my skin back in tip top shape within a week!  </li>
            <li>This stuff REALLY WORKS!!</li>
            <li>I have the first pimples I&#x27;ve had in months!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li>It does not dry my skin out and it doesn&#x27;t cause any irritations, this one is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>These products are more effective than any other over the counter items I&#x27;ve tried and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>Especially with the cleanser and moisturizer, focus mostly on the acne-prone areas of your face and you will be fine.</li>
            <li>I have virtually no acne at all now, so if you are finding you need maybe a little more than what this one alone can do, but can&#x27;t handle the stronger ones on their own, give this method a try.</li>
            <li>and this is the first time I&#x27;ve been able to leave the house without makeup on without feeling self-conscious about my skin since high school.  </li>
            <li>UPDATE: I have now found that combining the Acne Free \\&quot;Terminator 10\\&quot; maximum strength product with the cream in the \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot; package works very well.</li>
            <li>but after a few weeks of use my skin looks great.</li>
            <li>It will be worth it by day 5.</li>
            <li>This kit is definitely worth trying because of the price if you are struggling with acne.  </li>
            <li>I have also had some success with birth control pills (Orthotricyclen-Lo) at controlling my breakouts.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t say it is perfect all the time, but blemishes are much fewer, smaller and clear up much faster, without leaving a mark.</li>
            <li>I ordered this thinking since it was sensitive, it would work better.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin so was pleased to find this product.</li>
            <li>As far as I go, it&#x27;s just an OK product.</li>
            <li>I looked over many products, but was hesitant to buy them because I knew my skin was sensitive.</li>
            <li>I love the sensitive skin system because it does not have Methylisothiazolinone in it which I am allergic too.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s prone to breakouts, this is worth a try.</li>
            <li>Since using this product her skin is clear most of the time.</li>
            <li>then on top of it, have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Now that they have sensitive skin system, it&#x27;s even better for me.  </li>
            <li>Once your skin begin to clears up you wont be able to resists wanting to touch your smooth skin and nurture the progress by continuing to regularly wash with acnefree.</li>
            <li>Of course, the price is far better than Proactive.</li>
            <li>Had some success, some failures.</li>
            <li>It is much better now that I&#x27;m in my early 50&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I switch to more natural products, but they never work as well as this.  </li>
            <li>So I returned it and am now going to try the Sensitive Acne Pore Cleanser, replacing the alcohol free toner with an alcohol free Stridex pad</li>
            <li>The reviews for Proactiv on thie site convinced me that was the right choice.  </li>
            <li>I got this yesterday (right on time</li>
            <li>I read online that that some people who use proactive have this reaction, and that it should be stopped right away.</li>
            <li>I had high expectations for this products as it had fantastic reviews.</li>
            <li>That worked for awhile, but then I had to stop using it altogether: more zits were forming, and I needed something to prevent new ones from forming, which was the whole reason for buying this product.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different acne washes because like many young adults, I have pimples everywhere.</li>
            <li>We have tried many different products that honestly give basically the same end result, this being no exception.  </li>
            <li>I got the sensitive kind specifically because of that feature, and spent more on this product because of that, when there were cheaper systems out there.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a good product, but definitely not for all sensitive skin types.</li>
            <li>...not the blemishes maybe but the overall condition of my skin - it didn&#x27;t seem terribly gentle nor effective.</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent and does not leave skin feeling dry and cracked.  </li>
            <li>I purchase it now from Amazon because it is much cheaper then in any super store or discount stores around .</li>
            <li>Acne Free for sensitive skin was just what my skin needed!  </li>
            <li>This is my first acne treatment system purchase, so I bought the sensitive skin version just to be safe, even though my skin has never been especially sensitive.  </li>
            <li>It kept my acne pretty mild, but it still wasn&#x27;t doing as well as I really wanted.</li>
            <li>I did notice my face got very warm and even red in some spots after the third step.</li>
            <li>moisturized, moisturized, and moisturized some more and used just water and some very gentle cleanser to wash my face for the next couple days and that seemed to fix everything I had done.</li>
            <li>He is now in his second week and we have noticed a huge difference!</li>
            <li>The regular version dries out my skin and causes more acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different treatments.  </li>
            <li>I cannot stop itching my skin, it is redder than before, with tons more white heads.</li>
            <li>Acne free worked well and got me through pregnancy as well with clear skin.</li>
            <li>I only hope it could be sold separately  because I run out of the lotion first more than anything else.</li>
            <li>I tried MANY different products, both over the counter and prescribed by my doctor.</li>
            <li>but after while it really worked!</li>
            <li>At first I thought \\&quot;It&#x27;ll</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to claim it&#x27;s a miracle product, but this is definitely the first kit out of the many I&#x27;ve tried that has consistently helped to control my breakouts.</li>
            <li>My experience leads me to believe that skin might have an adjustment period when you first start using the system but eventually, your skin will hopefully get used to it.</li>
            <li>I also found that it needs to be used daily, sometimes more than once, as the package advises.</li>
            <li>but they are also very affordable!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it about a month now, and the only difference I&#x27;ve noticed is more acne.</li>
            <li>The only thing I found most helpful was the spot treatment/repair lotion.  </li>
            <li>At first I noticed some results.</li>
            <li>it was about 2 weeks and for the first 2 weeks</li>
            <li>I will most definitely be purchasing it here!</li>
            <li>(Most likely because of the Benzoyl Peroxide.)</li>
            <li>The first time I didn&#x27;t want to blame it on the lotion because I was stressed with school-</li>
            <li>I started using the Acne Free Sensitive Skin Clearing System a month ago.</li>
            <li>At first proactiv works then after a month it looses it&#x27;s effectiveness.  </li>
            <li>If you use this system, MAKE SURE you put on a layer of non-greasy facial moisturizer afterwards</li>
            <li>but then I got the BRIGHT idea to move to another product a few months ago...</li>
            <li>thought the end of the first week my face was peeling and</li>
            <li>Ok, back to this product.</li>
            <li>or so if you use this medication consistently.</li>
            <li>The redness on my cheeks has lessened, and where I used to have anywhere from 2-3 swollen, irritated acne bumps on one of them at any given time, my left cheek (the problem one) is almost smooth to the touch!</li>
            <li>She said you have to be consistent with the use or the breakouts will continue.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>was amazed when I woke up in the morning at how much clearer my skin was!</li>
            <li>First-</li>
            <li>when I woke up the morning after the first time I used it, it seemed to already be working.</li>
            <li>Even left my skin feeling softer and more supple.</li>
            <li>Everyone is different, so it probably works better for others, but I will not be ordering this product again.</li>
            <li>The thing is, you have to be consistent.</li>
            <li>It works much better then proactive and is a third of the cost!</li>
            <li>i had acne all over my face and its pretty much gone!</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast!  </li>
            <li>This is important to lemon my early 40s.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>, well the day i visited the Walgreens, i was having a full blown acne attack, and i mostly get it smack dap on my jaw and jawline, not really get breakouts anywhere else,</li>
            <li>I dont flinch when someone wants a picture!</li>
            <li>I have combination skin, with an oily T-Zone area, and this lotion makes it even more obvious with the heat hits.  </li>
            <li>Overall, we are pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>and I either dried my face out or didn&#x27;t work acne wise</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been struggling with mild acne since high school and could never find anything that wouldn&#x27;t burn or itch on my skin.</li>
            <li>I do agree with other reviewers--it would be nice to be able to purchase items separately as they do not all \\&quot;end\\&quot; at the same time.</li>
            <li>SO... after reading so many positive reviews on the AcneFree systems, I decided to purchase one at my local Walmart.</li>
            <li>have used Proactive for the past couple of years and was getting low so decided to try Acne Free because its cheaper &amp; has great reviews.</li>
            <li>I started The AcneFree Sensitive Skin Acne System a few days ago and am very pleased to say that this is the product for me!</li>
            <li>Clean &#x27;n Clear, Neutrogena, I thought I was going to have to go to Proactiv.</li>
            <li>I will get about 3-4 breakouts all at once that will take nearly two weeks to clear up and of course as soon as they do more show up soon after.</li>
            <li>I was extremely impresses with this skin care combo and at such a great price.  </li>
            <li>Yesterday night was my first night using it and its extremely gentle.</li>
            <li>His face acne is more minor</li>
            <li>Now I feel confident that I can have some minor cosmetic procedures to repair some of the damage done to my skin over the years.</li>
            <li>Worked really well at first.</li>
            <li>, my first experience was it was very drying</li>
            <li>My little girl is back to how SHE should look; beautiful skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 25, and the earliest age I remember having severe acne was 9; before that I simply had very mild acne.</li>
            <li>I stopped using it because it made my skin really dry and even more irritated.</li>
            <li>I ordered the mask also and found it to be a bit drying, but I&#x27;ll gladly take dry skin over acne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 27 y/o women with a mild case of adult acne.</li>
            <li>Within 2 weeks the acne has cleared and the dry flaky skin is MUCH better.</li>
            <li>It cleared up my dry patches, and my acne was already better</li>
            <li>Blackheads are at a minimum, and even now my breakouts aren&#x27;t full-face meltdowns, they are one tiny zit that I can easily treat.</li>
            <li>It certainly helps when I start to notice a breakout.</li>
            <li>Nothing has changed much except my skin turns to be more dry.</li>
            <li>Now four weeks later my skin is the most clear it has ever been!</li>
            <li>/&gt;First days of using: I patch tested everything first, separately, and also layering on top of each other.</li>
            <li>I read about Acnefree Sensitive skin and the reviews were rated higher than proactiv!</li>
            <li>I have tried many other products, but this is the first one that really worked.  </li>
            <li>Sure, many people got clear skin after using it but some friends said that it made their skin feel dry and many complained that once you stop using it you break out again</li>
            <li>I highly suggest that if anyone wants to try this product to do a skin test first.  </li>
            <li>I had a hard time finding the sensitive skin over the counter and was happy to find it here.  </li>
            <li>This acne system works very well for me.</li>
            <li>but I switched to Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser</li>
            <li>but I always have to buy the whole kit just to get the lotion.</li>
            <li>and nothing worked fast or well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s given her self esteem a much needed boost.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works and is not irritating.</li>
            <li>so everyone knows how much you breakout in your teens.</li>
            <li>Absolutely looooooove this has cleared my acne and scrars price has went up alot</li>
            <li>I am on the auto ship for this product and really like it.</li>
            <li>Some have been prescribed and very pricey.</li>
            <li>but there is so much cracking and dryness.</li>
            <li>If she skips a day or two, it shows.delivered fast.</li>
            <li>We have been booby that the product the rest of the month Does it fit this thing I want financial returns immediately</li>
            <li>Acnefree has really helped my skin</li>
            <li>but my skin has also gotten really used to it....</li>
            <li>really does give results and fast.</li>
            <li>It looks, and feels, so much healthier.</li>
            <li>and it made my whole neck and around my mouth break out.</li>
            <li>in all, I really do like it.</li>
            <li>Who wants that??</li>
            <li>I also use the acnefree gentle scrub for exfoliation once a week.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m back to smooth even toned skin with ZERO acne or scars.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light on my skin and makes my face look like a model face the next day!</li>
            <li>The acne that has plagued me took much longer.</li>
            <li>I never used to break out much on my face then out of nowhere</li>
            <li>I used a simple acne free was and cream, it worked</li>
            <li>but this product really improved my skin.</li>
            <li>When woke up my face itched, but I didn&#x27;t really pay ay attention to it.</li>
            <li>He uses a gently cleanser or just witch hazel in the morning.</li>
            <li>the product isn&#x27;t what it seems it is really runny</li>
            <li>Got this for Mom, and she loves it, says it&#x27;s gentle to her skin.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t take much time to use.</li>
            <li>The stuff is gentle and zaps zits in no time.  </li>
            <li>It just really works for me .</li>
            <li>THANKS FOR READING , BYE .  </li>
            <li>THANKS  AGAIN.</li>
            <li>The Acne Free system was the next thing I tried.</li>
            <li>however I didnt notice any real improvement in my skin&#x27;s quality.</li>
            <li>Back to Acne Free</li>
            <li>really does work.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m really hoping 5% in the All Day Control will work.</li>
            <li>Even though this was labeled for sensitive skin, I found that I was breaking out even more, and my skin was incredibly red!  </li>
            <li>encourage you to give it a try to this product, especially if you have sensitive skin :)</li>
            <li>More trouble than it was worth.</li>
            <li>Before I used this i very rarely had acne on my forehead, but now i constantly have it.</li>
            <li>When my 19 year old son began to have breakouts I started him on Proactive right away.</li>
            <li>I saw this kit in Wal-Mart earlier this week and decided to give it a try, knowing if it worked, it would save me a significant amount of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first night I used just the cleanser, to kind of slowly prepare my skin for the whole system.</li>
            <li>While there was a notation that you might want to start only as a spot treatment &amp; work your way up to full face, I decided to go ahead &amp; try it - after all, it was for Sensitive Skin, right?</li>
            <li>roommate started to used it, she really has sensitive skin, i don&#x27;t, but she got like first degree burn in her</li>
            <li>I have to say this product never leaves my face dry or tight feeling , JUST nice and clean .</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t take the time to post reviews, but for this particular product, I felt so compelled to write one, so here I go!</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin, and although this is supposed to be for sensitive skin..</li>
            <li>I was worried that because it is for sensitive skin that it wouldn&#x27;t work or be strong enough.  </li>
            <li>so i only use it once a day instead of twice and its not dry any more.</li>
            <li>sure the new, reformulated Sensitive kit would work fine for me, I&#x27;m just very particular and didn&#x27;t like the smell, texture or consistency of the wash and am willing to try other products from the same line before returning to the Sensitive kit.</li>
            <li>I have used this system in the past and it is amazing.</li>
            <li>seemed to clear my skin for the first month</li>
            <li>I have learned that my skin is pretty sensitive</li>
            <li>For the last full 16 years I had been using clearasil.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product, and I plan to purchase my next refill through Amazon, since the kits is a full five dollars cheaper than it was at Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li>It works really well, we have tried the other one and this one works a lot better for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought everything I can possibly think of to no avail and was about to order Proavtic, but I saw Acnefree and noticed a big difference in price (which was a HUGE plus for me!).</li>
            <li>What I discovered about my acne prone skin is that less is more.</li>
            <li>you can moderate this for your individual needs by adding more, less or varying how many days in between.</li>
            <li>This happened with all of the previous attempts listed at the top.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to wear less make-up and cover up</li>
            <li>so I use the regular Acne Free system and it really works, but it does not come with a moisturizer, and when I try other moisturizers they eventually break me out, so I decided to try the moisturizer that&#x27;s in the Acne Free Sensitive pack, and it works like a dream!</li>
            <li>A couple of things to remember is that because of the benzoyl peroxide you may experience some mild irritation such as an itch here and there but should not experience severe irritation.</li>
            <li>Granted, I only had  a mild case of acne, but it cleared it up</li>
            <li>It also quickly gets rid of her acne espically sudden outbreaks.</li>
            <li>so I left quickly by the end of the day</li>
            <li>Monthly, the cheek area of my face would break out mainly when it was close to \\&quot;that time of the month\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>The main downsides are that 1)</li>
            <li>I love it, such a big difference!  </li>
            <li>I assumed this was going to happen right away, especially for me because my skin is already very dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying this out.  </li>
            <li>Until I started my sophomore year of high school</li>
            <li>I purchase this set for my high school daughter as Target no longer carries it.  </li>
            <li>Through out my high school years i would have one or two zits once a month.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use many products due to my sensitive, acne prone skin, but this has been a delight.</li>
            <li>It may be because I chose the mild version of the product rather than regular, but I was worried that if I switched between products directly my skin would get really hurt.</li>
            <li>I prefer this sensitive kind because it doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin like the regular one.</li>
            <li>When I do get new breakouts, they are smaller and fewer and they ckear up quickly.</li>
            <li>Within a matter of two weeks his skin is 100% clear!!</li>
            <li>I have oily skin, mild to moderate acne and have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for adults who are suffering from acne because having a clear face again has made me so much happier.</li>
            <li>It also works really well for my fourteen year old daughter.</li>
            <li>That by itself didn&#x27;t do much for my acne, but it did leave my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>Not harsh like it not so gentle competitors.</li>
            <li>Instead I found the gentle formula Acnefree Sensitive Skin Acne System at CVS drug store for $ 19.99.  </li>
            <li>I decided to get the sensitive skin version, because I know Benzoyl Peroxide is very drying.</li>
            <li>And today, about a week after quitting the treatment, my skin is soft and much smoother.</li>
            <li>Every last one dried out my skin so much that I looked like I was turning into some kind of reptile.  </li>
            <li>I rarely get pimples, but when I do they&#x27;re usually big and leave a mark.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as harsh as proactive, which I&#x27;ve used before with ok results.  </li>
            <li>I barely have any zits anymore, and when i do get one during a stressful week, this stuff takes care of it fast and it heals without much scaring.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Proactive in the past with great results and have used other knockoffs for decent results</li>
            <li>It does however dry your skin out but with the right face moisturizer it works!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 36 years old and have had mild to moderate acne since about the age of about 27.</li>
            <li>The active breakout that I had was dried up and almost completely gone, and the existing blemishes were greatly reduced in size.</li>
            <li>But I think when someone with sensitive skin is starting this program it is smart to start with the lower concentration first.</li>
            <li>I have normal but very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Overall I am happy with my purchase because I feel as if the products that worked for me were worth paying the $17 for, but I will likely try to look into products with similar active ingredients that are sold individually.</li>
            <li>He was using only the Burt&#x27;s Bees acne cleanser before but within 3-5 days of using this, all of the really sore large pimples were gone and the rest of the spots had faded.</li>
            <li>The cream is very nice and doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel dry or sore -- at least that&#x27;s how it is for me.</li>
            <li>I guess you would need to keep continuing to see if it would help the zits, but need a new product to recover from this one.:</li>
            <li>The new one comes with a \\&quot;toner\\&quot;, a scrub and the acne cream.</li>
            <li>(I didn&#x27;t use a lot of it, but some), but the new acne cream seems to have moisturizer in it.</li>
            <li>It did not help preventing new ones from forming.  </li>
            <li>so here is my routine that has made my face look new again,</li>
            <li>I think it was the new product I was using.  </li>
            <li>So you have to keep rebuying a new package after a month</li>
            <li>and now I cannot live without it.</li>
            <li>so I decided to try something new.  </li>
            <li>I went from having a chin full of tiny little bumps to having a chin full on large deep irritated pustules and large cystic type acne bumps covering my chin and cheeks.</li>
            <li>Only after a couple of treatments, I have a huge rash, red itchy bumps.  </li>
            <li>Once the I experienced the rashes, the acne came back and it was worse than before.</li>
            <li>Has anyone with very sensitive skin tried this?</li>
            <li>She has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I do have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sensitive on my skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and everything that I tried before</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin then I would highly avoid this product.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I do however suffer from very sensitive skin issues.</li>
            <li>Your skin does have to adjust to the new product and may be itchy and red at first.</li>
            <li>If you truly have sensitive skin please reconsider because this product is anything but sensitive!!</li>
            <li>This works so well and so quickly to clear up breakouts without murdering your skin!</li>
            <li>but this is something I can afford and so far it works!</li>
            <li>but so far that hasn&#x27;t happened with this yay!</li>
            <li>I actually went out the other day without foundation (only bronzer) and still felt confident!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m allergic to fabric softeners which may have played some part in my reaction to this, but that&#x27;s why I chose to buy the sensitive skin set rather than the normal set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I did have a bit of drying, and ended up using the gel only as a spot treatment for the first month.  </li>
            <li>I also tried both the Acnefree regular and the Severe version and neither worked well for me, but did at first</li>
            <li>First off, my \\&quot;regular zits\\</li>
            <li>I usually never got whiteheads</li>
            <li>Is it only me or everyone will get hurt for the first time using this AcneFree ?</li>
            <li>As a bonus, i have super sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li>The Sensitive Hydrating Acne Repair Lotion + Spot Lotion worked so well for my acne and skin resulting in no irritation and eliminating new pimples, I&#x27;ll miss it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Both products work, the minimal amount of skin issues I have get cleared up quickly.    </li>
            <li>Normally I can&#x27;t use bp because my skin will get extremely red and start peeling, no matter how much lotion I use or how infrequent I use the medicine.</li>
            <li>I picked up the sensitive skin formula because my skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>I DO have very sensitive skin, so sensitive, I had to change my toothpaste because it was drying out the skin around the corners of my mouth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried the Sensitive Skin forumla and WOW!</li>
            <li>Tried EVERYTHING in the past without any success, and with a lot of pain, embarrassment, and only a blemish filled face to show for my efforts.  </li>
            <li>Then, I tried using Clean &amp; Clear, and Neutrogena on the spot treatment, but I had very minimal results.</li>
            <li>My acne was decently mild for 2 weeks and then the 2 weeks around that wonderful time of the month were terrible.  </li>
            <li>and i could see all the imperfections and little bumps where my pimples were, but now turn my face in all directions and it nothing but smooth skin.</li>
            <li>She still has a little acne on her forehead, but her cheeks, chin and nose are smooth and clear.  </li>
            <li>When you use it, make sure and use the little tub in areas you only need to help with acne.</li>
            <li>Im excited to show off my results to my sister and rub in the fact that i paid half the amount she does</li>
            <li>would not say my skin is super sensitive, so I don&#x27;t think I am an extreme exception.&lt;br</li>
            <li>1-2 months after using it, my face started to clear and it has been clear ever since.</li>
            <li>probably be like all the rest of the acne products out there that claim to clear acne overnight.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I used it as directed and within two days my skin was clear.</li>
            <li>My pimples and breakouts did clear up</li>
            <li>and it keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li>This product slowly clear my skin....</li>
            <li>My skin is now 100% clear after 2 months of using the product.</li>
            <li>I bought this product solely on the fact it advertises being \\&quot;gentle and for sensitive skin\\&quot; that could not be any further from the truth.</li>
            <li>your face will clear up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would recommend this to people who want to clear  up acne</li>
            <li>Within a week I had perfectly clear skin</li>
            <li>Used this, and all clear.</li>
            <li>The product was gentle enough to clear up the breakouts while not drying out my skin.</li>
            <li>I had clear skin for the first time in a long time, but over time, stopped working as well...</li>
            <li>Just looking for something to keep consistently clear.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;d probably be totally clear if I could kick the habit of picking at my face.  </li>
            <li>where I know my skin will be clear.</li>
            <li>This review is for the sensitive skin version.  </li>
            <li>The 2nd time it burned just as much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I am 52 yrs old and hadn&#x27;t had acne concerns in years.  </li>
            <li>Suffered adult acne for 10 years, I am now in my early 30s</li>
            <li>is nearly cleared up.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my young daughter who is getting acne quite early.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t help completely, but it reduced all my skin problems for 50%.&lt;br /&gt;However</li>
            <li>The sensitive skin formula isn&#x27;t so sensitive.</li>
            <li>It has not cleared my skin completely but I will try the severe one to see how it works.</li>
            <li>My 11 year old started having acne problems about a year ago.  </li>
            <li>So far I do recommend this before you try Proactive.</li>
            <li>This product is not for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I chose the gentle system for my skin because it only has one step with the benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li>This works wonderfully, as long as I remain consistent.  </li>
            <li>I believe these topical creams can help \\&quot;control\\&quot; problem complexions, but the underlying cause goes much deeper than that, and until that problem can be identified, i.e. puberty, the results may be superficial.</li>
            <li>I read online (cvs.com) that this product is not for people with extremely sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried proactiv, but my skin was too sensitive for it, so I switched over to this product.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive oily acne prone skin</li>
            <li>At 29 years old I was still dealing with acne that I&#x27;ve had since 13.</li>
            <li>I found AcneFree Sensitive and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even know that they made a sensitive formula.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, but not that sensitive.</li>
            <li>This is working for me so far.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Acne free dried my face out, it caused all over tightness and peeling and also burnt my skin after every application.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised; After using all three steps, I noticed my blackheads were surfacing.</li>
            <li>use the Acnefree Sensitive skin all three steps in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I am over 50, sensitive skin, and this product has taken 2 weeks for the peeling to stop.  </li>
            <li>I NEVER had suffered with acne as a teenager or young adult.</li>
            <li>This stuff even faded the old scars.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll take a few remaining spots in light of that.</li>
            <li>I am 15 years old.</li>
            <li>I picked up the sensitive skin pack from Wal-Mart solely by chance, but what a difference it has made.</li>
            <li>I use it in the evening and Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Cleanser in the morning.  </li>
            <li>She has extremely sensitive skin and so far it has not irritated her skin.</li>
            <li>(Maybe my hormones are changing now that I&#x27;m an adult...)</li>
            <li>I use it as well as my 13 year old son.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 17 years old and struggled with acne since I was 11.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin (that&#x27;s why I bought the sensitive stuff)</li>
            <li>BUT DO NOT HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN.</li>
            <li>So far i have been using AcneFree Exfoliating scrub and it has dramatically made a change.</li>
            <li>I immediately discontinued using Acnefree sensitive, however it has now been 4 days</li>
            <li>It is soft and dewey.</li>
            <li>My 15 year old uses this twice a day.</li>
            <li>so the next week I just used it at night and in the morning I would use a gentle moisturizer cleanser  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 34 with adult acne.</li>
            <li>I have used all manner of products from Proactiv, to stuff from Clinque and Body Shop and Lush.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s old ways.</li>
            <li>It never used to do that, so I switched and tried the sensitive line.</li>
            <li>Over the next few days even more acne than I had before started to appear in spots</li>
            <li>Although products work differently for different skin types, this product is definitely worth a try if you are struggling with breakouts.</li>
            <li>This is the only acne set I have had success with, having tried Proactiv and the regular AcneFree system before, among others.</li>
            <li>This set does not feel harsh, though I rarely use the step 3 because it is very drying.</li>
            <li>This system works just as good as the expensive brand.</li>
            <li>but it costs a little to much for me right now,</li>
            <li>Its so bumpy red and itchy.&lt;br /&gt;Please stay far away from this system!!!</li>
            <li>My skin is clear and it is the first product that didn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping that works as well as the rest of this line because I know I&#x27;ll be incredibly happy to not only have no acne, but to also have less marks left from previous acne.</li>
            <li>I have mild to moderate acne plus dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>At first it seems counterintuitive to use moisturizer for oil prone skin but trust me, the combination of BP plus moisturizer will kill the P. acne bacteria and mitigate the effects of dry skin.  </li>
            <li>My friend who has regularly visited dermatologists for most her life told me that this product probably knocked off the balance of my natural oils and that if you look at the ingredients and the amounts of them that this isn&#x27;t different than a regular acne product; aka: its not sensitive at all.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I have very dry, pretty sensitive skin, but I also suffer from acne on my chin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, a great product and you don&#x27;t have to sign up for some lame order by mail subscription!</li>
            <li>I rarely breakout now, because I&#x27;m using AcneFree every other day.</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin and am African American and this product just didn&#x27;t work at all for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for AcneFree, especially considering they have an option for people with sensitive skin to buy.</li>
            <li>This product is super harsh, not for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>I originally bought the regular system, only to find it really dried my face out at first..</li>
            <li>The lotion has benzoyl peroxide which is more effective when used cold according to the book I previously mentioned.</li>
            <li>Please note that when you first use this, you will likely have extra pimples for a day or two as everything comes to the surface.  </li>
            <li>After my skin started to get worse when I began using it, I searched all over the internet to see if maybe it was normal for your skin to break out before it got better but could not find any accounts of this happening from the use of</li>
            <li>The moisturizing gets used up first even though it only takes a tiny bit to do its job.</li>
            <li>I am currently using this system and it works decently.</li>
            <li>I decided to try the AcneFree sensitive skin to see if maybe it wouldn&#x27;t dry my skin out as much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin, I purchased the sensitive skin treatment so it would not dry out my face.</li>
            <li>It also dried up my skin and it started pealing, The moisturizer dried up my skin even more!   </li>
            <li>When I first started using this product it turned my face red and dried it out for the first week</li>
            <li>This is gentle for my sensitive skin, yet works really well for my trouble zones.  </li>
            <li>and it created a large scab covering the pimple which eventually wiped off the next morning when using their toner resulting in a quite irritated open wound on my face.</li>
            <li>my face came back to normal, oily, and one pimple at a time, i know food, hormones and stress take a major role in acne&lt;</li>
            <li>I tried the regular acnefree and it worked pretty well (at least compared to everything else I have tried, it worked the best) however it did dry my face out which can be irritating especially in the winter months.</li>
            <li>I thought that maybe this was an initial \\&quot;skin purging\\&quot; from introducing my skin to a new product, which has happened to me before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li>The smell is different, the new formula stinks (smell wise), isn&#x27;t moisturizing or luxurious like the old version and it doesn&#x27;t suds up at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although it didn&#x27;t work for me, it was gentle on my skin, but made it really dry, even though I have oily skin.  </li>
            <li>I always had clear skin naturally, but toward the middle of that school year</li>
            <li>After reading the mixed reviews I decided to go with the sensitive skin acne system since my skin isn&#x27;t sensitive.</li>
            <li>I have never suffered from acne as a teen , or young adult .</li>
            <li>I use the 3rd step spot treatment only on spots that really need it.</li>
            <li>After only 3 uses my face was peeling and very sensitive to touch.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more delicate formula doesn&#x27;t leave me with the little dry patches on my face like the original one had a tendency to do.</li>
            <li>so I have to lower to cleaning my face every other day, but that still helps so much!</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell funny, but last night was the second time I tried it</li>
            <li>nothing major.</li>
            <li>The new kit had an expiration date of 2013 but the wash is completely different and the bottle packaging were different colors (new is blue</li>
            <li>I never had acne in middle school and high school, but all of a sudden</li>
            <li>The only thing to clear my skin</li>
            <li>This is the only thing that helps keep my husbands skin clear.</li>
            <li>(I can finally use BareMinerals again without drying out) and even if it wears off I&#x27;m not worried because my skin is mostly clear.  </li>
            <li>have done three rounds of Accutane in my life (starting when it was an experimental drug) to keep my acne under control.  </li>
            <li>This product does NOT address scars, so if you have red spots or skin texture problems, that will require another course of action.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin I would recommend sticking to the regular AcneFree because it only uses BP and not both BP and salicyclic acid like the sensitive skin regimen does</li>
            <li>The regular formula will bleach out almost any natural fabric in comes into contact with.</li>
            <li>I have moderate acne, but extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So far the only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell because of the tea tree in it</li>
            <li>This is truly only for those people who have sensitive skin though.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product for anyone who has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Although my skin are sensitive to use this, I only applied to where I have acne or break and it work.</li>
            <li>but so far this has been the only product that worked.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 31 years old and have never struggled with acne until the birth of my 3rd child</li>
            <li>I thought I was keeping the products far enough away, but I guess they got too close to my under-eye area</li>
            <li>then it would be back to its old ways....</li>
            <li>I bought it for my 12 years old daughter, she followed instruction, then she woke up with tiny rash all over her face.</li>
            <li>If, however, your skin is sensitive, I suggest staying away for this product (especially the repairing lotion-</li>
            <li>I have actual sensitive skin, and to all those that do, STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin but use this because it is cheaper than their regular line.</li>
            <li>and i have literary tried every product they sell at my local walmart and rite aid</li>
            <li>I bought the sensitive kit on sale at my local Target, however, I didn&#x27;t notice the expiration date of July 2012 (had bought it in June).</li>
            <li>and I am 100% confident this product made it worse.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still waiting to see how it will fare during that time of the month, when my breakouts are worse, but it&#x27;s already doing MUCH better than Proactiv.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Their gentle formula didn&#x27;t work half as well as this AcneFree Sensitive kit.</li>
            <li>I am 14 and suffer from hormonal acne, and have tried everything from very sensitive products like cetaphil to commercial products such as proactive, and even went to a dermatologist and was prescribed with epiduo.</li>
            <li>Although, because i have dry skin, i am going to continue using my normal moisturizer and use theirs just as a spot treatment.</li>
            <li>Well, I have tried the regular and the sensitive skin formula and both have some pretty heavy strikes againts them.     </li>
            <li>woke up with at least 10 new whiteheads everyday and after cleansing I would get more during the day.</li>
            <li>it started burning like crazy, and turned bright red.</li>
            <li>The most dramatic improvement happens overnight.</li>
            <li>Different products work for different people but every time my acne starts up, I use this for about a week and my skin is completely clear.</li>
            <li>The next day, the whole area, especially the side of my chin where the bumps were, was scaly and dry.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t know what skin type you have, start with the orange regular acnefree products and only switch to this sensitive skin product if you cannot tolerate the reactions/irritations (if any)</li>
            <li>My skin isnt in between not oily and not dry.</li>
            <li>This kit does not dry your skin out</li>
            <li>I had the same worse before it gets better reaction to Proactiv</li>
            <li>applied this to my skin before bed the first night I got it, by no means a generous amount- just a little.</li>
            <li>I was really worried at first because I have really sensitive skin and everything I try causes me to turn red and makes it worse</li>
            <li>I had read all of the great reviews and was convinced it would work :(</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, so I went ahead and bought the sensitive skin system before even trying the other one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Purchased this item because I do have sensitive skin, but not extremely sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I am a long time acne sufferer who still gets pimples as an adult.  </li>
            <li>I have (or should i say had) normal skin with minimal breakouts</li>
            <li>I have always had trouble with acne since high school and tried everything including accutane!!</li>
            <li>Even with this one my skin burned the first few days.  </li>
            <li>it worked the first few days and cleared some of the pimples I had but soon after using this product for about a week I started to get whiteheads.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have super sensitive skin, but products in the past have definitely irritated my face by making dry patches or increasing redness.</li>
            <li>I had acne and extremely dry, sensitive skin and had tried Aveeno, Noxzema, and Proactiv and nothing was working until I bought this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Caution:  Although this is for sensitive skin it did dry my skin out a lot.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather have clear yet dry skin rather than itchy red swollen skin.</li>
            <li>The next day my skin did seem to clear up, but it was dry and flaky.</li>
            <li>: I have very mild acne, only a few trouble spots and blackheads)</li>
            <li>I never had acne as a kid, but starting at 25, I had a few recurring (and large) breakouts.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to try Proactiv, because she is young and her skin is a little sensitive.  </li>

            <li> and I&#x27;ve never been so happy before.</li>
            <li> Works great</li>

            <li> and I&#x27;m happy I did.  </li>
            <li> Great price</li>
            <li> I was never so happy to be wrong!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On top of that the skin on my face has swelled up a bit to add to the misery!!  </li>
            <li> Very effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointe!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I found this through my research online and found this amazing product!</li>
            <li> My skin feels and looks amazing!</li>
            <li> and my skin looks soooo amazing!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> I was thrilled!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a good month now and it works great.</li>
            <li> The cleanser and toner have pleasant, earthy smells.</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t lose the bright redness for about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thats a good product, would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Good</li>
            <li> The moisturizer was good, I just prefer not to use it.</li>
            <li> The good news:    </li>
            <li> a good note</li>
            <li> I have always loved this product.</li>
            <li> They say it is just as good as proactive</li>
            <li> The cleanser foams up good and makes my skin glow.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a good thing to me because they&#x27;re easier to extract; no pushing and prodding is needed (I use a metal extractor).</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be good to go.  </li>
            <li> To be fair, skin products are trial and error so this may work for you.  </li>
            <li> The products feel good on the skin</li>
            <li> I loved this system.</li>
            <li> My acne was mild at best</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this skincare regime.  </li>
            <li> I am a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> They are very pleased w/ the results.</li>
            <li> I love the moisturizer that they have in this pack!</li>
            <li> My skin looks better than it has in months!.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Glad we did because this did the trick!</li>
            <li> and my skin has gotten so much better!</li>
            <li> Works better then proactive!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> I used this morning and night and after just 2 days I was able to see a difference!</li>
            <li> I love this set!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> I am in love with it!</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> the lotion/spot treatment is amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing purchase.</li>
            <li> The spot treatment is amazing as well.</li>
            <li> Really amazing.</li>
            <li> It worked better when I started being fairly liberal with the step 3 (benzoil peroxide) cream.</li>
            <li> like it does for most!I am going to buy more Proactive today because I didnt realize how good I had it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this, as directed, for over a month, and honestly, have not seen any change.</li>
            <li> Cost effective.  </li>
            <li> so I had to use my own moisturizer with it.</li>
            <li> Although Proactive was not around in my acne days (I am almost 48 now), I had heard that it was amazingly effective.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy it just to see, but to be honest</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this though--it has worked better than some prescriptions that I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> The smell is light and actually pleasant.  </li>
            <li> Its a good product because it works better then most acne treatments out there ..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> It is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Since I started using it (cleanser and moisturizer), it&#x27;s been much more effective.</li>
            <li> By far the best product I have ever used!!!</li>
            <li> Found it to be just as effective at controlling acne and even better for my skin.</li>
            <li> This works wonderfully for my 13 year old daughter, must use it as directed.</li>
            <li> awesome thanks acne free</li>
            <li> For me, the best part is that this product is fairly priced and available at your local CVS, Target, or Walgreens.</li>
            <li> all of which makes me pretty happy.  </li>
            <li> It was a bit strong for the rest of his face, but is clearing his forehead up nicely.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried Murad&#x27;s acne system, and I think Acne Free delivers better results--at a fraction of the price!</li>
            <li> I have very fair and sensitive skin, but this product didn&#x27;t irritate it.  </li>
            <li> Already, I have noticed a huge change!  </li>
            <li> Price on Amazon was a huge plus!</li>
            <li> However, when I woke up a week ago with 4 pimples I decided I needed a change, which turned out to be a HUGE mistake!</li>
            <li> La Roche Posay was the second best, leaving me with about 3-5 pimples at a time.  </li>
            <li> I have never been able to use makeup on my skin...</li>
            <li> The price was definitley a good price and made it worth buying to try.</li>
            <li> The terminator was Ok it did seem to work on developing zits</li>
            <li> I was worried, but give it a thumbs up!  :)</li>
            <li> Figured we try one more before seeing a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Oh and that statement on the box claiming that it&#x27;s better than ProActive?</li>
            <li> It made my face break out even more.</li>
            <li> I found this product and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> well, the only results I saw in 3 days were more pimples!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Plus I am going to be more disciplined about using it morning &amp; night because I know that makes all the difference.</li>
            <li> Sometimes you just have to pay more to get something that works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****On</li>
            <li> Great product at a very competitive price.</li>
            <li> I can use all three at night, but with my aveeno calming lotion on top of everything.</li>
            <li> As soon as one disappears three more appear.</li>
            <li> I replaced the cleanser with Noxzema and used the repair lotion, and that worked better than  </li>
            <li> Those have been working much better for me</li>
            <li> Most justifiable purchase I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been to many dermatologists and tried treatments</li>
            <li> My skin looks better than ever.</li>
            <li> Ive never felt better about myself.</li>
            <li> It may be an okay product</li>
            <li> I eat a healthy diet and take care of myself well</li>
            <li> so I can not say that for sure.</li>
            <li> I am 34 and mostly break out on my chin around my time of the month.</li>
            <li> Slightly more for those who need the stronger medicine.  </li>
            <li> Will buy more</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad i did</li>
            <li> and I finally, after 5 years of acne embarrassment, I get compliments that I have \\&quot;flawless porcelain skin\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> but I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> It worked so fast and so great</li>
            <li> I still use it, and I love it.</li>
            <li> and i love it.</li>
            <li> try to make sure you wash you face twice a day and keep the routine.</li>
            <li> Anyways, for me, this works WAAAY better than ProActive, and you&#x27;ll also be doing your wallet a favor.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> Comparable to proactive and much more affordable .</li>
            <li> so I figured I would have him try it since it was quite inexpensive compared to many others.</li>
            <li> Then gradually use each product individually more than 1 day and see if anything happens.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products but none have worked as well as this one.</li>
            <li> I honestly love this product.</li>
            <li> AcneFree is a cheap and effective alternative.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get many breakouts anymore.</li>
            <li> you do buy this, be sure to keep moisturized.</li>
            <li> We really love it.</li>
            <li> I think the key is to find out a schedule is best for you to use it for your skin.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to everyone and believe I sound like an infomercial just talking about it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product i have been using it for two weeks</li>
            <li> This is better than anything, even most prescription meds I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Better than proactiv.</li>
            <li> I sincerely feel this acne product deserves 5 stars .  </li>
            <li> oh im not gonna be able to use this every morning and night,</li>
            <li> and i especially love the price and that i can get it from my local drugstore or walmart, so thats my review.</li>
            <li> but that was better than the acne underneath the makeup at the time.  </li>
            <li> I have always been a faithful customer and LOVE this product, but they must have changed the formula.</li>
            <li> I have used salon strength benzoyl peroxide up to 15% and have been ok</li>
            <li> about 30 min or more before I go to sleep for the night.</li>
            <li> The toner smells fresh and clean and makes me skin feel great.</li>
            <li> I saw noticeable improvement within the first 2 days!!!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try it out that I almost immediately washed my face when I got home.</li>
            <li> The cleanser has a nice texture but did not feel like it truely cleaned my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it works great for people who do not have sensitive skin; however, I was one of the unlucky customers.</li>
            <li> #34;the best product&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Should be accompanied by a moisturizer routine as it makes your skin dry...</li>
            <li> I found this product is so nice to my skin, very gentle and no overdrying!</li>
            <li> and you feel so clean after using it!</li>
            <li> Definitely gentler than the original one but still wors great!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s fair to call the terminator pure genius when it comes to clearing pimples.</li>
            <li> As I said, I had high hopes for it after reading so many good reviews.</li>
            <li> So far, seems to be doing the job, that&#x27;s if she uses like she supposed to, lol.</li>
            <li> I never got a check from the pharmaceutical company, but did see that Acne Free has made it&#x27;s way to stores that sell mostly discontinued items.</li>
            <li> I never got a check from the pharmaceutical company, but did see that Acne Free has made it&#x27;s way to stores that sell mostly discontinued items.</li>
            <li> This is great for people who have sensitive skin, while also being acne prone.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this product to anybody, first for it&#x27;s price, (can expect something to be good so cheap)</li>
            <li> After 48 hours I was happy to see the area was clear</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this has helped greatly.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, smells good, and it has a good feel to the skin.</li>
            <li> I tried the original AcneFree many years ago.</li>
            <li> Now I use a very mild cleanser in the morning and then their lotion and spot treatment.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say I&#x27;m glad that tried this system and that I would recommend it to anyone who needs something gentle that works.  </li>
            <li> And I really love the feeling of this product because not only do these products smell great</li>
            <li> I never thought that i would get into a routine of using a face washing system but its easy.  </li>
            <li> After trying many different brands, I read the great reviews on this and thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> great product my daughter has been using it for years now used to be able to buy it a Krogers but can only get online</li>
            <li> The pimples go away a lot faster and heals very quickly, doesn&#x27;t linger for 3+ weeks like it used to before.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much that it has effectively replaced my in office dermatologist recommended brand.</li>
            <li> and I thought it would be too strong for me, so</li>
            <li> Dindt work out for me .. too strong</li>
            <li> I have very fair, sensitive skin which I why I got the Sensitive skin kind.</li>
            <li> It has been exactly 5 days since I used the system, and my acne has cleared about 70%, which is amazing.</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks, her face looks wonderful and only after about 1/2 of the first package used.  </li>
            <li> It seemed fine.</li>
            <li> and it was super itchy, plus my face was peeling!  </li>
            <li> I have suffered of mild acne through all my life and I have tried so many products.</li>
            <li> If I could post pictures of what this product did to my face most people would run as quickly as they could away from it.</li>
            <li> Doing wonders for me, though the Sensitive one is pretty good on its own.</li>
            <li> I am happy to report that I am still having good results just using the scrub (not rubbing too hard) and the cream.</li>
            <li> We have been very happy with AcneFree Sensitive so far.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve seen a huge improvement.</li>
            <li> Great product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> and I am just happy something finally worked.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really smooth on the skin.</li>
            <li> I started to use acne free again</li>
            <li> Acne Free- PLUS</li>
            <li> Obvious, maybe, but it may explain why people aren&#x27;t having great results.  </li>
            <li> All I did was get an oil free moisturizer</li>
            <li> By the second week, redness had greatly diminished.</li>
            <li> My skin looks fresh and radiant and smooth!</li>
            <li> I use gold bond ultimate healding and it works great.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic product, has cleared my skin in 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Now my cheeks are even toned and acne free....</li>
            <li> After the toner ran out, I used alcohol free witch hazel.</li>
            <li> Read some of the reviews on Acne Free and figured why not.</li>
            <li> i used to tilt my face in the light in front of the mirror</li>
            <li> AND im not required to order it online because acnefree is available in stores.der it online because acnefree is available in stores.</li>
            <li> The next day I continued to see a difference in my skin, which was great</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I am so happy, and plan to continue using this product regularly with him until he grows out of those dreaded acne years!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great price and last for about 3-4 months.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll clear up nicely &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> , I would not consider this  a good Sensitive Skin product.</li>
            <li> Because they have this Sensitive Skin formula and the reviews were good</li>
            <li> It could be better but with the price I couldn&#x27;t really expect much more.</li>
            <li> I know my review has a lot more information than one may want to know, but I hope sharing my experience helped one decide if this is the right product for them to try.</li>
            <li> My skin literally started clearing up within the first two days!!  </li>
            <li> My suggestion to any new users would be to patch test more than once, for more than one day, and see if anything happens.</li>
            <li> I was struggling because I felt so incredibly self conscious about my acne, but now, I feel like a new person!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, using once at night is best, and a sun screen SPF 15 and higher is good (I like Olay Complete Sensitive).</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty sure that is why my face swelled and got irritated was because of the combination of the two medications.</li>
            <li> Was 90% better day 2 and has remained under control (when used consistently).</li>
            <li> This one has help me significantly.</li>
            <li> The first day I used these products, my skin looked immediately better.</li>
            <li> the original steps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> FYI is not Gluten friendly for my celiac people.</li>
            <li> so I guess it&#x27;s effective in that way, but I gave it a one-star rating because it specifically states on the box that it is \\&quot;gentle on easily irritated skin,\\&quot; and doesn&#x27;t advise the user to test it first.</li>
            <li> first 3 days was ok, skin wasn&#x27;t oily, no new pimples,  i was happy...</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to get clear and beautiful skin, i highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> :) I&#x27;ll just be sure to limit my use of the mask, but it ROCKED at helping clear me up.</li>
            <li> This has made such a difference in taking away my scars and it has worked wonderful with the sensitive kit.  </li>
            <li> My face felt clean, and I went to bed.</li>
            <li> So I have discovered that my skin can handle benzoyl peroxide in lotions where it&#x27;s more controled where I apply it, but not in face washes where it can slip and slide to more sensitive areas (close to the eyes).</li>
            <li> and I could see the results right away (believe me that I am not one of those people who says this kind of line very often, but the result significantly good!)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 6 months and have noticed amazing results, but had 100% clear skin in 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> Wow... this stuff is amazing....</li>
            <li> I look in the mirror to find my skin is bright red</li>
            <li> To be fair, I only used it for a week.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s TRUE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been to so many dermatologists over the years, but all of their products irritated my skin too much.</li>
            <li> AcneFree had really good reviews overall</li>
            <li> but I love this product so much I had to share.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things.</li>
            <li> I have purchased so many lotions and scrubs when all I really needed is this!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fair enough.</li>
            <li> Nice on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This product has set my skin back a good 3 months which I guess is punishment for me trying to skimp on my skin care since this was about 1/2 the price of Proactive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it is not nearly as bad as it used to be.</li>
            <li> Acne Free Sensitive has made a HUGE improvement in my skin!</li>
            <li> This product ships quickly after ordering.</li>
            <li> Works halfway decently for getting rid of my acne, but it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like most treatments do.</li>
            <li> on day 5 of using this kit and I&#x27;ve already noticed a tremendous improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m twenty-eight with mild, but persistent, acne.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 40&#x27;s and have been known my whole life for having good skin.  </li>
            <li> Bought for teens - quick results and improvement of skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried alot of products and have a mild skin problem that comes and goes.</li>
            <li> Was shipped really quickly</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick as well.</li>
            <li> Best of all it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin like most other acne products.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product, wish it had been around when I was a teen.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the fact that the face wash actually CLEANSED my face,</li>
            <li> I have been applying a mint julep mask once a day and wiping it away with a very hot towel, then after drying applying terminator 10.</li>
            <li> I started to see results the very first time I used it</li>
            <li> /&gt;It just feels pretty cheap on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Although, as great as it works, there are some down sides.</li>
            <li> and now I&#x27;m using a Clean and Clear facewash that works so much better than this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a while and ordering it from here was fast and easy.</li>
            <li> However, after using the toner for a week I stopped using it in favor of a glycolic acid toner (Skin Obsession 10% Glycolic Acid Toner), as I did not feel like the toner included was doing much and it smelled as if it had a strong fragrance in it.</li>
            <li> My skin also dries out REALLY easily, to the point of looking like a reptile if I wore makeup for a whole day.  </li>
            <li> I wish they would get it back into the stores, or better yet sell the moisturizer by itself!</li>
            <li> : I think everyone&#x27;s skin is very individual, so this product may not work for you -- but lordy, I sure am grateful it has worked so well for me!  </li>
            <li> This system works really well with consistent use, and is a good option for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is the first time in almost 3 years that I can say that!</li>
            <li> and this got my skin back in tip top shape within a week!  </li>
            <li> This stuff REALLY WORKS!!</li>
            <li> I have the first pimples I&#x27;ve had in months!  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> It does not dry my skin out and it doesn&#x27;t cause any irritations, this one is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> These products are more effective than any other over the counter items I&#x27;ve tried and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Especially with the cleanser and moisturizer, focus mostly on the acne-prone areas of your face and you will be fine.</li>
            <li> I have virtually no acne at all now, so if you are finding you need maybe a little more than what this one alone can do, but can&#x27;t handle the stronger ones on their own, give this method a try.</li>
            <li> and this is the first time I&#x27;ve been able to leave the house without makeup on without feeling self-conscious about my skin since high school.  </li>
            <li> UPDATE: I have now found that combining the Acne Free \\&quot;Terminator 10\\&quot; maximum strength product with the cream in the \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot; package works very well.</li>
            <li> but after a few weeks of use my skin looks great.</li>
            <li> It will be worth it by day 5.</li>
            <li> This kit is definitely worth trying because of the price if you are struggling with acne.  </li>
            <li> I have also had some success with birth control pills (Orthotricyclen-Lo) at controlling my breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say it is perfect all the time, but blemishes are much fewer, smaller and clear up much faster, without leaving a mark.</li>
            <li> I ordered this thinking since it was sensitive, it would work better.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin so was pleased to find this product.</li>
            <li> As far as I go, it&#x27;s just an OK product.</li>
            <li> I looked over many products, but was hesitant to buy them because I knew my skin was sensitive.</li>
            <li> I love the sensitive skin system because it does not have Methylisothiazolinone in it which I am allergic too.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s prone to breakouts, this is worth a try.</li>
            <li> Since using this product her skin is clear most of the time.</li>
            <li> then on top of it, have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Now that they have sensitive skin system, it&#x27;s even better for me.  </li>
            <li> Once your skin begin to clears up you wont be able to resists wanting to touch your smooth skin and nurture the progress by continuing to regularly wash with acnefree.</li>
            <li> Of course, the price is far better than Proactive.</li>
            <li> Had some success, some failures.</li>
            <li> It is much better now that I&#x27;m in my early 50&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I switch to more natural products, but they never work as well as this.  </li>
            <li> So I returned it and am now going to try the Sensitive Acne Pore Cleanser, replacing the alcohol free toner with an alcohol free Stridex pad</li>
            <li> The reviews for Proactiv on thie site convinced me that was the right choice.  </li>
            <li> I got this yesterday (right on time</li>
            <li> I read online that that some people who use proactive have this reaction, and that it should be stopped right away.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this products as it had fantastic reviews.</li>
            <li> That worked for awhile, but then I had to stop using it altogether: more zits were forming, and I needed something to prevent new ones from forming, which was the whole reason for buying this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different acne washes because like many young adults, I have pimples everywhere.</li>
            <li> We have tried many different products that honestly give basically the same end result, this being no exception.  </li>
            <li> I got the sensitive kind specifically because of that feature, and spent more on this product because of that, when there were cheaper systems out there.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a good product, but definitely not for all sensitive skin types.</li>
            <li> ...not the blemishes maybe but the overall condition of my skin - it didn&#x27;t seem terribly gentle nor effective.</li>
            <li> It has a nice scent and does not leave skin feeling dry and cracked.  </li>
            <li> I purchase it now from Amazon because it is much cheaper then in any super store or discount stores around .</li>
            <li> Acne Free for sensitive skin was just what my skin needed!  </li>
            <li> This is my first acne treatment system purchase, so I bought the sensitive skin version just to be safe, even though my skin has never been especially sensitive.  </li>
            <li> It kept my acne pretty mild, but it still wasn&#x27;t doing as well as I really wanted.</li>
            <li> I did notice my face got very warm and even red in some spots after the third step.</li>
            <li> moisturized, moisturized, and moisturized some more and used just water and some very gentle cleanser to wash my face for the next couple days and that seemed to fix everything I had done.</li>
            <li> He is now in his second week and we have noticed a huge difference!</li>
            <li> The regular version dries out my skin and causes more acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different treatments.  </li>
            <li> I cannot stop itching my skin, it is redder than before, with tons more white heads.</li>
            <li> Acne free worked well and got me through pregnancy as well with clear skin.</li>
            <li> I only hope it could be sold separately  because I run out of the lotion first more than anything else.</li>
            <li> I tried MANY different products, both over the counter and prescribed by my doctor.</li>
            <li> but after while it really worked!</li>
            <li> At first I thought \\&quot;It&#x27;ll</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to claim it&#x27;s a miracle product, but this is definitely the first kit out of the many I&#x27;ve tried that has consistently helped to control my breakouts.</li>
            <li> My experience leads me to believe that skin might have an adjustment period when you first start using the system but eventually, your skin will hopefully get used to it.</li>
            <li> I also found that it needs to be used daily, sometimes more than once, as the package advises.</li>
            <li> but they are also very affordable!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it about a month now, and the only difference I&#x27;ve noticed is more acne.</li>
            <li> The only thing I found most helpful was the spot treatment/repair lotion.  </li>
            <li> At first I noticed some results.</li>
            <li> it was about 2 weeks and for the first 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I will most definitely be purchasing it here!</li>
            <li> (Most likely because of the Benzoyl Peroxide.)</li>
            <li> The first time I didn&#x27;t want to blame it on the lotion because I was stressed with school-</li>
            <li> I started using the Acne Free Sensitive Skin Clearing System a month ago.</li>
            <li> At first proactiv works then after a month it looses it&#x27;s effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> If you use this system, MAKE SURE you put on a layer of non-greasy facial moisturizer afterwards</li>
            <li> but then I got the BRIGHT idea to move to another product a few months ago...</li>
            <li> thought the end of the first week my face was peeling and</li>
            <li> Ok, back to this product.</li>
            <li> or so if you use this medication consistently.</li>
            <li> The redness on my cheeks has lessened, and where I used to have anywhere from 2-3 swollen, irritated acne bumps on one of them at any given time, my left cheek (the problem one) is almost smooth to the touch!</li>
            <li> She said you have to be consistent with the use or the breakouts will continue.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> was amazed when I woke up in the morning at how much clearer my skin was!</li>
            <li> First-</li>
            <li> when I woke up the morning after the first time I used it, it seemed to already be working.</li>
            <li> Even left my skin feeling softer and more supple.</li>
            <li> Everyone is different, so it probably works better for others, but I will not be ordering this product again.</li>
            <li> The thing is, you have to be consistent.</li>
            <li> It works much better then proactive and is a third of the cost!</li>
            <li> i had acne all over my face and its pretty much gone!</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast!  </li>
            <li> This is important to lemon my early 40s.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> , well the day i visited the Walgreens, i was having a full blown acne attack, and i mostly get it smack dap on my jaw and jawline, not really get breakouts anywhere else,</li>
            <li> I dont flinch when someone wants a picture!</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, with an oily T-Zone area, and this lotion makes it even more obvious with the heat hits.  </li>
            <li> Overall, we are pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> and I either dried my face out or didn&#x27;t work acne wise</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with mild acne since high school and could never find anything that wouldn&#x27;t burn or itch on my skin.</li>
            <li> I do agree with other reviewers--it would be nice to be able to purchase items separately as they do not all \\&quot;end\\&quot; at the same time.</li>
            <li> SO... after reading so many positive reviews on the AcneFree systems, I decided to purchase one at my local Walmart.</li>
            <li> have used Proactive for the past couple of years and was getting low so decided to try Acne Free because its cheaper &amp; has great reviews.</li>
            <li> I started The AcneFree Sensitive Skin Acne System a few days ago and am very pleased to say that this is the product for me!</li>
            <li> Clean &#x27;n Clear, Neutrogena, I thought I was going to have to go to Proactiv.</li>
            <li> I will get about 3-4 breakouts all at once that will take nearly two weeks to clear up and of course as soon as they do more show up soon after.</li>
            <li> I was extremely impresses with this skin care combo and at such a great price.  </li>
            <li> Yesterday night was my first night using it and its extremely gentle.</li>
            <li> His face acne is more minor</li>
            <li> Now I feel confident that I can have some minor cosmetic procedures to repair some of the damage done to my skin over the years.</li>
            <li> Worked really well at first.</li>
            <li> , my first experience was it was very drying</li>
            <li> My little girl is back to how SHE should look; beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 25, and the earliest age I remember having severe acne was 9; before that I simply had very mild acne.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it because it made my skin really dry and even more irritated.</li>
            <li> I ordered the mask also and found it to be a bit drying, but I&#x27;ll gladly take dry skin over acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 27 y/o women with a mild case of adult acne.</li>
            <li> Within 2 weeks the acne has cleared and the dry flaky skin is MUCH better.</li>
            <li> It cleared up my dry patches, and my acne was already better</li>
            <li> Blackheads are at a minimum, and even now my breakouts aren&#x27;t full-face meltdowns, they are one tiny zit that I can easily treat.</li>
            <li> It certainly helps when I start to notice a breakout.</li>
            <li> Nothing has changed much except my skin turns to be more dry.</li>
            <li> Now four weeks later my skin is the most clear it has ever been!</li>
            <li> /&gt;First days of using: I patch tested everything first, separately, and also layering on top of each other.</li>
            <li> I read about Acnefree Sensitive skin and the reviews were rated higher than proactiv!</li>
            <li> I have tried many other products, but this is the first one that really worked.  </li>
            <li> Sure, many people got clear skin after using it but some friends said that it made their skin feel dry and many complained that once you stop using it you break out again</li>
            <li> I highly suggest that if anyone wants to try this product to do a skin test first.  </li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding the sensitive skin over the counter and was happy to find it here.  </li>
            <li> This acne system works very well for me.</li>
            <li> but I switched to Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser</li>
            <li> but I always have to buy the whole kit just to get the lotion.</li>
            <li> and nothing worked fast or well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s given her self esteem a much needed boost.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works and is not irritating.</li>
            <li> so everyone knows how much you breakout in your teens.</li>
            <li> Absolutely looooooove this has cleared my acne and scrars price has went up alot</li>
            <li> I am on the auto ship for this product and really like it.</li>
            <li> Some have been prescribed and very pricey.</li>
            <li> but there is so much cracking and dryness.</li>
            <li> If she skips a day or two, it shows.delivered fast.</li>
            <li> We have been booby that the product the rest of the month Does it fit this thing I want financial returns immediately</li>
            <li> Acnefree has really helped my skin</li>
            <li> but my skin has also gotten really used to it....</li>
            <li> really does give results and fast.</li>
            <li> It looks, and feels, so much healthier.</li>
            <li> and it made my whole neck and around my mouth break out.</li>
            <li> in all, I really do like it.</li>
            <li> Who wants that??</li>
            <li> I also use the acnefree gentle scrub for exfoliation once a week.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back to smooth even toned skin with ZERO acne or scars.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so light on my skin and makes my face look like a model face the next day!</li>
            <li> The acne that has plagued me took much longer.</li>
            <li> I never used to break out much on my face then out of nowhere</li>
            <li> I used a simple acne free was and cream, it worked</li>
            <li> but this product really improved my skin.</li>
            <li> When woke up my face itched, but I didn&#x27;t really pay ay attention to it.</li>
            <li> He uses a gently cleanser or just witch hazel in the morning.</li>
            <li> the product isn&#x27;t what it seems it is really runny</li>
            <li> Got this for Mom, and she loves it, says it&#x27;s gentle to her skin.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t take much time to use.</li>
            <li> The stuff is gentle and zaps zits in no time.  </li>
            <li> It just really works for me .</li>
            <li> THANKS FOR READING , BYE .  </li>
            <li> THANKS  AGAIN.</li>
            <li> The Acne Free system was the next thing I tried.</li>
            <li> however I didnt notice any real improvement in my skin&#x27;s quality.</li>
            <li> Back to Acne Free</li>
            <li> really does work.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m really hoping 5% in the All Day Control will work.</li>
            <li> Even though this was labeled for sensitive skin, I found that I was breaking out even more, and my skin was incredibly red!  </li>
            <li> encourage you to give it a try to this product, especially if you have sensitive skin :)</li>
            <li> More trouble than it was worth.</li>
            <li> Before I used this i very rarely had acne on my forehead, but now i constantly have it.</li>
            <li> When my 19 year old son began to have breakouts I started him on Proactive right away.</li>
            <li> I saw this kit in Wal-Mart earlier this week and decided to give it a try, knowing if it worked, it would save me a significant amount of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first night I used just the cleanser, to kind of slowly prepare my skin for the whole system.</li>
            <li> While there was a notation that you might want to start only as a spot treatment &amp; work your way up to full face, I decided to go ahead &amp; try it - after all, it was for Sensitive Skin, right?</li>
            <li> roommate started to used it, she really has sensitive skin, i don&#x27;t, but she got like first degree burn in her</li>
            <li> I have to say this product never leaves my face dry or tight feeling , JUST nice and clean .</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t take the time to post reviews, but for this particular product, I felt so compelled to write one, so here I go!</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin, and although this is supposed to be for sensitive skin..</li>
            <li> I was worried that because it is for sensitive skin that it wouldn&#x27;t work or be strong enough.  </li>
            <li> so i only use it once a day instead of twice and its not dry any more.</li>
            <li> sure the new, reformulated Sensitive kit would work fine for me, I&#x27;m just very particular and didn&#x27;t like the smell, texture or consistency of the wash and am willing to try other products from the same line before returning to the Sensitive kit.</li>
            <li> I have used this system in the past and it is amazing.</li>
            <li> seemed to clear my skin for the first month</li>
            <li> I have learned that my skin is pretty sensitive</li>
            <li> For the last full 16 years I had been using clearasil.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product, and I plan to purchase my next refill through Amazon, since the kits is a full five dollars cheaper than it was at Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> It works really well, we have tried the other one and this one works a lot better for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought everything I can possibly think of to no avail and was about to order Proavtic, but I saw Acnefree and noticed a big difference in price (which was a HUGE plus for me!).</li>
            <li> What I discovered about my acne prone skin is that less is more.</li>
            <li> you can moderate this for your individual needs by adding more, less or varying how many days in between.</li>
            <li> This happened with all of the previous attempts listed at the top.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to wear less make-up and cover up</li>
            <li> so I use the regular Acne Free system and it really works, but it does not come with a moisturizer, and when I try other moisturizers they eventually break me out, so I decided to try the moisturizer that&#x27;s in the Acne Free Sensitive pack, and it works like a dream!</li>
            <li> A couple of things to remember is that because of the benzoyl peroxide you may experience some mild irritation such as an itch here and there but should not experience severe irritation.</li>
            <li> Granted, I only had  a mild case of acne, but it cleared it up</li>
            <li> It also quickly gets rid of her acne espically sudden outbreaks.</li>
            <li> so I left quickly by the end of the day</li>
            <li> Monthly, the cheek area of my face would break out mainly when it was close to \\&quot;that time of the month\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> The main downsides are that 1)</li>
            <li> I love it, such a big difference!  </li>
            <li> I assumed this was going to happen right away, especially for me because my skin is already very dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying this out.  </li>
            <li> Until I started my sophomore year of high school</li>
            <li> I purchase this set for my high school daughter as Target no longer carries it.  </li>
            <li> Through out my high school years i would have one or two zits once a month.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use many products due to my sensitive, acne prone skin, but this has been a delight.</li>
            <li> It may be because I chose the mild version of the product rather than regular, but I was worried that if I switched between products directly my skin would get really hurt.</li>
            <li> I prefer this sensitive kind because it doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin like the regular one.</li>
            <li> When I do get new breakouts, they are smaller and fewer and they ckear up quickly.</li>
            <li> Within a matter of two weeks his skin is 100% clear!!</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, mild to moderate acne and have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for adults who are suffering from acne because having a clear face again has made me so much happier.</li>
            <li> It also works really well for my fourteen year old daughter.</li>
            <li> That by itself didn&#x27;t do much for my acne, but it did leave my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Not harsh like it not so gentle competitors.</li>
            <li> Instead I found the gentle formula Acnefree Sensitive Skin Acne System at CVS drug store for $ 19.99.  </li>
            <li> I decided to get the sensitive skin version, because I know Benzoyl Peroxide is very drying.</li>
            <li> And today, about a week after quitting the treatment, my skin is soft and much smoother.</li>
            <li> Every last one dried out my skin so much that I looked like I was turning into some kind of reptile.  </li>
            <li> I rarely get pimples, but when I do they&#x27;re usually big and leave a mark.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as harsh as proactive, which I&#x27;ve used before with ok results.  </li>
            <li> I barely have any zits anymore, and when i do get one during a stressful week, this stuff takes care of it fast and it heals without much scaring.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Proactive in the past with great results and have used other knockoffs for decent results</li>
            <li> It does however dry your skin out but with the right face moisturizer it works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 36 years old and have had mild to moderate acne since about the age of about 27.</li>
            <li> The active breakout that I had was dried up and almost completely gone, and the existing blemishes were greatly reduced in size.</li>
            <li> But I think when someone with sensitive skin is starting this program it is smart to start with the lower concentration first.</li>
            <li> I have normal but very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Overall I am happy with my purchase because I feel as if the products that worked for me were worth paying the $17 for, but I will likely try to look into products with similar active ingredients that are sold individually.</li>
            <li> He was using only the Burt&#x27;s Bees acne cleanser before but within 3-5 days of using this, all of the really sore large pimples were gone and the rest of the spots had faded.</li>
            <li> The cream is very nice and doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel dry or sore -- at least that&#x27;s how it is for me.</li>
            <li> I guess you would need to keep continuing to see if it would help the zits, but need a new product to recover from this one.:</li>
            <li> The new one comes with a \\&quot;toner\\&quot;, a scrub and the acne cream.</li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t use a lot of it, but some), but the new acne cream seems to have moisturizer in it.</li>
            <li> It did not help preventing new ones from forming.  </li>
            <li> so here is my routine that has made my face look new again,</li>
            <li> I think it was the new product I was using.  </li>
            <li> So you have to keep rebuying a new package after a month</li>
            <li> and now I cannot live without it.</li>
            <li> so I decided to try something new.  </li>
            <li> I went from having a chin full of tiny little bumps to having a chin full on large deep irritated pustules and large cystic type acne bumps covering my chin and cheeks.</li>
            <li> Only after a couple of treatments, I have a huge rash, red itchy bumps.  </li>
            <li> Once the I experienced the rashes, the acne came back and it was worse than before.</li>
            <li> Has anyone with very sensitive skin tried this?</li>
            <li> She has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I do have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sensitive on my skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and everything that I tried before</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin then I would highly avoid this product.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I do however suffer from very sensitive skin issues.</li>
            <li> Your skin does have to adjust to the new product and may be itchy and red at first.</li>
            <li> If you truly have sensitive skin please reconsider because this product is anything but sensitive!!</li>
            <li> This works so well and so quickly to clear up breakouts without murdering your skin!</li>
            <li> but this is something I can afford and so far it works!</li>
            <li> but so far that hasn&#x27;t happened with this yay!</li>
            <li> I actually went out the other day without foundation (only bronzer) and still felt confident!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to fabric softeners which may have played some part in my reaction to this, but that&#x27;s why I chose to buy the sensitive skin set rather than the normal set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I did have a bit of drying, and ended up using the gel only as a spot treatment for the first month.  </li>
            <li> I also tried both the Acnefree regular and the Severe version and neither worked well for me, but did at first</li>
            <li> First off, my \\&quot;regular zits\\</li>
            <li> I usually never got whiteheads</li>
            <li> Is it only me or everyone will get hurt for the first time using this AcneFree ?</li>
            <li> As a bonus, i have super sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li> The Sensitive Hydrating Acne Repair Lotion + Spot Lotion worked so well for my acne and skin resulting in no irritation and eliminating new pimples, I&#x27;ll miss it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Both products work, the minimal amount of skin issues I have get cleared up quickly.    </li>
            <li> Normally I can&#x27;t use bp because my skin will get extremely red and start peeling, no matter how much lotion I use or how infrequent I use the medicine.</li>
            <li> I picked up the sensitive skin formula because my skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I DO have very sensitive skin, so sensitive, I had to change my toothpaste because it was drying out the skin around the corners of my mouth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried the Sensitive Skin forumla and WOW!</li>
            <li> Tried EVERYTHING in the past without any success, and with a lot of pain, embarrassment, and only a blemish filled face to show for my efforts.  </li>
            <li> Then, I tried using Clean &amp; Clear, and Neutrogena on the spot treatment, but I had very minimal results.</li>
            <li> My acne was decently mild for 2 weeks and then the 2 weeks around that wonderful time of the month were terrible.  </li>
            <li> and i could see all the imperfections and little bumps where my pimples were, but now turn my face in all directions and it nothing but smooth skin.</li>
            <li> She still has a little acne on her forehead, but her cheeks, chin and nose are smooth and clear.  </li>
            <li> When you use it, make sure and use the little tub in areas you only need to help with acne.</li>
            <li> Im excited to show off my results to my sister and rub in the fact that i paid half the amount she does</li>
            <li> would not say my skin is super sensitive, so I don&#x27;t think I am an extreme exception.&lt;br</li>
            <li> 1-2 months after using it, my face started to clear and it has been clear ever since.</li>
            <li> probably be like all the rest of the acne products out there that claim to clear acne overnight.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I used it as directed and within two days my skin was clear.</li>
            <li> My pimples and breakouts did clear up</li>
            <li> and it keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li> This product slowly clear my skin....</li>
            <li> My skin is now 100% clear after 2 months of using the product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product solely on the fact it advertises being \\&quot;gentle and for sensitive skin\\&quot; that could not be any further from the truth.</li>
            <li> your face will clear up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would recommend this to people who want to clear  up acne</li>
            <li> Within a week I had perfectly clear skin</li>
            <li> Used this, and all clear.</li>
            <li> The product was gentle enough to clear up the breakouts while not drying out my skin.</li>
            <li> I had clear skin for the first time in a long time, but over time, stopped working as well...</li>
            <li> Just looking for something to keep consistently clear.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;d probably be totally clear if I could kick the habit of picking at my face.  </li>
            <li> where I know my skin will be clear.</li>
            <li> This review is for the sensitive skin version.  </li>
            <li> The 2nd time it burned just as much.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I am 52 yrs old and hadn&#x27;t had acne concerns in years.  </li>
            <li> Suffered adult acne for 10 years, I am now in my early 30s</li>
            <li> is nearly cleared up.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my young daughter who is getting acne quite early.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t help completely, but it reduced all my skin problems for 50%.&lt;br /&gt;However</li>
            <li> The sensitive skin formula isn&#x27;t so sensitive.</li>
            <li> It has not cleared my skin completely but I will try the severe one to see how it works.</li>
            <li> My 11 year old started having acne problems about a year ago.  </li>
            <li> So far I do recommend this before you try Proactive.</li>
            <li> This product is not for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I chose the gentle system for my skin because it only has one step with the benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li> This works wonderfully, as long as I remain consistent.  </li>
            <li> I believe these topical creams can help \\&quot;control\\&quot; problem complexions, but the underlying cause goes much deeper than that, and until that problem can be identified, i.e. puberty, the results may be superficial.</li>
            <li> I read online (cvs.com) that this product is not for people with extremely sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried proactiv, but my skin was too sensitive for it, so I switched over to this product.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive oily acne prone skin</li>
            <li> At 29 years old I was still dealing with acne that I&#x27;ve had since 13.</li>
            <li> I found AcneFree Sensitive and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even know that they made a sensitive formula.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, but not that sensitive.</li>
            <li> This is working for me so far.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Acne free dried my face out, it caused all over tightness and peeling and also burnt my skin after every application.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised; After using all three steps, I noticed my blackheads were surfacing.</li>
            <li> use the Acnefree Sensitive skin all three steps in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I am over 50, sensitive skin, and this product has taken 2 weeks for the peeling to stop.  </li>
            <li> I NEVER had suffered with acne as a teenager or young adult.</li>
            <li> This stuff even faded the old scars.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll take a few remaining spots in light of that.</li>
            <li> I am 15 years old.</li>
            <li> I picked up the sensitive skin pack from Wal-Mart solely by chance, but what a difference it has made.</li>
            <li> I use it in the evening and Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Cleanser in the morning.  </li>
            <li> She has extremely sensitive skin and so far it has not irritated her skin.</li>
            <li> (Maybe my hormones are changing now that I&#x27;m an adult...)</li>
            <li> I use it as well as my 13 year old son.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 17 years old and struggled with acne since I was 11.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin (that&#x27;s why I bought the sensitive stuff)</li>
            <li> BUT DO NOT HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN.</li>
            <li> So far i have been using AcneFree Exfoliating scrub and it has dramatically made a change.</li>
            <li> I immediately discontinued using Acnefree sensitive, however it has now been 4 days</li>
            <li> It is soft and dewey.</li>
            <li> My 15 year old uses this twice a day.</li>
            <li> so the next week I just used it at night and in the morning I would use a gentle moisturizer cleanser  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 34 with adult acne.</li>
            <li> I have used all manner of products from Proactiv, to stuff from Clinque and Body Shop and Lush.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s old ways.</li>
            <li> It never used to do that, so I switched and tried the sensitive line.</li>
            <li> Over the next few days even more acne than I had before started to appear in spots</li>
            <li> Although products work differently for different skin types, this product is definitely worth a try if you are struggling with breakouts.</li>
            <li> This is the only acne set I have had success with, having tried Proactiv and the regular AcneFree system before, among others.</li>
            <li> This set does not feel harsh, though I rarely use the step 3 because it is very drying.</li>
            <li> This system works just as good as the expensive brand.</li>
            <li> but it costs a little to much for me right now,</li>
            <li> Its so bumpy red and itchy.&lt;br /&gt;Please stay far away from this system!!!</li>
            <li> My skin is clear and it is the first product that didn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that works as well as the rest of this line because I know I&#x27;ll be incredibly happy to not only have no acne, but to also have less marks left from previous acne.</li>
            <li> I have mild to moderate acne plus dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> At first it seems counterintuitive to use moisturizer for oil prone skin but trust me, the combination of BP plus moisturizer will kill the P. acne bacteria and mitigate the effects of dry skin.  </li>
            <li> My friend who has regularly visited dermatologists for most her life told me that this product probably knocked off the balance of my natural oils and that if you look at the ingredients and the amounts of them that this isn&#x27;t different than a regular acne product; aka: its not sensitive at all.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I have very dry, pretty sensitive skin, but I also suffer from acne on my chin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise, a great product and you don&#x27;t have to sign up for some lame order by mail subscription!</li>
            <li> I rarely breakout now, because I&#x27;m using AcneFree every other day.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin and am African American and this product just didn&#x27;t work at all for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for AcneFree, especially considering they have an option for people with sensitive skin to buy.</li>
            <li> This product is super harsh, not for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I originally bought the regular system, only to find it really dried my face out at first..</li>
            <li> The lotion has benzoyl peroxide which is more effective when used cold according to the book I previously mentioned.</li>
            <li> Please note that when you first use this, you will likely have extra pimples for a day or two as everything comes to the surface.  </li>
            <li> After my skin started to get worse when I began using it, I searched all over the internet to see if maybe it was normal for your skin to break out before it got better but could not find any accounts of this happening from the use of</li>
            <li> The moisturizing gets used up first even though it only takes a tiny bit to do its job.</li>
            <li> I am currently using this system and it works decently.</li>
            <li> I decided to try the AcneFree sensitive skin to see if maybe it wouldn&#x27;t dry my skin out as much.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin, I purchased the sensitive skin treatment so it would not dry out my face.</li>
            <li> It also dried up my skin and it started pealing, The moisturizer dried up my skin even more!   </li>
            <li> When I first started using this product it turned my face red and dried it out for the first week</li>
            <li> This is gentle for my sensitive skin, yet works really well for my trouble zones.  </li>
            <li> and it created a large scab covering the pimple which eventually wiped off the next morning when using their toner resulting in a quite irritated open wound on my face.</li>
            <li> my face came back to normal, oily, and one pimple at a time, i know food, hormones and stress take a major role in acne&lt;</li>
            <li> I tried the regular acnefree and it worked pretty well (at least compared to everything else I have tried, it worked the best) however it did dry my face out which can be irritating especially in the winter months.</li>
            <li> I thought that maybe this was an initial \\&quot;skin purging\\&quot; from introducing my skin to a new product, which has happened to me before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li> The smell is different, the new formula stinks (smell wise), isn&#x27;t moisturizing or luxurious like the old version and it doesn&#x27;t suds up at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although it didn&#x27;t work for me, it was gentle on my skin, but made it really dry, even though I have oily skin.  </li>
            <li> I always had clear skin naturally, but toward the middle of that school year</li>
            <li> After reading the mixed reviews I decided to go with the sensitive skin acne system since my skin isn&#x27;t sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have never suffered from acne as a teen , or young adult .</li>
            <li> I use the 3rd step spot treatment only on spots that really need it.</li>
            <li> After only 3 uses my face was peeling and very sensitive to touch.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more delicate formula doesn&#x27;t leave me with the little dry patches on my face like the original one had a tendency to do.</li>
            <li> so I have to lower to cleaning my face every other day, but that still helps so much!</li>
            <li> Not only does it smell funny, but last night was the second time I tried it</li>
            <li> nothing major.</li>
            <li> The new kit had an expiration date of 2013 but the wash is completely different and the bottle packaging were different colors (new is blue</li>
            <li> I never had acne in middle school and high school, but all of a sudden</li>
            <li> The only thing to clear my skin</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that helps keep my husbands skin clear.</li>
            <li> (I can finally use BareMinerals again without drying out) and even if it wears off I&#x27;m not worried because my skin is mostly clear.  </li>
            <li> have done three rounds of Accutane in my life (starting when it was an experimental drug) to keep my acne under control.  </li>
            <li> This product does NOT address scars, so if you have red spots or skin texture problems, that will require another course of action.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin I would recommend sticking to the regular AcneFree because it only uses BP and not both BP and salicyclic acid like the sensitive skin regimen does</li>
            <li> The regular formula will bleach out almost any natural fabric in comes into contact with.</li>
            <li> I have moderate acne, but extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So far the only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell because of the tea tree in it</li>
            <li> This is truly only for those people who have sensitive skin though.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product for anyone who has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Although my skin are sensitive to use this, I only applied to where I have acne or break and it work.</li>
            <li> but so far this has been the only product that worked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 31 years old and have never struggled with acne until the birth of my 3rd child</li>
            <li> I thought I was keeping the products far enough away, but I guess they got too close to my under-eye area</li>
            <li> then it would be back to its old ways....</li>
            <li> I bought it for my 12 years old daughter, she followed instruction, then she woke up with tiny rash all over her face.</li>
            <li> If, however, your skin is sensitive, I suggest staying away for this product (especially the repairing lotion-</li>
            <li> I have actual sensitive skin, and to all those that do, STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin but use this because it is cheaper than their regular line.</li>
            <li> and i have literary tried every product they sell at my local walmart and rite aid</li>
            <li> I bought the sensitive kit on sale at my local Target, however, I didn&#x27;t notice the expiration date of July 2012 (had bought it in June).</li>
            <li> and I am 100% confident this product made it worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still waiting to see how it will fare during that time of the month, when my breakouts are worse, but it&#x27;s already doing MUCH better than Proactiv.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Their gentle formula didn&#x27;t work half as well as this AcneFree Sensitive kit.</li>
            <li> I am 14 and suffer from hormonal acne, and have tried everything from very sensitive products like cetaphil to commercial products such as proactive, and even went to a dermatologist and was prescribed with epiduo.</li>
            <li> Although, because i have dry skin, i am going to continue using my normal moisturizer and use theirs just as a spot treatment.</li>
            <li> Well, I have tried the regular and the sensitive skin formula and both have some pretty heavy strikes againts them.     </li>
            <li> woke up with at least 10 new whiteheads everyday and after cleansing I would get more during the day.</li>
            <li> it started burning like crazy, and turned bright red.</li>
            <li> The most dramatic improvement happens overnight.</li>
            <li> Different products work for different people but every time my acne starts up, I use this for about a week and my skin is completely clear.</li>
            <li> The next day, the whole area, especially the side of my chin where the bumps were, was scaly and dry.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t know what skin type you have, start with the orange regular acnefree products and only switch to this sensitive skin product if you cannot tolerate the reactions/irritations (if any)</li>
            <li> My skin isnt in between not oily and not dry.</li>
            <li> This kit does not dry your skin out</li>
            <li> I had the same worse before it gets better reaction to Proactiv</li>
            <li> applied this to my skin before bed the first night I got it, by no means a generous amount- just a little.</li>
            <li> I was really worried at first because I have really sensitive skin and everything I try causes me to turn red and makes it worse</li>
            <li> I had read all of the great reviews and was convinced it would work :(</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, so I went ahead and bought the sensitive skin system before even trying the other one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Purchased this item because I do have sensitive skin, but not extremely sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I am a long time acne sufferer who still gets pimples as an adult.  </li>
            <li> I have (or should i say had) normal skin with minimal breakouts</li>
            <li> I have always had trouble with acne since high school and tried everything including accutane!!</li>
            <li> Even with this one my skin burned the first few days.  </li>
            <li> it worked the first few days and cleared some of the pimples I had but soon after using this product for about a week I started to get whiteheads.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have super sensitive skin, but products in the past have definitely irritated my face by making dry patches or increasing redness.</li>
            <li> I had acne and extremely dry, sensitive skin and had tried Aveeno, Noxzema, and Proactiv and nothing was working until I bought this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Caution:  Although this is for sensitive skin it did dry my skin out a lot.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather have clear yet dry skin rather than itchy red swollen skin.</li>
            <li> The next day my skin did seem to clear up, but it was dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> : I have very mild acne, only a few trouble spots and blackheads)</li>
            <li> I never had acne as a kid, but starting at 25, I had a few recurring (and large) breakouts.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try Proactiv, because she is young and her skin is a little sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I am 43 years old and over the last few years have been suffering from mild acne for the past year 1/2.</li>
            <li> The big problem is, I scar, so each month I&#x27;d be left with new dark spots on my face after the pimple went away.  </li>
            <li> The scrub has little \\&quot;beads\\&quot; in it, which I&#x27;m not crazy about, as you have to be very careful not to rinse them into your eyes.</li>
            <li> I expected that, though, because it says on the box that if you recently used other topical products previous to this system, when first using it, dryness would occur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the AcneFree Sensitive Skin for two weeks and then stopped.  </li>
            <li> I do have sensitive skin, but I&#x27;ll just go back to my other face lotion.</li>
            <li> far as side effects go, as some other reviewers have mentioned, I initially had drying and peeling.</li>
            <li> I stopped using acne free in the beginning of this year for no apparent reason and my skin has gotten worse.</li>
            <li> When I first started using it, I felt a slight burning sensation so I only used the lotion every other day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 28 years old and for the past couple years have developed moderate acne along my jawline and around my mouth.</li>
            <li> I have tried acne products in the past, and they turned my skin red, itchy and very irritated.  </li>
            <li> It lasts me a long time, too, as I only have to use about a pea sized dollop of the cleanser on my entire face.</li>
            <li> Wow did I notice a difference just after one day of use, not only has the redness of my skin gone down</li>
            <li> I will try to cut back and see what happens, but now I dont want to irritate my face more by adding another moisturizer or facial wash while I am cutting back on the Acnefree.</li>
            <li> Although it did take care of the acne of my face, it left me with red, dry and flaky patches all over my face.</li>
            <li> and then I started to get dried out and thus, new breakouts.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> I only use it at nice just because the smell of the face wash, toner, and lotion is so bad.</li>
            <li> My skin is a touch dry since starting this system, but isn&#x27;t as prone to oiliness as it was before.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my face dry out or make me extra itchy.  </li>
            <li> and this did not make her turn red, itch or dry out.</li>
            <li> My third day of using this product and my skin is EXTREMELY dry.</li>
            <li> As far as applying the Acne Repair Lotion (Step 3)you should not use your fingers to apply the application to your face, instead use less than a pea size amount on (1)</li>
            <li> So far I have noticed a decrease in my acne and less acne hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> I started using AcneFree Sensitive about a month and a half ago.</li>
            <li> It made my skin extremely dry, red, and itchy.</li>
            <li> It works and it doesn&#x27;t irritate or dry up my skin at all, personally.</li>
            <li> , it becomes red and dry and hurt whenever i use it on my acne&#x27;s land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since day one using this my skin has been completely dry and irritated, what finally drove me to write this review is because tonight it made my skin feel like it was burning off my face.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this Kit for my adult daughter after reading a review in Consumer Reports which stated that this product worked as well as Proactiv for about half the price.</li>
            <li> I took my 14 year old to the doctor for her acne and they gave her the standard harsh chemicals to use.</li>
            <li> I have REALLY sensitive skin, and this product makes my skin red, irritated, and after a few days, left my skin dry and flakey.</li>
            <li> A few days after that my cheeks developed very deep zits, almost like cysts.</li>
            <li> I figured because he has red hair and sensitive skin that Proactive was too harsh.</li>
            <li> but I am still getting the big flat red bumps, but I drink a lot of dark soda&#x27;s and not enough water, which does help!!!</li>
            <li> The last month has brought me down to an emotional low that I have never felt before.</li>
            <li> It seems to clear up the acne much faster than Clearasil did, but it does such a bad job at prevention that it really doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> couple days: The next night I used the cleanser and toner, but skipped the spot treatment because it says to use only every other day in the beginning.</li>
            <li> I do this for one week, the next week every other day ,the same way .</li>
            <li> After 1 day my skin began to clear a little.</li>
            <li> After doing research on allergic reactions to this product I&#x27;ve found at least 10 other reviews of people claiming to have the exact same reaction.</li>
            <li> It is a little drying, despite it being the sensitive version, so I do use another moisturizer over it.  </li>
            <li> I had these small under the skin pimples developing on my forehead and mostly up high on my cheekbones</li>
            <li> in my late 30s and this product made me break back out as if I were in high school.  </li>
            <li> I rinsed with cold water, and the burning subsided mostly.</li>
            <li> so I bought this product thinking it would gently clear up the few pimples i got around my face.</li>
            <li> This cleared my face up in just a few days and is keeping it clear.  </li>
            <li> Within a few weeks, my skin was clear again.  </li>
            <li> It helps to control my acne so long as I&#x27;m not pmsing.</li>
            <li> Unlike some treatments, AcneFree Sensitive does not stink or have a heavy odor.  </li>
            <li> Will keep using as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> After just three uses, the skin on my face is swollen, red, rough and itchy.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product but it may not be a long term solution.</li>
            <li> While we find it did help to clear up some acne on each of them in about 7 days, the difference was less than expected.  </li>
            <li> I got white heads, black heads, deep blemishes, etc.  </li>
            <li> The spot treatment is similar to any other benzol peroxide spot treatment you would buy.  </li>
            <li> I cut back to using the moisturizer every other day and the spot treatment as needed.  </li>
            <li> Since the drying has started I have decided that I will likely be using this product every other day.</li>
            <li> but sometimes you just have to spend a little extra to get the proper care.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks daily use (sometimes just once a day depending on the dryness of my skin), my cheeks started to feel extremely itchy.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using any other products with this, and I only use it once a day.  </li>
            <li> The only problem I have now is that I alway have to buy both packs, and the sensitive skin one is hard to find in stores, so I have to order it all the time.</li>
            <li> It works sooooo well that if you misuse it, it will dry your skin.</li>
            <li> For years iv been looking for something I can use that doesn&#x27;t burn my skin or dry it out</li>
            <li> I have eczema and this hasn&#x27;t made me face really dry, but I suppose there&#x27;s still time for that.</li>
            <li> it does dry my face out</li>
            <li> of caution, if your face is not used to BP, it can dry your skin out.  </li>
            <li> I also must mention that I have been using another moisturizer since I began using AcneFree to help combat the dry skin.</li>
            <li> At night i just use step 1, wait for my face to dry and use step 4 from the severe kit that can be bought separately here....</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t leave my skin too dry.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin dry</li>
            <li> So dry it looked like my skin was going to crack.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and there, also my skin gets some what dry.</li>
            <li> Even though I had dry patches, I figured it was doing its job.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t over dry my skin</li>
            <li> It worked, but it was really harsh on my skin and it only had the wash and a spot treatment, so I went to our local King Soopers to get an acne moisturizer to supplement it.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a single breakout since I started this regimen.</li>
            <li> Today, I woke up and didn&#x27;t have single blemish.</li>
            <li> Using the Sensitive Skin version of this product,  I have one or two pimples, but usually none.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not normally one to post reviews</li>
            <li> I started getting frequent breakouts for the past year.</li>
            <li> I have always had some form of acne being just small breakouts to damn near cystic modules underneath the skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does dry the skin out, but only slightly.</li>
            <li> I came home one day last week after work and just broke down.</li>
            <li> One has a very oily complexion and the other only suffers from breakouts along her t-zone area but also has very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> my skin was really dry!</li>
            <li> I would try different products and see slight improvement.</li>
            <li> My skin is even less red</li>
            <li> woke up the next day with 10x more pimples all around my chin area, the next few days got worse and worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the skin repair part or third step, or if it&#x27;s the actual cleanser.</li>
            <li> Normally I buy $6 bottles of Neutrogena and it works well enough without making anything worse.</li>
            <li> Which made the product pretty useless, but I kept using it on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Less red and for once, no new breakouts in the morning!</li>
            <li> and my face became very dry.  </li>
            <li> I started out using it twice a day and noticed my skin got very dry</li>
            <li> Occasionally I&#x27;ll get one or two spots but never a full on breakout.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clear your pimple overnight because no product can do that, but it definitely makes it hardly noticeable!</li>
            <li> It did dry my skin out some in the beginning, but that only lasted a few days.</li>
            <li> the spot treatment and the lotion smell a little, but it doesn&#x27;t last, so you can still use it in the morning and go off to work, and 2)</li>
            <li> after putting the spot treatment on and then the lotion, sometimes your skin gets a little red.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint is the toner doesn&#x27;t last long but IDC!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to use this product every other day from now on since it did dry up my skin.</li>
            <li> By my second day, my breakouts started going down and now I have no acne!</li>
            <li> I had an occasional pimple and had a few bumps on my forehead.</li>
            <li> Definitely buy this product if you are having trouble with acne.</li>
            <li> My face is nearly all one color now instead of having angry red areas caused by those hard-to-treat deep blemishes.  </li>
            <li> It itches all day, even for the next few days.</li>
            <li> I started focusing on that area with absolutely no result and only dried my mouth area out to the point of cracking.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that i was a little skeptical about this product because one i have never heard of it before and two i wasn&#x27;t sure about buying anything that can seriously treat acne out of my local drugstore.</li>
            <li> Now I saw quite a few other reviews reveal the same problem, which I should have checked before I let her try.</li>
            <li> So, in my opinion, it&#x27;s not worth it when I can use a single, cheaper product once a day along with zit cream rather than the hassle of three products twice a day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried Proactive on 2 different occasions to find that my skin cannot handle the wash at all, the skin under my eyes got completely raw...</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to try Acne Free for a long time and wondered how it would work given that my acne is bad.</li>
            <li> Any acne product typically has the sacylic to dry out the blemishes.</li>
            <li> Does not leave skin dry plus it comes with a spot remover and cost half the price of proactive.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Overall, I am super disappointed with this product, I haven&#x27;t seen a single change in my acne with it.</li>
            <li> (effects last 5-10 yrs.), but there was always some lingering acne that never fully went away (usually about 10 pimples at a time).  </li>
            <li> so I tried it again thinking I just used it wrong the first time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need a lot of moisturizer, so I always have lots of that, but run out of the other things.</li>
            <li> it dries even my oily skin, so I recommend to mix the creme with any other hydrating.</li>
            <li> I suggest building a tolerance to any acne products with benzoyl peroxide by doing it once a day or every other day.</li>
            <li> It instantly worked on the small pimples that he had under his chin.</li>
            <li> Save your money and try something else!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Upon running out of any other type of cleanser, I decided to try the cleanser itself.</li>
            <li> Upon running out of any other type of cleanser, I decided to try the cleanser itself.</li>
            <li> There are other lotions out there</li>
            <li> This system on the other hand has both salicylic acid (SA) and 3% benzoyl peroxide (BP)</li>
            <li> It should be noted you should only use a small amount of these products.</li>
            <li> I stopped using the other name brand because their deceiving reorder practices.</li>
            <li> I have combination dry/oily skin, and this doesn&#x27;t over-dry my face like other products</li>
            <li> The only time I break-out now is if I&#x27;m lazy and don&#x27;t wash my face, or if I touch my face a lot.  </li>
            <li> the other over the counter stuff didn&#x27;t (for years).  </li>
            <li> I had some spotty breakouts due to some hormone imbalances.</li>
            <li> once every 10-14 days virtually eliminated my extremely severe acne.</li>
            <li> The cleanser did dry out my face a little</li>
            <li> If anything, trying new products just made it worse.</li>
            <li> I tried Pro active ,</li>
            <li> Early on, I (stupidly) ignored the directions and would only use it occasionally and the results were mixed.</li>
            <li> and I was less than half empty on my expiring kit.</li>
            <li> purchased it to help clear up a few bad spots on my face in preparation for my wedding, in about three weeks I could see a difference, but not as much as I hoped for.</li>
            <li> However, the dark marks on my skin remain.</li>
            <li> have never had such a negative reaction to skin products in my life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered since my late 20&#x27;s with acne and been to several dermatologists for it.</li>
            <li> not fun...</li>
            <li> I wish that they sold these in separates because I would gladly buy the face wash and spot treatment alone, but I would hate to buy the kit and throw out the toner every time.</li>
            <li> I have being using the Proactive green tea moisturizer when my face feels a little dry, but i have never have anything work</li>
            <li> Only within the past year has my skin become problematic where I couldn&#x27;t seem to control it!</li>
            <li> They never came to a head, but my cheeks are large, painful, red bumps all over them.</li>
            <li> but I figured it would be less harsh than the other system AcneFree provides.</li>
            <li> this has completely changed my face,even though i grabbed the AcneFree Sensitive, and at the time my face was so bad i could have gotten the Severe, but i didn&#x27;t know how my skin would react to it.</li>
            <li> My blemishes cleared up within less than a week.</li>
            <li> My face looks slightly flushed after a week</li>
            <li> Two and a half weeks after beginning the regimine, all of my acne is gone.</li>
            <li> I also recommend  using pantothenic acid pills, because when your skin dries out you shouldn&#x27;t use the cream for a day or less, this will probably cause some areas on your face to get oily so these pills will stop that,</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any major improvements, but the acne also wasn&#x27;t getting any worse.</li>
            <li> I still have a few large lumps under the skin, but they are no longer red, inflamed, or painful.</li>
            <li> It did dry out my skin pretty bad, but I just switched moisturizers.</li>
            <li> When I first began using it, I didn&#x27;t see a difference right away and the moisturizer seemed to give my skin a weird texture, so I was initially disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical of trying new acne systems.</li>
            <li> Within the 1st day of using I noticed a change, and by the end of the week, not only was the acne on my cheeks GONE, but so are the dark spots they leave behind.  </li>
            <li> and then a few black heads at my cheek bone area.</li>
            <li> I just mix in a small amount of the stronger one about every other day...</li>
            <li> I have used it for a little over a week and my face, neck, &amp; chest</li>
            <li> However, I started using just the cleanser for a little while and within two weeks started using the moisturizer as well</li>
            <li> Now after almost one week, the rash still stays with a little improvement.</li>
            <li> It is a little drying, but as someone with combination skin, that&#x27;s not an issue for me.  </li>
            <li> 4 starts because it&#x27;s a little drying</li>
            <li> I am trying to be patient and have hope, but on day three, I woke up with a itchy red race, which looked like sunburn, and really uncomfortable dry face.</li>
            <li> So, don&#x27;t be afraid to try the new product if the other one worked for you.</li>
            <li> A few days after using this my skin got worse and had tons of little tiny whiteheads all over my face.</li>
            <li> (I.E. Big Lots)I should&#x27;ve listened to the bad reviews and stayed far away.</li>
            <li> After using the products just a few days, my face cleared up.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed that the marks left behind from pimples seem to fade away quicker.</li>
            <li> few breakouts I get.</li>
            <li> I immediately felt an itching sensation on the bottom part of my chin where the few pimples I had were.</li>
            <li> It has taken away a few of them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update after a few weeks to see if anything has changed.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t like to waste money.</li>
            <li> I have used everything like others, but sometimes i have improvement for a few weeks, maybe a few months</li>
            <li> and i thought then maybe they were too harsh for my skin</li>
            <li> I found that this product actually made my skin worse.  </li>
            <li> It dried my face out, but it worked.</li>
            <li> I can use the spot cream/lotion on pimples that pop up randomly and they tend to completely disappear within 24 - 48 hours.</li>
            <li> Believe me when I say that this product can definitely make your acne much worse than it was before.</li>
            <li> My breakouts are almost completely dried up and gone</li>
            <li> /&gt;Within just a few days, my cystic stuff was gone.</li>
            <li> It just oozes out and that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> The worst part was that I could do nothing to treat the new acne due to the fact that my skin became overly sensitive to every other product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it about a month and a half and have seen a small amount if results.</li>
            <li> When I had horrific chin acne for years, I tried all I could think of in using at the health food stores, I even tried acnefree original and it just left all my skin oily,tender, and blotchy no matter what I was using, until they introduced this to the market</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been wary of trying Proactive or any of these other sets because they use the same ingredients as everything else.</li>
            <li> the original is green at the base).</li>
            <li> I ordered this to tame</li>
            <li> Im in my early 20&#x27;s and in these pass 4 months is the first time i seen my face brake out horribly.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, the third step (lotion) stung very bad on my skin.</li>
            <li> My son who is 13.5 has pretty bad back acne that has gotten a lot worse in the past 6 months.</li>
            <li> but this is also the first acne product that contains benzoyl peroxide that has not caused bad irritation to my skin.</li>
            <li> When my son was almost a year old and my skin was still a mess post-pregnancy, I was desperate.  </li>
            <li> Although, I will admit, it did clear up massive pimples within a day, but what happened next was awful.</li>
            <li> MY ENTIRE FACE FROM WHERE I USED THAT LOTION CRAP has completely peeled off and dried up</li>
            <li> In my late 20&#x27;s now, I started experiencing adult acne about 6 months ago and didn&#x27;t want to pay the expensive price for proactive.  </li>
            <li> Acnefree cost me at least $10 less than Proactive would have in a store.  </li>
            <li> While my face is not completely clear, I have noticed a dramatic reduction in the size and quantity of my breakouts.</li>
            <li> I used it for two weeks and saw very little improvement in both redness and breakouts.</li>
            <li> , my acne is very minimal and when I do breakout, it&#x27;s not half as bad as it was before.</li>
            <li> Was on oral antibiotic in the past, planned for pregnancy and stopped the meds.</li>
            <li> but I can get past this.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a small trade-off in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Doing so will prevent excessive irritation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It worked for existing pimples and small zits.  </li>
            <li> I have been a user of acnefree products for the past three years.</li>
            <li> This kit you can usually find at bigt lots or 5 below</li>
            <li> The problem is, she also suffers from eczema and has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> AFter a week, I returned to using the benzoyle peroxide twice a day, and have had no more dryness/peeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it more stars if it didn&#x27;t smell so terribly.</li>
            <li> The bottles are a bit small, though.</li>
            <li> Remember try it on small area of your face.</li>
            <li> I avoid makeup usually, but I do wear it about twice a week.</li>
            <li> It feels so soothing, and I usually end my regimen with an SPF lotion as opposed to using step 3 of the system.</li>
            <li> Twice a day everyday!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t be lazy about it though</li>
            <li> I have been using this product off an on for the past two years.  </li>
            <li> I am hoping this will work just as well if not better.</li>
            <li> In the last year, they have been really bad (worse than my teen years).</li>
            <li> I now get at least 1 pimple a week and have had small bumps under my skin on my forehead which i never use to have.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t use a moisturizer, you will dry out and you will be in worse shape than it was with the acne!  </li>
            <li> I hardly use the terminator, cleanser lasts a while</li>
            <li> I also think you could irritate your skin if you scrubbed too hard with them.  </li>
            <li> I bought this system a little over a year ago and it worked wonders!!</li>
            <li> I guess I should&#x27;ve listened to the bad reviews and stayed far away.</li>
            <li> My one complaint is that you can&#x27;t buy each product seperately.</li>
            <li> I can actually not wear make up now and not look crazy.</li>
            <li> I have spent lots of derms and expensive skin care for acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 20s</li>
            <li> My skin went through some hormonal changes lately and I was dealing with acne in my 50</li>
            <li> I woke up the next morning feeling sunburnt, my skin itching like crazy.</li>
            <li> I have never had chicken pox, but I imagine it would be somewhat similar to that.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to have any negative effects.</li>
            <li> I believe it is step 3, the lotion which causes the problem- at least for me.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to have any negative effects.</li>
            <li> I believe it is step 3, the lotion which causes the problem- at least for me.</li>
            <li> It has a slight smell to it, but it is very subtle.</li>
            <li> My skin looked horrid/gross and it lasted for, at least, two weeks.</li>
            <li> Even the blemishes from the bumps i would pick at are slowly fading.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this system twice a day for the past 4 months and my face has never been clearer!  </li>
            <li> I have maybe had 1 or 2 small pimples since I have started to use this!</li>
            <li> I suspected these tubes and bottles would end up in the drawer with all the other failed attempts.</li>
            <li> Now at 31, I&#x27;ve been continuously broken out for the past five months.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have very scared skin to deal with now for all the years of bad acne...  </li>
            <li> - they are serious when they say avoid the eye area.</li>
            <li> I would have such a bad reaction.</li>
            <li> only bad thing is that it went up</li>
            <li> I had been using Velocity by Mary K for years, as it seemed to be the ONLY face wash that I didn&#x27;t have a bad reaction to.</li>
            <li> I have NEVER had skin this bad in my entire life.</li>
            <li> Too bad I get a reaction because this was and still is (but only on occasion)</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I ended up returning the product as a whole and was disappointed.</li>
            <li> and he said I was having a horrible reaction to this product and to stop it right away.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Because of the dry painful skin on my face, I stopped using this product.</li>
            <li> and I still have extremely dry, painful, and tender skin at the corners of my eyes.</li>
            <li> am now on the fourth day of this horrible mess, I cannot see a dermatologist for another two weeks.</li>
            <li> It was much worse than when I was in my teens, and had gotten to the point where I felt truly embarrassed about my skin.</li>
            <li> Then my skin got used to the product and it stopped working, and made my skin worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still breaking out worse than I was before I tried this</li>
            <li> (sometimes worse than before)</li>
            <li> But it continually got worse and worse.</li>
            <li> so confused that if i allergies this item or not ...</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Non irritating and non drying\\&quot;&lt;br</li>
            <li> as when I was a teenager, but pimples are never welcome.  </li>
            <li> no cover up could mask it not to mention plain water on it burnt like crazy.</li>
            <li> I do not, but I find that every other product dries my skin out so bad that I flake.</li>
            <li> Once I turned 19 though, I began getting horrible hormonal breakouts on my chin that would result in huge, painful acne cysts.</li>
            <li> I hate saying that a product should be discontinued, but this one went to the top of my list on worst products ever made.  </li>
            <li> My red blemishes have slowly disappear, leaving some nasty scars.</li>
            <li> but alas, I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my 12 yr old grandson who is having a terrible time with his forehead.  </li>
            <li> but then its like my face rejects it and goes back into a very bad breakouts.</li>
            <li> So I have had very bad skin since Middle School</li>
            <li> I was so sad when Target stopped carrying it,</li>
            <li> After 3 days my face was indeed rid of all pimples, HOWEVER it was replaced by an itchy red sunburn-like rash which has been very uncomfortable!!</li>
            <li> I thought that proactive would work for me, but unfortunately it did not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to switch out my expensive sheets for cheaper ones because I use it at night</li>
            <li> If you have something that works for you, even if it doesn&#x27;t work perfectly- do not buy this.</li>
            <li> If you have something that works for you, even if it doesn&#x27;t work perfectly- do not buy this.</li>
            <li> Sorry won&#x27;t try it again.</li>
            <li> Weird I know,</li>
            <li> so they somehow trap you to continue buying their extremely expensive product.</li>
            <li> It was so uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I kept using the cleanser because I was afraid it would get worse if I just stopped the treatment.</li>
            <li> unfortunately, my results have been horrific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so anyways i stood there and determined which yet fail product i was gonna buy and take home,</li>
            <li> I have had really bad acne for years and it has gotten worse.</li>
            <li> I am someone that picks at my skin if i see the tiniest black head or pimple (which is a terrible habit).</li>
            <li> That stuff is expensive, but it worked and I never had really bad drying, peeling, or cracking.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m going through menopause, I was breaking out like crazy.   </li>
            <li> Also, the lotion that comes in this kit STINKS.</li>
            <li> I was in Walgreens about a month ago and decided to try this out because I was feeling desperate after a breakout on cheeks.</li>
            <li> They itched like crazy.</li>
            <li> I now have acne all over my face for the past months because of this horrible product.</li>
            <li> started breaking out worse than ever!!</li>
            <li> Sorry to say that I&#x27;m just disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I still have this hideous extremely uncomfortable rash!</li>
            <li> After dealing with bad break outs I got desperate.</li>
            <li> this product has an extremely unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> It was very expensive and made no difference.  </li>
            <li> Its even getting rid of the impossible nose blackheads.</li>
            <li> The cleanser doesn&#x27;t smell that bad</li>
            <li> The bad news:    </li>
            <li> I was hoping it was just a fluke from switching products after 16 years, but my acne hasn&#x27;t been this bad since I started puberty.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had any bad skin irritation or anything.  </li>
            <li> I told them what happened and how bad of a reaction I had</li>
            <li> I have never had acne so bad in my life</li>
            <li> BAD DECISION.</li>
            <li> My mom had bought this for me because I was suffering really badly with my acne.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had an bad reactions with it at all.</li>
            <li> I had really bad acne a couple of years ago, and I tried everything nothing else seems to be working for me.  </li>
            <li> I had acne when I was 11-13 really bad</li>
            <li> BAD IDEA.</li>
            <li> Now I have to walk around looking like I had a bad chemical peel.  </li>
            <li> I saw a video of a girl that had rosacea and said that this product help and even though my rosacea is not as bad as hers</li>
            <li> was having a particularly bad break out and passed this product in Target.</li>
            <li> I had bad acne on my forehead and with this it was gone in about a week.</li>
            <li> This included whiteheads and also painful cystic acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sick of this crap.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 27 and hate that I still have acne like a teenager, so this was a Godsend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had annoying acne since puberty and this set changed my skin dramatically.</li>
            <li> This helps with the painful cyst acne you get at that ttime!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s brutal).</li>
            <li> and I have started to break out very badly in the areas this was applied.</li>
            <li> Disappointed because this product does work!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I was wrong!!!  </li>
            <li> It was especially bad with the hormonal fluctuations of my menstrual cycle.</li>
            <li> *a horrible combination</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was awful!</li>
            <li> I felt awful, and looked awful!</li>
            <li> the hydrating acne repair lotion and spot treatment gave me a terrible, itching and burning rash on my face!</li>
            <li> the cheeks, the chin it was terrible.  </li>
            <li> Nothing helped and I was resigned to having miserable skin forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This review is for the sensitive skin version.  The regular version dries out my skin and causes more acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have done three rounds of Accutane in my life (starting when it was an experimental drug) to keep my acne under control.  It has worked wonders for me (effects last 5-10 yrs.), but there was always some lingering acne that never fully went away (usually about 10 pimples at a time).  I have tried so many different treatments.  Proactive did nothing for me.  La Roche Posay was the second best, leaving me with about 3-5 pimples at a time.  I have never been able to use makeup on my skin...not even Clinique which is supposedly noncomedogenic/hypoallergenic/etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I found this product.  It is by far the best. Using the Sensitive Skin version of this product,  I have one or two pimples, but usually none.  I was so sad when Target stopped carrying it, but then I found it on Amazon.  (Thank you, Amazon.)  Please note that when you first use this, you will likely have extra pimples for a day or two as everything comes to the surface.  Stick with it.  It will be worth it by day 5.</li>
            <li> I have (or should i say had) normal skin with minimal breakouts so I bought this product thinking it would gently clear up the few pimples i got around my face. I followed the directions and it felt like i had just poured acid onto my face and for the next 3 hours my face was red. I waited 2 days and my acne had no improvement so I tried it again thinking I just used it wrong the first time. The 2nd time it burned just as much. Over the next few days even more acne than I had before started to appear in spots i never had acne before. Before I used this i very rarely had acne on my forehead, but now i constantly have it. It also appears around my mouth and on my cheeks now when I only treated next to my nose, on my nose, and a spot on my forehead. My friend who has regularly visited dermatologists for most her life told me that this product probably knocked off the balance of my natural oils and that if you look at the ingredients and the amounts of them that this isn&#x27;t different than a regular acne product; aka: its not sensitive at all.&lt;br /&gt;This happened 3 months ago, I stumbled on this product when actually looking for another product in hopes of correcting what this did to my face. I now have acne all over my face for the past months because of this horrible product. Please don&#x27;t be fooled by the name.</li>
            <li> I love the moisturizer that they have in this pack! I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin so I use the regular Acne Free system and it really works, but it does not come with a moisturizer, and when I try other moisturizers they eventually break me out, so I decided to try the moisturizer that&#x27;s in the Acne Free Sensitive pack, and it works like a dream! The only problem I have now is that I alway have to buy both packs, and the sensitive skin one is hard to find in stores, so I have to order it all the time. I wish they would get it back into the stores, or better yet sell the moisturizer by itself!</li>
            <li> I have mild to moderate acne plus dry, sensitive skin. This acne system works very well for me. My skin is a touch dry since starting this system, but isn&#x27;t as prone to oiliness as it was before. My skin looks better than it has in months!. I&#x27;ve also tried Murad&#x27;s acne system, and I think Acne Free delivers better results--at a fraction of the price! Also, A.F. is a three-step system, whereas Murad is four steps. I&#x27;ve notice my compliance has increased with A.F. simply because there are fewer steps to follow.</li>
            <li> Something beautiful and wonderful because Amazon quality and originality code</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit in hopes of helping my struggle with acne.  The price was definitley a good price and made it worth buying to try. The cleanser has a nice texture but did not feel like it truely cleaned my face. I would wash once before with a basic face wash to remove my make up and follow with the AcneFree cleanser.  The hydrator has a lightweight feel.  The spot treatment is similar to any other benzol peroxide spot treatment you would buy.  This kit is definitely worth trying because of the price if you are struggling with acne.  I have not found anything to help with my acne in ten years so I am not suprised this did not work for me.</li>
            <li> This Product did not work for me.  To be fair, I only used it for a week. I had an occasional pimple and had a few bumps on my forehead. A few days after using this my skin got worse and had tons of little tiny whiteheads all over my face. It also dried up my skin and it started pealing, The moisturizer dried up my skin even more!   The terminator was Ok it did seem to work on developing zits so I would keep that tube in case i start to develop one in the future. I don&#x27;t know what would have happened had I continued but I switched to Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser and my skin is starting to heal up.   What I discovered about my acne prone skin is that less is more.</li>
            <li> I have had moderate acne ( at times severe) since I was 13- I&#x27;m now 32.  I have tried Proactiv (didn&#x27;t work for me), prescription retinol products (didn&#x27;t work) and this worked for me! I have been using it for a month now. I have very fair and sensitive skin, but this product didn&#x27;t irritate it.  I have also had some success with birth control pills (Orthotricyclen-Lo) at controlling my breakouts.  This product does NOT address scars, so if you have red spots or skin texture problems, that will require another course of action.  You have to use this product every day or it won&#x27;t work so well.  If you have sensitive skin, using once at night is best, and a sun screen SPF 15 and higher is good (I like Olay Complete Sensitive). For me, the best part is that this product is fairly priced and available at your local CVS, Target, or Walgreens. Like with any product, if this doesn&#x27;t work for you, keep trying.  Everyone is different, but there&#x27;s always hope.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin, and although this is supposed to be for sensitive skin.. my skin cannot handle this product as well. I cannot stop itching my skin, it is redder than before, with tons more white heads. I guess you would need to keep continuing to see if it would help the zits, but need a new product to recover from this one.:(</li>
            <li> I am 52 yrs old and hadn&#x27;t had acne concerns in years.  Now that I&#x27;m going through menopause, I was breaking out like crazy.   This cleared my face up in just a few days and is keeping it clear.  Great product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I have always had trouble with acne since high school and tried everything including accutane!! I tried the regular acnefree and it worked pretty well (at least compared to everything else I have tried, it worked the best) however it did dry my face out which can be irritating especially in the winter months. I decided to try the AcneFree sensitive skin to see if maybe it wouldn&#x27;t dry my skin out as much. This was a mistake!!!!!  After 3 days my face was indeed rid of all pimples, HOWEVER it was replaced by an itchy red sunburn-like rash which has been very uncomfortable!! On top of that the skin on my face has swelled up a bit to add to the misery!!  If you have sensitive skin I would recommend sticking to the regular AcneFree because it only uses BP and not both BP and salicyclic acid like the sensitive skin regimen does and I&#x27;m pretty sure that is why my face swelled and got irritated was because of the combination of the two medications. I&#x27;d rather have clear yet dry skin rather than itchy red swollen skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for almost 2 years now and I am very happy with the results. 1-2 months after using it, my face started to clear and it has been clear ever since. Suffered adult acne for 10 years, I am now in my early 30s and I am just happy something finally worked. Was on oral antibiotic in the past, planned for pregnancy and stopped the meds. Acne free worked well and got me through pregnancy as well with clear skin. I noticed that I start to break out if I don&#x27;t use so it is definitely doing its job. I only hope it could be sold separately  because I run out of the lotion first more than anything else. I hardly use the terminator, cleanser lasts a while but I always have to buy the whole kit just to get the lotion.</li>
            <li> Thats a good product, would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid-40s and have been suffering from ever-worsening acne for some years. It was much worse than when I was in my teens, and had gotten to the point where I felt truly embarrassed about my skin. It was especially bad with the hormonal fluctuations of my menstrual cycle. I tried MANY different products, both over the counter and prescribed by my doctor. Nothing seemed to make the slightest difference. I had tried Pro-Active, as well -- nothing. Acne Free Sensitive has made a HUGE improvement in my skin! I won&#x27;t say it is perfect all the time, but blemishes are much fewer, smaller and clear up much faster, without leaving a mark. It worked better when I started being fairly liberal with the step 3 (benzoil peroxide) cream. My one complaint is that you can&#x27;t buy each product seperately. I don&#x27;t need a lot of moisturizer, so I always have lots of that, but run out of the other things. Bottom line: I think everyone&#x27;s skin is very individual, so this product may not work for you -- but lordy, I sure am grateful it has worked so well for me!  Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: This product has now been changed. The new one comes with a \\&quot;toner\\&quot;, a scrub and the acne cream. I was worried about not having any moisturizer (I didn&#x27;t use a lot of it, but some), but the new acne cream seems to have moisturizer in it. The scrub has little \\&quot;beads\\&quot; in it, which I&#x27;m not crazy about, as you have to be very careful not to rinse them into your eyes. I also think you could irritate your skin if you scrubbed too hard with them.  I don&#x27;t use the toner at all -- I spoke to an excellent dermatologist about \\&quot;toners\\&quot; and he said they do nothing whatsoever. I am happy to report that I am still having good results just using the scrub (not rubbing too hard) and the cream. The cream is very nice and doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel dry or sore -- at least that&#x27;s how it is for me. So, don&#x27;t be afraid to try the new product if the other one worked for you. I was worried, but give it a thumbs up!  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SECOND UPDATE: I have now found that combining the Acne Free \\&quot;Terminator 10\\&quot; maximum strength product with the cream in the \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot; package works very well. I just mix in a small amount of the stronger one about every other day...you can moderate this for your individual needs by adding more, less or varying how many days in between. I have virtually no acne at all now, so if you are finding you need maybe a little more than what this one alone can do, but can&#x27;t handle the stronger ones on their own, give this method a try. Doing wonders for me, though the Sensitive one is pretty good on its own.</li>
            <li> I have tried acne products in the past, and they turned my skin red, itchy and very irritated.  Has anyone with very sensitive skin tried this?</li>
            <li> I have been using this system for about 2 weeks now.  Already, I have noticed a huge change!  My face has not gotten anymore acne and the acne that I did have is nearly cleared up.  I highly recommend trying this out.  It doesn&#x27;t make my face dry out or make me extra itchy.  I love it!</li>
            <li> My daughter just entered her teens and on came the acne. She had tons on her forehead and hairline. We tried spot treatment, noxema, oxy, etc. and nothing worked fast or well. Figured we try one more before seeing a dermatologist. Glad we did because this did the trick! Saw big results overnight! Was 90% better day 2 and has remained under control (when used consistently). She has very sensitive skin and this did not make her turn red, itch or dry out. It&#x27;s given her self esteem a much needed boost. :D I strongly recommend this!!!</li>
            <li> I originally bought the regular system, only to find it really dried my face out at first..but after while it really worked! I ordered this thinking since it was sensitive, it would work better. Overal i have seen a difference in the clearness of my face, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased it to help clear up a few bad spots on my face in preparation for my wedding, in about three weeks I could see a difference, but not as much as I hoped for. I&#x27;m still on the search for a great face product!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my young daughter who is getting acne quite early. The lotion I got from a dermatologist was drying out her skin. This stuff really works and is not irritating. My little girl is back to how SHE should look; beautiful skin. I am very pleased with this product, wish it had been around when I was a teen.</li>
            <li> I have been using AcneFree for about 3 months now and it works great! At first I thought \\&quot;It&#x27;ll probably be like all the rest of the acne products out there that claim to clear acne overnight.\\&quot; After 2 weeks using this, I take back my earlier thought. The cleanser doesn&#x27;t smell that bad and it&#x27;s really smooth on the skin. The moisturizer was good, I just prefer not to use it. Here comes the best part, the terminator. I think it&#x27;s fair to call the terminator pure genius when it comes to clearing pimples. It doesn&#x27;t clear your pimple overnight because no product can do that, but it definitely makes it hardly noticeable! 2 days with the terminator and I guarantee that pimple will be gone. I have had acne for about 5 years. I am 18 so everyone knows how much you breakout in your teens. My face was cleared within 3 months. I rarely breakout now, because I&#x27;m using AcneFree every other day. Oh and that statement on the box claiming that it&#x27;s better than ProActive? It&#x27;s TRUE. I back AcneFree 100% on that one. Definitely buy this product if you are having trouble with acne.</li>
            <li> I started AcneFree Senstitive on a Saturday and by Tuesday I had blisters all over my face and it was super itchy, plus my face was peeling!  I had a doctor look me over and he said I was having a horrible reaction to this product and to stop it right away.  Since then I have been using Hydrocordisone 1% everyday and it really has subsided.  I highly suggest that if anyone wants to try this product to do a skin test first.  I had no idea I would have such a bad reaction.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different acne washes because like many young adults, I have pimples everywhere. I thought that proactive would work for me, but unfortunately it did not. It made my face break out even more. I found this product and I am glad I did. It works miracles. It cleared up my face in like 2-3 days. I have learned that my skin is pretty sensitive so I have to lower to cleaning my face every other day, but that still helps so much! I am very pleased with my results! I hope this helps others the way it does for me.</li>
            <li> Absolutely looooooove this has cleared my acne and scrars price has went up alot was only 9.99 when I purchased only bad thing is that it went up</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use many products due to my sensitive, acne prone skin, but this has been a delight. I haven&#x27;t had a single breakout since I started this regimen.</li>
            <li> This one is working! It doesn&#x27;t help completely, but it reduced all my skin problems for 50%.&lt;br /&gt;However it dries even my oily skin, so I recommend to mix the creme with any other hydrating.</li>
            <li> I have used this system in the past and it is amazing. My blemishes cleared up within less than a week. I am someone that picks at my skin if i see the tiniest black head or pimple (which is a terrible habit). I stopped using acne free in the beginning of this year for no apparent reason and my skin has gotten worse. I now get at least 1 pimple a week and have had small bumps under my skin on my forehead which i never use to have. I started to use acne free again and my skin has gotten so much better! I 100% recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I really love this product. I have had really bad acne for years and it has gotten worse. I have been wanting to try Acne Free for a long time and wondered how it would work given that my acne is bad. I can actually not wear make up now and not look crazy. I am on the auto ship for this product and really like it. It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, smells good, and it has a good feel to the skin. I have spent lots of derms and expensive skin care for acne. This product is the best and I always tell everyone about it.</li>
            <li> Well, I have tried the regular and the sensitive skin formula and both have some pretty heavy strikes againts them.     The good news:    * Both products work, the minimal amount of skin issues I have get cleared up quickly.    The bad news:    * The regular formula will bleach out almost any natural fabric in comes into contact with. I ruined several towels and t-shirts even after letting the product absorb in AND washing my hands. Any sweat coming off your face and neck will have the benzoyl peroxide in it.    * The sensitive skin formula isn&#x27;t so sensitive. The cleanser is GREAT. Love it. But calling the moisturizer \\&quot;pH-balanced\\&quot; is a joke. My face looks slightly flushed after a week and my skin is all flakey. I don&#x27;t call that moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I must be the exception because I haven&#x27;t read anything about this happening to anyone else!&lt;br /&gt;I have used Proactive for the past couple of years and was getting low so decided to try Acne Free because its cheaper &amp; has great reviews. I have used it for a little over a week and my face, neck, &amp; chest (everywhere I was using it) started breaking out worse than ever!! I have very fair, sensitive skin which I why I got the Sensitive skin kind. I had read all of the great reviews and was convinced it would work :( After my skin started to get worse when I began using it, I searched all over the internet to see if maybe it was normal for your skin to break out before it got better but could not find any accounts of this happening from the use of Acne Free- PLUS the box says you will see results in 3 days- well, the only results I saw in 3 days were more pimples!!!!!! It could be that I am having an allergic reaction to on of the added ingredients, there&#x27;s no way to tell but I am taking it back because it&#x27;s obviously not going to work for me like it does for most!I am going to buy more Proactive today because I didnt realize how good I had it. Plus I am going to be more disciplined about using it morning &amp; night because I know that makes all the difference. Sometimes you just have to pay more to get something that works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****On a good note***** I was very pleased with the fact that the face wash actually CLEANSED my face, no makeup removing cloths required which is unlike Proactive which requires that I remove makeup before using the face wash because it simply doesn&#x27;t do the job :  an added expense!!!) They need to hurry up and make Proactive cheaper in my opinion! They&#x27;ve made enough money already!!!</li>
            <li> I have suffered of mild acne through all my life and I have tried so many products. Some have been prescribed and very pricey. This one has help me significantly. I have always had blackhead and breakouts and AcneFree has diminished them a lot. I noticed that my skin color in getting even and the texture smoother since the blackheads and whiteheads made me looked as if I had Melasma.   It has not cleared my skin completely but I will try the severe one to see how it works.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 of these systems for my granddaughter who has a severe acne problem.  After 3 weeks, her face looks wonderful and only after about 1/2 of the first package used.  Great product at a very competitive price.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I used it as directed and within two days my skin was clear. I do agree with other reviewers--it would be nice to be able to purchase items separately as they do not all \\&quot;end\\&quot; at the same time. The moisturizing gets used up first even though it only takes a tiny bit to do its job.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this product. When you use it, make sure and use the little tub in areas you only need to help with acne. It works sooooo well that if you misuse it, it will dry your skin. If you&#x27;re looking to get clear and beautiful skin, i highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Perfect.  Works better then proactive!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 20 and still struggling with my skin. I have moderate acne, but extremely sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve been to so many dermatologists over the years, but all of their products irritated my skin too much. I think this product was different for me because of the time released benzoyl peroxide. Normally I can&#x27;t use bp because my skin will get extremely red and start peeling, no matter how much lotion I use or how infrequent I use the medicine. The first day I used these products, my skin looked immediately better. Less red and for once, no new breakouts in the morning! That lasted for about three days and then I started to get dried out and thus, new breakouts. I wish I had started using this in the summer instead, because then it would have been perfect! Now I use a very mild cleanser in the morning and then their lotion and spot treatment. I can use all three at night, but with my aveeno calming lotion on top of everything. It helps to control my acne so long as I&#x27;m not pmsing. I&#x27;m not going to claim it&#x27;s a miracle product, but this is definitely the first kit out of the many I&#x27;ve tried that has consistently helped to control my breakouts.</li>
            <li> I got this 3 days ago and I started using it day and night. The first time I used it, the third step (lotion) stung very bad on my skin. I assumed it was because it working so I just dealt with it. My third day of using this product and my skin is EXTREMELY dry. My pimples and breakouts did clear up but there is so much cracking and dryness. I&#x27;m going to use this product every other day from now on since it did dry up my skin.</li>
            <li> My 11 year old started having acne problems about a year ago.  All over her forehead, cheeks, nose and chin.  Bought her some acne wash and cream at Wal-Mart (don&#x27;t remember the name), it didn&#x27;t work.  We tried the Neutrogena SkinId system for her.  It was very expensive and made no difference.  I was hesitant to try Proactiv, because she is young and her skin is a little sensitive.  The reviews for Proactiv on thie site convinced me that was the right choice.  We have been very happy with AcneFree Sensitive so far.  She has been using it for about 6 weeks.  She still has a little acne on her forehead, but her cheeks, chin and nose are smooth and clear.  One of her complaints of the SkinId system was that it \\&quot;hurt her face\\&quot;, she says this doesn&#x27;t do that.  I do think when this runs out we will try the regular version to see if that can help wipe out the rest of the acne on her forehead.  But I think when someone with sensitive skin is starting this program it is smart to start with the lower concentration first.</li>
            <li> For years iv been looking for something I can use that doesn&#x27;t burn my skin or dry it out and iv finally found it! I got this yesterday (right on time and I thought it was going to take longer but they sent it out the day I ordered) and have use it twice and I already see results. So far the only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell because of the tea tree in it (I could never stand the smell lol) but I can get past this. I was going to try Proactive but it costs a little to much for me right now, but this is something I can afford and so far it works! I was really worried at first because I have really sensitive skin and everything I try causes me to turn red and makes it worse but so far that hasn&#x27;t happened with this yay! So far I do recommend this before you try Proactive. If anything changes I will repost. Thank you for making a product that I can finally use!</li>
            <li> This product is not for sensitive skin. It burns a lot</li>
            <li> tried everything and nothing worked, so i decided to try this. worked in two days. the lotion/spot treatment is amazing. clears up skin and moisturizes at the same time. would re buy this over and over.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical of trying new acne systems. I don&#x27;t have super sensitive skin, but products in the past have definitely irritated my face by making dry patches or increasing redness. I didn&#x27;t have any of those problems with this AcneFree system. When I first began using it, I didn&#x27;t see a difference right away and the moisturizer seemed to give my skin a weird texture, so I was initially disappointed. However, I started using just the cleanser for a little while and within two weeks started using the moisturizer as well and it has worked great since then. My experience leads me to believe that skin might have an adjustment period when you first start using the system but eventually, your skin will hopefully get used to it. I also found that it needs to be used daily, sometimes more than once, as the package advises. Early on, I (stupidly) ignored the directions and would only use it occasionally and the results were mixed. Since I started using it (cleanser and moisturizer), it&#x27;s been much more effective. Obvious, maybe, but it may explain why people aren&#x27;t having great results.  My one criticism is the fact that the moisturizer and the Spot Treatment definitely stain fabrics. I&#x27;ve had to switch out my expensive sheets for cheaper ones because I use it at night but it&#x27;s a small trade-off in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Until I started my sophomore year of high school I always had clear skin naturally, but toward the middle of that school year my skin took a nose dive.  I would break out severely out of no where, and before one break out had cleared another one would start.  I got white heads, black heads, deep blemishes, etc.  You name the type of acne and I had it.  I had been trying every store bought cleanser I could get my hands on for 6 years.  Every last one dried out my skin so much that I looked like I was turning into some kind of reptile.  Recently I gave Zap Zyt another try.  It worked, but it was really harsh on my skin and it only had the wash and a spot treatment, so I went to our local King Soopers to get an acne moisturizer to supplement it.  While browsing I saw this system was on sale for just $10 when a moisturizer by itself cost $7, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot.  I have been using it faithfully twice a day since Sunday, January 1, 2012.  Today is Friday, January 6, 2012.  I turn 21 tomorrow and I can finally say that I have found an acne cleansing system that works for me without turning my skin scaley.  My acne has cleared by about 60% in just 6 days.  My face is nearly all one color now instead of having angry red areas caused by those hard-to-treat deep blemishes.  I can honestly say I&#x27;m glad that tried this system and that I would recommend it to anyone who needs something gentle that works.  Unlike some treatments, AcneFree Sensitive does not stink or have a heavy odor.  The smell is light and actually pleasant.  However, I will tell you that if you have severe acne like I did you will probably not notice a difference in 24 hours like the box says.  Give it about a week though and you&#x27;ll clear up nicely &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> This product is super harsh, not for sensitive skin! After only 3 uses my face was peeling and very sensitive to touch.</li>
            <li> I started The AcneFree Sensitive Skin Acne System a few days ago and am very pleased to say that this is the product for me! Wow did I notice a difference just after one day of use, not only has the redness of my skin gone down but this is also the first acne product that contains benzoyl peroxide that has not caused bad irritation to my skin. I am 14 and suffer from hormonal acne, and have tried everything from very sensitive products like cetaphil to commercial products such as proactive, and even went to a dermatologist and was prescribed with epiduo. But I did not get nearly as great results from those products as I did with the AcneFree 24 Hour Clearing System. And I really love the feeling of this product because not only do these products smell great but they also feel great on my skin but they are also very affordable! A couple of things to remember is that because of the benzoyl peroxide you may experience some mild irritation such as an itch here and there but should not experience severe irritation. I chose the gentle system for my skin because it only has one step with the benzoyl peroxide. I suggest building a tolerance to any acne products with benzoyl peroxide by doing it once a day or every other day. As far as applying the Acne Repair Lotion (Step 3)you should not use your fingers to apply the application to your face, instead use less than a pea size amount on (1) Your Forehead (2) Your Chin (3 &amp; 4) Your cheeks, and apply with the side of the palm of your hand in an outward motion. Doing so will prevent excessive irritation. Well wish you all luck and hope this helped!! &lt;3</li>
            <li> Happy with it. Bought it for my daughter. So far, seems to be doing the job, that&#x27;s if she uses like she supposed to, lol. If she skips a day or two, it shows.delivered fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 25, and the earliest age I remember having severe acne was 9; before that I simply had very mild acne. For the last full 16 years I had been using clearasil. It kept my acne pretty mild, but it still wasn&#x27;t doing as well as I really wanted. AcneFree had really good reviews overall so I thought I&#x27;d give it a chance.  I&#x27;ve been using it about a month now, and the only difference I&#x27;ve noticed is more acne. It seems to clear up the acne much faster than Clearasil did, but it does such a bad job at prevention that it really doesn&#x27;t matter. As soon as one disappears three more appear. I was hoping it was just a fluke from switching products after 16 years, but my acne hasn&#x27;t been this bad since I started puberty. It may be because I chose the mild version of the product rather than regular, but I was worried that if I switched between products directly my skin would get really hurt. Even with this one my skin burned the first few days.  Sorry to say that I&#x27;m just disappointed. I wonder if things would be different if I hadn&#x27;t stuck to one product for 16 years...maybe then this would&#x27;ve worked. But for now, I&#x27;m switching back to my regular routine.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin so was pleased to find this product. While there was a notation that you might want to start only as a spot treatment &amp; work your way up to full face, I decided to go ahead &amp; try it - after all, it was for Sensitive Skin, right? BIG MISTAKE!! Only after a couple of treatments, I have a huge rash, red itchy bumps.  And, I not only tried it on my face but on my chest &amp; shoulders-!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have to &#x27;work you way up to use it over several days&#x27;, I would not consider this  a good Sensitive Skin product. Wish I&#x27;d never tried it.</li>
            <li> This works wonderfully, as long as I remain consistent.  I have noticed that as soon as I miss a day, the acne is back.  I am very pleased with this though--it has worked better than some prescriptions that I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> Have tried this product on my two teenaged daughters who have very different facial needs.  One has a very oily complexion and the other only suffers from breakouts along her t-zone area but also has very sensitive skin.  We have tried many different products that honestly give basically the same end result, this being no exception.  While we find it did help to clear up some acne on each of them in about 7 days, the difference was less than expected.  My girls are happier than before, but they could be happier.  I believe these topical creams can help \\&quot;control\\&quot; problem complexions, but the underlying cause goes much deeper than that, and until that problem can be identified, i.e. puberty, the results may be superficial. Price on Amazon was a huge plus!</li>
            <li> As far as I go, it&#x27;s just an OK product. Nothing has changed much except my skin turns to be more dry.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this skincare regime.  I had some breakouts on my chin when I received the products. After using the products just a few days, my face cleared up.  I do have very sensitive skin and my face became very dry.  I cut back to using the moisturizer every other day and the spot treatment as needed.  I have continued to use the cleanser every morning and night. These products are more effective than any other over the counter items I&#x27;ve tried and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Purchased this item because I do have sensitive skin, but not extremely sensitive.  I read online (cvs.com) that this product is not for people with extremely sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked for existing pimples and small zits.  It did not help preventing new ones from forming.  I also noticed that the toner caused me to break out.  When I didn&#x27;t use it, I noticed a difference.  That worked for awhile, but then I had to stop using it altogether: more zits were forming, and I needed something to prevent new ones from forming, which was the whole reason for buying this product. The only thing I found most helpful was the spot treatment/repair lotion.  I replaced the cleanser with Noxzema and used the repair lotion, and that worked better than  the original steps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it didn&#x27;t work for me, it was gentle on my skin, but made it really dry, even though I have oily skin.  I expected that, though, because it says on the box that if you recently used other topical products previous to this system, when first using it, dryness would occur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the AcneFree Sensitive Skin for two weeks and then stopped.  Since I have stopped using it, I already see improvement.</li>
            <li> We have been booby that the product the rest of the month Does it fit this thing I want financial returns immediately</li>
            <li> This works perfectly! I&#x27;ve been using it for a while and ordering it from here was fast and easy. Acnefree has really helped my skin A LOT but my skin has also gotten really used to it....so when I don&#x27;t use it....not good.&lt;br /&gt;But really does give results and fast.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my tween daughter who seems to be experiencing hormonal acne as a consequence of puberty. This system works really well with consistent use, and is a good option for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Well, I am on day three of using this product and I figured I would try it because of the price and the reviews that I have read. I am trying to be patient and have hope, but on day three, I woke up with a itchy red race, which looked like sunburn, and really uncomfortable dry face. I will try to cut back and see what happens, but now I dont want to irritate my face more by adding another moisturizer or facial wash while I am cutting back on the Acnefree. Any suggestions???</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I obviously had a problem with acne. My acne was mild at best so I figured this would do the trick.  After twice daily use for several days it seemed to be helping.  It definitely made my face feel cleaner.  This is truly only for those people who have sensitive skin though. I thought I did but alas, I was wrong.  I have since moved to the orange acnefree products which use benzoyl peroxide.  Those have been working much better for me and I haven&#x27;t had any bad skin irritation or anything.  If you don&#x27;t know what skin type you have, start with the orange regular acnefree products and only switch to this sensitive skin product if you cannot tolerate the reactions/irritations (if any) you get from the orange product.</li>
            <li> At first I noticed some results. Some pimples got smaller and my blackheads went away, but that was the differences. Then my skin got used to the product and it stopped working, and made my skin worse. I&#x27;ve quit using it and using a Panoxel bar.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 12 yr old grandson who is having a terrible time with his forehead.  It was a bit strong for the rest of his face, but is clearing his forehead up nicely.  Great product and a great price!</li>
            <li> I was a max clarity user until they stopped producing it. After dealing with bad break outs I got desperate. I found this through my research online and found this amazing product! I&#x27;m in my late 20s and I&#x27;ve dealt with acne since I was a teen. This has made my Acne history and my acne scars lighter. I love this product!</li>
            <li> Amazing purchase. I rarely get pimples, but when I do they&#x27;re usually big and leave a mark. This purchase has probably been the best I&#x27;ve ever made. One of the seriums alleviates the redness within hours. I&#x27;ve also noticed that the marks left behind from pimples seem to fade away quicker. Most justifiable purchase I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li> Excellent product that works as advertised.  However I always run out of the cleanser too soon.</li>
            <li> This is the only acne system that has worked for me. I tried proactiv, but my skin was too sensitive for it, so I switched over to this product. Granted, I only had  a mild case of acne, but it cleared it up and it keeps my skin clear. The spot treatment is amazing as well. I definitely recommend this product for anyone who has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Although my skin are sensitive to use this, I only applied to where I have acne or break and it work. This product slowly clear my skin....</li>
            <li> I have sensitive oily acne prone skin *a horrible combination* I love this product so much that it has effectively replaced my in office dermatologist recommended brand. This cleared up my acne within a week and I&#x27;ve been using this now for about 2 years. Will keep using as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> This product ships quickly after ordering. It also works really well for my fourteen year old daughter. It also quickly gets rid of her acne espically sudden outbreaks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not normally one to post reviews but I love this product so much I had to share. At 29 years old I was still dealing with acne that I&#x27;ve had since 13. I&#x27;ve been to many dermatologists and tried treatments but so far this has been the only product that worked. Be advised it does take time for me it was about 2 weeks and for the first 2 weeks my skin was really dry! All I did was get an oil free moisturizer and it helped to heal some of the dryness. Now four weeks later my skin is the most clear it has ever been! I actually went out the other day without foundation (only bronzer) and still felt confident! I bought mine from target for $20 but based on the price on amazon I will most definitely be purchasing it here!</li>
            <li> My son uses the item and see immediate results. It instantly worked on the small pimples that he had under his chin.</li>
            <li> I have always had some struggles with skin. In the last year, they have been really bad (worse than my teen years). I started having cystic acne breakouts accompanied by lots of redness. I would try different products and see slight improvement. Then the cycle would start all over again. I tried the original AcneFree many years ago. I stopped using it because it made my skin really dry and even more irritated. For that reason, I avoided similar systems (like Proactive). In January, I had had enough of the breakouts and went to Ulta to look for a possible solution. I looked over many products, but was hesitant to buy them because I knew my skin was sensitive. I found AcneFree Sensitive and decided to give it a try. I didn&#x27;t even know that they made a sensitive formula. It worked beautifully! I started noticing results within days. By the second week, redness had greatly diminished. My skin is now 100% clear after 2 months of using the product. It looks, and feels, so much healthier. The instructions recommend using the moisturizer once a day until your skin gets used to it. I decided to continue with one application on the moisturizer so as not to overdo it. I use the cleanser and toner twice, daily, as recommended. This product works beautifully for me. Although products work differently for different skin types, this product is definitely worth a try if you are struggling with breakouts.</li>
            <li> Wow... this stuff is amazing.... I&#x27;ve had acne since i was 13. Tried lots of products... blah blah blah you know the deal. Nothing has worked as well as this. My skin was so congested.. not a space that wasn&#x27;t covered in Blackheads... woke up with at least 10 new whiteheads everyday and after cleansing I would get more during the day. Today, I woke up and didn&#x27;t have single blemish. Omg!!!! I could not believe it. My skin looks better than ever. I still have some dryness and patchiness but after using this it goes away. I had oil everywhere.. gone gone its all gone. Ive never felt better about myself. Its even getting rid of the impossible nose blackheads. Use as directed is key. Only complaint is the toner doesn&#x27;t last long but IDC!! My skin is even less red and it is glowing. I can&#x27;t say enough good things. After one week at that. Wow.</li>
            <li> I used Proactiv for 1.5 days and in addition to redness, my face started to swell up! (Most likely because of the Benzoyl Peroxide.) These three items do not contain Benzoyl Peroxide, and I&#x27;ve had no issues with redness or swelling.</li>
            <li> I did not get the product I&#x27;m very disappointe!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have dry-ish 30 something skin. I ordered this to tame&lt;br /&gt;The few breakouts I get. It may be an okay product but I did not like it at all for me. The lotion made my skin feel&lt;br /&gt;sticky. The products in tubes were stuck and had to use a needle to get it out. Finally tossed it all in the trash. I will stick to my preferred Equate brand of proactive 3 step treatment.</li>
            <li> I was extremely impresses with this skin care combo and at such a great price.  My skin went through some hormonal changes lately and I was dealing with acne in my 50&#x27;s as though I were a teenager.  Acne Free for sensitive skin was just what my skin needed!  I am a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> If I could post pictures of what this product did to my face most people would run as quickly as they could away from it. I have been a user of acnefree products for the past three years. Terminator 10 and the severe acne kit work wonders. I got this product because I no longer had the severe acne I did before so I thought hey why not get one that is gentler on the skin. Oh my goodness!! I wish I could rewind time.&lt;br /&gt;After I applied it the second time and applied makeup over it I immediately felt an itching sensation on the bottom part of my chin where the few pimples I had were. I had to go to work so I left quickly by the end of the day my face was itching and on fire. I washed off all the makeup and solution and went to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;I woke up the next day with 10x more pimples all around my chin area, the next few days got worse and worse. The third day my chin area had over a 100 pimples that were white and itchy.&lt;br /&gt;I am now on the fourth day of this horrible mess, I cannot see a dermatologist for another two weeks. I have been applying a mint julep mask once a day and wiping it away with a very hot towel, then after drying applying terminator 10. It has taken away a few of them but my face feels like nothing I have ever felt before. Its so bumpy red and itchy.&lt;br /&gt;Please stay far away from this system!!! I eat a healthy diet and take care of myself well, I didnt deserve this, I cannot even go outside people stare my face is covered in bumps now.</li>
            <li> Not only does it smell funny, but last night was the second time I tried it and it made my whole neck and around my mouth break out. The first time I didn&#x27;t want to blame it on the lotion because I was stressed with school- well now I&#x27;m finished and I never get rashes, put the lotion on last night and I couldn&#x27;t stop itching all night. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in it to make me so itchy. I do have sensitive skin, but I&#x27;ll just go back to my other face lotion.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, pretty sensitive skin, but I also suffer from acne on my chin. I&#x27;m 31 years old and have never struggled with acne until the birth of my 3rd child and now I can&#x27;t seem to get rid of it! I&#x27;ve bought everything I can possibly think of to no avail and was about to order Proavtic, but I saw Acnefree and noticed a big difference in price (which was a HUGE plus for me!). Because they have this Sensitive Skin formula and the reviews were good I decided to bite the bullet and try it out. I am on day 6 of using this product and couldn&#x27;t be happier. By my second day, my breakouts started going down and now I have no acne! This is the first time in almost 3 years that I can say that! I ordered the mask also and found it to be a bit drying, but I&#x27;ll gladly take dry skin over acne. :) I&#x27;ll just be sure to limit my use of the mask, but it ROCKED at helping clear me up. I am so happy I bought this product. Just as a side note, I just ordered the retinol lotion that comes with the regular formula cleanser and have read reviews that it helps fade the red marks. I&#x27;m hoping that works as well as the rest of this line because I know I&#x27;ll be incredibly happy to not only have no acne, but to also have less marks left from previous acne. Good luck to you!</li>
            <li> I use this every day! They say it is just as good as proactive but I have never used proactive so I can not say that for sure. What I can say is that this stuff works! I love the sensitive skin system because it does not have Methylisothiazolinone in it which I am allergic too. This kit you can usually find at bigt lots or 5 below so it is a great price. Comes with a cleanser, a toner and a cream treatment. This is the perfect combo together. The cleanser foams up good and makes my skin glow. The toner smells fresh and clean and makes me skin feel great. The treatment cream does a great job also as just a spot treatment. I use this morning and night. I saw a difference in 4 days! It is even helping future break outs also. My skin isnt in between not oily and not dry. I am 34 and mostly break out on my chin around my time of the month. This helps with the painful cyst acne you get at that ttime! My skin looks fresh and radiant and smooth! This is a great system</li>
            <li> I started using the Acne Free Sensitive Skin Clearing System a month ago. So far I have noticed a decrease in my acne and less acne hyperpigmentation. However, after using the toner for a week I stopped using it in favor of a glycolic acid toner (Skin Obsession 10% Glycolic Acid Toner), as I did not feel like the toner included was doing much and it smelled as if it had a strong fragrance in it. I think I can attribute some of the hyperpigmentation lightening to that as well. I wish that they sold these in separates because I would gladly buy the face wash and spot treatment alone, but I would hate to buy the kit and throw out the toner every time. Overall I am happy with my purchase because I feel as if the products that worked for me were worth paying the $17 for, but I will likely try to look into products with similar active ingredients that are sold individually.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for AcneFree, especially considering they have an option for people with sensitive skin to buy. I hate saying that a product should be discontinued, but this one went to the top of my list on worst products ever made.  I have sensitive skin, but not that sensitive. I&#x27;m allergic to fabric softeners which may have played some part in my reaction to this, but that&#x27;s why I chose to buy the sensitive skin set rather than the normal set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied this to my skin before bed the first night I got it, by no means a generous amount- just a little. I woke up the next morning feeling sunburnt, my skin itching like crazy. I have never had chicken pox, but I imagine it would be somewhat similar to that. I look in the mirror to find my skin is bright red and I have started to break out very badly in the areas this was applied. It itches all day, even for the next few days. My skin doesn&#x27;t lose the bright redness for about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was awful! I&#x27;m still breaking out worse than I was before I tried this and it&#x27;s been several weeks! I also tried to go without applying the second step \\&quot;toner\\&quot; and it still made me itch. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the skin repair part or third step, or if it&#x27;s the actual cleanser. No matter what I used or didn&#x27;t use I got the same results. I felt awful, and looked awful! I was scared I might have to go to the hospital for the redness and itchiness to go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called the pharmaceutical company who works with this brand and asked them if I could ship it back to them for a refund. Normally I buy $6 bottles of Neutrogena and it works well enough without making anything worse. I told them what happened and how bad of a reaction I had and they asked me for a lot of information from it. They told me I didn&#x27;t have to send it back and they&#x27;d send me a check. I still have yet to receive a check or a call back from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product. As I said, I had high hopes for it after reading so many good reviews. I guess I should&#x27;ve listened to the bad reviews and stayed far away. If you have something that works for you, even if it doesn&#x27;t work perfectly- do not buy this. Save your money and try something else!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Upon running out of any other type of cleanser, I decided to try the cleanser itself. (Step 1). It didn&#x27;t seem to have any negative effects. I believe it is step 3, the lotion which causes the problem- at least for me. I never got a check from the pharmaceutical company, but did see that Acne Free has made it&#x27;s way to stores that sell mostly discontinued items. (I.E. Big Lots)I should&#x27;ve listened to the bad reviews and stayed far away. If you have something that works for you, even if it doesn&#x27;t work perfectly- do not buy this.

            <li> This is great for people who have sensitive skin, while also being acne prone. It has a slight smell to it, but it is very subtle. While is has sacylic acid in it, I personally have not had any issues with it over drying my skin. Any acne product typically has the sacylic to dry out the blemishes. This line contains the face wash, the moisturizer, and the acne spot treatment for blemishes.</li>
            <li> This is working for me so far.  It&#x27;s not as harsh as proactive, which I&#x27;ve used before with ok results.  My skin isn&#x27;t drying out and my towels aren&#x27;t being accidentally bleached, all of which makes me pretty happy.  If you have sensitive skin that&#x27;s prone to breakouts, this is worth a try.</li>
            <li> I bought this product solely on the fact it advertises being \\&quot;gentle and for sensitive skin\\&quot; that could not be any further from the truth. I went from having a chin full of tiny little bumps to having a chin full on large deep irritated pustules and large cystic type acne bumps covering my chin and cheeks. I used the spot treatment on a pimple I had on my  cheek and it created a large scab covering the pimple which eventually wiped off the next morning when using their toner resulting in a quite irritated open wound on my face. I have never had acne so bad in my life and I am 100% confident this product made it worse. I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin, I purchased the sensitive skin treatment so it would not dry out my face. Acne free dried my face out, it caused all over tightness and peeling and also burnt my skin after every application. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!! Plus- this product has an extremely unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I just bought this system last night, and decided to wait till this morning to use it. I was pleasantly surprised; After using all three steps, I noticed my blackheads were surfacing. That&#x27;s a good thing to me because they&#x27;re easier to extract; no pushing and prodding is needed (I use a metal extractor). I have eczema and this hasn&#x27;t made me face really dry, but I suppose there&#x27;s still time for that. I think even f it does dry my face out I will still use it. There are other lotions out there you could use in addition with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I really do like it. I&#x27;ll update after a few weeks to see if anything has changed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried proactiv on and off with always the same results.  At first proactiv works then after a month it looses it&#x27;s effectiveness.  This system on the other hand has both salicylic acid (SA) and 3% benzoyl peroxide (BP) unlike proactiv&#x27;s 2.5% BP and no SA.  Slightly more for those who need the stronger medicine.  I&#x27;ve been using this system twice a day for the past 4 months and my face has never been clearer!  Occasionally I&#x27;ll get one or two spots but never a full on breakout.  But no OTC system can fully cure acne 100%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word of caution, if your face is not used to BP, it can dry your skin out.  If you use this system, MAKE SURE you put on a layer of non-greasy facial moisturizer afterwards and you&#x27;ll be good to go.  I use gold bond ultimate healding and it works great.  At first it seems counterintuitive to use moisturizer for oil prone skin but trust me, the combination of BP plus moisturizer will kill the P. acne bacteria and mitigate the effects of dry skin.  If you don&#x27;t use a moisturizer, you will dry out and you will be in worse shape than it was with the acne!  (Speaking from experience) Acne.org is a big proponent of moisturizer as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, a great product and you don&#x27;t have to sign up for some lame order by mail subscription!</li>
            <li> the hydrating acne repair lotion and spot treatment gave me a terrible, itching and burning rash on my face!</li>
            <li> I took my 14 year old to the doctor for her acne and they gave her the standard harsh chemicals to use. The problem is, she also suffers from eczema and has sensitive skin. Since using this product her skin is clear most of the time. I am ordering my second pack since they don&#x27;t sell it at my Target!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for the teenage grandkids. They are very pleased w/ the results. I would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for people with sensitive skin. I do not, but I find that every other product dries my skin out so bad that I flake. Who wants that?? This kit does not dry your skin out and you feel so clean after using it! Will buy more</li>
            <li> I love this product!  In my teen years I used Proactive and it helped a lot. In my late 20&#x27;s now, I started experiencing adult acne about 6 months ago and didn&#x27;t want to pay the expensive price for proactive.  After reading the reviews, I decided to try AcneFree.  I did as suggested and built up the amount I used each part of the system.  I did have a bit of drying, and ended up using the gel only as a spot treatment for the first month.  3 months later I can not use it in all areas of my T zone.  I use Neutrogena face lotion on the rest of my face.  I barely have any zits anymore, and when i do get one during a stressful week, this stuff takes care of it fast and it heals without much scaring.  Everyone needs to adjust for their skin, but I recommend giving this product a shot.  Because I only use the face wash once a day, it has even lasted longer than it was suppose to!</li>
            <li> I started using AcneFree Sensitive about a month and a half ago. I started out using it twice a day and noticed my skin got very dry so I cut back to once a day. Which made the product pretty useless, but I kept using it on a daily basis. I just don&#x27;t like to waste money. While using the product daily, I had a severe breakout on my face at about the corners of my lips, on each side were 7 - 10 pimples clustered together. I started focusing on that area with absolutely no result and only dried my mouth area out to the point of cracking. I still have a couple of the pimples which finally started to go away after using a completely different product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the dry painful skin on my face, I stopped using this product. I workout daily and couldn&#x27;t handle getting sweaty and being in pain. It has now been about 5 days since I stopped using this product and I still have extremely dry, painful, and tender skin at the corners of my eyes. I also must mention that I have been using another moisturizer since I began using AcneFree to help combat the dry skin. I now have been putting that on 3 times a day to help repair my skin.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, has cleared my skin in 3 weeks. I didn&#x27;t have serve acne but this product has still worked for me, I would recommend it to anyone! Haven&#x27;t found anything in the UK with results like it! 😀</li>
            <li> I have used everything like others, but sometimes i have improvement for a few weeks, maybe a few months but then its like my face rejects it and goes back into a very bad breakouts. I am mid 30&#x27;s.  I also tried both the Acnefree regular and the Severe version and neither worked well for me, but did at first and i thought then maybe they were too harsh for my skin and so I tried this and I&#x27;m so glad i did, i have used this version for six months now and its been wonderful.  Unfortunately I have very scared skin to deal with now for all the years of bad acne...  so here is my routine that has made my face look new again, literally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Acnefree Sensitive skin all three steps in the morning.  At night i just use step 1, wait for my face to dry and use step 4 from the severe kit that can be bought separately here.... http://www.amazon.com/Acnefree-Retinol-Renewal-Complex-Severe/dp/B003ANWLYW/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1400528474&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;acnefree+step+4 I skip both 2 and 3 at night.  This has made such a difference in taking away my scars and it has worked wonderful with the sensitive kit.  I also use the acnefree gentle scrub for exfoliation once a week.  http://www.amazon.com/AcneFree-Gentle-Acne-Scrub-Ounce/dp/B004ZGAOCE/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1400528666&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;acnefree+scrub  This has done wonders for my face!!</li>
            <li> This is the only system that has cleared my acne. Clean &#x27;n Clear, Neutrogena, I thought I was going to have to go to Proactiv. But no, I found this and it works! My husband uses it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note - they are serious when they say avoid the eye area. I thought I was keeping the products far enough away, but I guess they got too close to my under-eye area and it turned red and flaky. Especially with the cleanser and moisturizer, focus mostly on the acne-prone areas of your face and you will be fine.</li>
            <li> Used all 3 products as instructed, it burnt my face. I am over 50, sensitive skin, and this product has taken 2 weeks for the peeling to stop.  I threw it out. Sorry won&#x27;t try it again.</li>
            <li> The only thing to clear my skin and I am not a teenager.  I have tried everything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 27 y/o women with a mild case of adult acne. I will get about 3-4 breakouts all at once that will take nearly two weeks to clear up and of course as soon as they do more show up soon after. After reading the mixed reviews I decided to go with the sensitive skin acne system since my skin isn&#x27;t sensitive. Weird I know, but I figured it would be less harsh than the other system AcneFree provides. My assumptions were correct. I used the product once a day and only at night. I did notice my face got very warm and even red in some spots after the third step. This went away within about 20 minutes. I immediately noticed a change in my blemished the next morning. It&#x27;s been about a week now and I have noticed some drying of my skin. I exfoliated with a face scrub then used cocoa butter on my face to deal with the dryness overnight. This helped a lot. Since the drying has started I have decided that I will likely be using this product every other day. My hopes is that this will give my skin a chance to get the moisture it needs. I would recommend this product although I do believe people need to find the best routine that works for them. Education yourself on your skin type is key.</li>
            <li> I am 43 years old and over the last few years have been suffering from mild acne for the past year 1/2. I NEVER had suffered with acne as a teenager or young adult. Monthly, the cheek area of my face would break out mainly when it was close to \\&quot;that time of the month\\&quot;.  The big problem is, I scar, so each month I&#x27;d be left with new dark spots on my face after the pimple went away.  My daughter used the regular AcneFree and I thought it would be too strong for me, so I tried the Sensitive Skin forumla and WOW! This stuff is the truth!  Within the 1st day of using I noticed a change, and by the end of the week, not only was the acne on my cheeks GONE, but so are the dark spots they leave behind.  This stuff even faded the old scars.  Now my cheeks are even toned and acne free....but then I got the BRIGHT idea to move to another product a few months ago...BAD DECISION. My face broke out...the cheeks, the chin it was terrible.  I think it was the new product I was using.  I went back to AcneFree and this got my skin back in tip top shape within a week!  I&#x27;m back to smooth even toned skin with ZERO acne or scars. It&#x27;s the only thing that works for me so I&#x27;m sticking to it.</li>
            <li> I have the driest skin in the world and I am always scared to wash my face because it flakes up after. But this product is the best! It&#x27;s so light on my skin and makes my face look like a model face the next day! By far the best product I have ever used!!!</li>
            <li> When I had horrific chin acne for years, I tried all I could think of in using at the health food stores, I even tried acnefree original and it just left all my skin oily,tender, and blotchy no matter what I was using, until they introduced this to the market and I finally, after 5 years of acne embarrassment, I get compliments that I have \\&quot;flawless porcelain skin\\&quot;. I will never have to frantically in frustration look for products ever again. Stick to this!</li>
            <li> I started getting frequent breakouts for the past year. This included whiteheads and also painful cystic acne. I started using AcneFree in January of 2015 and it should be noted that I also began exercising regularly as well as doing yoga for stress related purposes. I did not change my diet. While using AcneFree, my acne stayed about the same until 3 months after use I no longer had any pimples. I still get an occasional one but it is not nearly as bad as it used to be. I also read a book entitled &amp;#34;Breaking Out: A Woman&#x27;s Guide to Coping with Acne at Any Age&amp;#34; by Lydia Preston. In the morning I washed my face with water and  used the toner. After the toner ran out, I used alcohol free witch hazel. At night I used the cleanser. I left the cleanser on my face while brushing my teeth and then rinsed it off. I then waited about 15 minutes and used the hydrating repair lotion which I kept in the fridge. The lotion has benzoyl peroxide which is more effective when used cold according to the book I previously mentioned. When I first started using it, I felt a slight burning sensation so I only used the lotion every other day. It should be noted you should only use a small amount of these products. A little goes a long way and it also helps to make it last. I am still using the same bottles I bought in January and it is July now. My skin still isn&#x27;t perfect but I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this products as it had fantastic reviews. Instead, it dried out my skin so much that it began to perl and I got q rash. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> Works halfway decently for getting rid of my acne, but it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like most treatments do. I&#x27;ll take a few remaining spots in light of that.</li>
            <li> I am 15 years old. My mom had bought this for me because I was suffering really badly with my acne. I used this morning and night and after just 2 days I was able to see a difference! It worked so fast and so great, I don&#x27;t feel like I need to cover up anymore. Although, as great as it works, there are some down sides. It did dry out my skin pretty bad, but I just switched moisturizers. I still use it, and I love it. I don&#x27;t break out anymore!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this product to anybody, first for it&#x27;s price, (can expect something to be good so cheap) but i still try (lesson learned)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first 3 days was ok, skin wasn&#x27;t oily, no new pimples,  i was happy... thought the end of the first week my face was peeling and suddenly twice pimples appear, i stop using it.. my face came back to normal, oily, and one pimple at a time, i know food, hormones and stress take a major role in acne&lt;br /&gt;My roommate started to used it, she really has sensitive skin, i don&#x27;t, but she got like first degree burn in her face!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess for some people this product might work, but for me and my roommate didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I found that this product actually made my skin worse.  Even though this was labeled for sensitive skin, I found that I was breaking out even more, and my skin was incredibly red!  I recently switched to a different product and have seen an improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a good product, but definitely not for all sensitive skin types.</li>
            <li> I never had acne as a kid, but starting at 25, I had a few recurring (and large) breakouts. Now at 31, I&#x27;ve been continuously broken out for the past five months. Nothing has worked, not clearisil, not Aveeno... nothing. If anything, trying new products just made it worse. I picked up the sensitive skin pack from Wal-Mart solely by chance, but what a difference it has made. First off, my \\&quot;regular zits\\&quot; (those not associated with my acne breakout zone) were gone in 24 hours. The acne that has plagued me took much longer. Two and a half weeks after beginning the regimine, all of my acne is gone. However, the dark marks on my skin remain. Time will tell if they go away too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as side effects go, as some other reviewers have mentioned, I initially had drying and peeling. I remedied this by only using step 3 once a day. I used the face wash and the toner twice a day. AFter a week, I returned to using the benzoyle peroxide twice a day, and have had no more dryness/peeling. I highly recommend this for adults who are suffering from acne because having a clear face again has made me so much happier. I will continue to use this product, and I plan to purchase my next refill through Amazon, since the kits is a full five dollars cheaper than it was at Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> I had acne and extremely dry, sensitive skin and had tried Aveeno, Noxzema, and Proactiv and nothing was working until I bought this. I use it in the evening and Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Cleanser in the morning.  Within 2 weeks the acne has cleared and the dry flaky skin is MUCH better. I wish I had tried this sooner!</li>
            <li> This works so well and so quickly to clear up breakouts without murdering your skin! It&#x27;s a big curse to have acne and then on top of it, have sensitive skin. So happy I found this and it worked! Great price on here too.</li>
            <li> This system works just as good as the expensive brand. I stopped using the other name brand because their deceiving reorder practices. Ok, back to this product. It works great. I prefer this sensitive kind because it doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin like the regular one.</li>
            <li> I purchase this set for my high school daughter as Target no longer carries it.  It is working well and her skin is clearing up.  She has extremely sensitive skin and so far it has not irritated her skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with mild acne since high school and could never find anything that wouldn&#x27;t burn or itch on my skin. Read some of the reviews on Acne Free and figured why not. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks and I&#x27;ve never been so happy before. My skin feels and looks amazing!</li>
            <li> I am currently using this system and it works decently. I only use it at nice just because the smell of the face wash, toner, and lotion is so bad. I&#x27;ve been using it about a month and a half and have seen a small amount if results. It could be better but with the price I couldn&#x27;t really expect much more. It&#x27;s very sensitive on my skin I haven&#x27;t had an bad reactions with it at all. I&#x27;d give it more stars if it didn&#x27;t smell so terribly.</li>
            <li> I had really bad acne a couple of years ago, and I tried everything nothing else seems to be working for me.  Except for AcneFree.  This stuff doesn&#x27;t work overnite, but you can see the results over 2 weeks after using their products.  Now that they have sensitive skin system, it&#x27;s even better for me.  Didn&#x27;t leave my skin too dry.  I have these things now deliver to me every three months.</li>
            <li> I have normal but very sensitive skin. I never used to break out much on my face then out of nowhere I had these small under the skin pimples developing on my forehead and mostly up high on my cheekbones (Maybe my hormones are changing now that I&#x27;m an adult...) My younger sister was having a similar problem so she ordered proactiv. I was so close to purchasing a kit myself but hesitated when i starting reading the reviews and some personal accounts from friends. Sure, many people got clear skin after using it but some friends said that it made their skin feel dry and many complained that once you stop using it you break out again (sometimes worse than before) so they somehow trap you to continue buying their extremely expensive product. I read about Acnefree Sensitive skin and the reviews were rated higher than proactiv! I bought it myself and i love it. I never thought that i would get into a routine of using a face washing system but its easy.  i just keep it in the shower and wash my face with the cleanser instead of soap. Once your skin begin to clears up you wont be able to resists wanting to touch your smooth skin and nurture the progress by continuing to regularly wash with acnefree. Its been 2 weeks and my skin looks soooo amazing! i used to tilt my face in the light in front of the mirror and i could see all the imperfections and little bumps where my pimples were, but now turn my face in all directions and it nothing but smooth skin. Even the blemishes from the bumps i would pick at are slowly fading. i cant wait to see what my skin will look like months from now using Acnefree. I recommend you give it a try. try to make sure you wash you face twice a day and keep the routine. BE PAITENT! what always helps me is just picturing the results i will get if i just keep going. And dont pick at ur face! just let the system do the work. Im excited to show off my results to my sister and rub in the fact that i paid half the amount she does AND im not required to order it online because acnefree is available in stores.der it online because acnefree is available in stores.</li>
            <li> This product is working after two weeks. Your skin does have to adjust to the new product and may be itchy and red at first. I had the same worse before it gets better reaction to Proactiv but after a few weeks of use my skin looks great.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as promised to work</li>
            <li> This stuff REALLY WORKS!! I have tried everything, from prescription to over the counter products! This stuff is amazing! I have very sensitive skin and everything that I tried before seemed to clear my skin for the first month then it would be back to its old ways....I have been using this product for 6 months and have noticed amazing results, but had 100% clear skin in 2 weeks! I have maybe had 1 or 2 small pimples since I have started to use this! It does however dry your skin out but with the right face moisturizer it works! I will never use anything else!!</li>
            <li> This product destroyed my face. If you have sensitive skin then I would highly avoid this product. I&#x27;m sure it works great for people who do not have sensitive skin; however, I was one of the unlucky customers. Although, I will admit, it did clear up massive pimples within a day, but what happened next was awful. It made my skin extremely dry, red, and itchy. Nothing helped with the massive skin rash. My skin looked horrid/gross and it lasted for, at least, two weeks. Once the I experienced the rashes, the acne came back and it was worse than before. The worst part was that I could do nothing to treat the new acne due to the fact that my skin became overly sensitive to every other product. Plus, I was giving my skin time to heal. This product is cheaper than a lot of brands but sometimes you just have to spend a little extra to get the proper care.</li>
            <li> It works and it doesn&#x27;t irritate or dry up my skin at all, personally. The bottles are a bit small, though. So you have to keep rebuying a new package after a month or so if you use this medication consistently. Anyways, for me, this works WAAAY better than ProActive, and you&#x27;ll also be doing your wallet a favor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 28 years old and for the past couple years have developed moderate acne along my jawline and around my mouth. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with acne until now and have tried just about every combination of cleansers, lotions, etc. I recently purchased the Proactiv 3-step kit. I used it for two weeks and saw very little improvement in both redness and breakouts. I saw this kit in Wal-Mart earlier this week and decided to give it a try, knowing if it worked, it would save me a significant amount of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEST DECISION EVER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on day 5 of using this kit and I&#x27;ve already noticed a tremendous improvement in my skin. The redness on my cheeks has lessened, and where I used to have anywhere from 2-3 swollen, irritated acne bumps on one of them at any given time, my left cheek (the problem one) is almost smooth to the touch! I&#x27;m still waiting to see how it will fare during that time of the month, when my breakouts are worse, but it&#x27;s already doing MUCH better than Proactiv.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does dry the skin out, but only slightly. I use the cleanser only at night, and the toner and lotion twice per day. The lotion doesn&#x27;t fare well as an actual moisturizer, so I&#x27;ve applied it all over at night and in the morning, I&#x27;ve been treating only the problem areas and then applying an additional moisturizer to the rest of my face before putting on makeup. Also, the lotion that comes in this kit STINKS. That&#x27;s about it&#x27;s only downfall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m twenty-eight with mild, but persistent, acne. I&#x27;ve always been wary of trying Proactive or any of these other sets because they use the same ingredients as everything else. I&#x27;ve used this, as directed, for over a month, and honestly, have not seen any change. So, in my opinion, it&#x27;s not worth it when I can use a single, cheaper product once a day along with zit cream rather than the hassle of three products twice a day.</li>
            <li> Dindt work out for me .. too strong</li>
            <li> I bought this in my local pharmacy but when I needed a refill I turned to Amazon and it was cheaper and I got it the next day. Really amazing.</li>
            <li> Works great and it&#x27;s affordable.  I use it as well as my 13 year old son.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 17 years old and struggled with acne since I was 11. I&#x27;ve used nutregena, proactive, and even went to the dermatologist but nothing worked. I used a simple acne free was and cream, it worked okay but this product really improved my skin. It makes my skin dry but it does the job, u jus have to man up about the dryness and before you know it you it your face will clear up. I recommend using the acnefree terminator 10 cream instead of the cream they give u in the pack, it reduces redness and dries your skin quicker, but you should use the cream they give you couple times a week. I&#x27;ve only used the product for 2 weeks and I&#x27;ve seen a huge improvement. I also recommend  using pantothenic acid pills, because when your skin dries out you shouldn&#x27;t use the cream for a day or less, this will probably cause some areas on your face to get oily so these pills will stop that, but i&#x27;m very happy with this product and will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> The picture shows this package containing a cleanser, toner and lotion. However the package that arrived contained a cleanser, lotion and spot treatment. I feel like I was deceived as to what I was ordering.</li>
            <li> Its a good product because it works better then most acne treatments out there ..and for the price it definitely beats proactive</li>
            <li> I love this set! I just turned 13 and have struggled with acne since third grade. As a bonus, i have super sensitive and dry skin. Yesterday night was my first night using it and its extremely gentle. Although, because i have dry skin, i am going to continue using my normal moisturizer and use theirs just as a spot treatment. It cleared up my dry patches, and my acne was already better</li>
            <li> Comparable to proactive and much more affordable .</li>
            <li> I had acne when I was 11-13 really bad and I used Clinique. It dried my face out, but it worked. I moved to Florida and the water there made my face break out, so I used proactive. That stuff is expensive, but it worked and I never had really bad drying, peeling, or cracking. NOW WITH THIS STUFF... Oh my word, I used it on a Friday night. It seemed fine. My face felt clean, and I went to bed. When woke up my face itched, but I didn&#x27;t really pay ay attention to it. I went out and someone asked if I got some sun, but I didn&#x27;t. MY ENTIRE FACE FROM WHERE I USED THAT LOTION CRAP has completely peeled off and dried up and it is red and a tomato. I will not use this again. If you have sensitive skin (that&#x27;s why I bought the sensitive stuff) I would NOT use it.</li>
            <li> My son who is 13.5 has pretty bad back acne that has gotten a lot worse in the past 6 months. I have a friend that recommended this system so I figured I would have him try it since it was quite inexpensive compared to many others. She said you have to be consistent with the use or the breakouts will continue. He was using only the Burt&#x27;s Bees acne cleanser before but within 3-5 days of using this, all of the really sore large pimples were gone and the rest of the spots had faded. He is now in his second week and we have noticed a huge difference! His face acne is more minor but I am going to have him try it on face now too so that it hopefully works the same. Also, he is only using it at night instead of the recommended twice a day. He uses a gently cleanser or just witch hazel in the morning.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 40&#x27;s and have been known my whole life for having good skin.  Only within the past year has my skin become problematic where I couldn&#x27;t seem to control it! I looked at all the reviews for skin systems and I decided to get this.  I was worried that because it is for sensitive skin that it wouldn&#x27;t work or be strong enough.  I was wrong!!!  My skin literally started clearing up within the first two days!!  I have purchased so many lotions and scrubs when all I really needed is this!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caution:  Although this is for sensitive skin it did dry my skin out a lot.  Do not let that stop you from buying it.  All I did is take a break from it when my skin cleared and I used a deep moisturizer to add moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Tried EVERYTHING in the past without any success, and with a lot of pain, embarrassment, and only a blemish filled face to show for my efforts.  This is the only thing that works!  I have combination dry/oily skin, and this doesn&#x27;t over-dry my face like other products did.  The only time I break-out now is if I&#x27;m lazy and don&#x27;t wash my face, or if I touch my face a lot.  Now that I&#x27;ve found my eureka acne product, I will never try out anything else.</li>
            <li> I have always used this whenever I have acne flare ups. Different products work for different people but every time my acne starts up, I use this for about a week and my skin is completely clear. I can use the spot cream/lotion on pimples that pop up randomly and they tend to completely disappear within 24 - 48 hours. It does not dry my skin out and it doesn&#x27;t cause any irritations, this one is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> All through being a teen, I never got breakouts, with the exception of maybe one or two pimples here and there. Once I turned 19 though, I began getting horrible hormonal breakouts on my chin that would result in huge, painful acne cysts. After trying many different brands, I read the great reviews on this and thought I would give it a try. I have extremely sensitive skin, so I went ahead and bought the sensitive skin system before even trying the other one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First days of using: I patch tested everything first, separately, and also layering on top of each other. After 48 hours I was happy to see the area was clear and I had no reaction. The first night I used just the cleanser, to kind of slowly prepare my skin for the whole system. That by itself didn&#x27;t do much for my acne, but it did leave my skin feeling soft. I didn&#x27;t have any reaction, and the next night I decided to dive in and use all 3 steps.&lt;br /&gt;I was amazed when I woke up in the morning at how much clearer my skin was! The active breakout that I had was dried up and almost completely gone, and the existing blemishes were greatly reduced in size. A lot of the redness and swelling was also gone as well. I was thrilled! The great thing was it continued to work throughout the day too without reapplying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next couple days: The next night I used the cleanser and toner, but skipped the spot treatment because it says to use only every other day in the beginning. Fair enough. The next day I continued to see a difference in my skin, which was great considering I didn&#x27;t even use the spot treatment. Throughout the day though, I noticed I had some tiny bumps forming on my chin, but nothing major. The bumps were tiny. I thought that maybe this was an initial \\&quot;skin purging\\&quot; from introducing my skin to a new product, which has happened to me before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last couple days: That night I skipped the cleanser, worried that&#x27;s what was giving me the bumpy rash (cleanser have been known to effect me in that way before), and I used the toner on my chin and around my nose... BAD IDEA. About 2 minutes after using it the areas I applied it started burning like crazy, and turned bright red. I rinsed with cold water, and the burning subsided mostly. The next day, the whole area, especially the side of my chin where the bumps were, was scaly and dry. So dry it looked like my skin was going to crack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I moisturized, moisturized, and moisturized some more and used just water and some very gentle cleanser to wash my face for the next couple days and that seemed to fix everything I had done. Needless to say, I ended up returning the product as a whole and was disappointed. HOWEVER, I can say that even that 1 day of using it seemed to help my existing acne! My suggestion to any new users would be to patch test more than once, for more than one day, and see if anything happens. Then gradually use each product individually more than 1 day and see if anything happens.</li>
            <li> Im in my early 20&#x27;s and in these pass 4 months is the first time i seen my face brake out horribly. Through out my high school years i would have one or two zits once a month. have try this product for over 3 weeks already.  So far i have seen some results in my face, not much though. My red blemishes have slowly disappear, leaving some nasty scars. But im still getting pimples here and there, also my skin gets some what dry. Idk if i should keep using it or stop. Soon I&#x27;m going to see a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> ...not the blemishes maybe but the overall condition of my skin - it didn&#x27;t seem terribly gentle nor effective.</li>
            <li> Works well and non-irritating</li>
            <li> I thought that this was a great buy!  When my son was almost a year old and my skin was still a mess post-pregnancy, I was desperate.  Initially, I used the soap 2x a day and the toner, lotion 1x a day.  Within a few weeks, my skin was clear again.  I still have some of the lotion and toner left after 5 months and am using that 1x a day before bed.  When I am out, I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> It helped me reduce my acne and controlled further out break of it....But cannot categorize as &amp;#34;the best product&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Should be accompanied by a moisturizer routine as it makes your skin dry...</li>
            <li> Like the way it works.  I have sensitive skin and this has helped greatly.  I only have to use it once a day for it to keep my acne under control</li>
            <li> Remember try it on small area of your face. I bought it for my 12 years old daughter, she followed instruction, then she woke up with tiny rash all over her face. Now after almost one week, the rash still stays with a little improvement. Now I saw quite a few other reviews reveal the same problem, which I should have checked before I let her try.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year and it has kept my skin the clearest I have ever seen it. I started to see results the very first time I used it and now I cannot live without it. I have tried so many products but none have worked as well as this one. I honestly love this product. I dont know what I would do without it.</li>
            <li> great product my daughter has been using it for years now used to be able to buy it a Krogers but can only get online</li>
            <li> I have tried many other products, but this is the first one that really worked.  The main downsides are that 1) the spot treatment and the lotion smell a little, but it doesn&#x27;t last, so you can still use it in the morning and go off to work, and 2) after putting the spot treatment on and then the lotion, sometimes your skin gets a little red.  It doesn&#x27;t last very long and I use concealer anyway, so it&#x27;s not that big of a deal.  I love it, such a big difference!  I&#x27;m 27 and hate that I still have acne like a teenager, so this was a Godsend.</li>
            <li> Very effective. Not harsh like it not so gentle competitors. Cost effective.  Bought for teens - quick results and improvement of skin.</li>
            <li> Although it did take care of the acne of my face, it left me with red, dry and flaky patches all over my face. I had to go to my dermatologist to  get prescription to deal with the patches. (He said it resembled seborrheic dermatitis).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not say my skin is super sensitive, so I don&#x27;t think I am an extreme exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to people who want to clear  up acne BUT DO NOT HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN. If, however, your skin is sensitive, I suggest staying away for this product (especially the repairing lotion- it&#x27;s brutal).</li>
            <li> My husband asked me to get Proactive but I wanted to find it in a store and not online.  Instead I found the gentle formula Acnefree Sensitive Skin Acne System at CVS drug store for $ 19.99.  I saw a noticeable improvement within 12 hours of using it. It has a nice scent and does not leave skin feeling dry and cracked.  I cannot figure out why it worked overnight and the other over the counter stuff didn&#x27;t (for years).  Acnefree cost me at least $10 less than Proactive would have in a store.  I used Proactive several years ago and I stopped using it because I couldn&#x27;t afford it.  AcneFree is a cheap and effective alternative.</li>
            <li> the product isn&#x27;t what it seems it is really runny and I haven&#x27;t seen a difference in my skin yet been using it for couple weeks and nothing</li>
            <li> it worked the first few days and cleared some of the pimples I had but soon after using this product for about a week I started to get whiteheads. I usually never got whiteheads but I did after using this product. I stopped using it and now I&#x27;m using a Clean and Clear facewash that works so much better than this.</li>
            <li> First- Each and every person has different skin.  I have experimented with tons of acne treatments from Proactive- Pills/Cream prescribed by my doctor.  Finding the prefect treatment will be a trial and error process.  So far i have been using AcneFree Exfoliating scrub and it has dramatically made a change. The hardest thing was to try not to pick, which is a personal challenge i have to over come.  Now I use the Acne System daily and the exfoliating scrub every couple of days. I have been \\&quot;Acnefree\\&quot; for a couple months.  Keep searching people there is a product out there that is perfect for you!</li>
            <li> This is my first acne treatment system purchase, so I bought the sensitive skin version just to be safe, even though my skin has never been especially sensitive.  What a mistake!  After just three uses, the skin on my face is swollen, red, rough and itchy.  Nowhere on the packaging does it say to do a spot test before using it all over your face, but it should.  Now I have to walk around looking like I had a bad chemical peel.  It seems to have done its work on the pimples I had, so I guess it&#x27;s effective in that way, but I gave it a one-star rating because it specifically states on the box that it is \\&quot;gentle on easily irritated skin,\\&quot; and doesn&#x27;t advise the user to test it first. This stuff is going back to the store.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin. I had been using Velocity by Mary K for years, as it seemed to be the ONLY face wash that I didn&#x27;t have a bad reaction to. However, when I woke up a week ago with 4 pimples I decided I needed a change, which turned out to be a HUGE mistake! I followed the instructions for this product perfectly &amp; when I woke up the morning after the first time I used it, it seemed to already be working. However, the following day (after continued use) I woke up to a rash of the tiniest bumps covering my entire face, neck, and chest. They look like microscopic pimples and burn like a sun burn, especially on my jaw line for some reason. I immediately discontinued using Acnefree sensitive, however it has now been 4 days and I still have this hideous extremely uncomfortable rash! After doing research on allergic reactions to this product I&#x27;ve found at least 10 other reviews of people claiming to have the exact same reaction. If you truly have sensitive skin please reconsider because this product is anything but sensitive!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product at Walgreens. Wasn&#x27;t expecting the results that I have received from using it. My skin has cleared up. It is soft and dewey. I don&#x27;t get many breakouts anymore. When I do get new breakouts, they are smaller and fewer and they ckear up quickly. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Nice on sensitive skin. Does not leave skin dry plus it comes with a spot remover and cost half the price of proactive.</li>
            <li> Tried this product when the store was out of the regular Acnefree. Found it to be just as effective at controlling acne and even better for my skin. It&#x27;s more delicate formula doesn&#x27;t leave me with the little dry patches on my face like the original one had a tendency to do. Even left my skin feeling softer and more supple. Love this! Of course, the price is far better than Proactive. After having used Proactive for 5 years, I had started to develop some sort of immunity to it. I started getting acne flare ups again. Switched to Acnefree 6 years ago and haven&#x27;t had one flare up.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t take the time to post reviews, but for this particular product, I felt so compelled to write one, so here I go! This product saved my life. I never had acne in middle school and high school, but all of a sudden I began to get acne on my cheeks during college. I tried to get rid of it using &amp;#34;natural methods&amp;#34; such as tea tree oil, witch hazel, aloe vera, ACV, etc, and never had any noticeable results. Then, I tried using Clean &amp; Clear, and Neutrogena on the spot treatment, but I had very minimal results. SO... after reading so many positive reviews on the AcneFree systems, I decided to purchase one at my local Walmart. I decided to get the sensitive skin version, because I know Benzoyl Peroxide is very drying. It has been exactly 5 days since I used the system, and my acne has cleared about 70%, which is amazing. A lot of the redness from the acne has substantially faded. I was struggling because I felt so incredibly self conscious about my acne, but now, I feel like a new person!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do buy this, be sure to keep moisturized. I put on Cetaphil after the cleanser and toner, and then I put my treatment lotion. I avoid makeup usually, but I do wear it about twice a week. Let your skin breathe as it heals! Good luck everyone!</li>
            <li> I have REALLY sensitive skin, and this product makes my skin red, irritated, and after a few days, left my skin dry and flakey. Everyone is different, so it probably works better for others, but I will not be ordering this product again.</li>
            <li> Got this for Mom, and she loves it, says it&#x27;s gentle to her skin.</li>
            <li> This is the only acne set I have had success with, having tried Proactiv and the regular AcneFree system before, among others. This set does not feel harsh, though I rarely use the step 3 because it is very drying. The cleanser and toner have pleasant, earthy smells. While my face is not completely clear, I have noticed a dramatic reduction in the size and quantity of my breakouts. It lasts me a long time, too, as I only have to use about a pea sized dollop of the cleanser on my entire face. It feels so soothing, and I usually end my regimen with an SPF lotion as opposed to using step 3 of the system. I use step 3 in conjunction with lotion only at night, maybe once or twice a week, depending on how my skin is doing. It certainly helps when I start to notice a breakout.</li>
            <li> It works really well, we have tried the other one and this one works a lot better for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My 15 year old uses this twice a day. It works wonderfully. The thing is, you have to be consistent. Twice a day everyday! Preferable around the same times of day too. We really love it. You can&#x27;t be lazy about it though</li>
            <li> I am a female in my mid twenties and have never dealt with acne before until recently. I picked up the sensitive skin formula because my skin is very sensitive. I was in Walgreens about a month ago and decided to try this out because I was feeling desperate after a breakout on cheeks. I was very excited to try it out that I almost immediately washed my face when I got home. I used the cleanser, the toner, and the spot treatment. The next day my skin did seem to clear up, but it was dry and flaky. I assumed this was going to happen right away, especially for me because my skin is already very dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the course of the next week I didn&#x27;t see any major improvements, but the acne also wasn&#x27;t getting any worse. Even though I had dry patches, I figured it was doing its job. After 2 weeks daily use (sometimes just once a day depending on the dryness of my skin), my cheeks started to feel extremely itchy. It was so uncomfortable. I stopped using the spot treatment because I figured that was the cause of the pain. It wasn&#x27;t. A few days after that my cheeks developed very deep zits, almost like cysts. They never came to a head, but my cheeks are large, painful, red bumps all over them. They itched like crazy. I kept using the cleanser because I was afraid it would get worse if I just stopped the treatment. But it continually got worse and worse. I could no longer wear makeup because my skin was so parched and burned and bumpy. I have NEVER had skin this bad in my entire life. I came home one day last week after work and just broke down. I threw out the product and decided to stop every treatment. I would only use Dial soap and see if that would help my skin. After 1 day my skin began to clear a little. And today, about a week after quitting the treatment, my skin is soft and much smoother. I still have a few large lumps under the skin, but they are no longer red, inflamed, or painful. Also I don&#x27;t have that peeling parched skin anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had such a negative reaction to skin products in my life. They should NOT market this as a &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; skin product. I have actual sensitive skin, and to all those that do, STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT. The last month has brought me down to an emotional low that I have never felt before. Believe me when I say that this product can definitely make your acne much worse than it was before.</li>
            <li> So I have had very bad skin since Middle School and I have struggled with it even til this day at 31. I have oily skin, mild to moderate acne and have very sensitive skin. When I first started using this product it turned my face red and dried it out for the first week but I will say that it was just bring all the yuck stuff to the surface so the next week I just used it at night and in the morning I would use a gentle moisturizer cleanser  and it works out. I think the key is to find out a schedule is best for you to use it for your skin. My face is a lot clearer but I am still getting the big flat red bumps, but I drink a lot of dark soda&#x27;s and not enough water, which does help!!!</li>
            <li> I saw a video of a girl that had rosacea and said that this product help and even though my rosacea is not as bad as hers I found this product is so nice to my skin, very gentle and no overdrying! I am in love with it! I&#x27;ve been using it for like a month and I could see the results right away (believe me that I am not one of those people who says this kind of line very often, but the result significantly good!)&lt;br /&gt;I encourage you to give it a try to this product, especially if you have sensitive skin :)</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that helps keep my husbands skin clear. It works much better then proactive and is a third of the cost!</li>
            <li> Only product that TREATS CURRENT acne and PREVENTS FUTURE acne for me! I recommend this to everyone and believe I sound like an infomercial just talking about it! I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin but use this because it is cheaper than their regular line. LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> Bought this at 2 weeks ago and its great i had acne all over my face and its pretty much gone! The cleanser did dry out my face a little so i only use it once a day instead of twice and its not dry any more. I used to always cover my face in foundation and concealer so i could hide my acne and i haven&#x27;t had to using this product. I&#x27;m 16 and i have literary tried every product they sell at my local walmart and rite aid and I either dried my face out or didn&#x27;t work acne wise and it doesn&#x27;t take much time to use. I would defiantly recommend this for people who have blackheads and under the skin pimples. The under the skin ones never surface with this product it just goes away and after all my blackheads were gone i haven&#x27;t seen another.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Proactive in the past with great results and have used other knockoffs for decent results so thought I&#x27;d give this brand a try and unfortunately, my results have been horrific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my late 30s and this product made me break back out as if I were in high school.  I have pretty sensitive skin and am African American and this product just didn&#x27;t work at all for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just feels pretty cheap on my skin.  To be fair, skin products are trial and error so this may work for you.  All I can say is it didn&#x27;t work for me.  This product has set my skin back a good 3 months which I guess is punishment for me trying to skimp on my skin care since this was about 1/2 the price of Proactive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, you can tell by the # of reviews i&#x27;ve done that i&#x27;m not a shill for any company.  But in my case, this product is proof that you get what you pay for.  So, its back to Proactive for me, there are some things you shouldn&#x27;t skimp on and facial skin care is one of them.</li>
            <li> Is it only me or everyone will get hurt for the first time using this AcneFree ?&lt;br /&gt;especially the HYDRATING ACNE REPAIR LOTION + SPOT TREATMENT, it becomes red and dry and hurt whenever i use it on my acne&#x27;s land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so confused that if i allergies this item or not ...</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Non irritating and non drying\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;That is the falsest statement ever about this product.  I got the sensitive kind specifically because of that feature, and spent more on this product because of that, when there were cheaper systems out there.  Since day one using this my skin has been completely dry and irritated, what finally drove me to write this review is because tonight it made my skin feel like it was burning off my face.  I haven&#x27;t been using any other products with this, and I only use it once a day.  Overall, I am super disappointed with this product, I haven&#x27;t seen a single change in my acne with it.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding the sensitive skin over the counter and was happy to find it here.  Shipping was fast!  This works wonderfully for my 13 year old daughter, must use it as directed.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product i have been using it for two weeks and o my gosh my face looks awesome thanks acne free</li>
            <li> I am a long time acne sufferer who still gets pimples as an adult.  Of course, it&#x27;s not the same amount or type as when I was a teenager, but pimples are never welcome.  I decided to try this after the reviews on Amazon and I&#x27;m happy I did.  The stuff is gentle and zaps zits in no time.  It is a little drying, but as someone with combination skin, that&#x27;s not an issue for me.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend trying this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered since my late 20&#x27;s with acne and been to several dermatologists for it. Had some success, some failures. It is much better now that I&#x27;m in my early 50&#x27;s. I had used the regular strength AcneFree and then decided to try this. Within a week I had perfectly clear skin and it&#x27;s stayed that way. Now I feel confident that I can have some minor cosmetic procedures to repair some of the damage done to my skin over the years. This is better than anything, even most prescription meds I&#x27;ve used. In fact I quit taking my antibiotic and my skin broke out. Used this, and all clear.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic. I had some spotty breakouts due to some hormone imbalances. The product was gentle enough to clear up the breakouts while not drying out my skin. This is important to lemon my early 40s. I saw noticeable improvement within the first 2 days!!! The most dramatic improvement happens overnight. I was a former proactive user but I have switched!  Get this. You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Cleared skin within days. It is drying so I had to use my own moisturizer with it. Otherwise it is an awesome product. I&#x27;m 34 with adult acne. My daughter is 13 and it worked very good for her also. Better than proactiv.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast shipping! Thank you! A+</li>
            <li> I have never suffered from acne as a teen , or young adult . I am in my 50&#x27;s now and I have noticed now and then a few black heads at my cheek bone area. I do however suffer from very sensitive skin issues. I started using this product about 8 months ago , I immediately saw as difference in my cheek area. My routine for me seems to work. I use the cleanser in the morning ,in the shower , and the toner and repair lotion in the evening. I do this for one week, the next week every other day ,the same way . I use purity made simple by PHILOSOPHY on my off week. I have to say this product never leaves my face dry or tight feeling , JUST nice and clean . It doesn&#x27;t have any odor or fragrance at all. It just really works for me . I purchase it now from Amazon because it is much cheaper then in any super store or discount stores around . I sincerely feel this acne product deserves 5 stars .  THANKS FOR READING , BYE .  P.S.  I tried Pro active , didn&#x27;t work at all for me .  THANKS  AGAIN.</li>
            <li> Works great! Definitely gentler than the original one but still wors great!</li>
            <li> Acne runs in the family. I know acne well. Although Proactive was not around in my acne days (I am almost 48 now), I had heard that it was amazingly effective. When my 19 year old son began to have breakouts I started him on Proactive right away. However,  his acne worsened. I read online that that some people who use proactive have this reaction, and that it should be stopped right away. I figured because he has red hair and sensitive skin that Proactive was too harsh. The Acne Free system was the next thing I tried. Within a matter of two weeks his skin is 100% clear!! I am so happy, and plan to continue using this product regularly with him until he grows out of those dreaded acne years!</li>
            <li> Worked really well at first. I had clear skin for the first time in a long time, but over time, stopped working as well...looking for another miracle elsewhere:/</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that i was a little skeptical about this product because one i have never heard of it before and two i wasn&#x27;t sure about buying anything that can seriously treat acne out of my local drugstore. I&#x27;m 36 years old and have had mild to moderate acne since about the age of about 27. I have always had some form of acne being just small breakouts to damn near cystic modules underneath the skin, well the day i visited the Walgreens, i was having a full blown acne attack, and i mostly get it smack dap on my jaw and jawline, not really get breakouts anywhere else, so anyways i stood there and determined which yet fail product i was gonna buy and take home, so i picked this one and the sales lady assured me i can bring it back if it didn&#x27;t work for me, my first experience was it was very drying and i figured oh im not gonna be able to use this every morning and night,by the third day i said well it is making the breakout smaller,so i decided give it a chance and use it as directed and see what happens, now im at 1 week and 1 day and i have to say this has now become my HG! this has completely changed my face,even though i grabbed the AcneFree Sensitive, and at the time my face was so bad i could have gotten the Severe, but i didn&#x27;t know how my skin would react to it. My breakouts are almost completely dried up and gone and i will not use anything else for my acne. I have being using the Proactive green tea moisturizer when my face feels a little dry, but i have never have anything work so well and i especially love the price and that i can get it from my local drugstore or walmart, so thats my review. I hope it was helpful.</li>
            <li> Great price but it didn&#x27;t do the job like Proactiv does. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different so it might work for others but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I am 27 and have had problem skin since I was 13. I have used all manner of products from Proactiv, to stuff from Clinque and Body Shop and Lush. I have also used prescription medication. Nothing helped and I was resigned to having miserable skin forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was having a particularly bad break out and passed this product in Target. I decided to buy it just to see, but to be honest I suspected these tubes and bottles would end up in the drawer with all the other failed attempts. I was never so happy to be wrong!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within just a few days, my cystic stuff was gone. Blackheads are at a minimum, and even now my breakouts aren&#x27;t full-face meltdowns, they are one tiny zit that I can easily treat. They stopped selling this product at Target but I buy it from Amazon because it is AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can wear makeup! I dont flinch when someone wants a picture! I feel like I finally have control over my skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried alot of products and have a mild skin problem that comes and goes. Just looking for something to keep consistently clear. The products feel good on the skin however I didnt notice any real improvement in my skin&#x27;s quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of products over the years.  I&#x27;ve tried proactive, I&#x27;ve tried prescriptions of benzecline, I&#x27;ve tried using the all-natural oils (grapeseed, EVOO and tea tree oil, castor oil...) and my acne has stayed with me.  I&#x27;m 23.  I&#x27;m sick of this crap.  Then I tried this stuff.  I&#x27;ve had it about 2 months now and this is the first time I&#x27;ve been able to leave the house without makeup on without feeling self-conscious about my skin since high school.  What a blessing!!  My acne was decently mild for 2 weeks and then the 2 weeks around that wonderful time of the month were terrible.  Like the big raised ones deep under the skin that hurt just to poke.  This keeps my face under control all month, which has never happened.  My skin also dries out REALLY easily, to the point of looking like a reptile if I wore makeup for a whole day.  Flake chunks... not fun... but that was better than the acne underneath the makeup at the time.  This happened with all of the previous attempts listed at the top.  Now I can put on my makeup at the beginning of the day (I can finally use BareMinerals again without drying out) and even if it wears off I&#x27;m not worried because my skin is mostly clear.  It&#x27;d probably be totally clear if I could kick the habit of picking at my face.  That&#x27;s my next goal.  TRY THIS. I bet you won&#x27;t regret it!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product off an on for the past two years.  I switch to more natural products, but they never work as well as this.  I don&#x27;w even wash my face with this every day and it keeps my skin clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have with this product is the Spot Treatment / Daily Moisturizer, it makes my skin shiny, especially during the summer months,  I have combination skin, with an oily T-Zone area, and this lotion makes it even more obvious with the heat hits.  Might want to add a mattifying lotion if you have the same skin type.</li>
            <li> I bought this system a little over a year ago and it worked wonders!! It did dry my skin out some in the beginning, but that only lasted a few days. I loved this system. It&#x27;s a great price and last for about 3-4 months. That whas a big plus. I had bad acne on my forehead and with this it was gone in about a week. After about 10 months my skin started breaking out again and went back to it&#x27;s old ways. I would recommend this product but it may not be a long term solution.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had annoying acne since puberty and this set changed my skin dramatically. 4 starts because it&#x27;s a little drying and I haven&#x27;t discovered a moisturizer that&#x27;d work with this set without the pimples going back.</li>
            <li> I was a proactive customer for years but it was costing me an arm and a leg so I decided to try something new.  I found AcneFree at the drugstore and gave it a try.  It&#x27;s great!  I literally do not have breakouts with this product.  It is a little drying, despite it being the sensitive version, so I do use another moisturizer over it.  But even the extra moisturizer doesn&#x27;t make me break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m re-ordering the product because I ran out and decided to try something else and lo and behold I have the first pimples I&#x27;ve had in months!  Back to Acne Free where I know my skin will be clear.</li>
            <li> This is gentle for my sensitive skin, yet works really well for my trouble zones.  Blemishes cleared up within 2 days of using this.</li>
            <li> Product is great! really does work. Was shipped really quickly</li>
            <li> I have always been a faithful customer and LOVE this product, but they must have changed the formula. Now when I use the product my face gets red and itchy. It never used to do that, so I switched and tried the sensitive line. Does the same thing. Disappointed because this product does work! My skin is clear and it is the first product that didn&#x27;t dry out my skin. Too bad I get a reaction because this was and still is (but only on occasion) my miracle go-to skin care. FYI is not Gluten friendly for my celiac people.</li>
            <li> Awesome!! Best acne system I&#x27;ve ever used! This system, combined with an at home Salicylic Acid peel once every 10-14 days virtually eliminated my extremely severe acne. Best of all it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin like most other acne products. Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 35 with combo-oily skin with acne issues that have worsen in my 20&#x27;s-30&#x27;s. I&#x27;ve used this for a good month now and it works great. Doesn&#x27;t over dry my skin and I use an additional moisturizer with 2% salicylic acid. I DO have very sensitive skin, so sensitive, I had to change my toothpaste because it was drying out the skin around the corners of my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Now, my acne is very minimal and when I do breakout, it&#x27;s not half as bad as it was before. The pimples go away a lot faster and heals very quickly, doesn&#x27;t linger for 3+ weeks like it used to before. I&#x27;m able to wear less make-up and cover up but I do have scarring that I&#x27;m trying to lighten with a different product.&lt;br /&gt;So I bought the sensitive kit on sale at my local Target, however, I didn&#x27;t notice the expiration date of July 2012 (had bought it in June). So I bought another kit from my local Bed Bath &amp; Beyond store because I had a 20% off coupon and I was less than half empty on my expiring kit. The new kit had an expiration date of 2013 but the wash is completely different and the bottle packaging were different colors (new is blue the original is green at the base). The smell is different, the new formula stinks (smell wise), isn&#x27;t moisturizing or luxurious like the old version and it doesn&#x27;t suds up at all. It just oozes out and that&#x27;s it. So I returned it and am now going to try the Sensitive Acne Pore Cleanser, replacing the alcohol free toner with an alcohol free Stridex pad, then the Oil-Free All Day Acne Control then the 3-in-1 Acne Night Repair. I am hoping this will work just as well if not better. The Sensitive Hydrating Acne Repair Lotion + Spot Lotion worked so well for my acne and skin resulting in no irritation and eliminating new pimples, I&#x27;ll miss it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried Proactive on 2 different occasions to find that my skin cannot handle the wash at all, the skin under my eyes got completely raw...flaming red, no cover up could mask it not to mention plain water on it burnt like crazy. Their gentle formula didn&#x27;t work half as well as this AcneFree Sensitive kit. So I have discovered that my skin can handle benzoyl peroxide in lotions where it&#x27;s more controled where I apply it, but not in face washes where it can slip and slide to more sensitive areas (close to the eyes). I have used salon strength benzoyl peroxide up to 15% and have been ok so I&#x27;m really hoping 5% in the All Day Control will work. I look forward to not having my pillow cases bleached from the benzoyl peroxide anymore too.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure the new, reformulated Sensitive kit would work fine for me, I&#x27;m just very particular and didn&#x27;t like the smell, texture or consistency of the wash and am willing to try other products from the same line before returning to the Sensitive kit. I know my review has a lot more information than one may want to know, but I hope sharing my experience helped one decide if this is the right product for them to try.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Kit for my adult daughter after reading a review in Consumer Reports which stated that this product worked as well as Proactiv for about half the price. She has sensative skin and has reported to me that daily use has not caused redness or irritation, but has definitly cleared up her skin. Overall, we are pleased with this product. Delivery was quick as well.</li>
            <li> Meh. Just didn&#x27;t work. More trouble than it was worth.</li>
            <li> I use it once a day, at night. about 30 min or more before I go to sleep for the night. I use the 3rd step spot treatment only on spots that really need it. It burns when I put it on but does the job &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave any spot or redness/dry spot.  I have seen immediate results and have been using it about a week now.&lt;br /&gt;I will def. keep using!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(sidenote: I have very mild acne, only a few trouble spots and blackheads)</li>
