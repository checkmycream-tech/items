            <li>I bought these blades expecting a great shave...</li>
            <li>The people at Harry&#x27;s are great to work with</li>
            <li>then the second&lt;br /&gt;Company is great at getting every Podcast to&lt;br /&gt;schill</li>
            <li>Great packaging and marketing.  </li>
            <li>The blades and razor are great.</li>
            <li>Really great blades.</li>
            <li>It shaved off 5&amp;#34; of my skin in one lovely piece!!  </li>
            <li>, presentation/packaging is very nice.  </li>
            <li>Their packaging and marketing are unbelievably good.  </li>
            <li>All is not as it appears and the Gillette products are superior.</li>
            <li>the shave is about has good as disposable razors.  </li>
            <li>, I got one or two good shaves with these blades before they crapped</li>
            <li>But they have now dropped the price to about $2 a blade which is a good buy.    </li>
            <li>Great presentation, nice heft to razor handle, BUT..rough shave.</li>
            <li>Wanted to like this product, and the price is good</li>
            <li>I have been shaving for 30 years and find these blades to be as good as any I have used.</li>
            <li>My conclusion is nothing is perfect unless you are willing to get all your hair removed by lazer</li>
            <li>As a result the shaving experience was more pleasant with the Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a result the shaving experience was more pleasant with the Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was pretty happy with the product&#x27;s performance but not so happy with the price.</li>
            <li>mg aspirin in 30mL of warm water.  </li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t honestly recommend your product.</li>
            <li>Nice story line.&lt;br /&gt;Want</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pretty handle and nice boxes are going in the trash.</li>
            <li>I liked the shaving cream.</li>
            <li>The blade just doesn&#x27;t cut through their own shave cream to the bottom of the stubble on the face (or anyone else&#x27;s shave cream for that matter).</li>
            <li>Handle is nice, shaving gel was good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The handle is nice.</li>
            <li>They have a nice plan tailored to your own shaving habits, and you can cancel at any time.  </li>
            <li>Wow, what a bust and I had great hopes all along!  </li>
            <li>These blades and the handle are elegant and nicely made.</li>
            <li>Had the replacement razor been as good as the original razor I would be a fan.</li>
            <li>No tugging and good clean shaves</li>
            <li>Although they should have called it \\&quot;Nick&#x27;s\\&quot; rather than \\&quot;Harry&#x27;s\\&quot;  :-)    </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off with a BIC......</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re stuck with an Harry razor like I am you&#x27;ll probably want to consider switching to a more reputable brand once you run (or snap) out of blades.</li>
            <li>went back to my Schick Hydro 3, which, in my opinion is the best razor out there - for me that is.  </li>
            <li>Confident that this razor and blades will work for me, I have placed a $20 order for additional blades.</li>
            <li>Much better blade</li>
            <li>Family dollar cheapies do a better job.</li>
            <li>I believe I had a better shave when I was in bootcamp</li>
            <li>how many gifts my wife has given me</li>
            <li>so when I find it on sale on Amazon it makes it even better.</li>
            <li>have given one star but the return process was the most effortless experience I&#x27;ve ever had, so they&#x27;ve got that going for them.</li>
            <li>here&#x27;s the most damning thing of all:  </li>
            <li>In a touch test my wife liked the cheap razor shaved side better than the Harry&#x27;s side</li>
            <li>and that was after I used 2-3 times as many strokes to shave the Harry&#x27;s side.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a loser.</li>
            <li>I have used the Mach 3 razor for many years, but when I saw the Harry&#x27;s add, I decided to try the razor.</li>
            <li>Harry&#x27;s should considered designing a slimmer more maneuverable razor blade.</li>
            <li>I would have had better luck using a hunting knife.</li>
            <li>After taking out a ANOTHER chunk of skin on my chin a couple weeks ago, I realized that most of their blades are defective.  </li>
            <li>but I now bear way too many scars on my face from trying to like your product.  </li>
            <li>Great at marketing not so much at making razors.</li>
            <li>The first shave on the second blade was fair at best.  </li>
            <li>The first two blades were amazing and even though I wasn&#x27;t 100% thrilled with the lack of maneuverability of the blades</li>
            <li>They are very good blades but cost a little more than Harry&#x27;s and are not quite as good.    </li>
            <li>New, these do not deliver a great shave compared to the Fusion Power Pro.</li>
            <li>On a positive note, this is a good beginner set for teens.</li>
            <li>Do not misunderstand me, the feeling is pretty good, it runs quite smoothly</li>
            <li>Cut myself with these blades as I would with cheap disposals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was hoping for a better shave.</li>
            <li>Shaves close easily.</li>
            <li>I liked the handle and that was the only good part.</li>
            <li>Average at best.</li>
            <li>Hands down, this is the best.</li>
            <li>The overall experience was great with the razor that was attached.</li>
            <li>Try it, it works and it&#x27;s dirt cheap, unless you&#x27;re allergic to aspirin.  </li>
            <li>Quality handle which is easy to keep clean</li>
            <li>I will be happy to revise my review if this is not so or if I begin having a problem with subsequent blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li>, I just order 8 blades for $15, free shipping.</li>
            <li>The razor head conforms to the face, lips and chip and leaves a smooth face without nicks.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re cheap but you get what you pay for</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t see or fit otherwise</li>
            <li>good old Schick or Gillette.  </li>
            <li>The first shave was pretty good.  </li>
            <li>next day I installed a new Harry&#x27;s replacement blade and once again, -- a wonderful shave.</li>
            <li>next day I installed a new Harry&#x27;s replacement blade and once again, -- a wonderful shave.</li>
            <li>cause me to gouge myself significantly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving with the power ProGlide for over a year and have never gotten one nick, which is the first blade I&#x27;ve ever been able to go against the grain on my neck without getting</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t buy any more blades because at 4 blades for $16 they are not a bargain.  </li>
            <li>Although the design is pretty good, in my opinion, it is also one of the main problem.</li>
            <li>Easier to clean cut hair from between blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great precision razors, which are worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li>The only good to come of the experiment  was the discovery of the saving cream of Taylor of Old Bond Street (sold here at Amazon) which is amazing and is a great bargain (it goes a long way) compared to the canned variety.  </li>
            <li>I was super excited when I got the package that included the razor and blades.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re anything but a Teenager, with not much of a beard, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
            <li>Really good German metal.</li>
            <li>Shop BJâ€™s or similar for Gillette quality at a good price.</li>
            <li>Also the blade doesn&#x27;t pivot which kind of surprised</li>
            <li>I signed up for the full package, shave balm, and auto reorder.</li>
            <li>There seems to be mixed feelings about the shaving cream, but I liked it just fine.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that there was even stubble on my cheeks, which even cheap blades usually do better (as oppsoed to my neck area).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Sorry Harry&#x27;s good idea, nice presentation but the blades sucks.</li>
            <li>Very pretty razors and snazzy graphics, but</li>
            <li>I have reduced this from my original two stars to one star because, when I switched back, I realized that the difference is amazing.</li>
            <li>I was still able to get a smooth shave, but there was definitely more drag.</li>
            <li>I was still able to get a smooth shave, but there was definitely more drag.</li>
            <li>I am still on my first blade that came with the $15.00 original razor/2 blade package deal.</li>
            <li>Dorco is far superior to this product&#x27;s out-of-the-box, brand-spankin&#x27; new blade.  </li>
            <li>But some of these negative reviews are so over the top, I can&#x27;t help, but question their motive in light of my own experience.</li>

            <li>I can imagine, since the comparable Gillette and Schick models have a superior tilt, that if you try to shave with the same pressure and angle using a Harry&#x27;s Razor, that you are way more likely to nick yourself or cause razor burn.</li>

            <li>I then started to shave my shin when the fun started.  </li>
            <li>I love it so far.</li>
            <li>The inconsistency of the blade quality simply isn&#x27;t worth it at any price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered the starter kit which is nicely packed and received it shortly afterwards.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely worth a try -  you like it or you don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Good product but be careful with twiggy and his 2 nutty friends.</li>
            <li>The blade is outstanding because it is so sharp and lasts through many shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Right away I threw out the shave cream.</li>
            <li>I find most of the negative reviews amusing.</li>
            <li>I got the Truman handle and initial box of 2 razors along with the original shave cream that was available at the time (since then they&#x27;ve launched a foaming gel which I haven&#x27;t tried).</li>
            <li>I used Cremo after the first shave but still got the tugging, bumps, etc.  </li>
            <li>I bought the starter pack with a coupon, direct from Harry&#x27;s, so got it for $10.00 and free shipping.  </li>
            <li>third wasnt much better</li>
            <li>These are great blades, long lasting, close shave.</li>
            <li>Direct from Harry&#x27;s is dirt cheap</li>
            <li>If you like something different than go with Harry&#x27;s top notch quality.</li>
            <li>Either skip it or have a first aid kit nearby.</li>
            <li>Part of the reason for this is that the total surface area of the Harry&#x27;s blade is greater than that of the Mach 3.</li>
            <li>Just went through my first blade that came with the razor handle.  </li>
            <li>It left a lot of stubble, and I went over my face/neck more than once.  </li>
            <li>I can change them frequently and the cost is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I have tried many many products over the years from electic razors that cost hundreds of dollars to low to high-end regular disposable razors.</li>
            <li>This is significantly better vs the big names unless you buy specialty foam and conditioner</li>
            <li>I first gave Harry&#x27;s 1 star but the blade that came with the razor was defective.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the packaging for their blades but the razor itself felt much better with a properly manufactured blade.</li>
            <li>Good that they are not available.</li>
            <li>And it probably would do just fine for those fuzzy faces that don&#x27;t require the heavy lifting experience of a top brand blade.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like you have to remove most all the shaving cream with the first pass, even when very conservatively applied to the face, and the second pass starts to shave the stubble.</li>
            <li>If I am keeping it real, I think the Gillette Fusion Pro overall is still a better razor, but in my opinion from a price to performance ratio</li>
            <li>If I am keeping it real, I think the Gillette Fusion Pro overall is still a better razor, but in my opinion from a price to performance ratio</li>
            <li>The second and third were not so good</li>
            <li>Sorry, Harry&#x27;s, you may have good price, cute marketing &amp; a slick-looking product -</li>
            <li>This is still a slightly better blade and system than Harry&#x27;s but not by much and definitely not to justify purchasing it over Harry&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, upon ordering my first set of 4 replacement blades I found the quality to absolutely disappear.</li>
            <li>I guess you really do get what you pay for.ricier Gillette products and after the first shave the difference in quality</li>
            <li>I changed the blade and used a gel lubricant instead of their foam and got a very decent shave.</li>
            <li>As for the the Harry&#x27;s Razors they work just as well as the national brand at less than half the price--and the free handle works great as well.  </li>
            <li>Shaving under the nose (without the benefit of the single blade on the Fusion) does require more effort, but is doable.</li>
            <li>I moved on to the second one and it was fine.</li>
            <li>I am very please with this razor and blades .I</li>
            <li>I know this is turning into a cliche, but I really wanted this razor to work as well.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product.  </li>
            <li>Straight to the trash can.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product</li>
            <li>My husband really likes this product</li>
            <li>I really, really wanted this to work.</li>
            <li>was absolutely staggering.</li>
            <li>was absolutely staggering.</li>
            <li>I guess you really do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>price is seductive; the quality leaves much to be desired.</li>
            <li>There is just too much surface area and the whole head rides up onto the foam.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to like this razor - I really did.</li>
            <li>Absolutely agree with others comments.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll start off by saying that I really wanted to like this razor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now ready to use Harry&#x27;s Razor.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend the heavier handle as I do find the regular ones just too light weight.</li>
            <li>Do they give you the shave of a straight razor in the barber shop?</li>
            <li>really?</li>
            <li>It leaves my face much smoother.</li>
            <li>The razor is very lightweight.</li>
            <li>Now that I am in a position to believe the bad reviews (instead of being romanced by the amazing packaging and design - which are exceptional)</li>
            <li>In the end, it&#x27;s a surprisingly good product that does close to the same job for a lot less money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really tried to like these cute little razors.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to adopt a new razor</li>
            <li>All in all my Gillette refills while more expensive than Harry&#x27;s are much better than Harry&#x27;s replacement blades.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s way more expensive than $3-$5 products most buy.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get a decent shave.</li>
            <li>As much as I was loving the brand experience, the product just doesn&#x27;t &#x27;cut it&#x27;, and I mean that literally.</li>
            <li>The first blade I used from the new box felt like I was shaving with a 2 month old blade.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this razor to everyone.</li>
            <li>But really, order direct from Harry&#x27;s</li>
            <li>The coefficient of friction of the material of the Harry&#x27;s shave head is noticeably greater compared to the Mach 3 or Mach3 Turbo blade against bare wet skin.</li>
            <li>Old Guy (60), medium beard/shaved head, really like the razor.&lt;br /&gt;Blade lasts and performs well.</li>
            <li>normally shave with a Gillette Fusion.</li>
            <li>The shave was smooth the first few times, as is the Schick Hydro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>I was left with far more stubble than with my current razor.</li>
            <li>My Gillette razor rinses quickly, the Harry&#x27;s blades need to be held under the water much too long and even then they don&#x27;t always clear out.</li>
            <li>The bottom line is I can get a better shave for far less money using Bic disposables.</li>
            <li>The only improvement would be the addition of the top single blade for trimming sideburns, but at this price I can live without it.  </li>
            <li>I put a new blade on and started to shave by my ankle.  </li>
            <li>I live in Florida and go to work in dresses.  </li>
            <li>The bottom blade was bent, see picture and ripped me a new one before I noticed the blood.</li>
            <li>I purchased a new pack of Fusion Pro Power (which I was using pre-Harry).</li>
            <li>Left two huge gashes on the back of my head</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m in my thirties and have been in professions since 19 years old that require employees to be clean shaven every single day.</li>
            <li>money is no option, in my opinion, the Gillette Fusion feature-wise continues to be the overall better razor, but if you are on a budget and would prefer to spend your money on things other than razor blades, Harry&#x27;s razor provides a quality shave for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>This week I went back to the pricier Gillette products and after the first shave the difference in quality</li>
            <li>Left my skin feeling pretty torn</li>
            <li>The first time I sliced my face open with these razors I thought &amp;#34;oh</li>
            <li>The handle is heavy and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>First time was just okay, not great though.</li>
            <li>I have no problem reversing a positive review should it become necessary.</li>
            <li>I have no problem reversing a positive review should it become necessary.</li>
            <li>Went back to my disposable Schicks which I would judge to be 10 times better with less blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I emailed pics of the entire situation including the large strip of skin and asked them to call me immediately.  </li>
            <li>You get what you pay for: dull blades that needs to be replaced more often.</li>
            <li>Until Harry&#x27;s can get a handle on the quality and safety of their blades and cartridges, I would steer clear of Harry&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I have slightly sensitive skin and my neck looked like a war zone when I got out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>My three-week old three-blade</li>
            <li>Now that I know I will buy direct for Harry.</li>
            <li>Not going to send it back, gpoing to bust the whole kit up with a hammer and hope no one is injured in the process.</li>
            <li>I bought my razor kit directly from Harry&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Not for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My point being, I&#x27;ve been around the block as far as shaving products go.</li>
            <li>The German engineering has some real problems when it comes to making razor blades.  </li>
            <li>I am 29 years old and Iv&#x27;e shaving since i was 16.</li>
            <li>these razor ate my head alive.</li>
            <li>Finally and the main reason I went back to my old razor was these blades nicked me much easier.  </li>
            <li>The look of the head is very different than other brands and does look cheap</li>
            <li>noticed that if you bring the blade down relatively quickly on your skin, the blades will tend to cut you.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>I always try to support the little guy especially when he charges less for a superior product.</li>
            <li>(I have a beard and only shave every other day) compared to a full month with my Schick Hydro that I&#x27;ve used for years.  </li>
            <li>These blades will not make you think of other fine German brands such as Bosch, BMW and Mercedes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really tried to make these things work, but I have had more razor rash and cuts in the past 2 weeks than in the previous 5 years combined.</li>
            <li>I sneezed while using them on lefty--the one that hangs low and nearly cut it off!</li>
            <li>That said, should I, too, come across a bad batch of Harry&#x27;s Replacement Blades, I&#x27;ll be happy to update once again.</li>
            <li>That said, should I, too, come across a bad batch of Harry&#x27;s Replacement Blades, I&#x27;ll be happy to update once again.</li>
            <li>First of all I am absolutely dumbfounded by the negative reviews.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s the same old bait and switch that all of the razor companies use.</li>
            <li>I am 83 years old and have used a lot of different types of razors.</li>
            <li>A broken piece of glass would have offered a better shave.  </li>
            <li>Maybe Harry has had quality control problems in the past or maybe I have been just lucky but</li>
            <li>If you are used to GIllete or major brand razors, you will notice a very obvious difference.</li>
            <li>Actually I have a suspicion, but how could one prove that is was posted by an employee of a major manufacturer.  </li>
            <li>, it flexes very well and the angle at which you shave it different than the other brands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried a large number of shaving techniques and foams and conditioners that are suppose to give a closer shave with less resistence.</li>

            <li> The people at Harry&#x27;s are great to work with</li>

            <li> The blades and razor are great.</li>
            <li> Really great blades.</li>
            <li> It shaved off 5&amp;#34; of my skin in one lovely piece!!  </li>
            <li> , presentation/packaging is very nice.  </li>
            <li> Their packaging and marketing are unbelievably good.  </li>
            <li> All is not as it appears and the Gillette products are superior.</li>
            <li> the shave is about has good as disposable razors.  </li>
            <li> , I got one or two good shaves with these blades before they crapped</li>
            <li> But they have now dropped the price to about $2 a blade which is a good buy.    </li>
            <li> Great presentation, nice heft to razor handle, BUT..rough shave.</li>
            <li> Wanted to like this product, and the price is good</li>
            <li> I have been shaving for 30 years and find these blades to be as good as any I have used.</li>
            <li> My conclusion is nothing is perfect unless you are willing to get all your hair removed by lazer</li>
            <li> As a result the shaving experience was more pleasant with the Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a result the shaving experience was more pleasant with the Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was pretty happy with the product&#x27;s performance but not so happy with the price.</li>
            <li> mg aspirin in 30mL of warm water.  </li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t honestly recommend your product.</li>
            <li> Nice story line.&lt;br /&gt;Want</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pretty handle and nice boxes are going in the trash.</li>
            <li> I liked the shaving cream.</li>
            <li> The blade just doesn&#x27;t cut through their own shave cream to the bottom of the stubble on the face (or anyone else&#x27;s shave cream for that matter).</li>
            <li> Handle is nice, shaving gel was good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The handle is nice.</li>
            <li> They have a nice plan tailored to your own shaving habits, and you can cancel at any time.  </li>
            <li> Wow, what a bust and I had great hopes all along!  </li>
            <li> These blades and the handle are elegant and nicely made.</li>
            <li> Had the replacement razor been as good as the original razor I would be a fan.</li>
            <li> No tugging and good clean shaves</li>
            <li> Although they should have called it \\&quot;Nick&#x27;s\\&quot; rather than \\&quot;Harry&#x27;s\\&quot;  :-)    </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off with a BIC......</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re stuck with an Harry razor like I am you&#x27;ll probably want to consider switching to a more reputable brand once you run (or snap) out of blades.</li>
            <li> went back to my Schick Hydro 3, which, in my opinion is the best razor out there - for me that is.  </li>
            <li> Confident that this razor and blades will work for me, I have placed a $20 order for additional blades.</li>
            <li> Much better blade</li>
            <li> Family dollar cheapies do a better job.</li>
            <li> I believe I had a better shave when I was in bootcamp</li>
            <li> how many gifts my wife has given me</li>
            <li> so when I find it on sale on Amazon it makes it even better.</li>
            <li> have given one star but the return process was the most effortless experience I&#x27;ve ever had, so they&#x27;ve got that going for them.</li>
            <li> here&#x27;s the most damning thing of all:  </li>
            <li> In a touch test my wife liked the cheap razor shaved side better than the Harry&#x27;s side</li>
            <li> and that was after I used 2-3 times as many strokes to shave the Harry&#x27;s side.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a loser.</li>
            <li> I have used the Mach 3 razor for many years, but when I saw the Harry&#x27;s add, I decided to try the razor.</li>
            <li> Harry&#x27;s should considered designing a slimmer more maneuverable razor blade.</li>
            <li> I would have had better luck using a hunting knife.</li>
            <li> After taking out a ANOTHER chunk of skin on my chin a couple weeks ago, I realized that most of their blades are defective.  </li>
            <li> but I now bear way too many scars on my face from trying to like your product.  </li>
            <li> Great at marketing not so much at making razors.</li>
            <li> The first shave on the second blade was fair at best.  </li>
            <li> The first two blades were amazing and even though I wasn&#x27;t 100% thrilled with the lack of maneuverability of the blades</li>
            <li> They are very good blades but cost a little more than Harry&#x27;s and are not quite as good.    </li>
            <li> New, these do not deliver a great shave compared to the Fusion Power Pro.</li>
            <li> On a positive note, this is a good beginner set for teens.</li>
            <li> Do not misunderstand me, the feeling is pretty good, it runs quite smoothly</li>
            <li> Cut myself with these blades as I would with cheap disposals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was hoping for a better shave.</li>
            <li> Shaves close easily.</li>
            <li> I liked the handle and that was the only good part.</li>
            <li> Average at best.</li>
            <li> Hands down, this is the best.</li>
            <li> The overall experience was great with the razor that was attached.</li>
            <li> Try it, it works and it&#x27;s dirt cheap, unless you&#x27;re allergic to aspirin.  </li>
            <li> Quality handle which is easy to keep clean</li>
            <li> I will be happy to revise my review if this is not so or if I begin having a problem with subsequent blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li> , I just order 8 blades for $15, free shipping.</li>
            <li> The razor head conforms to the face, lips and chip and leaves a smooth face without nicks.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cheap but you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t see or fit otherwise</li>
            <li> good old Schick or Gillette.  </li>
            <li> The first shave was pretty good.  </li>
            <li> next day I installed a new Harry&#x27;s replacement blade and once again, -- a wonderful shave.</li>
            <li> next day I installed a new Harry&#x27;s replacement blade and once again, -- a wonderful shave.</li>
            <li> cause me to gouge myself significantly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with the power ProGlide for over a year and have never gotten one nick, which is the first blade I&#x27;ve ever been able to go against the grain on my neck without getting</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t buy any more blades because at 4 blades for $16 they are not a bargain.  </li>
            <li> Although the design is pretty good, in my opinion, it is also one of the main problem.</li>
            <li> Easier to clean cut hair from between blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great precision razors, which are worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li> The only good to come of the experiment  was the discovery of the saving cream of Taylor of Old Bond Street (sold here at Amazon) which is amazing and is a great bargain (it goes a long way) compared to the canned variety.  </li>
            <li> I was super excited when I got the package that included the razor and blades.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re anything but a Teenager, with not much of a beard, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
            <li> Really good German metal.</li>
            <li> Shop BJâ€™s or similar for Gillette quality at a good price.</li>
            <li> Also the blade doesn&#x27;t pivot which kind of surprised</li>
            <li> I signed up for the full package, shave balm, and auto reorder.</li>
            <li> There seems to be mixed feelings about the shaving cream, but I liked it just fine.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that there was even stubble on my cheeks, which even cheap blades usually do better (as oppsoed to my neck area).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Sorry Harry&#x27;s good idea, nice presentation but the blades sucks.</li>
            <li> Very pretty razors and snazzy graphics, but</li>
            <li> I have reduced this from my original two stars to one star because, when I switched back, I realized that the difference is amazing.</li>
            <li> I was still able to get a smooth shave, but there was definitely more drag.</li>
            <li> I was still able to get a smooth shave, but there was definitely more drag.</li>
            <li> I am still on my first blade that came with the $15.00 original razor/2 blade package deal.</li>
            <li> Dorco is far superior to this product&#x27;s out-of-the-box, brand-spankin&#x27; new blade.  </li>
            <li> But some of these negative reviews are so over the top, I can&#x27;t help, but question their motive in light of my own experience.</li>
            <li> But some of these negative reviews are so over the top, I can&#x27;t help, but question their motive in light of my own experience.</li>
            <li> I can imagine, since the comparable Gillette and Schick models have a superior tilt, that if you try to shave with the same pressure and angle using a Harry&#x27;s Razor, that you are way more likely to nick yourself or cause razor burn.</li>
            <li> I can imagine, since the comparable Gillette and Schick models have a superior tilt, that if you try to shave with the same pressure and angle using a Harry&#x27;s Razor, that you are way more likely to nick yourself or cause razor burn.</li>
            <li> I then started to shave my shin when the fun started.  </li>
            <li> I love it so far.</li>
            <li> The inconsistency of the blade quality simply isn&#x27;t worth it at any price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered the starter kit which is nicely packed and received it shortly afterwards.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely worth a try -  you like it or you don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Good product but be careful with twiggy and his 2 nutty friends.</li>
            <li> The blade is outstanding because it is so sharp and lasts through many shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Right away I threw out the shave cream.</li>
            <li> I find most of the negative reviews amusing.</li>
            <li> I got the Truman handle and initial box of 2 razors along with the original shave cream that was available at the time (since then they&#x27;ve launched a foaming gel which I haven&#x27;t tried).</li>
            <li> I used Cremo after the first shave but still got the tugging, bumps, etc.  </li>
            <li> I bought the starter pack with a coupon, direct from Harry&#x27;s, so got it for $10.00 and free shipping.  </li>
            <li> third wasnt much better</li>
            <li> These are great blades, long lasting, close shave.</li>
            <li> Direct from Harry&#x27;s is dirt cheap</li>
            <li> If you like something different than go with Harry&#x27;s top notch quality.</li>
            <li> Either skip it or have a first aid kit nearby.</li>
            <li> Part of the reason for this is that the total surface area of the Harry&#x27;s blade is greater than that of the Mach 3.</li>
            <li> Just went through my first blade that came with the razor handle.  </li>
            <li> It left a lot of stubble, and I went over my face/neck more than once.  </li>
            <li> I can change them frequently and the cost is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have tried many many products over the years from electic razors that cost hundreds of dollars to low to high-end regular disposable razors.</li>
            <li> This is significantly better vs the big names unless you buy specialty foam and conditioner</li>
            <li> I first gave Harry&#x27;s 1 star but the blade that came with the razor was defective.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the packaging for their blades but the razor itself felt much better with a properly manufactured blade.</li>
            <li> Good that they are not available.</li>
            <li> And it probably would do just fine for those fuzzy faces that don&#x27;t require the heavy lifting experience of a top brand blade.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like you have to remove most all the shaving cream with the first pass, even when very conservatively applied to the face, and the second pass starts to shave the stubble.</li>
            <li> If I am keeping it real, I think the Gillette Fusion Pro overall is still a better razor, but in my opinion from a price to performance ratio</li>
            <li> If I am keeping it real, I think the Gillette Fusion Pro overall is still a better razor, but in my opinion from a price to performance ratio</li>
            <li> The second and third were not so good</li>
            <li> Sorry, Harry&#x27;s, you may have good price, cute marketing &amp; a slick-looking product -</li>
            <li> This is still a slightly better blade and system than Harry&#x27;s but not by much and definitely not to justify purchasing it over Harry&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, upon ordering my first set of 4 replacement blades I found the quality to absolutely disappear.</li>
            <li> I guess you really do get what you pay for.ricier Gillette products and after the first shave the difference in quality</li>
            <li> I changed the blade and used a gel lubricant instead of their foam and got a very decent shave.</li>
            <li> As for the the Harry&#x27;s Razors they work just as well as the national brand at less than half the price--and the free handle works great as well.  </li>
            <li> Shaving under the nose (without the benefit of the single blade on the Fusion) does require more effort, but is doable.</li>
            <li> I moved on to the second one and it was fine.</li>
            <li> I am very please with this razor and blades .I</li>
            <li> I know this is turning into a cliche, but I really wanted this razor to work as well.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product.  </li>
            <li> Straight to the trash can.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this product</li>
            <li> I really, really wanted this to work.</li>
            <li> was absolutely staggering.</li>
            <li> was absolutely staggering.</li>
            <li> I guess you really do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> price is seductive; the quality leaves much to be desired.</li>
            <li> There is just too much surface area and the whole head rides up onto the foam.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to like this razor - I really did.</li>
            <li> Absolutely agree with others comments.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying that I really wanted to like this razor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now ready to use Harry&#x27;s Razor.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend the heavier handle as I do find the regular ones just too light weight.</li>
            <li> Do they give you the shave of a straight razor in the barber shop?</li>
            <li> really?</li>
            <li> It leaves my face much smoother.</li>
            <li> The razor is very lightweight.</li>
            <li> Now that I am in a position to believe the bad reviews (instead of being romanced by the amazing packaging and design - which are exceptional)</li>
            <li> In the end, it&#x27;s a surprisingly good product that does close to the same job for a lot less money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really tried to like these cute little razors.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to adopt a new razor</li>
            <li> All in all my Gillette refills while more expensive than Harry&#x27;s are much better than Harry&#x27;s replacement blades.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s way more expensive than $3-$5 products most buy.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get a decent shave.</li>
            <li> As much as I was loving the brand experience, the product just doesn&#x27;t &#x27;cut it&#x27;, and I mean that literally.</li>
            <li> The first blade I used from the new box felt like I was shaving with a 2 month old blade.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this razor to everyone.</li>
            <li> But really, order direct from Harry&#x27;s</li>
            <li> The coefficient of friction of the material of the Harry&#x27;s shave head is noticeably greater compared to the Mach 3 or Mach3 Turbo blade against bare wet skin.</li>
            <li> Old Guy (60), medium beard/shaved head, really like the razor.&lt;br /&gt;Blade lasts and performs well.</li>
            <li> normally shave with a Gillette Fusion.</li>
            <li> The shave was smooth the first few times, as is the Schick Hydro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> I was left with far more stubble than with my current razor.</li>
            <li> My Gillette razor rinses quickly, the Harry&#x27;s blades need to be held under the water much too long and even then they don&#x27;t always clear out.</li>
            <li> The bottom line is I can get a better shave for far less money using Bic disposables.</li>
            <li> The only improvement would be the addition of the top single blade for trimming sideburns, but at this price I can live without it.  </li>
            <li> I put a new blade on and started to shave by my ankle.  </li>
            <li> I live in Florida and go to work in dresses.  </li>
            <li> The bottom blade was bent, see picture and ripped me a new one before I noticed the blood.</li>
            <li> I purchased a new pack of Fusion Pro Power (which I was using pre-Harry).</li>
            <li> Left two huge gashes on the back of my head</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m in my thirties and have been in professions since 19 years old that require employees to be clean shaven every single day.</li>
            <li> money is no option, in my opinion, the Gillette Fusion feature-wise continues to be the overall better razor, but if you are on a budget and would prefer to spend your money on things other than razor blades, Harry&#x27;s razor provides a quality shave for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> This week I went back to the pricier Gillette products and after the first shave the difference in quality</li>
            <li> Left my skin feeling pretty torn</li>
            <li> The first time I sliced my face open with these razors I thought &amp;#34;oh</li>
            <li> The handle is heavy and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> First time was just okay, not great though.</li>
            <li> I have no problem reversing a positive review should it become necessary.</li>
            <li> I have no problem reversing a positive review should it become necessary.</li>
            <li> Went back to my disposable Schicks which I would judge to be 10 times better with less blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I emailed pics of the entire situation including the large strip of skin and asked them to call me immediately.  </li>
            <li> You get what you pay for: dull blades that needs to be replaced more often.</li>
            <li> Until Harry&#x27;s can get a handle on the quality and safety of their blades and cartridges, I would steer clear of Harry&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I have slightly sensitive skin and my neck looked like a war zone when I got out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> My three-week old three-blade</li>
            <li> Now that I know I will buy direct for Harry.</li>
            <li> Not going to send it back, gpoing to bust the whole kit up with a hammer and hope no one is injured in the process.</li>
            <li> I bought my razor kit directly from Harry&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Not for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My point being, I&#x27;ve been around the block as far as shaving products go.</li>
            <li> The German engineering has some real problems when it comes to making razor blades.  </li>
            <li> I am 29 years old and Iv&#x27;e shaving since i was 16.</li>
            <li> these razor ate my head alive.</li>
            <li> Finally and the main reason I went back to my old razor was these blades nicked me much easier.  </li>
            <li> The look of the head is very different than other brands and does look cheap</li>
            <li> noticed that if you bring the blade down relatively quickly on your skin, the blades will tend to cut you.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> I always try to support the little guy especially when he charges less for a superior product.</li>
            <li> (I have a beard and only shave every other day) compared to a full month with my Schick Hydro that I&#x27;ve used for years.  </li>
            <li> These blades will not make you think of other fine German brands such as Bosch, BMW and Mercedes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really tried to make these things work, but I have had more razor rash and cuts in the past 2 weeks than in the previous 5 years combined.</li>
            <li> I sneezed while using them on lefty--the one that hangs low and nearly cut it off!</li>
            <li> That said, should I, too, come across a bad batch of Harry&#x27;s Replacement Blades, I&#x27;ll be happy to update once again.</li>
            <li> That said, should I, too, come across a bad batch of Harry&#x27;s Replacement Blades, I&#x27;ll be happy to update once again.</li>
            <li> First of all I am absolutely dumbfounded by the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s the same old bait and switch that all of the razor companies use.</li>
            <li> I am 83 years old and have used a lot of different types of razors.</li>
            <li> A broken piece of glass would have offered a better shave.  </li>
            <li> Maybe Harry has had quality control problems in the past or maybe I have been just lucky but</li>
            <li> If you are used to GIllete or major brand razors, you will notice a very obvious difference.</li>
            <li> Actually I have a suspicion, but how could one prove that is was posted by an employee of a major manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> , it flexes very well and the angle at which you shave it different than the other brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried a large number of shaving techniques and foams and conditioners that are suppose to give a closer shave with less resistence.</li>
            <li> Far less drag and a far closer shave than Harry can deliver.</li>
            <li> On the following day, I then shaved with a 30 day old Gillette Fusion blade on one half of my face and with the old Harry&#x27;s blade on the other.</li>
            <li> On the following day, I then shaved with a 30 day old Gillette Fusion blade on one half of my face and with the old Harry&#x27;s blade on the other.</li>
            <li> You can get the same replacement blades direct from the manufacturer for much less money.</li>
            <li> This whole &#x27;Harry&#x27;s&#x27; phenomenon is a scam based on slick marketing.</li>
            <li> The actual shave was rough and left my skin red, sore, and bleeding.</li>
            <li> First shaves were noticeably worse that my old Gillette and took twice as long since the blade doesn&#x27;t pivot or vibrate.</li>
            <li> I read a few of the one star reviews and am legitimately surprised to the point that I feel we must be using a different product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget the single blade on the Gillette is historically one of their newer features.</li>
            <li> The plastic edges around the sides of the blades are too high, making it difficult to shave certain areas, like below the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also took a long time to rinse the shave cream off the blade.  </li>
            <li> It took that long to control the bleeding.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Aside from the fact that the blades are not as sharp and do not last as long</li>
            <li> The initial blade sent with the razor was sharp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only reviewing here because I haven&#x27;t found any other locations to review this product.</li>
            <li> This was the case when I went back to my other shaving creams as well.  </li>
            <li> and they made us dry shave for a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> Single edge blade for under nose and side burns</li>
            <li> again not worth the hassle of constant online ordering and shipping.</li>
            <li> Probably more so because I really wanted it to finally replace the outrageous prices I&#x27;ve been dealing with for years.</li>
            <li> I use the term \\&quot;lather\\&quot; loosely, because their shaving cream just doesn&#x27;t cut it (no pun intended).  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want to risk breaking her fragile black heart.</li>
            <li> I have tried for years to find a safety razor that provided a close shave without all the nicks and cuts and have spent a fortune on Nick Stick.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Further, the handle is round.</li>
            <li> Hard to say if the blades last as long as fusion blades</li>
            <li> The second and third shaves were not good.  </li>
            <li> I too wanted to replace the expensive Gillette razors with a new indie type company.</li>
            <li> And of course, when buying the blades, there is also the invitation to purchase Harry&#x27;s other shaving products.  </li>
            <li> I usually use the same blade for 1 month</li>
            <li> I agree with other one star reviewers.  </li>
            <li> will be sending them my bill for Advil neosporin and other items I need to dress these wounds.  </li>
            <li> The Harry&#x27;s shave head pivots primarily due to the elasticity of the plastic</li>
            <li> I shave every other day and change the blades once a week.</li>
            <li> I think that is a sign of the blade not being sharp.  </li>
            <li> The blades were sharp but didn&#x27;t conform to my face.</li>
            <li> i got my razors in the mail the other day</li>
            <li> I was a fan of a major brand five blade model, but the price became ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> The blade pulled on my skin and I was careful to follow the grain - yes, I read the little pamphlet enclosed in the box.  </li>
            <li> And, between uses, it&#x27;s almost impossible to clean the debris out of the blade groves.  </li>
            <li> The closeness of the shave is at least equal to the Gillette Fusion</li>
            <li> for all these negative reviews, I simply am dumb-founded to explain.  </li>
            <li> for all these negative reviews, I simply am dumb-founded to explain.  </li>
            <li> the shave is not worth the effort and cost.</li>
            <li> After healing my face and replacing the cartridge with a new one, I found that the Harry&#x27;s blades tugged at my beard and the shave was rough and uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> use the Harry&#x27;s cream and have to shave it off for a couple strokes before the blades get down to the skin.  </li>
            <li> The price for 16 blades is somewhere around 60% less than Gillette&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> Figuring it was simply a random bogus blade (which happens with the more expensive Gillette blades too)</li>
            <li> I must admit that while the finished shave with the Gillette was no better, there was definitely less drag.</li>
            <li> I must admit that while the finished shave with the Gillette was no better, there was definitely less drag.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the shave/blade is not good for a thick beard, with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> to help the little guys</li>
            <li> but they are a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> damn, I need to refine my technique a little with these&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m writing this hour after cutting myself, really lacerating myself with one of their razors.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t cut well and ended up with a few nicks.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the Schick Quatro 4 blades for quite a few years.  </li>
            <li> that I thought they must be planted by Gillette, but I agree- harsh, not close at all, pulled at my beard.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Even though I&#x27;m 64 years old, maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong.  </li>
            <li> Then I tried the old safety razor route to save money, sad to say that decision required quite a bit of styptic pencil.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m certainly not questioning the veracity of all the negative reviews, but for some their hyperbole does give room for pause.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m certainly not questioning the veracity of all the negative reviews, but for some their hyperbole does give room for pause.</li>
            <li> Harry&#x27;s Razor handle is hard to use vs any other razor I&#x27;ve every used and</li>
            <li> It is not easy to gauge size on a laptop or iPad.  </li>
            <li> As mentioned in other reviews they have trouble cutting through the shaving cream, it takes several passes.</li>
            <li> The other big negative is that rinsing the clogged blades is difficult.</li>
            <li> I shave in the shower, have done so for years, and the round handle makes it hard to tell which way the blade is facing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure, but it works.  </li>
            <li> The handle and razor are so big that it makes is too difficult to pay attention to details.</li>
            <li> Not sure how others give anything but one star.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve got two small sores on the tops of my cheek bones that were caused by these blades.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had lots of expectations but it was the worst razor ever used, I had to re shave using my Gillet Fusion, the advertisement  is greater than the shaver</li>
            <li> The Mach 3 Turbo also has a slick polymer strip on the bottom of the blade that the Harry&#x27;s blade lacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;That is $1.64 per cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;Harry&#x27;s has slick and relentless ads hounding me too.</li>
            <li> The marketing is so slick, the packaging unmatched - as one men&#x27;s magazine reviewer noted, &#x27;it&#x27;s the iPhone of razors&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Wanted to like these blades tried them, was not impressed and then managed to cut the hell out of my face something I have not done since being a teen.</li>
            <li> they are not safe at all to use.</li>
            <li> Also the negative reviews about the foam are very odd to me.</li>
            <li> The broadness of the Harry&#x27;s shave head makes getting into tight places like the upper lip, under the nose very difficult.</li>
            <li> The blades were dull.</li>
            <li> Just like any blde you may get some nicks and cuts as they dull or if you use them improperly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What makes my situation bad is that I have extremely sensitive skin on my neck and continually suffer from ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I complained to them (Harry&#x27;s) they said my money would be refunded.</li>
            <li> But if you use them to shave those secret private parts, be wary.</li>
            <li> Granted, I don&#x27;t have a thick beard, but I just finished m6th shave.</li>
            <li> Some of them are so negative that they border on the ridiculous and cause me to question</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure where the poor reviews of this product are coming from.  </li>
            <li> I second the reviewers comment that Harry&#x27;s razors are poorly made and even dangerous</li>
            <li> No good.</li>
            <li> Blades just are not good.</li>
            <li> In my humble opinion you can&#x27;t go wrong with these razors--and I haven&#x27;t been paid for this review.</li>
            <li> was worst then the first ,after a month of use</li>
            <li> mileage may vary, but if you are on a budget, please ignore these over-the-top negative reviews and give Harry&#x27;s a try.</li>
            <li> and I got a poor shave.</li>
            <li> But alas, it&#x27;s one to (by)pass.</li>
            <li> While I hate the price of big brand razor blades, these just don&#x27;t make the cut.</li>
            <li> it was the absolute WORST shaving experience of my life!!</li>
            <li> So, I do NOT recommend this product if you have a beard, it does not make sense because it is very complicated to make it work &amp;#34;in small distances.&amp;#34; I felt like driving a 3 tons truck inside of a mall!</li>
            <li> This equipment is almost useless if the stubble is longer.  </li>
            <li> I tried three different blades and they were all terrible.  </li>
            <li> Sorry Harry&#x27;s</li>
            <li> there lousy product</li>
            <li> There is something really wrong here.</li>
            <li> wanted to like them because pro fusion glides are so expensive.</li>
            <li> to the expensive Gillete blades for me.</li>
            <li> sorry Harry</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> and Harry&#x27;s flunked, sadly.    </li>
            <li> Moreover, you get about 60% fewer shaves per blade which makes these things rather expensive.</li>
            <li> What was not impressive was the shave.  </li>
            <li> I would rate the Harry&#x27;s blades very poor and even dangerous.</li>
            <li> I see that this is a dangerous product.</li>
            <li> now that I&#x27;ve been to their site and bought, I am blasted with their product on almost every web page I visit.</li>
            <li> what a disappointment after seeing all the ads.</li>
            <li> Dangerous.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s haw bad</li>
            <li> Not as bad though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Blades gone bad after one shave?</li>
            <li> reviews were so bad here,</li>
            <li> A bad product...</li>
            <li> the blades are just that bad.</li>
            <li> i am not happy and once i find every customer communication out to post on i will be canceling this frankly horrible product!!!</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed.</li>
            <li> To me it was horrible and useless.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed.  </li>
            <li> These blades were very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry Gillette!!!</li>
            <li> I quite literally had the worst razor bumps that I&#x27;ve EVER had.  </li>
            <li> Awful quality!</li>
            <li> Now for the worst part.</li>
            <li> I wanted it to work, but the blade was probably the worst blade I ever shaved with.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great marketing and handle design. But the blades are vastly inferior to Gillette Fusion ProGlide. The actual shave was rough and left my skin red, sore, and bleeding.</li>
            <li> The initial blade sent with the razor was sharp. The overall experience was great with the razor that was attached. There seems to be mixed feelings about the shaving cream, but I liked it just fine. The replacement razors, however are quite a different story. After I finished shaving I felt like I needed to shave again. Had the replacement razor been as good as the original razor I would be a fan. But it&#x27;s the same old bait and switch that all of the razor companies use. The one on the razor you buy gets you hooked and all of the replacements are lower quality. All in all my Gillette refills while more expensive than Harry&#x27;s are much better than Harry&#x27;s replacement blades. I guess you just get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like these razors.  Their packaging and marketing are unbelievably good.  The colors are reminiscent of Harrods and the reference to German quality invites us in.  The truth is somewhat different.  The blades are not quality and if you want to have a shave that even compares to a Gillette razor, you have to lather twice. I use the term \\&quot;lather\\&quot; loosely, because their shaving cream just doesn&#x27;t cut it (no pun intended).  The only cut that you will get will be from the blade itself.  That&#x27;s haw bad it is.  The marketing is the Sirens&#x27; song - Don&#x27;t buy it.  Wouldn&#x27;t mind employing their marketing team!  Although they should have called it \\&quot;Nick&#x27;s\\&quot; rather than \\&quot;Harry&#x27;s\\&quot;  :-)    And of course, when buying the blades, there is also the invitation to purchase Harry&#x27;s other shaving products.  This is where purchasing on the internet leaves the unwary at a disadvantage.  It is not easy to gauge size on a laptop or iPad.  Harry&#x27;s shaving cream is 4 oz and sells for $8, Gillette&#x27;s is 7 oz and sells for $3.99.  Harry&#x27;s 1.7 oz aftershave balm sells for $10.   Gillette&#x27;s is 2.5 oz and sells for $2.12.  Appearances can be deceptive.  Check the sizes.  All is not as it appears and the Gillette products are superior.</li>
            <li> I am very please with this razor and blades .I highly recommend this razor to everyone.</li>
            <li> Looks great......but that&#x27;s it......I have a beard and only shave sections when necessary.  This equipment is almost useless if the stubble is longer.  And, between uses, it&#x27;s almost impossible to clean the debris out of the blade groves.  You&#x27;re better off with a BIC......</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for: dull blades that needs to be replaced more often. Manufacturing is also extremely low quality (the plastic arms that flex and hold the blades have snapped in numerous occasions). If you&#x27;re stuck with an Harry razor like I am you&#x27;ll probably want to consider switching to a more reputable brand once you run (or snap) out of blades.</li>
            <li> I know this is turning into a cliche, but I really wanted this razor to work as well.  Presentation was awesome.  Styling was awesome.  The razor sucked.  It wasn&#x27;t just one blade.  I tried three different blades and they were all terrible.  This razor tugged when shaving with the grain!  I pushed ahead and continued to shave.  I always do three passes - with, across and against.  All three were like pulling teeth (or hairs...lol).  Didn&#x27;t cut well and ended up with a few nicks.  I have slightly sensitive skin and my neck looked like a war zone when I got out of the shower.  I quite literally had the worst razor bumps that I&#x27;ve EVER had.  Note that this was using Harry&#x27;s shaving cream.  I used Cremo after the first shave but still got the tugging, bumps, etc.  Not as bad though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went back to my Schick Hydro 3, which, in my opinion is the best razor out there - for me that is.  Maybe it&#x27;s the skinguard?  Maybe it&#x27;s the 3 blades instead of 5?  I&#x27;m not sure, but it works.  No tugging and good clean shaves consistently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SIDE NOTE - READ THIS!!! - For some of you guys who get ingrowns, razor bumps, sensitivity, etc....dissolve 3ea 325mg aspirin in 30mL of warm water.  Apply it to a cotton ball and swab it on your face (with the grain) after you shave and at night.  It worked wonders for me.  It reduced my overall &amp;#34;irritation&amp;#34; by 90-95%.  One bottle lasts me weeks.  My face also seems smoother.  Aspirin is acetylsalicylic acid.  Salicylic acid is what is in a lot of topical acne meds.  Aspirin is an anti-inflammatory.  What else is shaving irritation but an inflammation?  Try it, it works and it&#x27;s dirt cheap, unless you&#x27;re allergic to aspirin.  If that&#x27;s the case, don&#x27;t try it!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s all i can say... I bought these blades expecting a great shave... Do not misunderstand me, the feeling is pretty good, it runs quite smoothly but, there is one problem. Although the design is pretty good, in my opinion, it is also one of the main problem. The handle and razor are so big that it makes is too difficult to pay attention to details. So, I do NOT recommend this product if you have a beard, it does not make sense because it is very complicated to make it work &amp;#34;in small distances.&amp;#34; I felt like driving a 3 tons truck inside of a mall!</li>
            <li> These blades were very disappointing. As mentioned in other reviews they have trouble cutting through the shaving cream, it takes several passes. The other big negative is that rinsing the clogged blades is difficult. My Gillette razor rinses quickly, the Harry&#x27;s blades need to be held under the water much too long and even then they don&#x27;t always clear out. I guess it&#x27;s back to my ProFusion.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product.  I bought the starter pack with a coupon, direct from Harry&#x27;s, so got it for $10.00 and free shipping.  What a blood fest!  A broken piece of glass would have offered a better shave.  The blade pulled on my skin and I was careful to follow the grain - yes, I read the little pamphlet enclosed in the box.  I could feel the blades digging into my skin.  My three-week old three-blade Dorco is far superior to this product&#x27;s out-of-the-box, brand-spankin&#x27; new blade.  Sorry Harry&#x27;s but I can&#x27;t honestly recommend your product.</li>
            <li> I am still on my first blade that came with the $15.00 original razor/2 blade package deal. Granted, I don&#x27;t have a thick beard, but I just finished m6th shave. (My last one on that blade, although I would try for 7 if I was out of blades ). Confident that this razor and blades will work for me, I have placed a $20 order for additional blades. The razor, the blades, the service, it all works for me.&lt;br /&gt;;</li>
            <li> First time was just okay, not great though. Second time, I started bleeding from nicks all over. Blades gone bad after one shave? You gotta be kidding. Not sure how others give anything but one star. Straight to the trash can. I liked the handle and that was the only good part.</li>
            <li> First of all I am absolutely dumbfounded by the negative reviews. Some of them are so negative that they border on the ridiculous and cause me to question their motive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally shave with a Gillette Fusion. I recently started using Harry&#x27;s Truman razor; so here is what I consider a balanced assessment:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette Fusion Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Much better blade tilt.&lt;br /&gt;2. Single edge blade for under nose and side burns&lt;br /&gt;3. Easier to clean cut hair from between blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harry&#x27;s Truman Razor Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Quality handle which is easy to keep clean&lt;br /&gt;2. The price for 16 blades is somewhere around 60% less than Gillette&lt;br /&gt;3. The closeness of the shave is at least equal to the Gillette Fusion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The angle of the shave is different than the Gillette and therefore requires an adjustment in your technique. I cannot speak to shaving of the head. Shaving under the nose (without the benefit of the single blade on the Fusion) does require more effort, but is doable. Don&#x27;t forget the single blade on the Gillette is historically one of their newer features. We used to always shave without it; so it can be done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If money is no option, in my opinion, the Gillette Fusion feature-wise continues to be the overall better razor, but if you are on a budget and would prefer to spend your money on things other than razor blades, Harry&#x27;s razor provides a quality shave for a fraction of the price. After 18 days on the same blade I am still getting the same shave I got with my Gillette for the same period of time. I usually use the same blade for 1 month and I expect to get the same performance on Harry&#x27;s razor. I will be happy to revise my review if this is not so or if I begin having a problem with subsequent blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your mileage may vary, but if you are on a budget, please ignore these over-the-top negative reviews and give Harry&#x27;s a try. The Starter Kit is so inexpensive, why wouldn&#x27;t you? The people at Harry&#x27;s are great to work with and I will likely continue to purchase blades from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 3-27-2015&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 31 days of shaving with the same blade, I still have not cut myself. I was still able to get a smooth shave, but there was definitely more drag. On the following day, I then shaved with a 30 day old Gillette Fusion blade on one half of my face and with the old Harry&#x27;s blade on the other. I must admit that while the finished shave with the Gillette was no better, there was definitely less drag. As a result the shaving experience was more pleasant with the Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day I installed a new Harry&#x27;s replacement blade and once again, -- a wonderful shave. If I am keeping it real, I think the Gillette Fusion Pro overall is still a better razor, but in my opinion from a price to performance ratio the Harry&#x27;s Razor is still a winner and one I plan on continuing to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for all these negative reviews, I simply am dumb-founded to explain.  I can imagine, since the comparable Gillette and Schick models have a superior tilt, that if you try to shave with the same pressure and angle using a Harry&#x27;s Razor, that you are way more likely to nick yourself or cause razor burn. But some of these negative reviews are so over the top, I can&#x27;t help, but question their motive in light of my own experience. I&#x27;m certainly not questioning the veracity of all the negative reviews, but for some their hyperbole does give room for pause. That said, should I, too, come across a bad batch of Harry&#x27;s Replacement Blades, I&#x27;ll be happy to update once again. I have no problem reversing a positive review should it become necessary. Until then, I&#x27;m a Harry&#x27;s fan.work with and I will likely continue to purchase blades from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 3-27-2015&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 31 days of shaving with the same blade, I still have not cut myself.

            <li> I would rate the Harry&#x27;s blades very poor and even dangerous. I had a blade within the cartridge become bent while I was shaving with it cause me to gouge myself significantly.  I returned the damaged blade to Harry&#x27;s and they are sending it on to their German engineering team.  After healing my face and replacing the cartridge with a new one, I found that the Harry&#x27;s blades tugged at my beard and the shave was rough and uncomfortable.  Until Harry&#x27;s can get a handle on the quality and safety of their blades and cartridges, I would steer clear of Harry&#x27;s.  Try Dorco and see if you can experience some improvement in your shaving experience.</li>
            <li> I agree with other one star reviewers.  Nice story line.&lt;br /&gt;Want to help the little guys but I&#x27;m throwing mine out.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been shaving for 40 years so technique is not the problem.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got two small sores on the tops of my cheek bones that were caused by these blades.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that if you bring the blade down relatively quickly on your skin, the blades will tend to cut you.&lt;br /&gt;Not cool.&lt;br /&gt;I bought these off their website.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty handle and nice boxes are going in the trash.</li>
            <li> Not a close shave! Family dollar cheapies do a better job. I was really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I got the &amp;#34;Winston&amp;#34; as a gift from my wife. It was personalized with my initials! Ive used this razor 5 times. Each time I report to the Red Cross for a liter of blood. I believe I had a better shave when I was in bootcamp and they made us dry shave for a couple weeks. Save yourselves,  I have to continue using this razor because I can count on one hand how many gifts my wife has given me and I don&#x27;t want to risk breaking her fragile black heart. Do yourselves a favor and avoid Harry&#x27;s. If anything changes in the quality as I trudge on, I&#x27;ll update this review. Two stars because it looks nicer than a Bic.</li>
            <li> I put a new blade on and started to shave by my ankle.  I immediately felt like I had nicked myself started to stinging and bleeding.  I then started to shave my shin when the fun started.  It shaved off 5&amp;#34; of my skin in one lovely piece!!  I threw up in the shower shortly after seeing my skin hanging from the razor.  I immediately got out in massive pain and tears.  I re examined my ankle and it had taken strips of skin from that too but it was a series of cuts.&lt;br /&gt;  I emailed pics of the entire situation including the large strip of skin and asked them to call me immediately.  No one called so within 8 hours I posted to their Twitter page and then got an immediate response and phone call.  I was asked to send the blade back for inspection and was asked to describe my shaving technique!!! I have been doing this daily for 30 years!!! I can&#x27;t remember the last time I even got nicked by a blade.&lt;br /&gt;I will be sending them my bill for Advil neosporin and other items I need to dress these wounds.  I live in Florida and go to work in dresses.  I attend functions and I am going to have to explain over and over again what happened?  I ran out the the store yesterday and had 3 people ask what happened.  I&#x27;m still so friggen upset by this.  I&#x27;m sorry Gillette!!! This was my husbands doing not mine!</li>
            <li> here is  my story&lt;br /&gt;first razor was awesome&lt;br /&gt;second was worst then the first ,after a month of use&lt;br /&gt;the third wasnt much better then the second&lt;br /&gt;Company is great at getting every Podcast to&lt;br /&gt;schill there lousy product&lt;br /&gt;I threw razor and blades out ...</li>
            <li> Great packaging and marketing.  I bought the Truman, their shaving cream, and some razors. I liked the shaving cream. I could not get as close a shave with the blades as I did with my prior national brand razor.  It also took a long time to rinse the shave cream off the blade.  Finally and the main reason I went back to my old razor was these blades nicked me much easier.  I really wanted to like this product but it is not for me.</li>
            <li> Stick with what you know and used before...good old Schick or Gillette.  You get what you pay for with Harry&#x27;s razors.</li>
            <li> Bought these razor&#x27;s hoping they would be close to the quality of my Gillette Fusion ProGlide but a third of the price.  I&#x27;ve been shaving with the power ProGlide for over a year and have never gotten one nick, which is the first blade I&#x27;ve ever been able to go against the grain on my neck without getting cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Harry&#x27;s Razor handle is hard to use vs any other razor I&#x27;ve every used and the shave is about has good as disposable razors.  Cut myself with these blades as I would with cheap disposals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was hoping for a better shave.</li>
            <li> These are great blades, long lasting, close shave. But really, order direct from Harry&#x27;s, I just order 8 blades for $15, free shipping.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price!  My husband really likes this product so when I find it on sale on Amazon it makes it even better.</li>
            <li> I had lots of expectations but it was the worst razor ever used, I had to re shave using my Gillet Fusion, the advertisement  is greater than the shaver</li>
            <li> This is a rip off.. go on ebay and you can get these for $6 PLUS, including the postage!!!  Good Luck!</li>
            <li> I have tried for years to find a safety razor that provided a close shave without all the nicks and cuts and have spent a fortune on Nick Stick.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Harry&#x27;s truman razor with replacement heads. The razor head conforms to the face, lips and chip and leaves a smooth face without nicks. I love it so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only reviewing here because I haven&#x27;t found any other locations to review this product. I&#x27;ll start by saying there is no point in buying these on Amazon. Direct from Harry&#x27;s is dirt cheap and that&#x27;s the only place I purchased the stuff I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to actually review. I really, really wanted this to work. Like many I&#x27;m fed up with paying absurd prices for the mainstream Gillette products and have been searching for years for another quality option. In came Harry&#x27;s and their superb marketing scheme. I bought into it hook, line, and sinker. Probably more so because I really wanted it to finally replace the outrageous prices I&#x27;ve been dealing with for years. I was super excited when I got the package that included the razor and blades. I got the Truman handle and initial box of 2 razors along with the original shave cream that was available at the time (since then they&#x27;ve launched a foaming gel which I haven&#x27;t tried). Right away I threw out the shave cream. To me it was horrible and useless. It literally felt like I hadn&#x27;t used anything. The first two blades were amazing and even though I wasn&#x27;t 100% thrilled with the lack of maneuverability of the blades I was convinced I had finally found a company to replace Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, upon ordering my first set of 4 replacement blades I found the quality to absolutely disappear. The first blade I used from the new box felt like I was shaving with a 2 month old blade. My face was on fire and I got a poor shave. Figuring it was simply a random bogus blade (which happens with the more expensive Gillette blades too) I moved on to the second one and it was fine. However, the third was also garbage, as was the 4th. I tried with two more replacement boxes (clinging to hope I was just unlucky) and the same unfortunate results were found. The inconsistency of the blade quality simply isn&#x27;t worth it at any price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly Harry&#x27;s isn&#x27;t the replacement company I hoped for. This week I went back to the pricier Gillette products and after the first shave the difference in quality was absolutely staggering. I guess you really do get what you pay for.ricier Gillette products and after the first shave the difference in quality was absolutely staggering. I guess you really do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Smoothest shave ever!!!!!!&#x27;</li>
            <li> Now that I know I will buy direct for Harry. The blades and razor are great. Really good German metal.</li>
            <li> Best razor I have ever used. The blade is outstanding because it is so sharp and lasts through many shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Channing Arnold</li>
            <li> No good. They&#x27;re cheap but you get what you pay for, I got one or two good shaves with these blades before they crapped out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is seductive; the quality leaves much to be desired.</li>
            <li> Hard to say if the blades last as long as fusion blades but they are a little cheaper. $1.86 a piece</li>
            <li> Great precision razors, which are worth the extra money.  If you like something different than go with Harry&#x27;s top notch quality. TD</li>
            <li> I second the reviewers comment that Harry&#x27;s razors are poorly made and even dangerous, I&#x27;m writing this hour after cutting myself, really lacerating myself with one of their razors. It took that long to control the bleeding. Not going to send it back, gpoing to bust the whole kit up with a hammer and hope no one is injured in the process.</li>
            <li> Blades pulled quite a bit just trying to trim the edges of my beard.  I had to shave over the same areas several times and there are still hairs that were missed.  Left my skin feeling pretty torn up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d have given one star but the return process was the most effortless experience I&#x27;ve ever had, so they&#x27;ve got that going for them.</li>
            <li> The first time I sliced my face open with these razors I thought &amp;#34;oh damn, I need to refine my technique a little with these&amp;#34;. The second time it happened I though, wait a minute...&amp;#34; The third time? There is something really wrong here. Two cuts shaving my head and once on my side-burn. Deep cuts. Skin flaps. Gnarly. Now that I am in a position to believe the bad reviews (instead of being romanced by the amazing packaging and design - which are exceptional) I see that this is a dangerous product. Either skip it or have a first aid kit nearby.</li>
            <li> Wow, what a bust and I had great hopes all along!  I&#x27;m one of those guys who has to shave every day, and again if I&#x27;m going out in the evening and want to look my smoothest.  The bottom line is I can get a better shave for far less money using Bic disposables. And I&#x27;m saying that after wanting to really...really...like the razor after having gotten one for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;I use the Harry&#x27;s cream and have to shave it off for a couple strokes before the blades get down to the skin.  This was the case when I went back to my other shaving creams as well.  There is just too much surface area and the whole head rides up onto the foam.  Another aspect of all is that I still must reach for my cheaper razor  to get around my nose and mouth.  I just can&#x27;t see or fit otherwise, the shaver head is too big.&lt;br /&gt;And here&#x27;s the most damning thing of all:  In a touch test my wife liked the cheap razor shaved side better than the Harry&#x27;s side and that was after I used 2-3 times as many strokes to shave the Harry&#x27;s side.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a loser.</li>
            <li> I bought my razor kit directly from Harry&#x27;s.  At first I didn&#x27;t buy any more blades because at 4 blades for $16 they are not a bargain.  But they have now dropped the price to about $2 a blade which is a good buy.    I have been using the Schick Quatro 4 blades for quite a few years.  They are very good blades but cost a little more than Harry&#x27;s and are not quite as good.    Maybe Harry has had quality control problems in the past or maybe I have been just lucky but no question about it these are the best razor blades I have ever used.    I always try to support the little guy especially when he charges less for a superior product.</li>
            <li> I have used the Mach 3 razor for many years, but when I saw the Harry&#x27;s add, I decided to try the razor. After using the razor for a couple of shaves these are my observations:&lt;br /&gt;1. The Harry&#x27;s shave head pivots primarily due to the elasticity of the plastic shave head material. However it does take some pressure to bend the shave head to the desired angle. The design of the Mach 3 utilizes a pivot point that requires no effort to change the angle of the shave head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The broadness of the Harry&#x27;s shave head makes getting into tight places like the upper lip, under the nose very difficult. I found myself reaching for my Mach 3 to get to those places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The coefficient of friction of the material of the Harry&#x27;s shave head is noticeably greater compared to the Mach 3 or Mach3 Turbo blade against bare wet skin. Part of the reason for this is that the total surface area of the Harry&#x27;s blade is greater than that of the Mach 3. The Mach 3 Turbo also has a slick polymer strip on the bottom of the blade that the Harry&#x27;s blade lacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The Harry&#x27;s shave gel performs well, but does not quite provide the same performance of Edge Gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. I do like the lower cost of the blades. I purchased the Winston Set and 16 extra blades. After I finish using the 16 blades I will update this review.&lt;br /&gt;6. Harry&#x27;s should considered designing a slimmer more maneuverable razor blade.</li>
            <li> Do not shave your head with these blades and if you can help it try not to shave your face either.  Left two huge gashes on the back of my head and I have been shaving my head for over 6 years.  I would have had better luck using a hunting knife.</li>
            <li> BJâ€™s Wholesale bjs.com&lt;br /&gt;24 Gillette Fusion Cartridges $45.99&lt;br /&gt;That is $1.64 per cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;Harry&#x27;s has slick and relentless ads hounding me too. Shop BJâ€™s or similar for Gillette quality at a good price.</li>
            <li> A veery affordable and incredibly built razor. I get the best shave yet. I shave every other day and change the blades once a week. Perfect setup!</li>
            <li> Good that they are not available. I bought an intro package on Harry&#x27;s website. I took one shave, and that was one too many.&lt;br /&gt;The reviews were so bad here, that I thought they must be planted by Gillette, but I agree- harsh, not close at all, pulled at my beard.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to like them because pro fusion glides are so expensive. But, I will stick with Gillette.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this razor - I really did. The marketing is so slick, the packaging unmatched - as one men&#x27;s magazine reviewer noted, &#x27;it&#x27;s the iPhone of razors&#x27;. As much as I was loving the brand experience, the product just doesn&#x27;t &#x27;cut it&#x27;, and I mean that literally. The blade just doesn&#x27;t cut through their own shave cream to the bottom of the stubble on the face (or anyone else&#x27;s shave cream for that matter). It&#x27;s like you have to remove most all the shaving cream with the first pass, even when very conservatively applied to the face, and the second pass starts to shave the stubble. Except then it takes a third pass and a fourth... well, you get the idea. I&#x27;d love for these inexpensive blades to be the holy grail of shaving so that I could bypass all those outrageously expensive name brand blades. But alas, it&#x27;s one to (by)pass. On a positive note, this is a good beginner set for teens. It comes with instructions on how to shave. It provides an out of box purchase experience (as in &#x27;thinking outside the box&#x27;). And it probably would do just fine for those fuzzy faces that don&#x27;t require the heavy lifting experience of a top brand blade. Now if only Harry&#x27;s could provide a step up to a premium blade to match the premium marketing....</li>
            <li> Great presentation, nice heft to razor handle, BUT..rough shave. Not for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Just went through my first blade that came with the razor handle.  It only lasted 3 weeks (I have a beard and only shave every other day) compared to a full month with my Schick Hydro that I&#x27;ve used for years.  I suppose if I bought the max quantity of Harry&#x27;s blades and changed them ore often it would be about a wash on the cost.  The shave was smooth the first few times, as is the Schick Hydro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great marketing story and now that I&#x27;ve been to their site and bought, I am blasted with their product on almost every web page I visit.</li>
            <li> I guess I bought their slick marketing (&amp;#34;the blades are made in Germany&amp;#34;).  These blades will not make you think of other fine German brands such as Bosch, BMW and Mercedes.  I would be giving them a complement if I said they were of Yugo quality.  While I hate the price of big brand razor blades, these just don&#x27;t make the cut.</li>
            <li> Absolutely agree with others comments.  Wanted to like this product, and the price is good, presentation/packaging is very nice.  Handle is nice, shaving gel was good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the shave/blade is not good for a thick beard, with sensitive skin.  It left a lot of stubble, and I went over my face/neck more than once.  I was surprised that there was even stubble on my cheeks, which even cheap blades usually do better (as oppsoed to my neck area).  Also the blade doesn&#x27;t pivot which kind of surprised me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the expensive Gillete blades for me.</li>
            <li> You can get the same replacement blades direct from the manufacturer for much less money. Don&#x27;t let these guys rip you off.</li>
            <li> Very pretty razors and snazzy graphics, but the shave is not worth the effort and cost. I am about the shave and not the &amp;#34;cute&amp;#34; factor of my razor. I want to move from my disposables, but this is NOT it. The shave cream is just shave cream...again not worth the hassle of constant online ordering and shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying that I really wanted to like this razor.  I ordered the starter kit which is nicely packed and received it shortly afterwards.  I read about the proper way to shave.  Even though I&#x27;m 64 years old, maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong.  So, I read the proper way to shave.  I watch videos.  I&#x27;m now ready to use Harry&#x27;s Razor.  The first shave was pretty good.  The second and third were not so good so I replaced the blades.  The first shave on the second blade was fair at best.  The second and third shaves were not good.  I felt pulling as I used the razor.  I think that is a sign of the blade not being sharp.  I am disappointed.  I really wanted to adopt a new razor but this is not it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing. I threw it away. The blades were dull. The shave cream was soupy. The handle was cheap.&lt;br /&gt;When I complained to them (Harry&#x27;s) they said my money would be refunded. It never was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make no mistake about it. This whole &#x27;Harry&#x27;s&#x27; phenomenon is a scam based on slick marketing.</li>
            <li> Really great blades. I have been using them for 6 months now. I can change them frequently and the cost is fantastic. I would recommend the heavier handle as I do find the regular ones just too light weight. The look of the head is very different than other brands and does look cheap but it works well and I have never had one break, it flexes very well and the angle at which you shave it different than the other brands. It is definitely worth a try -  you like it or you don&#x27;t but it works - it&#x27;s just different than we all grew up with.</li>
            <li> These blades and the handle are elegant and nicely made. But if you use them to shave those secret private parts, be wary. I sneezed while using them on lefty--the one that hangs low and nearly cut it off! And the after shave I used? It was fire, baby, fire. Good product but be careful with twiggy and his 2 nutty friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really tried to like these cute little razors.  But I&#x27;ve sliced &amp; diced my face enough now to move back to my Gillette ProGlide.  After taking out a ANOTHER chunk of skin on my chin a couple weeks ago, I realized that most of their blades are defective.  I&#x27;m done bleeding throughout the day.  The final straw came when I was actually still dripping blood through my band aid onto my dinner plate - almost 10 hours later!  Sorry, Harry&#x27;s, you may have good price, cute marketing &amp; a slick-looking product - but I now bear way too many scars on my face from trying to like your product.  Awful quality!</li>
            <li> Wanted to like these blades tried them, was not impressed and then managed to cut the hell out of my face something I have not done since being a teen. sorry Harry your product is not up to that of a Fusion and I would never buy it again.</li>
            <li> I find most of the negative reviews amusing. They all talk about lacerating themselves with these blades. I have been shaving for 30 years and find these blades to be as good as any I have used. Do they give you the shave of a straight razor in the barber shop? No...but neither do they lacerate your skin. Just like any blde you may get some nicks and cuts as they dull or if you use them improperly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are quality blades that deliver a quality shave. I like Harry&#x27;s and will stick with them until I start to see a decline in that quality.</li>
            <li> I too wanted to replace the expensive Gillette razors with a new indie type company. I signed up for the full package, shave balm, and auto reorder. First shaves were noticeably worse that my old Gillette and took twice as long since the blade doesn&#x27;t pivot or vibrate. Second blade I popped in without looking at it? I never had to inspect a Gillette Blade. Big mistake, as I ended up with multiple cuts on my face. The bottom blade was bent, see picture and ripped me a new one before I noticed the blood. Im going back to the Gillette blades and will never complain about price again. Sometimes you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re anything but a Teenager, with not much of a beard, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be happy. After 2 shaves the blades couldn&#x27;t cut my neck beard....what a disappointment after seeing all the ads.</li>
            <li> Dangerous. These blades can cut you deeply they are not safe at all to use. At the bottom of the blade is a flimsy plastic strip which can give way allowing the blade to slice deep like a potato peeler. The blades don&#x27;t pivot they are attached in a way like a spatula. The handle is nice.</li>
            <li> Old Guy (60), medium beard/shaved head, really like the razor.&lt;br /&gt;Blade lasts and performs well.</li>
            <li> Blades just are not good. I&#x27;ve really tried to make these things work, but I have had more razor rash and cuts in the past 2 weeks than in the previous 5 years combined. If you are used to GIllete or major brand razors, you will notice a very obvious difference.</li>
            <li> I read a few of the one star reviews and am legitimately surprised to the point that I feel we must be using a different product. These reviews bash the shaving foam as well as the blades to the point of basically comparing them to Dollar Store knock-offs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my thirties and have been in professions since 19 years old that require employees to be clean shaven every single day. What makes my situation bad is that I have extremely sensitive skin on my neck and continually suffer from ingrown hairs. I have tried many many products over the years from electic razors that cost hundreds of dollars to low to high-end regular disposable razors. My point being, I&#x27;ve been around the block as far as shaving products go. I&#x27;ve also tried a large number of shaving techniques and foams and conditioners that are suppose to give a closer shave with less resistence. My conclusion is nothing is perfect unless you are willing to get all your hair removed by lazer treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Winston Set with a number of extra blades. My prior preference was with the Gillette Pro Fusion razor. These are the best IMO but are so overpriced it&#x27;s obnoxious. This is still a slightly better blade and system than Harry&#x27;s but not by much and definitely not to justify purchasing it over Harry&#x27;s. Also the negative reviews about the foam are very odd to me. A bad product...really? This is significantly better vs the big names unless you buy specialty foam and conditioner that&#x27;s way more expensive than $3-$5 products most buy. It leaves my face much smoother. In the end, it&#x27;s a surprisingly good product that does close to the same job for a lot less money.</li>
            <li> Not impressed. First the small things. The razor is very lightweight. I didn&#x27;t like the feel of it. Further, the handle is round. I shave in the shower, have done so for years, and the round handle makes it hard to tell which way the blade is facing. Now for the worst part. I couldn&#x27;t get a decent shave. The blades were sharp but didn&#x27;t conform to my face. I was left with far more stubble than with my current razor. That&#x27;s what it&#x27;s all about and Harry&#x27;s flunked, sadly.    Update: I first gave Harry&#x27;s 1 star but the blade that came with the razor was defective. I decided to give them a 2nd chance. I changed the blade and used a gel lubricant instead of their foam and got a very decent shave. I&#x27;ll wait to see whether the German blades really do last longer but if they do Harry&#x27;s might get an extra star. I don&#x27;t like the packaging for their blades but the razor itself felt much better with a properly manufactured blade. I don&#x27;t know if quality control is a problem.</li>
            <li> New, these do not deliver a great shave compared to the Fusion Power Pro. Moreover, you get about 60% fewer shaves per blade which makes these things rather expensive. Additionally, there is a design flaw. The plastic edges around the sides of the blades are too high, making it difficult to shave certain areas, like below the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the fact that the blades are not as sharp and do not last as long they are too flexible; The blades and the plastic casing are flimsy. I ordered the starter kit for $15. I will not refill these but your mileage may vary. For 15 bucks (holder and three blades) you might want to judge for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - 11/27/2014: With one Harry&#x27;s blade left I purchased a new pack of Fusion Pro Power (which I was using pre-Harry). I have reduced this from my original two stars to one star because, when I switched back, I realized that the difference is amazing. Far less drag and a far closer shave than Harry can deliver. By the way the shaving cream that came in the starter kit is nothing to write home about either.</li>
            <li> Best, closest shave ever. I am 83 years old and have used a lot of different types of razors. Hands down, this is the best. Shaves close easily. While shaving, it cleans well; hair cuttings rinse off and do not pile up, clogging the blades. The handle is heavy and easy to hold. I like the feel of it. This is my way of shaving from now on.</li>
            <li> I did not read any of the reviews before I purchased the Harry razor. I was impressed with the advertisement and the packaging was impressive.  What was not impressive was the shave.  I wanted it to work, but the blade was probably the worst blade I ever shaved with.  The German engineering has some real problems when it comes to making razor blades.  The blade does not cut the beard.  Went back to my disposable Schicks which I would judge to be 10 times better with less blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry Harry&#x27;s good idea, nice presentation but the blades sucks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure where the poor reviews of this product are coming from.  Actually I have a suspicion, but how could one prove that is was posted by an employee of a major manufacturer.  I was a fan of a major brand five blade model, but the price became ridiculous.  Then I tried the old safety razor route to save money, sad to say that decision required quite a bit of styptic pencil.  The only good to come of the experiment  was the discovery of the saving cream of Taylor of Old Bond Street (sold here at Amazon) which is amazing and is a great bargain (it goes a long way) compared to the canned variety.  As for the the Harry&#x27;s Razors they work just as well as the national brand at less than half the price--and the free handle works great as well.  They have a nice plan tailored to your own shaving habits, and you can cancel at any time.  The only improvement would be the addition of the top single blade for trimming sideburns, but at this price I can live without it.  In my humble opinion you can&#x27;t go wrong with these razors--and I haven&#x27;t been paid for this review.</li>
            <li> I am 29 years old and Iv&#x27;e shaving since i was 16. I started shaving my head 3 years ago using Gillette Pro Glide shaving system. I was pretty happy with the product&#x27;s performance but not so happy with the price. I signed up to start receiving razors from Harry&#x27;s 2.5 weeks ago. i got my razors in the mail the other day and i shaved my head tonight. it was the absolute WORST shaving experience of my life!! these razor ate my head alive. i was bleeding for 30 mins without even making any mistakes!! the blades are just that bad. they pulled and cut my shin so drastically it left visible scars. i am not happy and once i find every customer communication out to post on i will be canceling this frankly horrible product!!!</li>
            <li> Great at marketing not so much at making razors. Average at best.</li>
