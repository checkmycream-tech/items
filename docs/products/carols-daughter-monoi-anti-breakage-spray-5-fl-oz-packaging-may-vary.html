    <ol>
            <li>I am VERY impressed.</li>
            <li>It smells very good and does a great job of protecting and minimizing breakage.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell that great either</li>

            <li>I totally Love this scent..</li>
            <li>BUT I am totally in love with the aroma.  </li>
            <li>Great products, worth the try and worth the investment.</li>
            <li>which were less impressive than the anti-breakage spray.</li>
            <li>Great product i notice difference in my hair from 1st use shedding stopped wish was larger bottle</li>
            <li>This has an,amazing smell not strong just makes you feel wonderful!</li>
            <li>This made it quick and easy.</li>
            <li>but this really detangled, smells great, and my hair if really really soft will buy this again</li>
            <li>My kinky curls popped right back into place and my hair felt great.</li>
            <li>It is smooth, soft, very easy to manage and straighten.</li>
            <li>doing a blow out and press myself has been true torture.</li>
            <li>I am telling you the truth I have NEVER combed out and blow dryed my hair so quickly.</li>
            <li>Really good for dry hair!</li>
            <li>Really like this, I really see it working the more</li>
            <li>i saw many reviewers say not only does this spray help with breakage, but hair loss as well.</li>
            <li>I would not, however, spray heavily by roots as good look greasy.</li>
            <li>Hydrates just enough without leaving great or heavy.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t use too much.  </li>
            <li>Very lightweight.</li>
            <li>It was straight as a board (but not damaged)</li>
            <li>But these products really did work well on my hair.</li>
            <li>This spray is very versatile.</li>
            <li>But since I like it so much it gets 5.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I both use it on our not thick, straight hair..</li>
            <li>This first time I used this product I shampooed with Wen FIG, did a hot oil treatment of coconut oil and olive oil mixed, rinsed very well (probably could have used a bit of shampoo to get it all out but didn&#x27;t)</li>
            <li>Loce the comb since I have natural hair , thanks so much for selling her products.  </li>
            <li>Then I made the for sections of braids and put a little more on as I combed through my hair.</li>
            <li>i found a new friend</li>
            <li>Does exactly what the product states my hair is staying in my head an instant visible results!!</li>
            <li>, this cuts the time almost in half and is well worth the money!</li>
            <li>So far I am liking this product.</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft.</li>
            <li>I have been natural for 7 years and have struggled to get the texture that I want</li>
            <li>:  FOund instructions on BOTTOM of bottle, WOW, who knew...</li>
            <li>In just one use this product has made my 4c hair type manageable, soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I had no other products on my hair and trusted it to make my hair feel lively as promised.</li>
            <li>Today I shampooed with Shea Moisture moisturizing shampoo and conditioned with the Monoi Conditioner (my hair felt very dry with this conditioner at first</li>
            <li>As far as Anti-Breakage, not sure what&#x27;s it doing because hair wasn&#x27;t really breaking that much</li>
            <li>This was bought for my granddaughter and it makes her hair softer and much easier to comb thru -- we actually see less hair in the comb after using this product.  </li>

            <li> but i could put my fingers through my hair no breakage or tangles which is literally a miracle for my hair, I then sprayed the monoi oil directly on my hair this time, made my 4 sections of breads and then put the chocolate blow dry creamon each section probably about a dime size or less on each section again careful not to put too much to avoid hair with build up.</li>
            <li> I was careful not to put to much as some reviews said it made their hair hard and with a residue.</li>
            <li> I have had a haircut to cut all the dry ends off.</li>
            <li> With the blow out I used Carols Daughter chocolat blow dry cream</li>

            <li> the chocolate blow dry cream.</li>
            <li> My hair tends to tangle a lot and get very dry.</li>
            <li> I am curious to see how these products work when I wear my hair in a fro, will also do an update on that.</li>
            <li> Print on bottle should be in dark color to contrast with gold label.</li>
            <li> Does not weigh it down, feels healthier.</li>
            <li> It seems like I&#x27;m seeing less split ends</li>
            <li> Aside from making my hair feel dry, hard and wirery hair, my color suffered and was lightened in a way that&#x27;s tough to overlook considering my color was done three days prior.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a little difference in the amount of hair loss since using this product.  </li>
            <li> shake well, sprayed a few times in my head and distributed through my hair.</li>
            <li> After comb out I noticed very, very little hair in my brush and in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> Price for amount, and the small amounts of monoi oil (coconut oil) and coconut water in the formulation.</li>
            <li> my usual leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> The price is also outrageous and  no one can convince me this product shouldn&#x27;t be sold in the dollar store, this would automatically allow people to accurately place a value on this product line.</li>
            <li> about 2-3 hours later touched my hair and was shocked at how hard it was.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this purchase.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Really like this, I really see it working the more I use it.</li>
            <li> Does what it says it&#x27;s for...</li>
            <li> This stuff works great, doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down and it is a great product! I would recommend anyone with hair that has lots of split ends to use this!</li>
            <li> Just started using carols daughter Momoi and loving it... Does exactly what the product states my hair is staying in my head an instant visible results!! A must have</li>
            <li> So I had been looking at these infomercials forever and decided to purchase this product from *sn. What a disappointment. Aside from making my hair feel dry, hard and wirery hair, my color suffered and was lightened in a way that&#x27;s tough to overlook considering my color was done three days prior. I had no other products on my hair and trusted it to make my hair feel lively as promised. I got to work and about 2-3 hours later touched my hair and was shocked at how hard it was. There&#x27;s some type of drying agent included-alcohol-like. It doesn&#x27;t smell that great either and I kept thinking &amp;#34;it seems like nothing more than water with fragrance added&amp;#34;. I felt like I should have shouted from my roof top &amp;#34;buyer beware&amp;#34;. The price is also outrageous and  no one can convince me this product shouldn&#x27;t be sold in the dollar store, this would automatically allow people to accurately place a value on this product line. I also got what&#x27;s passing for conditioner and shampoo..which were less impressive than the anti-breakage spray.</li>
            <li> It seems like I&#x27;m seeing less split ends &amp; I like this as a leave in conditioner before styling shampooed hair &amp; also use it to refresh my blow out between washings.</li>
            <li> I love love this product also smells good</li>
            <li> Great product i notice difference in my hair from 1st use shedding stopped wish was larger bottle</li>
            <li> This item did not have the milky look after shaking it. Not happy with this purchase. The smell is great though.</li>
            <li> So far I am liking this product. Just don&#x27;t use too much.  My hair feels soft. I have had a haircut to cut all the dry ends off. Will see if this product will help it stay healthy.</li>
            <li> i wear a lot of hair weaves i use leave in conditioners when i have the weave so hair isn&#x27;t so damaged but this really detangled, smells great, and my hair if really really soft will buy this again i found a new friend</li>
            <li> I use this on my hair almost every day, especially in the nape area where my hair is prone to breakage. It smells very good and does a great job of protecting and minimizing breakage.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. A light spray oil, lots of good stuff in it. My daughter and I both use it on our not thick, straight hair.. Does not weigh it down, feels healthier. I would not, however, spray heavily by roots as good look greasy.</li>
            <li> Love it , great smell but two weeks later hair still breaking. Very lightweight.</li>
            <li> I am writing this review after the second time blowing my hair out using Carols Daughter Moni Anti breakage spray. I am VERY impressed. I am a product junkie and even though I may find a product that works well on my hair I can&#x27;t help but try one more just to see if it makes my hair more manageable. I am SOOO glad that I did. This first time I used this product I shampooed with Wen FIG, did a hot oil treatment of coconut oil and olive oil mixed, rinsed very well (probably could have used a bit of shampoo to get it all out but didn&#x27;t) and then I applied the Moni Anti breakage spray  - shake well, sprayed a few times in my head and distributed through my hair. Then I made the for sections of braids and put a little more on as I combed through my hair. I was careful not to put to much as some reviews said it made their hair hard and with a residue. After comb out I noticed very, very little hair in my brush and in my bathroom. Comb out was incredibly EASY! My hair tends to tangle a lot and get very dry. I have been natural for 7 years and have struggled to get the texture that I want doing a blow out and press myself has been true torture. This made it quick and easy. With the blow out I used Carols Daughter chocolat blow dry cream it is WONDERFUL smells great and made my hair so very soft and easy to straighten. It was straight as a board (but not damaged) when I went to shampoo it today. My kinky curls popped right back into place and my hair felt great. I definitely feel it protected my hair from heat damage. Today I shampooed with Shea Moisture moisturizing shampoo and conditioned with the Monoi Conditioner (my hair felt very dry with this conditioner at first but as it sat on my hair it softened, still a bit dry when I rinsed out but i could put my fingers through my hair no breakage or tangles which is literally a miracle for my hair, I then sprayed the monoi oil directly on my hair this time, made my 4 sections of breads and then put the chocolate blow dry creamon each section probably about a dime size or less on each section again careful not to put too much to avoid hair with build up. I am telling you the truth I have NEVER combed out and blow dryed my hair so quickly. I will have to time it for you guys next time and do an update. But these products really did work well on my hair. It is smooth, soft, very easy to manage and straighten. Which is saving me a ton of money so that I can now do it myself. I am curious to see how these products work when I wear my hair in a fro, will also do an update on that. Great products, worth the try and worth the investment. I do think CD is overpriced a bit but I get it they are going for a great profit margin and they do have excellent products I think its worth it when it comes to the monoi line and the chocolate blow dry cream. I plan to try all of the products in these 2 lines. More reviews to come.</li>
            <li> great for detagling. wish it were a bit cheaper and last a bit longer.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a little difference in the amount of hair loss since using this product.  It helps with tangles too.</li>
            <li> Hydrates just enough without leaving great or heavy. Will purchase again</li>
            <li> ALWAYS LOVE THE END RESULTS.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the anti-breakage hair spray. This was bought for my granddaughter and it makes her hair softer and much easier to comb thru -- we actually see less hair in the comb after using this product.  Doing her hair has always been a chore, this cuts the time almost in half and is well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Would recommend her products to everyone, it does what it says it does.I love her body products also. Loce the comb since I have natural hair , thanks so much for selling her products.  Annette surrell</li>
            <li> Really good for dry hair!</li>
            <li> This has an,amazing smell not strong just makes you feel wonderful! Helped with my ends and love using this everyday!Carol makes great products!</li>
            <li> would recommend it to anyone who is bleached hair</li>
            <li> I totally Love this scent.. If I could get perfume/cologne with this scent I would.  I spray it all over my body.  As far as Anti-Breakage, not sure what&#x27;s it doing because hair wasn&#x27;t really breaking that much BUT I am totally in love with the aroma.  Would give 5 stars but AGAIN no directions for use!  Or if they are on bottle, need magnifying glass to read them :o) Print on bottle should be in dark color to contrast with gold label. SHAKE WELL shld be included in instructions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  FOund instructions on BOTTOM of bottle, WOW, who knew... lol</li>
            <li> In just one use this product has made my 4c hair type manageable, soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> This spray is very versatile. It detangles any hair type. It also is perfect for relaxed, natural, or color-treated hair. You can also use it as a heat protectant. I use it as a refresher spray. I like the idea of having to &amp;#34;mix&amp;#34; the two halves up before each use. When i was looking into buying this i saw many reviewers say not only does this spray help with breakage, but hair loss as well. It smells really good too. There is only two problems. Price for amount, and the small amounts of monoi oil (coconut oil) and coconut water in the formulation. But since I like it so much it gets 5.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t notice a difference from this and my usual leave in conditioner.</li>
