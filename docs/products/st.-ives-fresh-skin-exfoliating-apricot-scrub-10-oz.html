            <li>This is my favorite apricot scrub product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s scrubby, it&#x27;s apricot, what more could you need?</li>
            <li>A lovely lady told me about it</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for better results.</li>
            <li>I love the 3 pack value that I ordered.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it came with 3 because it saves me money.</li>
            <li>I love how abrasive the scrub is.</li>
            <li>The scent is ok too.</li>
            <li>I have spent good money on scrubs, and this one just 5.00 a jar is just as good as my $35.00 scrub for 2 ounces.</li>
            <li>too much works good smooth face</li>
            <li>exfoliator and cheap, what else is there to say?</li>
            <li>Absolutely Devine. Clears and tones my skin effectively.</li>
            <li>It is a great facial scrub.</li>
            <li>I have always been a fan of this product, and for some reason it was no longer available in my area.</li>
            <li>I have fair sensitive skin</li>
            <li>None of them make my skin feel as clean and smooth as St. Ives brand.  </li>
            <li>This is a good scrub but the apricots are too big.</li>
            <li>locally- and 3 tubs for this price was too good to pass up.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please make sure if you&#x27;re using it that you only use it on your body 3-4 times a week, any more</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing body scrub, and I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if the granules were a bit smaller</li>
            <li>Once I found this available and in a reasonably priced multi-pack it wasn&#x27;t even a question of purchasing.</li>
            <li>Feel free to use on face and any other areas in need of healthy and vigorous cleansing.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face smooth and soft, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>I instantly fell in love with it and decided to buy some.</li>
            <li>But I did purchase this scrub from this exact seller.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>The container appeared to be filled to the top but when pushed down, I realized it was the air at the bottom of the container.</li>
            <li>I dont have much to say .</li>
            <li>it arrive fast.</li>
            <li>i really like washing my face and neck with the scrub in the shower.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and the product was as described.</li>
            <li>Make sure you close your pores back with cold water and a great toner after using this scrub.</li>
            <li>Deep scrub that will leave your skin feeling super soft.</li>
            <li>I live in Philadelphia, PA.</li>
            <li>The third container was lighter in weight when I first took it out of the box.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores for a long time so have settled for other brands.  </li>
            <li>I always get asked how skin is so soft.</li>
            <li>I use this scrub everyday and it makes my oily skin feel soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for your daily skin care.</li>
            <li>If you want baby soft skin this is the key.</li>
            <li>Package arrived with one open leaking jar and one jar with a broken top.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great product and a great deal.  I use this scrub everyday and it makes my oily skin feel soft and clean.  Plus, I saved a lot of money by getting this three pack.</li>
            <li> VERY NICE! Leaves my face smooth and soft, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> This is a good scrub but the apricots are too big. Make sure you close your pores back with cold water and a great toner after using this scrub. If you&#x27;re an apricot fan than I do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> St. Ives Fresh Skin Apricot Scrub is the best I have ever used but I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores for a long time so have settled for other brands.  None of them make my skin feel as clean and smooth as St. Ives brand.  There is just enough roughness to the scrub to rid my face of dead skin but not enough to irritate my face.  I even use it on rough heels sometimes.  Great product that I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;ve found again.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not using St. Ives then your face is filthy. The best stuff ever. I use it vigorously daily but I&#x27;m a mechanic/ welder and deal with oil and dust all day. Some people find it too gritty but they have other cleansers that are less gritty.</li>
            <li> So i stole a dib or dab from a roomate that she left in our shower. I instantly fell in love with it and decided to buy some. Was happy to see that there was an option to purchase 3 all together as a bundle. It is a nice size jar. Ive had it for a week now, and it is still more than 75% of the scrub in the jar. I also use some on my face and on neck too. I really do love it. I live in Philadelphia, PA. Purchased this from a friend&#x27;s account because she had Prime and I didnt. That is why the review does not say Verified. But I did purchase this scrub from this exact seller. and i love it. im open for any questions as well. :) Happy Shopping!</li>
            <li> The pack of 3 order is a scam. The third container only contain half of what is supposed to be in it. The third container was lighter in weight when I first took it out of the box. The container appeared to be filled to the top but when pushed down, I realized it was the air at the bottom of the container. Not happy but don&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of returning.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I didn&#x27;t realize though that when I (hastily) ordered &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; I would receive a package of 3 jars.  I ordered &amp;#34;2&amp;#34; so now I have 6 big jars of apricot scrub.  Love it anyway.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite apricot scrub product. I use it every day on my face. The skin on my face feels very smooth. I have used it on other parts of my body where the skin has felt rough and I have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> I dont have much to say . this scrub has been purchased by 1,000&#x27;s of people. It great. I love it. I loved that this came in a pack of 3 Jars. all 10 ounces each. it arrive fast. i really like washing my face and neck with the scrub in the shower. will be purchasing again. thanks!</li>
            <li> Both my girlfriend and I use this. It works very well. Deep scrub that will leave your skin feeling super soft.</li>
            <li> Great buy, more for your money</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s scrubby, it&#x27;s apricot, what more could you need?</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t beat the price per jar compared to stores</li>
            <li> nothing fancy... does what its supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Dynamite stuff.  If you have periods of dry skin this is for you.  A lovely lady told me about it and I gave it a shot.  You have to buy three but who cares?  It doesn&#x27;t go bad!  Use it.  It works.</li>
            <li> Package arrived with one open leaking jar and one jar with a broken top.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this size sold locally- and 3 tubs for this price was too good to pass up.&lt;br /&gt;Best exfoliator and cheap, what else is there to say?</li>
            <li> My package was delivered in a timely manner with everything intact.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Absolutely Devine. Clears and tones my skin effectively.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! One jar was open ava dried tho.</li>
            <li> My mom introduced me to this body scrub when I was younger, and I use it all the time. It&#x27;s an amazing body scrub, and I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if the granules were a bit smaller and I could scrub my face with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please make sure if you&#x27;re using it that you only use it on your body 3-4 times a week, any more and it will dry your skin out. If you&#x27;re using it on sensitive skin, don&#x27;t scrub too hard!</li>
            <li> It is a great facial scrub. Couldn&#x27;t ask for better results. I love the 3 pack value that I ordered. I highly recommend this for your daily skin care. I have fair sensitive skin and I use this daily without any problems.</li>
            <li> Feel free to use on face and any other areas in need of healthy and vigorous cleansing. A little but goes a long way don&#x27;t use too much water to lather face.</li>
            <li> I have spent good money on scrubs, and this one just 5.00 a jar is just as good as my $35.00 scrub for 2 ounces.</li>
            <li> I got this back in January but I&#x27;m just now using it! I&#x27;m glad it came with 3 because it saves me money. I love how abrasive the scrub is. The scent is ok too. Shipping was fast and the product was as described.</li>
            <li> Excellent for the whole body too.  Klara</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I hate this p;oduct or not-I am returning it as one jar WAS OPENED AND USED-</li>
            <li> FANTABULOUS. ......If you want baby soft skin this is the key. I use it monthly all over my body. I always get asked how skin is so soft. This is it.</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of this product, and for some reason it was no longer available in my area. Once I found this available and in a reasonably priced multi-pack it wasn&#x27;t even a question of purchasing.</li>
            <li> A great buy in a three pk( good for whole family)!</li>
            <li> I like the jars don&#x27;t like the tubes waste too much works good smooth face</li>
