            <li>This is a great device.  </li>
            <li>but I am so happy with this product.</li>

            <li>the product is a good one.</li>
            <li>good product,alittle pricy.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>this Amazing</li>
            <li>would stock this Amazing tool!&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>The 2 sides are nice.</li>
            <li>Very cool!  </li>
            <li>My wife is a professional esthtician &amp; was very happy with the look &amp; feel of the product,I like the way it folds up!&lt;br /&gt;thanks  Patrick</li>
            <li>I found the thinner bowl to be much more effective, although this implement does most of the job its predecessor did.</li>
            <li>Tip should be fine to be effective.</li>
            <li>This product lives up to its name, I was able to remove most blackheads on my face and my pores shrank.</li>
            <li>I noticed I could remove more</li>
            <li>my skin looks better.</li>
            <li>it would more efficient.  </li>
            <li>i was able to poke and squeeze zits as advertised.</li>
            <li>and I totally love it.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to disinfect the tool before and after with alcohol to avoid spreading the bacteria all over your face.</li>
            <li>This seems to work better for blackheads on flatter surfaces on the face, like the forehead or cheeks.</li>
            <li>The lance by the way is pinpoint fine, while the extractor is better for blackheads than whiteheads, but I&#x27;ve used it on both.  </li>
            <li>You definitely need this perfect and cool tool.</li>
            <li>easy..</li>
            <li>I like the tool, I just wish both ends screwed in easily.</li>
            <li>and I thought I could see a specialist for that fine detail.</li>
            <li>Of course, since the tool is metal, it&#x27;s easy to keep clean with alcohol before and after each use.  </li>
            <li>Cheap quality, 5.</li>
            <li>no storage case it came in a cheap plastic tube can&#x27;t even hold it well inside...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Basically they don&#x27;t clean the product after they machine it, or they are storing the product incorrectly.</li>
            <li>helps a lot to clean pimples</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m not about to pay $300 a pop to get my skin cleaned, I decided I needed my own quality tool to keep my skin clear, so I found this lance/extractor on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>--- I returned it and got full refund including S&amp;H charge.</li>
            <li>I think it works good enough</li>
            <li>The nose is too &amp;#34;squishy.&amp;#34; The lance is useful, though.</li>
            <li>When I received it,I was amazed at the fine crafting and clever design.  </li>
            <li>This tool has helped me to get my blemish-outbreak under control because  it is just as good as a tool that a professional cosmetologist would use for a facial cleaner.</li>
            <li>This implement is exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>The pointy end works pretty well at piercing the skin to remove millia.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The needle is nice n sharp.</li>
            <li>When the white and or black heads first appear this product works great..</li>
            <li>Thanks,</li>
            <li>It really does work.</li>
            <li>It is really helpful to get rid of blemishes</li>
            <li>I guess I will order it again and be more careful with it this time.</li>
            <li>The whole thing isn&#x27;t even in proportion.</li>
            <li>but i hope seller add it a real storage case with this tool...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would be better if they had a sharp wire loop tool like some dermatoligist instruments.</li>
            <li>To be more specific - imagine the hole in the bowl - the part put over the blackhead, as a hole in the sharp end of a razor blade, vs a hole in the thicker side of the blade.  </li>
            <li>I am completely satusfied!  </li>
            <li>Sharp end also will bend easily if you&#x27;re not careful.  </li>
            <li>After getting a professional skin cleaning months ago, I noticed I continued to get blemishes.  </li>
            <li>all I can Say is WOW...</li>
            <li>Better late than never however.</li>
            <li>Good tool but too expensive 16 dlls with shipping...</li>
            <li>The lance and extrator are twisted/screwed on and off the ends of the stems, and are also stored internally inside the stem (that&#x27;s the clever part).</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>The product is not sharp.</li>
            <li>The lancet end is not very sharp and, without that functioning, the extractor isn&#x27;t going to work.</li>

            <li> Lancet wasn&#x27;t sharp enough to even work.</li>
            <li> so I am writing a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After contacting the company, because my lancet was dull</li>
            <li> everytime you receive a white and or black head.</li>
            <li> It is really sharp, so be careful to no poke yourself by accident.</li>
            <li> The picture is not accurate and doesn&#x27;t reflect the actual item: the ending of the comedone is not sharp and thin and doesn&#x27;t extract black or white spots</li>
            <li> This is a sharp product that will work well, but you&#x27;ll probably need help to use it.  </li>
            <li> and then I decided to order a cheaper tool from a different provider and was not very happy with it.</li>
            <li> , the company sent me a sharp one!  </li>
            <li> It is designed like a small eyelet with a sharp edge on one side.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to drop it because it will make the lancet dull- this happened to me</li>
            <li> My disappointment in this item was the thickness of the \\&quot;bowl\\&quot; on the extractor end - much \\&quot;thicker\\&quot; than the one I was replacing.  </li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews</li>
            <li> but it worked well to shave off a very small skin overgrowth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little difficult, depending on when you&#x27;re trying to use it, to hold the device in place and use the poker end to puncture a comedome.  </li>
            <li> Very hard to handle.</li>
            <li> Poor design -</li>
            <li> /&gt;The cup part is worthless due to the thickness and hole size.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned before my purchase, but after reading the reviews I decided to give it a shot and wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  </li>
            <li> To blunt, painful.</li>
            <li> Horrible product, came rusted up and dirty, do not buy this garbage.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love it! I had to buy a second one so my husband would quit taking mine. The 2 sides are nice. The needle is nice n sharp.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find any directions on how to use this.</li>
            <li> The product is not sharp.</li>
            <li> After getting a professional skin cleaning months ago, I noticed I continued to get blemishes.  Since I&#x27;m not about to pay $300 a pop to get my skin cleaned, I decided I needed my own quality tool to keep my skin clear, so I found this lance/extractor on Amazon.  When I received it,I was amazed at the fine crafting and clever design.  There are actually 3 parts to this lance/extractor: the lance, the extractor and the stem.  The lance and extrator are twisted/screwed on and off the ends of the stems, and are also stored internally inside the stem (that&#x27;s the clever part). Just twist/screw the parts inside either side of the stem when you&#x27;re done.  Very cool!  The lance by the way is pinpoint fine, while the extractor is better for blackheads than whiteheads, but I&#x27;ve used it on both.  Of course, since the tool is metal, it&#x27;s easy to keep clean with alcohol before and after each use.  You definitely need this perfect and cool tool.</li>
            <li> 1. Rust Lancet, 2. No product origin-of-country, 3. No direction brief to use, 4. Cheap quality, 5. Not sure if the delivered item was a new one or a used item. --- I returned it and got full refund including S&amp;H charge. Thanks,</li>
            <li> This implement is exactly as advertised.  It was purchased as a replacement for a lost item.  My disappointment in this item was the thickness of the \\&quot;bowl\\&quot; on the extractor end - much \\&quot;thicker\\&quot; than the one I was replacing.  To be more specific - imagine the hole in the bowl - the part put over the blackhead, as a hole in the sharp end of a razor blade, vs a hole in the thicker side of the blade.  I found the thinner bowl to be much more effective, although this implement does most of the job its predecessor did.</li>
            <li> This product lives up to its name, I was able to remove most blackheads on my face and my pores shrank. I noticed I could remove more but I would need a magnifying glass and I thought I could see a specialist for that fine detail. For an at home comedone extractor and lancet I think it works good enough and I am happy with the product and my purchaseand my skin looks better.</li>
            <li> Poor design - The loop should be bigger.  Over priced.  I thought by purchasing the most expensive it would more efficient.  I suspect the cheapest one would have serviced just as poorly.[[ASIN:B0013BQHW0 Comedone Extractor &amp; Lancet-blackhead Remover/whitehead Extractor-made in Germany]]</li>
            <li> the product is a good one. i returned it because it did not come with any instructions</li>
            <li> This is a sharp product that will work well, but you&#x27;ll probably need help to use it.  It&#x27;s a little difficult, depending on when you&#x27;re trying to use it, to hold the device in place and use the poker end to puncture a comedome.  Sharp end also will bend easily if you&#x27;re not careful.  I&#x27;d still buy it again.</li>
            <li> i was able to poke and squeeze zits as advertised. i didn&#x27;t do anything to help the under-groudrs though. good product,alittle pricy.</li>
            <li> This is a great device.  I was a little concerned before my purchase, but after reading the reviews I decided to give it a shot and wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have never seen anything work this Amazing, this pops Blackhead so&lt;br /&gt;darn easy..all I can Say is WOW...Try it..It WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;A Big Two Thumbs-Up...If I had a store that helped people with their skin, I&lt;br /&gt;Sure would stock this Amazing tool!&lt;br /&gt;Just Buy It...It really does work.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but I am so happy with this product. I ordered this tool about  a month ago and I totally love it. It is really sharp, so be careful to no poke yourself by accident. It is really helpful to get rid of blemishes and I also use a facial steamer to prep my skin. This tool has helped me to get my blemish-outbreak under control because  it is just as good as a tool that a professional cosmetologist would use for a facial cleaner. Just make sure to disinfect the tool before and after with alcohol to avoid spreading the bacteria all over your face. Be careful not to drop it because it will make the lancet dull- this happened to me and then I decided to order a cheaper tool from a different provider and was not very happy with it. I guess I will order it again and be more careful with it this time.</li>
            <li> This is not working as I had hoped.  The lancet end is not very sharp and, without that functioning, the extractor isn&#x27;t going to work.</li>
            <li> Horrible product, came rusted up and dirty, do not buy this garbage. The whole thing isn&#x27;t even in proportion. If you want to prod yourself with a tetanus rod then buy this garbage. If you don&#x27;t want to inflict tetanus on yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically they don&#x27;t clean the product after they machine it, or they are storing the product incorrectly. Either way, just avoid this junk.</li>
            <li> To blunt, painful. Tip should be fine to be effective. Very hard to handle.</li>
            <li> works great easly cleaned and can travel with it helps a lot to clean pimples comes with different types of tips</li>
            <li> The picture is not accurate and doesn&#x27;t reflect the actual item: the ending of the comedone is not sharp and thin and doesn&#x27;t extract black or white spots</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful...I&#x27;m happy...Linda</li>
            <li> When the white and or black heads first appear this product works great.. My problem is that I didn&#x27;t find out about the product in time. Better late than never however. It does work so I suggest you use it everytime you receive a white and or black head.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to edit my \\&quot;Poor\\&quot; 2-Star review so I am writing a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After contacting the company, because my lancet was dull, the company sent me a sharp one!  So YAY!  I am completely satusfied!  Thank you, Perfect Beauty!!!</li>
            <li> I like the tool, I just wish both ends screwed in easily. they don&#x27;t screw in correctly.</li>
            <li> My wife is a professional esthtician &amp; was very happy with the look &amp; feel of the product,I like the way it folds up!&lt;br /&gt;thanks  Patrick</li>
            <li> The pointy end works pretty well at piercing the skin to remove millia.&lt;br /&gt;The cup part is worthless due to the thickness and hole size.&lt;br /&gt;Would be better if they had a sharp wire loop tool like some dermatoligist instruments.</li>
            <li> Lancet wasn&#x27;t sharp enough to even work. I ended up just throwing it away after 5 minutes. I also wasn&#x27;t impressed with the extractor end</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it on acne but it worked well to shave off a very small skin overgrowth.  It is designed like a small eyelet with a sharp edge on one side.</li>
            <li> Good tool but too expensive 16 dlls with shipping... no storage case it came in a cheap plastic tube can&#x27;t even hold it well inside... for that i lost it in a week. I will buy it again but i hope seller add it a real storage case with this tool...</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> This seems to work better for blackheads on flatter surfaces on the face, like the forehead or cheeks. The nose is too &amp;#34;squishy.&amp;#34; The lance is useful, though.</li>
