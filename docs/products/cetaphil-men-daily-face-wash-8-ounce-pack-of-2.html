    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Cetaphil has become my goto brand and replaces Dove and Neutrogena as the best brand out there.</li>
            <li>and now I have the perfect compliment to use on my face.</li>
            <li>I was very happy to try this product and have my son (16) test it as well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Smells great too.</li>
            <li>Great for anyone with skin problems.  </li>
            <li>Great item is feeling great this summer</li>
            <li>Great value for the two pump bottles.</li>
            <li>...it&#x27;s good stuff.  </li>
            <li>It is easier to use in the shower, since you do need a good amount of water to wash this stuff off after applying.</li>
            <li>The Cetaphil doesn&#x27;t feel as good (it&#x27;s a bit slimy/oily).</li>
            <li>I think this is a good product for either gender, but you might want to unscrew the cap and take a whiff before you decide to buy.</li>
            <li>A good compromise is to use a medicated acne wash in the evening and Cetaphil in the morning.</li>
            <li>So a good thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;â–º Ounces.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to report that this product is a gentle face wash perfect for pre-shaving or just face wash just before going to bed.</li>
            <li>Cetaphil has been a trusted brand in our home for many years!  </li>
            <li>I have oily skin, this Cetaphil for Men face wash cleaned out my face nicely.</li>
            <li>handy pump bottle is on the counter in the master bath where both my husband and I can use it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll add more to my review if things change good or</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the best or or not, but it gets the job done and is plenty good enough for me.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Aveeno foaming face wash which I really like, but for the money and results, this Cetaphil is incredible.</li>
            <li>Unless you have flawless skin already, I don&#x27;t think Cetaphil is encompassing enough on its own -</li>
            <li>An excellent, mild, yet very effective men&#x27;s face wash for daily use.</li>
            <li>I would not use this again, but for travel and quick washes it is a good choice./</li>
            <li>They were both pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent facial wash, for men, women, children</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more for sure.</li>
            <li>I also found my face felt more refreshed with this product and</li>
            <li>OK.</li>
            <li>If it smelled better, I&#x27;d give it five stars.</li>
            <li>I love the pump bottles.</li>
            <li>One week in, my face FEELS better to the touch.</li>
            <li>It also is more drying to my skin than others.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used cetaphil for many years at a dermatologist&#x27;s recommendation and always liked the clean feeling.</li>
            <li>It is touted as a &amp;#34;non-drying&amp;#34; face wash that effectively removes dirt and leaves one&#x27;s face feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>The daily face wash is perfect guys, no scent, comes off easily with no residue and doesn&#x27;t leave a shine.</li>
            <li>This new formula for men is a welcome addition to the cetaphil line-up.</li>
            <li>Easy to dispense with no waste.&lt;br /&gt;~</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad for sure, but there&#x27;s a lot of room for improvement.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face felt clean, smooth, and oil free after a quick wash with Cetaphil, which is much more potent than the Aveeno product.</li>
            <li>But I think what I appreciate even more is that the scent is mild.  </li>
            <li>It really is amazing how effective this stuff is at cleaning only the surface of your skill.</li>
            <li>but in rare cases you know for sure.  </li>
            <li>However, since I was receiving a free review sample I figured that I would try</li>
            <li>Anyways, the product itself is the same great facewash I already use.</li>
            <li>It has a light fragrance to it that isn&#x27;t too medicinal-smelling and isn&#x27;t overbearing at all.  </li>
            <li>I received one bottle of this product free to try out and review.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>B00UHNZZ4G Cetaphil Men Daily Face Wash, 8 Ounce (Pack of 2)]] was offered for review by Amazon I gladly accepted it knowing that it will be good too since it is made by Cetaphil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The pump is of good design and very convenient which delivers just the right amount of liquid in one or two push to get the job done.</li>
            <li>Leave skin feeling clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It goes on clean, rinses off clean, and my face feels and looks clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it keeps my face clean.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need bubbles to get clean.  </li>
            <li>This daily wash for men is a surprising find.</li>
            <li>It is not bad for me, but it seems to make my skin feel greasy after some use, maybe just my skin type?  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong enough that the first time I used the wash my wife commented that something I used smelled good.</li>
            <li>It produces a medium lather and leaves one&#x27;s face feeling extremely fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>Just clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>The mild scent that it has does not bother you.</li>
            <li>I got over that rather quick.</li>
            <li>I sometimes found the Gentle formula to be too gentle, however, and not as effective at removing dirt.</li>
            <li>This is a great, gentle yet thorough facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used lots of different facial cleansers over the years (including the regular cetaphil cleanser) and can honestly say this is very, very good.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used a lot of Cetaphil skin products but the few I have used have always been great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing to feel how clean and dry the surface of my skin feels while not feeling AT</li>
            <li>I want to smell like a nice smelling human, not a flower pot.  </li>
            <li>The scent is nice but definitely on the floral side.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just something worth</li>
            <li>Meh, this smells kind of gross.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found a face wash for my sensitive</li>
            <li>I had to laugh when I saw that he had taken both pump bottles and put one in his shower and one on his vanity.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Economical, effective, male-friendly, and &amp;#34;non-drying&amp;#34; are enough for me to want to use this product again and again.</li>
            <li>Unlike the Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser, the Daily Face Wash feels much more like liquid soap and feels like it&#x27;s doing a better job of cleaning my face.  </li>
            <li>Cetaphil provides a nice gentle clean feeling to my face as a daily face wash.</li>
            <li>master bath isn&#x27;t large, so it&#x27;s nice to have products out that both of us are comfortable using instead of a large collection of gender specific</li>
            <li>/&gt;It really is a good facial wash though, but the masking fragrance (or whatever it&#x27;s trying to mask) has a strong smell that lingers on my skin for several minutes after I wash my face.  </li>
            <li>Price is also very reasonable.</li>
            <li>know what exactly makes this a MANLY product...</li>
            <li>My husband has fallen in love with this facial wash.</li>
            <li>It works fast!</li>
            <li>This face wash works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Would love some scent, especially as I wipe it under my nose.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it does.  </li>
            <li>pretty much anyone despite the name.  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to report that after two weeks I have not had any problems with facial skin irritation due to this</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed was it doesn&#x27;t produce much suds.  </li>
            <li>It does not linger for too long and leaves a clean fresh feeling on your skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser for years</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting used to the fact it doesn&#x27;t lather too, but lather or not, it works very well at clearing the skin.</li>
            <li>Purpose Gentle Cleansing Wash.</li>
            <li>B00GX8H59C Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser 20oz 2 pack]]</li>
            <li>which is so gentle you could leave it on your face for hours</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I like this product I&#x27;m just not seeing the value added in switching over from Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser.</li>
            <li>(and my aesthetician complimented me on my skin&#x27;s nice balance at my last facial).</li>
            <li>while I like many of the products offered by companies like Neutrogena, Dove, and Nivea, I can say that all of them perform at about the same level (as far as name brands</li>
            <li>The price will likely fluctuate, but before you buy you might want to check the regular kind to see how the price compares, taking care to note the size of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 99% sure these are the exact same products with a different label.</li>
            <li>One thing I especially like is that this facial wash is outstanding for pre-shaving, as it has a slight lubricating quality which pairs nicely with whatever shave cream</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re regularly washing away natural oils, it may start producing more natural</li>
            <li>This face wash seems to strip a bit more oil off than the gentle skin cleanser but definitely not as harsh as other products out there like Oil-Free Acne Wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend Cetaphil to anybody looking for a new face wash that&#x27;s not too smelly and works very well.</li>
            <li>Typically I lean more towards the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Face Wash is easy to dispense and the squat bottle with a wide bottom means you don&#x27;t have to hold it to use</li>
            <li>Cetaphil Daily Advance Lotion, Ultra Hydrating, 16 Ounce]] from local Costco wholesale and love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even sure if it has a different scent from the regular one.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the main reason why I switched to Cetaphil from Neutrogena products years ago.</li>
            <li>Many skin care products have historically caused me to develop red irritated areas, even hives.</li>
            <li>recent years, I&#x27;ve used several Cetaphil products created for women and I&#x27;ve always been pleased with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The pump is very convenient and delivers just the right amount of wash to cover my entire face.  </li>
            <li>It does a good job and does clean out the pores and makes my face feel clean, but the greasy feeling is something I hate.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Ultimately it leaves my skin feeling clean and not irritated or dry in any way.  </li>
            <li>guess my only minor gripe is that I don&#x27;t love the scent.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out, it rinses easily and the slight fragrance is clean.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a truly fragrance free facial wash, I&#x27;d suggest Olay Foaming Face Wash for Sensitive skin or Cerave Foaming Facial Cleanser, both products I use and really like.</li>
            <li>I am having fewer new blackheads or zits form.</li>
            <li>The face wash itself is a smooth gel similar to the Kiehl&#x27;s Facial Fuel Energizing Face Wash, but at a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li>Exact same ingredient list, exact same masking fragrance (it&#x27;s &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; but it isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34;), does the exact same good job of removing all my makeup at the end of the day, even my heavy black eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin on my face.</li>
            <li>I usually use a moisturizer or lotion but this is more of a soap like substance for cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Since its unscented I&#x27;m not sure what really makes it specific to men, but it is a great clearest none the less.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not extremely strong, and it rinses off easily.</li>
            <li>Cleans without stripping skin of natural oils.  </li>
            <li>It cleaned my face well without drying my skin, but I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m wild about the scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Cetaphil Daily Lotion and Gentle Skin Cleanser for years and jumped at the opportunity to try this product formulated for men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this face wash for about a week</li>
            <li>My husband, who has sensitive skin, loves it.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin on my face.  </li>
            <li>It leaves the skin feeling very clean, and totally oil-free without harsh astringents or burning alcohol.</li>
            <li>It has a smooth texture and is not gritty like some other face wash products I have tried.</li>
            <li>The Daily Face Wash is still gentle by all means, but it&#x27;s also strong enough to get a little deeper than ultra-gentle Cetaphil.</li>
            <li>The scent was somewhat medicinal not masculine but faded fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little sharp for my taste, but I had a couple of male friends smell it, and they liked it.</li>
            <li>It gave me a deep down clean without drying my skin.</li>
            <li>I have used Cetaphil Daily Face Wash for years and like it, so even though I&#x27;m a woman, I decided to give this new men&#x27;s version a try.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Without getting into too much detail, I have some patches of skin on my face that get dry.</li>
            <li>I sometimes use Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser, for normal to oily skin, and this Cetaphil Men Daily Facial Wash is exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also gentle enough to use multiple times during the day such as those gym days.</li>
            <li>I have been a regular user of Clearasil&#x27;s Daily Face Wash, but this new wash from Cetaphil might just make me switch.</li>
            <li>single pump of the product should be enough for most situations, so the small bottle should last quite awhile, even with two people using it.</li>
            <li>My only complaint would be that the consistency of this product is a bit like runny hair gel and totally clear, so I feel like I might be using more than is needed in the shower as it is hard to tell how much is in your hand.</li>
            <li>Does not dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>Also at this point in time on Amazon, this men&#x27;s version is more expensive per ounce than the regular Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser for normal to oily skin.  </li>
            <li>but i don&#x27;t like harsh cleaners that leave it super dry.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re getting considerably less product in the Men&#x27;s Face Wash product compared to Gentle Skin Cleanser</li>
            <li>The wash gently removes dirt, oil and sweat without leaving my face tight and prepares my face pre-shave.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> It goes on clean, rinses off clean, and my face feels and looks clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it keeps my face clean.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need bubbles to get clean.  </li>
            <li> This daily wash for men is a surprising find.</li>
            <li> It is not bad for me, but it seems to make my skin feel greasy after some use, maybe just my skin type?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong enough that the first time I used the wash my wife commented that something I used smelled good.</li>
            <li> It produces a medium lather and leaves one&#x27;s face feeling extremely fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> Just clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> The mild scent that it has does not bother you.</li>
            <li> I got over that rather quick.</li>
            <li> I sometimes found the Gentle formula to be too gentle, however, and not as effective at removing dirt.</li>
            <li> This is a great, gentle yet thorough facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of different facial cleansers over the years (including the regular cetaphil cleanser) and can honestly say this is very, very good.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used a lot of Cetaphil skin products but the few I have used have always been great.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing to feel how clean and dry the surface of my skin feels while not feeling AT</li>
            <li> I want to smell like a nice smelling human, not a flower pot.  </li>
            <li> The scent is nice but definitely on the floral side.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just something worth</li>
            <li> Meh, this smells kind of gross.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found a face wash for my sensitive</li>
            <li> I had to laugh when I saw that he had taken both pump bottles and put one in his shower and one on his vanity.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Economical, effective, male-friendly, and &amp;#34;non-drying&amp;#34; are enough for me to want to use this product again and again.</li>
            <li> Unlike the Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser, the Daily Face Wash feels much more like liquid soap and feels like it&#x27;s doing a better job of cleaning my face.  </li>
            <li> Cetaphil provides a nice gentle clean feeling to my face as a daily face wash.</li>
            <li> master bath isn&#x27;t large, so it&#x27;s nice to have products out that both of us are comfortable using instead of a large collection of gender specific</li>
            <li> /&gt;It really is a good facial wash though, but the masking fragrance (or whatever it&#x27;s trying to mask) has a strong smell that lingers on my skin for several minutes after I wash my face.  </li>
            <li> Price is also very reasonable.</li>
            <li> know what exactly makes this a MANLY product...</li>
            <li> My husband has fallen in love with this facial wash.</li>
            <li> It works fast!</li>
            <li> This face wash works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Would love some scent, especially as I wipe it under my nose.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it does.  </li>
            <li> pretty much anyone despite the name.  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to report that after two weeks I have not had any problems with facial skin irritation due to this</li>
            <li> first thing I noticed was it doesn&#x27;t produce much suds.  </li>
            <li> It does not linger for too long and leaves a clean fresh feeling on your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser for years</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting used to the fact it doesn&#x27;t lather too, but lather or not, it works very well at clearing the skin.</li>
            <li> Purpose Gentle Cleansing Wash.</li>
            <li> B00GX8H59C Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser 20oz 2 pack]]</li>
            <li> which is so gentle you could leave it on your face for hours</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I like this product I&#x27;m just not seeing the value added in switching over from Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser.</li>
            <li> (and my aesthetician complimented me on my skin&#x27;s nice balance at my last facial).</li>
            <li> while I like many of the products offered by companies like Neutrogena, Dove, and Nivea, I can say that all of them perform at about the same level (as far as name brands</li>
            <li> The price will likely fluctuate, but before you buy you might want to check the regular kind to see how the price compares, taking care to note the size of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 99% sure these are the exact same products with a different label.</li>
            <li> One thing I especially like is that this facial wash is outstanding for pre-shaving, as it has a slight lubricating quality which pairs nicely with whatever shave cream</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re regularly washing away natural oils, it may start producing more natural</li>
            <li> This face wash seems to strip a bit more oil off than the gentle skin cleanser but definitely not as harsh as other products out there like Oil-Free Acne Wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend Cetaphil to anybody looking for a new face wash that&#x27;s not too smelly and works very well.</li>
            <li> Typically I lean more towards the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Face Wash is easy to dispense and the squat bottle with a wide bottom means you don&#x27;t have to hold it to use</li>
            <li> Cetaphil Daily Advance Lotion, Ultra Hydrating, 16 Ounce]] from local Costco wholesale and love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even sure if it has a different scent from the regular one.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the main reason why I switched to Cetaphil from Neutrogena products years ago.</li>
            <li> Many skin care products have historically caused me to develop red irritated areas, even hives.</li>
            <li> recent years, I&#x27;ve used several Cetaphil products created for women and I&#x27;ve always been pleased with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pump is very convenient and delivers just the right amount of wash to cover my entire face.  </li>
            <li> It does a good job and does clean out the pores and makes my face feel clean, but the greasy feeling is something I hate.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Ultimately it leaves my skin feeling clean and not irritated or dry in any way.  </li>
            <li> guess my only minor gripe is that I don&#x27;t love the scent.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out, it rinses easily and the slight fragrance is clean.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a truly fragrance free facial wash, I&#x27;d suggest Olay Foaming Face Wash for Sensitive skin or Cerave Foaming Facial Cleanser, both products I use and really like.</li>
            <li> I am having fewer new blackheads or zits form.</li>
            <li> The face wash itself is a smooth gel similar to the Kiehl&#x27;s Facial Fuel Energizing Face Wash, but at a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li> Exact same ingredient list, exact same masking fragrance (it&#x27;s &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; but it isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34;), does the exact same good job of removing all my makeup at the end of the day, even my heavy black eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin on my face.</li>
            <li> I usually use a moisturizer or lotion but this is more of a soap like substance for cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Since its unscented I&#x27;m not sure what really makes it specific to men, but it is a great clearest none the less.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not extremely strong, and it rinses off easily.</li>
            <li> Cleans without stripping skin of natural oils.  </li>
            <li> It cleaned my face well without drying my skin, but I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m wild about the scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Cetaphil Daily Lotion and Gentle Skin Cleanser for years and jumped at the opportunity to try this product formulated for men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this face wash for about a week</li>
            <li> My husband, who has sensitive skin, loves it.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin on my face.  </li>
            <li> It leaves the skin feeling very clean, and totally oil-free without harsh astringents or burning alcohol.</li>
            <li> It has a smooth texture and is not gritty like some other face wash products I have tried.</li>
            <li> The Daily Face Wash is still gentle by all means, but it&#x27;s also strong enough to get a little deeper than ultra-gentle Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> The scent was somewhat medicinal not masculine but faded fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little sharp for my taste, but I had a couple of male friends smell it, and they liked it.</li>
            <li> It gave me a deep down clean without drying my skin.</li>
            <li> I have used Cetaphil Daily Face Wash for years and like it, so even though I&#x27;m a woman, I decided to give this new men&#x27;s version a try.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Without getting into too much detail, I have some patches of skin on my face that get dry.</li>
            <li> I sometimes use Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser, for normal to oily skin, and this Cetaphil Men Daily Facial Wash is exactly the same.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also gentle enough to use multiple times during the day such as those gym days.</li>
            <li> I have been a regular user of Clearasil&#x27;s Daily Face Wash, but this new wash from Cetaphil might just make me switch.</li>
            <li> single pump of the product should be enough for most situations, so the small bottle should last quite awhile, even with two people using it.</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that the consistency of this product is a bit like runny hair gel and totally clear, so I feel like I might be using more than is needed in the shower as it is hard to tell how much is in your hand.</li>
            <li> Does not dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> Also at this point in time on Amazon, this men&#x27;s version is more expensive per ounce than the regular Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser for normal to oily skin.  </li>
            <li> but i don&#x27;t like harsh cleaners that leave it super dry.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re getting considerably less product in the Men&#x27;s Face Wash product compared to Gentle Skin Cleanser</li>
            <li> The wash gently removes dirt, oil and sweat without leaving my face tight and prepares my face pre-shave.  </li>
            <li> He uses it every other day and his skin is already starting to clear up.</li>
            <li> so it feels like you&#x27;re really washing your face, but it doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling dry, tight, sticky or scummy.  </li>
            <li> A small pea sized amount cleaned my whole face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a everyday user of the normal Cetaphil face wash.</li>
            <li> My husband usually uses plain soap to wash his face, but he says this feels better for his skin - less drying.</li>
            <li> It is especially helpful before you use any type of lotion--if you also use something to moisturize your dry, flaky skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They try to turn us women into suckers by marketing this toward one gender vs the other,  but this is the exact same formula as the regular cetaphil face wash which I have also used.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle, gets your face clean, and I&#x27;ve never felt like it dried me out or left my face dirty at all.</li>
            <li> I generally prefer to keep the perfume level down.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; facial cleansers it lathers in a soap-like way</li>
            <li> This would not work for my wife because her face always get dry, but for my oily skin, this is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my face out like soap does.</li>
            <li> it is not a great choice, but that could just be my skin type of too much use of lotions and moisturizers, it does get my skin feeling clean but at a greasy weird feeling cost.  </li>
            <li> I use Cetaphil Men Daily Face Wash everyday in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Both washes don&#x27;t foam as much as I expected, but I don&#x27;t think that says anything about their efficacy.</li>
            <li> After two weeks of using this, my skin is less dry than it has been (using hand soap).</li>
            <li> A little went a long way here.</li>
            <li> Recommended but also suggest trying Cetaphil&#x27;s other skin cleaning products.</li>
            <li> My soap is usually the last hotel I stayed at, but I&#x27;d consider using this instead on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Based on other reviews, I tried it in the shower before shaving</li>
            <li> I thought it left my very dirty, sweaty face tingly and clean.  </li>
            <li> While I may actually be imagining it, I do at least feel refreshed after using the face wash.  </li>
            <li> Which is a bit odd considering it&#x27;s formulated for men.</li>
            <li> and I had less irritation and a smoother shave after.</li>
            <li> Also, little lather, which after reading the bottle is the point.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it for a few days to see if I noticed a difference</li>
            <li> I certainly don&#x27;t hate the Cetaphil, nor has it, after a few weeks of regular use, seemed to do much for my skin.</li>
            <li> ALL dried out.  </li>
            <li> I usually use a bar of soap.</li>
            <li> and I think (it&#x27;s hard to say)</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t had a negative effect either.</li>
            <li> So I was hesitant to start using a daily face wash again as I&#x27;ve had bad experiences in the past.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough to review skincare stuff because you&#x27;re always inclined to think it&#x27;s helping you and works well</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and hate products that remove all my skin oils and make my skin feel dry.</li>
            <li> I am unsure why they bothered putting a fragrance in since it&#x27;s vaguely medicinal.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong -</li>
            <li> I hate to shave as well.  </li>
            <li> insect repellent -- sort of a citronella scent.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used Cetaphil product before and I do have trust in this brand no doubt about it. I regularly purchase [[ASIN:B00352MHE2 Cetaphil Daily Advance Lotion, Ultra Hydrating, 16 Ounce]] from local Costco wholesale and love it. It has always been my number 1 choice for hydrating skin during winter months. When this [[ASIN:B00UHNZZ4G Cetaphil Men Daily Face Wash, 8 Ounce (Pack of 2)]] was offered for review by Amazon I gladly accepted it knowing that it will be good too since it is made by Cetaphil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to report that this product is a gentle face wash perfect for pre-shaving or just face wash just before going to bed. The mild scent that it has does not bother you. It does not linger for too long and leaves a clean fresh feeling on your skin. The pump is of good design and very convenient which delivers just the right amount of liquid in one or two push to get the job done. The face wash does not lather at all but gently removes dirt, oil and sweat without having a heavy soapy smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used cetaphil for many years at a dermatologist&#x27;s recommendation and always liked the clean feeling. This new formula for men is a welcome addition to the cetaphil line-up. It gave me a deep down clean without drying my skin. Lathered up well. The scent was somewhat medicinal not masculine but faded fast. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband.  I read about the benefits of this brand in a fashion magazine article on recommended products. It said dermatologists recommend it.  Recently, my Mom also heard about this brand from her dermatologist.  She tried the generic version and my husband tried this version.  They were both pleased with the results.  My mom has sensative skin so the fact that she has no allergic reaction to the Cetaphil is big news.  My husband usually uses plain soap to wash his face, but he says this feels better for his skin - less drying. They both recommend.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent facial wash, for men, women, children pretty much anyone despite the name.  It produces a medium lather and leaves one&#x27;s face feeling extremely fresh and clean.  One thing I especially like is that this facial wash is outstanding for pre-shaving, as it has a slight lubricating quality which pairs nicely with whatever shave cream you&#x27;d like to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess my only minor gripe is that I don&#x27;t love the scent.  It&#x27;s not bad for sure, but there&#x27;s a lot of room for improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But...it&#x27;s good stuff.  4 stars as it stands and an improved scent would make it a 5 star product, in my view.</li>
            <li> After two weeks of using this, my skin is less dry than it has been (using hand soap). I use it in the shower and before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know what exactly makes this a MANLY product...I guess that it doesn&#x27;t smell like flowers. That it does still have fragrance keeps my hubby from using it (he&#x27;s actually the one I got it for). I am unsure why they bothered putting a fragrance in since it&#x27;s vaguely medicinal. (that&#x27;s the reason for the 3.5 instead of 4 stars-somewhere between it&#x27;s ok and I like).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I recommend this to guys (and gals) who don&#x27;t want to smell flowery and who don&#x27;t need hypoallergenic face wash.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, this Cetaphil for Men face wash cleaned out my face nicely. I have been using the Aveeno foaming face wash which I really like, but for the money and results, this Cetaphil is incredible. My face felt clean, smooth, and oil free after a quick wash with Cetaphil, which is much more potent than the Aveeno product. This would not work for my wife because her face always get dry, but for my oily skin, this is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will have to switch to the Cetaphil product once I run out of my current brand!</li>
            <li> Cetaphil has become my goto brand and replaces Dove and Neutrogena as the best brand out there. The daily face wash is perfect guys, no scent, comes off easily with no residue and doesn&#x27;t leave a shine.</li>
            <li> I use Cetaphil Men Daily Face Wash everyday in the shower.  The pump is very convenient and delivers just the right amount of wash to cover my entire face.  The face wash itself is a smooth gel similar to the Kiehl&#x27;s Facial Fuel Energizing Face Wash, but at a fraction of the price.  The wash gently removes dirt, oil and sweat without leaving my face tight and prepares my face pre-shave.  I&#x27;ve used Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser for years and now I have the perfect compliment to use on my face.</li>
            <li> An excellent, mild, yet very effective men&#x27;s face wash for daily use. I have been a regular user of Clearasil&#x27;s Daily Face Wash, but this new wash from Cetaphil might just make me switch. It leaves the skin feeling very clean, and totally oil-free without harsh astringents or burning alcohol. My only complaint would be that the consistency of this product is a bit like runny hair gel and totally clear, so I feel like I might be using more than is needed in the shower as it is hard to tell how much is in your hand. I&#x27;m getting used to the fact it doesn&#x27;t lather too, but lather or not, it works very well at clearing the skin. Smells great too. I&#x27;ll be buying more for sure.</li>
            <li> My husband has fallen in love with this facial wash. He uses it every other day and his skin is already starting to clear up. I would recommend this for those that may have blemishes or pimples. It works fast!</li>
            <li> They try to turn us women into suckers by marketing this toward one gender vs the other,  but this is the exact same formula as the regular cetaphil face wash which I have also used.  No scent difference, even.  I recommend to all, even teens.  Cleans without stripping skin of natural oils.  Been using this ever since I got severe hormonal breakouts and my face has evened out well (and my aesthetician complimented me on my skin&#x27;s nice balance at my last facial).</li>
            <li> This face wash works pretty well. I use it instead of soap to wash my face in the shower. It doesn&#x27;t dry my face out like soap does. It is easier to use in the shower, since you do need a good amount of water to wash this stuff off after applying.</li>
            <li> This works just like the regular version (non men&#x27;s). I&#x27;m not even sure if it has a different scent from the regular one. I&#x27;m a everyday user of the normal Cetaphil face wash. My skin tends to get oily through the day but i don&#x27;t like harsh cleaners that leave it super dry. Cetaphil provides a nice gentle clean feeling to my face as a daily face wash. I use it every morning in combination with Proactiv and it&#x27;s been keeping my acne under control. It&#x27;s also gentle enough to use multiple times during the day such as those gym days.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used a lot of Cetaphil skin products but the few I have used have always been great.  It&#x27;s tough to review skincare stuff because you&#x27;re always inclined to think it&#x27;s helping you and works well but in rare cases you know for sure.  While I may actually be imagining it, I do at least feel refreshed after using the face wash.  My skin feels smoother.  I stopped using it for a few days to see if I noticed a difference and I did.  So I give it the highest compliment I can: I think it&#x27;s actually improving my skin!  But I think what I appreciate even more is that the scent is mild.  With all the things we&#x27;re supposed to put on our bodies for our health and odor I generally prefer to keep the perfume level down.  I want to smell like a nice smelling human, not a flower pot.  The face wash DEFINITELY delivers in that department.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the best or or not, but it gets the job done and is plenty good enough for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several weeks. I&#x27;m not a face wash guy, but my wife convinced me to use Purpose Gentle Cleansing Wash. That&#x27;s my only basis for comparison. The Cetaphil doesn&#x27;t feel as good (it&#x27;s a bit slimy/oily). I got over that rather quick. Both washes don&#x27;t foam as much as I expected, but I don&#x27;t think that says anything about their efficacy. It&#x27;s just a psychological thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without getting into too much detail, I have some patches of skin on my face that get dry. Neither face wash &amp;#34;cures&amp;#34; this problem, although I guess it seems to help on the margin. Shaving regularly also seems to help. Why? Don&#x27;t ask me, I&#x27;m not a dermatologist. I do also (again on the wife&#x27;s suggestion) apply a moisturizing lotion (Neutrogena Oil-free) after using a face wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just one data point. I certainly don&#x27;t hate the Cetaphil, nor has it, after a few weeks of regular use, seemed to do much for my skin. It hasn&#x27;t had a negative effect either. As a totally non-scientific observation, my pillow cases seem to be yellowing at slower rate after face washes. From what I read, your skin tends to adjust to conditions. So if you&#x27;re regularly washing away natural oils, it may start producing more natural oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I&#x27;m still a face washing skeptic and Cetaphil has done nothing to change my mind.</li>
            <li> This is the recommended brand from my doctor.  Great for anyone with skin problems.  Says for men but work for anyone.  Leave skin feeling clean and smooth.  Price is also very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I have used Cetaphil Daily Face Wash for years and like it, so even though I&#x27;m a woman, I decided to give this new men&#x27;s version a try. Verdict: It cleaned my face well without drying my skin, but I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m wild about the scent. It&#x27;s a little sharp for my taste, but I had a couple of male friends smell it, and they liked it. One said it reminded him of Off! insect repellent -- sort of a citronella scent. It&#x27;s not extremely strong, and it rinses off easily. I think this is a good product for either gender, but you might want to unscrew the cap and take a whiff before you decide to buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long-time Cetaphil fan. It&#x27;s one of the few brands that uses gentle ingredients which won&#x27;t give your skin a chemical burn or over-dry. Typically I lean more towards the [[ASIN:B00GX8H59C Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser 20oz 2 pack]] which is so gentle you could leave it on your face for hours and it wouldn&#x27;t damage the skin. I sometimes found the Gentle formula to be too gentle, however, and not as effective at removing dirt. The Daily Face Wash is still gentle by all means, but it&#x27;s also strong enough to get a little deeper than ultra-gentle Cetaphil. I also found my face felt more refreshed with this product and still hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only concern is that it still doesn&#x27;t prevent breakouts as well as medicated cleansers. A good compromise is to use a medicated acne wash in the evening and Cetaphil in the morning. This regimen reduces redness while still using some chemicals to fight off break outs. Unless you have flawless skin already, I don&#x27;t think Cetaphil is encompassing enough on its own - but it&#x27;s still a must-have beauty supply. Recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Cetaphil Daily Lotion and Gentle Skin Cleanser for years and jumped at the opportunity to try this product formulated for men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this face wash for about a week I&#x27;m not entirely convinced I&#x27;ll be switching over to this cleanser. My observation compared to regular Cetaphil Skin Cleanser:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;â–º Scent. This face wash definitely has a stronger scent than the regular skin cleanser. Which is a bit odd considering it&#x27;s formulated for men. The scent is nice but definitely on the floral side. It&#x27;s strong enough that the first time I used the wash my wife commented that something I used smelled good. So it is noticeable. Don&#x27;t get me wrong - I don&#x27;t take issue with the smell it&#x27;s just something worth noting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;â–º On oily skin. I have oily skin and hate products that remove all my skin oils and make my skin feel dry. That&#x27;s the main reason why I switched to Cetaphil from Neutrogena products years ago. This face wash seems to strip a bit more oil off than the gentle skin cleanser but definitely not as harsh as other products out there like Oil-Free Acne Wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;â–º Breakouts. I haven&#x27;t had issue with breakouts since using Cetaphil and that&#x27;s still the case with this face wash. So a good thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;â–º Ounces. You&#x27;re getting considerably less product in the Men&#x27;s Face Wash product compared to Gentle Skin Cleanser so the price per ounce is almost double!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I like this product I&#x27;m just not seeing the value added in switching over from Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser. For now the biggest issue with this product is price. Recommended but also suggest trying Cetaphil&#x27;s other skin cleaning products.</li>
            <li> I usually use a bar of soap. Manly man style. That&#x27;s how my face gets washed. Lava, for extra exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured I&#x27;d try this stuff to see how it works. A couple pumps later, a bit of a lather, and I&#x27;m going for it. Washing my face with face wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First impressions: Meh, this smells kind of gross. Would love some scent, especially as I wipe it under my nose. Also, little lather, which after reading the bottle is the point. OK. It pumps well out of the bottle, too, none of this thirty pumps for a drop stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply it. It goes on clean, rinses off clean, and my face feels and looks clean. Great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it keeps my face clean. I&#x27;m in my 30s, so I don&#x27;t worry about acne and stuff. I just want to wash the sweat and dirt away. If it smelled better, I&#x27;d give it five stars. As-is, four stars.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin on my face. Many skin care products have historically caused me to develop red irritated areas, even hives. So I was hesitant to start using a daily face wash again as I&#x27;ve had bad experiences in the past. However, since I was receiving a free review sample I figured that I would try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to report that after two weeks I have not had any problems with facial skin irritation due to this and I think (it&#x27;s hard to say) I am having fewer new blackheads or zits form. I&#x27;m glad I found a face wash for my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will report back here if with longer term use I get any skin senstivity issues.</li>
            <li> I received the Cetaphil for Men Daily Face Wash as a review product. Confession: I am already a Cetaphil customer. Just of regular Cetaphil face wash and not Cetaphil for Men. I&#x27;m 99% sure these are the exact same products with a different label. Anyways, the product itself is the same great facewash I already use. It&#x27;s not unscented, but its just a soapy smell - no actual fragrance. I actually like the scent that is there quite a bit. It&#x27;s gentle, gets your face clean, and I&#x27;ve never felt like it dried me out or left my face dirty at all. I&#x27;ll keep buying it!!</li>
            <li> This is a great, gentle yet thorough facial cleanser.  My husband, who has sensitive skin, loves it.  I&#x27;ve used lots of different facial cleansers over the years (including the regular cetaphil cleanser) and can honestly say this is very, very good.  Unlike other &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; facial cleansers it lathers in a soap-like way so it feels like you&#x27;re really washing your face, but it doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling dry, tight, sticky or scummy.  Just clean and fresh.  Since its unscented I&#x27;m not sure what really makes it specific to men, but it is a great clearest none the less.</li>
            <li> Great item is feeling great this summer</li>
            <li> Cetaphil has been a trusted brand in our home for many years!  I was very happy to try this product and have my son (16) test it as well.  I had to laugh when I saw that he had taken both pump bottles and put one in his shower and one on his vanity.  That has to something!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highlights:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ I love the pump bottles. Easy to dispense with no waste.&lt;br /&gt;~ No extra fragrance floating in these bottles - nothing offensive anyway!&lt;br /&gt;~ Cleans well - opens pores and leaves you feeling refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Great value for the two pump bottles. Prior to this, we were buying the Neutrogena face wash for my son.  I find this comparable!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin on my face.  I hate to shave as well.  I&#x27;ve used a number of face washes over the years and while I like many of the products offered by companies like Neutrogena, Dove, and Nivea, I can say that all of them perform at about the same level (as far as name brands go).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cetaphil Men Daily Face Wash is no different.  It does exactly what it says it does.  It removes dirt, oil, and sweat withouth overly drying the skin.  It has a light fragrance to it that isn&#x27;t too medicinal-smelling and isn&#x27;t overbearing at all.  It doesn&#x27;t create a lot of suds, so if foamy faces are your thing, you&#x27;ll be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately it leaves my skin feeling clean and not irritated or dry in any way.  I recommend Cetaphil to anybody looking for a new face wash that&#x27;s not too smelly and works very well.</li>
            <li> I received one bottle of this product free to try out and review.&lt;br /&gt;In recent years, I&#x27;ve used several Cetaphil products created for women and I&#x27;ve always been pleased with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This handy pump bottle is on the counter in the master bath where both my husband and I can use it.&lt;br /&gt;The Face Wash is easy to dispense and the squat bottle with a wide bottom means you don&#x27;t have to hold it to use it.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out, it rinses easily and the slight fragrance is clean.  In my opinion, it&#x27;s gender neutral.&lt;br /&gt;Our master bath isn&#x27;t large, so it&#x27;s nice to have products out that both of us are comfortable using instead of a large collection of gender specific products.&lt;br /&gt;A single pump of the product should be enough for most situations, so the small bottle should last quite awhile, even with two people using it.</li>
            <li> Good for sensitive skin. Does not dry out your skin. It has a smooth texture and is not gritty like some other face wash products I have tried.</li>
            <li> One week in, my face FEELS better to the touch. I can&#x27;t see any difference, however. I&#x27;ll add more to my review if things change good or bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price seemed reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YES, its a pack of two. 16 total ounces.</li>
            <li> I sometimes use Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser, for normal to oily skin, and this Cetaphil Men Daily Facial Wash is exactly the same.  Exact same ingredient list, exact same masking fragrance (it&#x27;s &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; but it isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34;), does the exact same good job of removing all my makeup at the end of the day, even my heavy black eyeliner.  I&#x27;m going to file this facial wash under &amp;#34;pointlessly gendered product&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really is a good facial wash though, but the masking fragrance (or whatever it&#x27;s trying to mask) has a strong smell that lingers on my skin for several minutes after I wash my face.  It also is more drying to my skin than others.  For those 2 concerns, I docked a star.  Also at this point in time on Amazon, this men&#x27;s version is more expensive per ounce than the regular Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser for normal to oily skin.  The price will likely fluctuate, but before you buy you might want to check the regular kind to see how the price compares, taking care to note the size of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a truly fragrance free facial wash, I&#x27;d suggest Olay Foaming Face Wash for Sensitive skin or Cerave Foaming Facial Cleanser, both products I use and really like.</li>
            <li> My soap is usually the last hotel I stayed at, but I&#x27;d consider using this instead on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was it doesn&#x27;t produce much suds.  I like that.  I don&#x27;t need bubbles to get clean.  A little went a long way here. A small pea sized amount cleaned my whole face.  Based on other reviews, I tried it in the shower before shaving and I had less irritation and a smoother shave after.</li>
            <li> This daily wash for men is a surprising find. It is touted as a &amp;#34;non-drying&amp;#34; face wash that effectively removes dirt and leaves one&#x27;s face feeling clean.  I thought it left my very dirty, sweaty face tingly and clean.  It is especially helpful before you use any type of lotion--if you also use something to moisturize your dry, flaky skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Economical, effective, male-friendly, and &amp;#34;non-drying&amp;#34; are enough for me to want to use this product again and again.</li>
            <li> It is not bad for me, but it seems to make my skin feel greasy after some use, maybe just my skin type?  I usually use a moisturizer or lotion but this is more of a soap like substance for cleaning.  It does a good job and does clean out the pores and makes my face feel clean, but the greasy feeling is something I hate.  I was also hoping it would scrub in easier and not leave any residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all for me it is not a great choice, but that could just be my skin type of too much use of lotions and moisturizers, it does get my skin feeling clean but at a greasy weird feeling cost.  I would not use this again, but for travel and quick washes it is a good choice./</li>
            <li> Unlike the Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser, the Daily Face Wash feels much more like liquid soap and feels like it&#x27;s doing a better job of cleaning my face.  It&#x27;s amazing to feel how clean and dry the surface of my skin feels while not feeling AT ALL dried out.  It really is amazing how effective this stuff is at cleaning only the surface of your skill.</li>
