            <li>I&#x27;ve attached a couple of pictures of this excellent bathroom accessory.</li>
            <li>It looks beautiful on my bathroom wall.  </li>
            <li>I purchased it and I am so happy I did.  </li>
            <li>The lighting is great and could not be happier.</li>
            <li>Good illumination tool.</li>
            <li>This is an amazingly nice, sturdy and attractive lighted mirror.  </li>
            <li>I have loved using it.</li>
            <li>We kept finding this mirror in motel rooms and loved it.  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Easy to install &amp; great to use.</li>
            <li>and I hung it at just the perfect height for me--it has made my life much easier--and</li>
            <li>that it was kind of bulky.</li>
            <li>I used it at a hotel and wanted to have one in my own bathroom.  </li>
            <li>The light nicely and evenly lights up the mirror.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really enjoyed this purchase.  </li>
            <li>The ones I see in hotels have much greater magnification.</li>
            <li>I love the light as well!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this mirror.  </li>
            <li>I have used many through the years</li>
            <li>Love this mirror.  </li>
            <li>I bought an 8 X without the light and it works better to put on makeup.</li>
            <li>It was easy to install (but my husband is handy when it comes to anchoring screws and finding a place in the wall that will provide the right support).</li>
            <li>10 X is to strong for me.  </li>
            <li>Like others, I had used this mirror at a high end hotel and loved it.</li>
            <li>ordered a replacement with a euro (spot) light.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous light for the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>Very worth my money.</li>
            <li>the light isn&#x27;t bright enough and there isn&#x27;t a magnified side.  </li>
            <li>Being able to see your face that close is a real plus as my eye sight is not as it used to be.</li>
            <li>but I loved this one enough to purchase it.</li>
            <li>The light isn&#x27;t enough to use on it&#x27;s own but is great if you have other lighting in the area.  </li>
            <li>This is a very pretty mirror....</li>
            <li>Easy to mount, easy to plug in, easy to push back out of the way.</li>
            <li>Other than it not being as bright as I would like, this product is a great addition to any vanity center or wall.</li>
            <li>Easy to install and used by the whole family.  </li>
            <li>Other wise, mirror was satisfactory, well made, and polished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>--it pulls right up to me</li>
            <li>The price was so reasonable and it came quickly.  </li>
            <li>Nice finish, but the light is not very bright.  </li>
            <li>Has a very high end look to it.</li>
            <li>The cord was thoughtfully designed as a coiled cord, which spares the looks of the bathroom from yet another tangle of extra lengths of electrical cord.  </li>
            <li>the swing out arm &amp; adjustable mirror are just more than I expected.</li>
            <li>The only improvement would be a brighter light.  </li>
            <li>This one is very sturdy and stays where you adjust it to.  </li>
            <li>my makeup application so much faster.  </li>
            <li>I like that it is very sturdy and that it is lighted.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with it and wrote down the brand name and model # and came home and searched online.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I just love having a mirror to put makeup on and do a little tweezing</li>
            <li>Love the product and it showed up earlier than I expected</li>
            <li>It helps me see clearly in putting on makeup.</li>
            <li>There are a lot of these types of mirrors but in my experience they are far too flimsy.  </li>
            <li>The mirror is perfectly ground and polished, as is the chrome plating on the arms and base.</li>
            <li>Halo light not bright enough.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Other than it not being as bright as I would like, this product is a great addition to any vanity center or wall. Good illumination tool.</li>
            <li> Love the product and it showed up earlier than I expected BUT the hardware to attach it to the wall was not included in the box!! Frustrating and annoying!</li>
            <li> Halo light not bright enough. Returned item. Other wise, mirror was satisfactory, well made, and polished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a replacement with a euro (spot) light. It is now installed.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this everyday.  If it seems expensive, realize that it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This is an amazingly nice, sturdy and attractive lighted mirror.  You just mount it to the wall with two screws and plug it in.  The light nicely and evenly lights up the mirror.  The cord was thoughtfully designed as a coiled cord, which spares the looks of the bathroom from yet another tangle of extra lengths of electrical cord.  Perhaps the electric toothbrush manufacturers will take the hint.  The mirror is perfectly ground and polished, as is the chrome plating on the arms and base. I&#x27;ve attached a couple of pictures of this excellent bathroom accessory.</li>
            <li> The wife loves her lighted mirror</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty mirror....heavy &amp; sturdy, not cheap built. It looks beautiful on my bathroom wall.  the swing out arm &amp; adjustable mirror are just more than I expected. The 9.75 frame!!! you can actually see your entire face instead of one eye..ha ha  The only improvement would be a brighter light.  Very worth my money.</li>
            <li> While on a trip recently the hotel I stayed in had this mirror in the bathroom.  I fell in love with it and wrote down the brand name and model # and came home and searched online.  I purchased it and I am so happy I did.  There are a lot of these types of mirrors but in my experience they are far too flimsy.  This one is very sturdy and stays where you adjust it to.  It also hugs the wall well enough when not in use that it is not in the way.  I just love having a mirror to put makeup on and do a little tweezing and I don&#x27;t have to bend over or arch my neck forward to see--it pulls right up to me and I hung it at just the perfect height for me--it has made my life much easier--and my makeup application so much faster.  I have no complaints at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really enjoyed this purchase.  Two downsides...the light isn&#x27;t bright enough and there isn&#x27;t a magnified side.  I remedied this by purchasing a small round magnified mirror that sticks to the front.</li>
            <li> Nice finish, but the light is not very bright.  Also note that the magnification is medium strength.  The ones I see in hotels have much greater magnification.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mirror after seeing one like it in a hotel. I love it! It helps me see clearly in putting on makeup. I love the light as well! I knew what I was getting after using it in the hotel.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this mirror.  Easy to install and used by the whole family.  The lighting is great and could not be happier.</li>
            <li> After seeing this mirror in several hotel rooms I had to have one. Being able to see your face that close is a real plus as my eye sight is not as it used to be. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> 10 X is to strong for me.  I bought an 8 X without the light and it works better to put on makeup.</li>
            <li> I like that it is very sturdy and that it is lighted. I just dont like that it was kind of bulky.</li>
            <li> Like others, I had used this mirror at a high end hotel and loved it. I have used many through the years but I loved this one enough to purchase it. It was easy to install (but my husband is handy when it comes to anchoring screws and finding a place in the wall that will provide the right support). It only took about 10-15 minutes to install. I have loved using it.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous light for the bathroom.  I used it at a hotel and wanted to have one in my own bathroom.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Easy to mount, easy to plug in, easy to push back out of the way.</li>
            <li> We kept finding this mirror in motel rooms and loved it.  So we came home after a trip and ordered it.  The price was so reasonable and it came quickly.  It took about 15 minutes to install.</li>
            <li> Easy to install &amp; great to use.</li>
            <li> mirror on and off button did not work - still trying to find a replacement - send me one.................... will never order from Amazon again. Totally unacceptable to sell merchandise that does not work</li>
            <li> Do not know how I ever applied makeup without it!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this mirror.  Use it every morning to apply makeup.  It did take a couple of days to get used to the 3x magnification though.  Very simple to install if you have a drill.  Waited for my husband to install it but grew impatient and did it myself.  Probably took about 15 minutes.  I was a bit worried that it might be too heavy for the drywall since there were no studs where I wanted to put it, but with the anchors it&#x27;s very stable.  The light isn&#x27;t enough to use on it&#x27;s own but is great if you have other lighting in the area.  It helps in eliminating shadows.  Does not fog.  Has a very high end look to it.</li>
