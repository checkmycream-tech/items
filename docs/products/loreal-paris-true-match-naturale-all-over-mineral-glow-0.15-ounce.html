            <li>Great product at lower price</li>

            <li>However, the brush is very nice and works well.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this makeup!  </li>
            <li>fast shipping very happy customer!</li>
            <li>I did get a nice compliment on it, however, in that my hairdresser remarked on how &amp;#34;sparkly&amp;#34; it was.</li>
            <li>I have used for years and years with no complaints and I am worth it !!!</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised, great price, received in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>Goes on light, lasts forever, and doesn&#x27;t give an orange glow like most bronzers!</li>
            <li>I believe this item may now be discontinued such a shame, great product!!!</li>
            <li>I love this blush and haven&#x27;t been able to find this shade in the store</li>
            <li>It gives my skin a healthy glow</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find more.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!!!</li>
            <li>Great product for a natural looking glow.</li>
            <li>I am usually pretty satisfied with whatever LÓreal products I get</li>
            <li>I transferred the powder to a different container and use my own brush, and that seems to work fine, but what a pain!  </li>
            <li>and I have had random people stop me to ask what kind of foundation I use because it is flawless.  </li>
            <li>and I love this product so much ,.</li>
            <li>i am fair skinned and it gives me a nice subtle bronze glow....</li>
            <li>I have used L&#x27;Oreal Paris Over All Mineral Glow in the past and loved it!  </li>
            <li>This powder also has a sparkle-y component to it which I&#x27;m not crazy about, but seems to go away after a while.</li>
            <li>This is truly worth getting.</li>
            <li>I love these products but could only find them on line.</li>
            <li>Negatives: \\&quot;Nude Glow\\&quot; is more like \\&quot;Embarrassed Nude\\&quot; - very red!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an avid makeup user</li>
            <li>It lasts such a long time and you can make it darker by applying a bit more or keep it light with a sweep of the brush.  </li>
            <li>Positives: creates a matte finish that stays on very well.    </li>
            <li>Wide angle of brush flings more powder to the side than onto face.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>and I really like to try out all of the drugstore brands.</li>
            <li>After use, I tone down the redness with a more neutral powder.</li>
            <li>Just a lovely shimmer to brighten up bland winter skin or to enhance a summer glow.</li>
            <li>Really made my face glow naturally.</li>
            <li>The contents work fine, but the container is a mess.  </li>
            <li>It blends with my actual skin so much</li>
            <li>and I am 73 years old.</li>
            <li>Messy to use, but worth it.</li>

            <li> too shiny, too messy.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Perfect shade!  Love it!</li>
            <li> I love these products but could only find them on line. I bought every Glow I could. I know they will stop making them and I will stretch them over time.</li>
            <li> I believe this item may now be discontinued such a shame, great product!!! Will have to hunt round for an alternative now....</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that the powder had glitter in it. I can&#x27;t use it every day for that reason.</li>
            <li> Positives: creates a matte finish that stays on very well.    Negatives: \\&quot;Nude Glow\\&quot; is more like \\&quot;Embarrassed Nude\\&quot; - very red! The tray where you get powder on the brush is too small for the wide brush, so a lot of powder spills over the sides. Wide angle of brush flings more powder to the side than onto face. I&#x27;ve started using a smaller brush from another powder set.    After use, I tone down the redness with a more neutral powder. I&#x27;m thinking of mixing the two. This powder also has a sparkle-y component to it which I&#x27;m not crazy about, but seems to go away after a while. If you are a fan of Twilight- use a lot of this and you will look like a vampire in daylight!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!!!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied! Exactly as advertised, great price, received in a timely manner. Would definitely recommend this seller!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it to have a sort of glitter in it.  Way too shiny - unless that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re after.  Just wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> This is a great product but it&#x27;s no longer carried in stores. I was over the moon to see it on Amazon! Goes on light, lasts forever, and doesn&#x27;t give an orange glow like most bronzers! Just a lovely shimmer to brighten up bland winter skin or to enhance a summer glow.</li>
            <li> I have used L&#x27;Oreal Paris Over All Mineral Glow in the past and loved it!  It lasts such a long time and you can make it darker by applying a bit more or keep it light with a sweep of the brush.  It lasts all day which is a plus for me.  I set it with a bit of powder when applied.</li>
            <li> I love this blush and haven&#x27;t been able to find this shade in the store</li>
            <li> Great price and I love this product so much ,. Loreal  I have used for years and years with no complaints and I am worth it !!!</li>
            <li> Great  product fast shipping very happy customer!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years! Great product for a natural looking glow.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this product.  too shiny, too messy.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, thank you.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup!  I use the foundation, then the nude glow, then the blush which cost about $10 each.  It gives my skin a healthy glow and I have had random people stop me to ask what kind of foundation I use because it is flawless.  It stays all day and my skin tone and texture has actually improved since I started using it.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> great product...L&#x27;Oreal doesn&#x27;t make this anymore so thankful to find it on amazon!!!  great shade for me...i am fair skinned and it gives me a nice subtle bronze glow....</li>
            <li> The contents work fine, but the container is a mess.  When you shake the powder as you&#x27;re supposed to, some of it gets into the lid of the lower section, but that lid also serves as the handle for the brush, so there&#x27;s powder all over the bottom of it. I transferred the powder to a different container and use my own brush, and that seems to work fine, but what a pain!  Will definitely not buy this one again unless they rethink the packaging.</li>
            <li> Gives my complexion a sparkly glow and I always get compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> This product is great. Really made my face glow naturally.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this product at all. It&#x27;s tough to use and seems darker than I&#x27;d like. I did get a nice compliment on it, however, in that my hairdresser remarked on how &amp;#34;sparkly&amp;#34; it was. I didn&#x27;t know it was sparkly.</li>
            <li> I am usually pretty satisfied with whatever LÓreal products I get and this is no exception! This is truly worth getting.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for several years, had been unable to find it in retail stores. Happy to find it on Amazon. Messy to use, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an avid makeup user and I really like to try out all of the drugstore brands. This product really disappointed me. This is 90% sparkles and 10% minerals. It looked ridiculous on me. However, the brush is very nice and works well.</li>
            <li> Great product at lower price</li>
            <li> Love this product!! I haven&#x27;t been able to find more.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I only need to use a small amount to completely cover my age spots.  It blends with my actual skin so much, you can hardly tell that I have make up on and I am 73 years old.</li>
