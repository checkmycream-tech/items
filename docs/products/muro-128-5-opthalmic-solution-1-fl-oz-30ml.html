            <li>As for price, I paid was too much at the drug store.</li>

            <li>I probably don&#x27;t use this as often as I should, but when I do I notice that my vision becomes more clear almost instantly.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this product for any one who needs it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The drops are soothing in spite of the high salt content.[it is supposed to be salty</li>
            <li>The seller, Dh Medical, which can&#x27;t seem to ship me the right product.</li>
            <li>If you must use this product (doctor&#x27;s order only use) then this 30ml size and price are right for you.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I feel a little tension in my eye, but that&#x27;s far better than the muscle spasms.</li>
            <li>I had been purchasing them from my local pharmacy at a much higher price.  </li>

            <li>It burns for a second when first dropped in the eyes but only for a  moment.  </li>
            <li>I got twice as much for the same price I paid for .5 oz locally.</li>
            <li>For me, the burning and stinging with instillation was the absolute worse I have ever had with any dry eye product and trust me, I have been on many.</li>

            <li>no other similar product.</li>
            <li>It does &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; a little when you first put a drop in your eye</li>
            <li>Could have gotten a bottle twice as large for less money</li>
            <li>Instead of calling in an order to my local Pharmacy, and then waiting for the product to arrive, and then finally driving over to pick it up, this was delivered to my Mail Box just about as fast, and cost me about 15% less (just for the product) -- with only a couple of Key-clicks.  </li>

            <li> These eye drops were recommended to me by my eye doctor due to the Fuchs Dystrophy disease that I have developed in my eyes.  </li>
            <li> but doesn&#x27;t last as long in eye as ointment.</li>
            <li> I have to use these eye drops to treat an eye disease related to dry eye.  </li>
            <li> However, I checked out the cost of such on Amizon and determined that I could get a larger size for less than it cost me to purchase a smaller size at either CVS or Walmart.  </li>
            <li> Have used this ointment for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Same product prescribed by my opthalmologist at about half the price at my local pharmacy.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a terrific deal as opposed to getting it through a pharmacy and which it usually takes several days to get, since they usually only have the ointment.</li>
            <li> My condition requires I use Muro 128 for a very long time and I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I have a long-term dry eye condition.</li>
            <li> Recommend for anyone that experiences dry eyes.</li>
            <li> Husband uses this to treat his chronic dry eyes before bed.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my eye doctor extremely dry eyes.  </li>
            <li> I have corneal edema so the salt solution eyedrops help to dry my eye.</li>
            <li> In store for half the amount they ask for about tthe same price as on here.</li>
            <li> We got double the amount for less.  </li>
            <li> The first time, they sent me totally wrong drops; the second time, they sent me ointment!</li>
            <li> My eye doctor wanted me to use it, Amazon is half the price of my local drug store.</li>
            <li> Larger size bottle is a little easier to handle.</li>
            <li> This product is not readily available locally in the 1 fl oz (30ml) size.  </li>
            <li> Lift closed lid to allow liquid to move to all parts of eye.</li>
            <li> It works just as I expected it would.  </li>
            <li> I do find it difficult to squeeze the tube and get the right amount of ointment in my eye.  </li>
            <li> Yes, that is accurate but the product itself irritated my eyes so bad that it was a waste of money since I only used it about 3 times before I gave up on it.</li>
            <li> Due to a problem with my corna, my doctor recommended use of this product.  </li>
            <li> I checked other drug stores and the price was pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> Thought it was the larger size, received 2 small size bottles.</li>
            <li> Just not right for me I guess.</li>
            <li> Hard to find locally.</li>
            <li> I need to get these for my Aunt, who is in assisted living, and they are hard to find at regular drug stores.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to know what to write to review a Standard, Branded Product.  </li>
            <li> Previous review says Drugstore.com is cheaper</li>
            <li> I bought this product on Amazon because I got it faster, and with less time, effort and cost.  </li>
            <li> Expect a slight burning sensation when the drop hits your eye.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit cheaper from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for quite a few years</li>
            <li> The saline solution stops the pain, sometimes for a few hours, sometimes for a day or so.</li>
            <li> Makes  life less hectic!</li>
            <li> This product stings very slightly, but it works well.</li>
            <li> We checked the usual drug stores and this items runs about $35 for 5 fl oz.  </li>
            <li> my Dr. recommended that I use and this fits his recommendation - this provider was the least expensive for the the same brand and size.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This was a great savings. I got twice as much for the same price I paid for .5 oz locally. I will buy this again. It had a good expiration date of over a year.</li>
            <li> Great product and value. In store for half the amount they ask for about tthe same price as on here.</li>
            <li> A good product, and service was great. Five star rating.</li>
            <li> I have a long-term dry eye condition. Muro 128 works&lt;br /&gt;like no other similar product. I use both the drop and the ointment at night&lt;br /&gt;for a vert effective solution to mu problem.</li>
            <li> I am required to use these products by my doctor and I depend upon Amazon to suoply them quickly and at the best possible price.</li>
            <li> Exact product that I wanted at a good price and prompt shipping! I will order again since it seems I will be using it for my lifetime.</li>
            <li> This makes my eyes sting and tear, but really relives the itching and dryness, so it actually feels really good.</li>
            <li> My product was received quickly.  I really appreciate the good service and always order my Muro 128 5% eyedrops from Amazon.com.  Thank you for providing this product.....saves me a trip to the pharmacy!</li>
            <li> I have used Muro 128 5% for several years for a corneal problem - under physician&#x27;s care.  This is the best price I have ever found and will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> This is something I was told to get by my eye doctor. Amazon has the cheapest prices for this product.  [...]</li>
            <li> We checked the usual drug stores and this items runs about $35 for 5 fl oz.  We got double the amount for less.  My husband has to use these drops 3x a day and this is quite a savings.</li>
            <li> Best product on the market for corneal erosion condition.  Use it every day.  There is no other product more effective than this one.</li>
            <li> Due to a problem with my corna, my doctor recommended use of this product.  I purchased it initially from CVS. However, I checked out the cost of such on Amizon and determined that I could get a larger size for less than it cost me to purchase a smaller size at either CVS or Walmart.  I am saving a great deal of money.</li>
            <li> Product was the same as found in my drug store but priced well below the drug store price. Product is exactly as it claims to be.</li>
            <li> Works very well for me for the eye condition I have.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for any one who needs it.</li>
            <li> These eye drops were recommended to me by my eye doctor due to the Fuchs Dystrophy disease that I have developed in my eyes.  I have been using these drops for several years.  Recommend for anyone that experiences dry eyes.</li>
            <li> These drops were recommended by my ophthalmologist, so I assume they&#x27;re fine. My problem? The seller, Dh Medical, which can&#x27;t seem to ship me the right product. The first time, they sent me totally wrong drops; the second time, they sent me ointment! Phone response is laggard, in spite of a stated 24 hour turnaround time. The company also takes weeks to respond to email. Avoid this vendor!</li>
            <li> Prescribed by my doctor one drop on my right eye and it  helps a lot with my vision to reduce corneal dryness and also has a soothing effect.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my wife who uses it regularly.  This product is not readily available locally in the 1 fl oz (30ml) size.  Amazon&#x27;s price is also very competitive.  The cost of the15ml size locally is about the same as the 30ml size from Amazon.  Great product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> 1oz of this product is extremly cost effective over the smaller sizes in the store. My condition requires I use Muro 128 for a very long time and I will be buying again. Perfect in every way.....Thanks</li>
            <li> As with others here, my doctor recommended daily use of Muro 128 to combat the relentless progression of Fuchs dystrophy.  I use drops during the day and ointment at night.  Much cheaper on line and arrived quickly.      How do they get away with charging so much for salt water?    I am almost out of drops and have plenty of ointment, so it would be nice to have the package include more drops.</li>
            <li> Threes drops were recommended by my opthamalogist.  I had been purchasing them from my local pharmacy at a much higher price.  This is a great value and I was able to purchase a larger size.  I will definitely order again when I need more.</li>
            <li> Dr told me to use one drop in each eye every night at bedtime.  Not pleasant, but not too bad, and maybe it will hold off the swelling in the cornea.</li>
            <li> Kindle fraud purchase</li>
            <li> This does the job it should. 20 years ago I had my cornea burst. After it was healed I was told that MURO 128 would stop that from happening. It has prevented it since then.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for eyes.  I have an eye disease, Fuch&#x27;s Corneal Dystrophy, and this product has kept it at bay for several years now.</li>
            <li> I use rhis on my surgeons orders daily.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Hard to find locally. Husband uses this to treat his chronic dry eyes before bed. He used to wake up in pain in the middle of the night. This helps me sleep without problem.</li>
            <li> I use this for my dog.  she has a chronic eye condition.  The bottle is easy to squeeze and all others I have bought are too difficult.&lt;br /&gt;I trust the Bausch and Lomb name and I trust Amazon.  So it has worked out well.</li>
            <li> My eye doctor suggested that I start using this as I have corneal dystrophy and I think it is really helping a lot! Would cost much more to purchase this in the drug store!!</li>
            <li> Works well. Received in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> I use the Muro solution for a genetic Eye disease. Amazon has the best price that I&#x27;ve found anywhere. Previous review says Drugstore.com is cheaper so I checked it out and their price is $28.99.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for quite a few years but I decided to switch from a national drug store for purchase to Amazon when I realized there was such a dollar difference in the price.  In this day and time I try to watch where I spend our money.  The product - no matter where you get it is great.  It burns for a second when first dropped in the eyes but only for a  moment.  I didn&#x27;t realize that &amp;#34;dry eyes&amp;#34; caused bad vision but when my eye Dr. gave me a sample to try and I saw the difference - well, I knew what I had to do.  So, if you are troubled with dry eyes, try this product.  I&#x27;ve recommended it to my bridge friends and they feel the same way.  Good luck.  Pat M</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended it for my condition corneal spasm.  I was seeing blurry and even double.  Thanks to the medication I am holding back an operation/. When I take it , I can see better.  The only disadvantage that I can observe is that I have take it 4 times daily. and it doesn&#x27;t &#x27;damage the eyes.</li>
            <li> My doctor suggested that I buy this on Amazon because it is so much cheaper there than at a drug store.  Yes, that is accurate but the product itself irritated my eyes so bad that it was a waste of money since I only used it about 3 times before I gave up on it.</li>
            <li> I need to get these for my Aunt, who is in assisted living, and they are hard to find at regular drug stores.  My only complaint is that it&#x27;s not on the Prime program for free shipping.</li>
            <li> I have to use these eye drops to treat an eye disease related to dry eye.  It is an excellent product, and it arrives within day.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see without it.  But it&#x27;s quite a price to pay for salt water.  When I was young gold was $32 an ounce.  That&#x27;s about what I used to pay for this at the pharmacy.  It&#x27;s a little bit cheaper from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years for Fuch&#x27;s Distrophy.  Most days it helps with vision.  Good price from this vendor and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years and it works well  except for fact that tip clogs I need to use needle to unclog. This usually happens when  bottle is half used and can be difficult to use  remainder  of solution. Last time I unclogged tip the  cap flipped off and I lost the solution .</li>
            <li> My Eye Doctor prescribed Muro 128 over a year ago. It is helping my cornea disease. I was buying it at Walmart Pharmacy but they often did not stock it. I checked other drug stores and the price was pretty expensive. I checked Amazon and found that I could get two bottles for what I was paying at Walmart. Ships fast and saves me money. What is not to like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years to get rid of the excess moisture on my cornea caused by Fuch&#x27;s dystrophy.  Buying it this way was a good find for me as I&#x27;ve been paying almost as much for .5 ounce at the drug store as I paid for this full 1 ounce.  It is not generic.  Not telling anyone to go buy it and use it without your eye doctor telling you it&#x27;s ok to do so.  It does &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; a little when you first put a drop in your eye but that&#x27;s the saline solution.  After a cornea transplant my doctor has me using it 4 times a day.</li>
            <li> This product came recommended to me by many people with dry eyes. For me, the burning and stinging with instillation was the absolute worse I have ever had with any dry eye product and trust me, I have been on many. Just not right for me I guess.</li>
            <li> So much less expensive than the drug store. And that is if you can find it there. Makes  life less hectic!</li>
            <li> Dollar-wise it&#x27;s a terrific deal as opposed to getting it through a pharmacy and which it usually takes several days to get, since they usually only have the ointment.</li>
            <li> the doctor recommended it and it helps my sight. I like to find bargains and found this available on Amazon</li>
            <li> my doctor recommended this for an eye condition that i have  I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years  it has helped me</li>
            <li> I always come back to Muro but do use generics as well. I find this help keep my eye from causing problems when used daily.</li>
            <li> I probably don&#x27;t use this as often as I should, but when I do I notice that my vision becomes more clear almost instantly.  It really helps in the morning.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my eye doctor extremely dry eyes.  Great price for the product, much cheaper than when purchased at lthe ocal pharmacy</li>
            <li> my Dr. recommended that I use and this fits his recommendation - this provider was the least expensive for the the same brand and size.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to know what to write to review a Standard, Branded Product.  You already know how it works, but there is something to be said for the method used to get it (in this case) into the Medicine Cabinet.  I bought this product on Amazon because I got it faster, and with less time, effort and cost.  Instead of calling in an order to my local Pharmacy, and then waiting for the product to arrive, and then finally driving over to pick it up, this was delivered to my Mail Box just about as fast, and cost me about 15% less (just for the product) -- with only a couple of Key-clicks.  I can&#x27;t think of a better, easier, cheaper way to make a satisfactory transaction. So, that&#x27;s how I plan to do it in the future.</li>
            <li> This is better, in many ways, than the prescription drops that the doctor prescribed. My cornea was &amp;#34;traumatized&amp;#34; during cataract surgery, so after a while it starts to hurt. The prescription drops stop the pain for a day or two, but they also cause muscle spasms - cramps, headaches, etc. The saline solution stops the pain, sometimes for a few hours, sometimes for a day or so. Sometimes I feel a little tension in my eye, but that&#x27;s far better than the muscle spasms. I&#x27;ve had this body for 72 years, so sometimes I know more about what it needs than the doctors. Together we can figure things out.</li>
            <li> Have used this ointment for a long time.  I do find it difficult to squeeze the tube and get the right amount of ointment in my eye.  It could be the size is small and hard to hold on to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;mom mom</li>
            <li> I also use the ointment, but don&#x27;t like the greasy eyelid that is so hard to remove. This product stings very slightly, but it works well.</li>
            <li> Muro is something I must apply daily, 3 times a day.  I can not say enough about how grateful I am that  the seller offers this product at the price they do.  Thank you.  If you must use this product (doctor&#x27;s order only use) then this 30ml size and price are right for you.</li>
            <li> does and excellent job when applied 4x a day.  Apply to eye and keep lid closed for several minutes for best effect.  Lift closed lid to allow liquid to move to all parts of eye.</li>
            <li> My eye doctor wanted me to use it, Amazon is half the price of my local drug store. I like to buy local but don&#x27;t have the funds to always do that</li>
            <li> Wonderful product but doesn&#x27;t last as long in eye as ointment. Still it travels well and will do work as intended.</li>
            <li> Best price I can find on this product</li>
            <li> This was a good buy. It was better than I expected&#x27; I have used Muro&lt;br /&gt;for a long time. Price is right.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended this after I started having a soreness in one of my eyes after surgery. He advised me it was good for a temporary relief. I used the product four times days and the result has been excellent. Expect a slight burning sensation when the drop hits your eye. that sensation  will quickly disappear. As for price, I paid was too much at the drug store. Could have gotten a bottle twice as large for less money had I gone to Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have corneal edema so the salt solution eyedrops help to dry my eye. Living here in the Florida Swamp this has become a necessity&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> Have used Moro 128 for at least 20 years, after my ophthamologist recommended it. Remarkably soothing when my eyes feel irritated, especially after intense reading or working on computer. Much better for the eyes than the cheap drops that are highly advertised and not habit-forming like those other.</li>
            <li> Good product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Good price and adequate delivery time</li>
            <li> Same product prescribed by my opthalmologist at about half the price at my local pharmacy.  Will recmmend to my friends.</li>
            <li> I have Corneal Edema. Muro 128 brings instant relief. I keep bottles everywhere, in all my purses, at my bedside, in my car, in my suitcase, in my gym bag, everywhere. This is the best price I have found. In Walgreens and CVS this is what I pay for 1/2 the size.</li>
            <li> It helps my wife&#x27;e eye problems (Fuch&#x27;s Syndrome). It is much cheaper than buying it at the local drug store.</li>
            <li> I have been taking these drops for awhile now.  I got a really good price &amp; it came on time.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> Thought it was the larger size, received 2 small size bottles. Larger size bottle is a little easier to handle.</li>
            <li> I like this brand because I trust the quality of their products.  There is nothing similar on the market that comes close in quality--as far as I know.  The drops are soothing in spite of the high salt content.[it is supposed to be salty, that is its point].</li>
            <li> My Eye doctor requires me to use this solution to treat a corneal irregularity.  It has worked effectively and the Amazon price is $5 less than Walmart</li>
            <li> It is so much cheaper buying these online and since they are an ongoing need doing it this way will save us a lot of money.</li>
            <li> This item was recommended by my optometrist.  It works just as I expected it would.  I would recommend this to anyone experiencing the same problems</li>
