            <li>I Love all Jan Marini products!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not a good direction, Jan Marini.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I was so glad to get it on Amazon at a great price.  </li>
            <li>love this stuff!</li>
            <li>My own fault for trying to save a buck.</li>
            <li>This products is Incredible and Completely cleared up my acne!!!!</li>
            <li>If the price is too good to be true.....</li>
            <li>I love using this product recommended to me by my Esthetician.</li>
            <li>Love this product...</li>
            <li>Love love love Jan Marini, this is the single best product out there if you are still having problems with your skin after the forties.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the best products I have ever used that not only clears up acne but also helps reduce fine lines.  </li>
            <li>It also helps smooth fine lines.</li>
            <li>Honestly didn&#x27;t really help or do anything with my acne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cream for years and don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do if if were no longer available.  </li>
            <li>I have used the product in the pas and always liked it but will be looking for a new face care line.</li>
            <li>and I have a full bottle of BioGlycolic.</li>
            <li>It may sting when you first put it on, but that sensation goes away quickly.  </li>
            <li>I am on my 30&#x27;s and no one had ever guessed my age right.</li>
            <li>It stings at first and then it fades.  </li>
            <li>It really makes my face smooth and younger looking.</li>
            <li>and it cost way too much</li>
            <li>I ordered this product from amazon because it was much cheaper than the price I pay at the salon.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended product!</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>It is a little lighter coverage, but I&#x27;m liking it better.</li>
            <li>worth 5 stars, if you keep the dye out of it and fix the packaging and set the pricing back to what it was before, and I will restate the review here to reflect the modifications.</li>
            <li>I feel like I waste more than with a pump dispenser.</li>
            <li>New packaging?</li>
            <li>clear has really helped my adult acne.</li>
            <li>Somehow after I turned 35 year old</li>
            <li>The consistency is different, and does not cause a &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34; sensation the way the real product should.</li>
            <li>say:  Bring back reasonable packaging with 2oz</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for someone who has sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I use this at night and it keeps my skin soft and clear and I don&#x27;t look my age at all.</li>
            <li>Major design flaw there!</li>
            <li>I love the product, but the dispenser design is not good.  </li>
            <li>When my skin is sensitive, then I can only apply at night.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> where you can&#x27;t get to the last 25-30% of it because of the hard plastic bottle with very tiny opening -- no squeezing... and the new replacement is $28 for 1oz..</li>
            <li> I bought it after reading some of the reviews for it in other websites, and though it uses up faster than cream based moisturizer I feel a difference on my skin.</li>

            <li> But.. same terrible packaging..</li>
            <li> Every time I buy this product I have an issue with pump, it doesn&#x27;t work, or it is difficult to use.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> love this stuff! works so well</li>
            <li> Honestly didn&#x27;t really help or do anything with my acne.</li>
            <li> Somehow after I turned 35 year old I started having breakouts again!  This is one of the best products I have ever used that not only clears up acne but also helps reduce fine lines.  I am never w/o this product and I was so glad to get it on Amazon at a great price.  The items arrived in a timely manner and in tact.  There was no issues and I would use the seller again for my next purchase.</li>
            <li> I Love all Jan Marini products!!</li>
            <li> I bought it after reading some of the reviews for it in other websites, and though it uses up faster than cream based moisturizer I feel a difference on my skin. It tightens a little bit w/ tingly feeling after application. I am on my 30&#x27;s and no one had ever guessed my age right.</li>
            <li> Sent night cream not what is shown.</li>
            <li> I wish this product came in a squeeze bottle.  This is a wonderful product.  You pay a fortune for it and the bottle doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said,  bio clear has really helped my adult acne. I use one pump in the morning and one in the evening.</li>
            <li> i did not the lotion and it cost way too much and the bottle was falling apart before i can finish it</li>
            <li> I ordered this product from amazon because it was much cheaper than the price I pay at the salon. However,  this product is a knock-off and not an official Jan Marini product. The consistency is different, and does not cause a &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34; sensation the way the real product should. My own fault for trying to save a buck. If the price is too good to be true.....</li>
            <li> This is the replacement for Jan Marini&#x27;s Bioglycolic Acne Gel II with similar ingredients:  The Bioglycolic Bioclear Lotion has the same 2% Salicylic Acid, takes away the blue dye from the Acne Gell, adds a small amount of glycolic acid (smaller than 2% since the ingredients list in reverse order for quantity and the Salicylic is first).  But.. same terrible packaging.. where you can&#x27;t get to the last 25-30% of it because of the hard plastic bottle with very tiny opening -- no squeezing... and the new replacement is $28 for 1oz.. instead of $41 for 2oz.  IE a 36% increase in pricing just for changing everything up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a good direction, Jan Marini.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say:  Bring back reasonable packaging with 2oz so we can access the product fully, keep away the blue dye, and bring back the  2 oz/60 ml for $41.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth 5 stars, if you keep the dye out of it and fix the packaging and set the pricing back to what it was before, and I will restate the review here to reflect the modifications.</li>
            <li> I started using the cream about two years ago.  When my skin is sensitive, then I can only apply at night.  It stings at first and then it fades.  I like the bottle for cleanliness over the cream jar.  It is a little lighter coverage, but I&#x27;m liking it better.</li>
            <li> I love using this product recommended to me by my Esthetician. It really makes my face smooth and younger looking. It does help prevent future breakouts on my face. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot and they are not greasy on the face. I just wish they have a bigger size bottle. I would recommend this for someone who has sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Fights any and all breakouts.  Burns when you apply, but eventually it does stop.  My pores seemed smaller, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This products is Incredible and Completely cleared up my acne!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for years and don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do if if were no longer available.  I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I love the product, but the dispenser design is not good.  Every time I buy this product I have an issue with pump, it doesn&#x27;t work, or it is difficult to use.  Major design flaw there!</li>
            <li> New packaging? The product does not pump out of the bottle and I have a full bottle of BioGlycolic. The packaging does not allow the user to unscrew or uncap. I have used the product in the pas and always liked it but will be looking for a new face care line.</li>
            <li> Love this product... Keeps me from having breakouts.  I&#x27;m not a fan of the dropper... I feel like I waste more than with a pump dispenser.</li>
            <li> I use this at night and it keeps my skin soft and clear and I don&#x27;t look my age at all.</li>
            <li> Love love love Jan Marini, this is the single best product out there if you are still having problems with your skin after the forties.  I have use it for 15+ years.</li>
            <li> Within one day of using this product your skin instantly starts improving.  It may sting when you first put it on, but that sensation goes away quickly.  It also helps smooth fine lines. Highly recommended product!</li>
