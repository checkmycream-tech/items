            <li>Thanks for great service.   </li>
            <li>I love this product and wish.</li>
            <li>Besides being a excellent skin care product, the second reason for buying it is as a treatment for poison ivy.</li>
            <li>I love this purifying freshener because it gets rid of any dirt leftover after you cleanse and helps get rid of those greasy spots.</li>
            <li>Love this product,but won&#x27;t pay more than 10bucks for it.</li>
            <li>I am just not terribly fond of the scent.  </li>
            <li>products that smell better than this.</li>
            <li>amazes me that after I&#x27;ve washed my face, showered, i can still wipe my face with this on a cotton ball and find more dirt.</li>
            <li>I was glad to see that Mary Kay was offered.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product, and I highly recommend it for those with oily/combination skin.</li>
            <li>Makes me feel really REALLY clean!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over 25 years and was glad it was available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Very mild.</li>
            <li>I have used Mary Kay products for more than 20 years and have always found them to be just right for my skin type.</li>
            <li>Because my skin is a lot better off after I have used the purifying freshener - it looks far more radiant and almost glows.</li>
            <li>This arrived sooner than expected in the mail and in great condition.</li>
            <li>I love Mary Kay products on a whole.</li>
            <li>I hope to purchase more in the future from this vendor if available.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s in her 70&#x27;s and has kept her skin looking young and healthy.</li>
            <li>so you feel it working, but not too strong for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I like them very much.  </li>
            <li>new, still in original container and was shipped in ample time.  </li>
            <li>It is strong enough</li>
            <li>I have tried other products in the past, but this is the best.</li>
            <li>My husband is very susceptible to poison ivy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>As always the quality is consistently high and it meets the needs of my skin.  </li>
            <li>The new replacement does not work at all.  </li>
            <li>Seems to work just fine, and it costs a lot less.</li>
            <li>Not harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, Mary Kay has discontinued this - they have replaced it with a paltry spray-one freshener that you have to keep spraying the cottonball with to get any kind of moisture.  </li>
            <li>so I can tone, right before leaving, and after I get to work and the toner has dried, I can then apply the moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The only problem I have is, I&#x27;m always so busy in the morning, I don&#x27;t always have time to use this toner because I&#x27;d have to put it on, let it dry, then apply my moisturizer.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I have always liked this product.  I ordered this for years, then all of a sudden I couldn&#x27;t get it from my Mary Kay rep.  So I looked it up to see if I could get it from Amazon, and I was glad I could.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 30 years.  Has always worked great for my skin.  The new replacement does not work at all.  But I&#x27;ll be darn if I will pay almost $60.00 for a bottle of this products when I used to pay $11.50.</li>
            <li> Received the Mary Kay product that I was looking for....new, still in original container and was shipped in ample time.  Thanks for great service.   L. Barker</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. Not harsh on the skin. Very mild. Removes dirt. I love Mary Kay products on a whole. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> It has always been a great product.  It is a shame they no longer manufacture the product and have replaced it.</li>
            <li> I love this product and wish.</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be a bit on the oily side.  It&#x27;s fantastic for keeping skin in great condition.  I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great used before. Hard to find discontinued by Mary Kay and the replacement product does not work for me at all.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 25 years now.  I don&#x27;t care for the current-day Mary Kay Basic Skin Care products.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for 20 years. I was very disappointed and angry to learn that Mary Kay has discontinued it! I am very pleased to have found this product on Amazon. Besides being a excellent skin care product, the second reason for buying it is as a treatment for poison ivy. My husband is very susceptible to poison ivy and he uses this product for healing any breakouts. Has for years. He swears by it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Mary Kay has discontinued this - they have replaced it with a paltry spray-one freshener that you have to keep spraying the cottonball with to get any kind of moisture.  In my opinion, the replacement for this is the worst Mary Kay product ever.</li>
            <li> Been using this for 10 years. Sad to see them discontinue it and I&#x27;ll have to find another product like it because it has tripled in cost since they stopped making it.</li>
            <li> I love this purifying freshener because it gets rid of any dirt leftover after you cleanse and helps get rid of those greasy spots.</li>
            <li> Need more!!!!!!!!! It still is the best &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; formula EVER made. Thank you Amazon for having Diane novelties on ur page. Always checking for GREAT deals. I LOVE AMAZON.COM!!!!!👍👍👍👍👍</li>
            <li> Mary Kay&#x27;s Purifying Freshener, Formula 2, is designed for people with combination/oily skin, like myself (I have had problems in the past with an oily T-zone). It tones the skin, making it tingle, and balances the skin to keep blemishes at bay, without drying it out. It is strong enough so you feel it working, but not too strong for my sensitive skin. The only problem I have is, I&#x27;m always so busy in the morning, I don&#x27;t always have time to use this toner because I&#x27;d have to put it on, let it dry, then apply my moisturizer. So all too often I skip this step. But I think what I&#x27;ll start doing is carrying my moisturizer in my purse so I can tone, right before leaving, and after I get to work and the toner has dried, I can then apply the moisturizer. Because my skin is a lot better off after I have used the purifying freshener - it looks far more radiant and almost glows. Plus, it keeps the blemishes away.     This is a great product, and I highly recommend it for those with oily/combination skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product,but won&#x27;t pay more than 10bucks for it.</li>
            <li> Since when is this product $40? I&#x27;ve always paid no more than $18.  It&#x27;s a great product, but I won&#x27;t pay $40 for it, no.</li>
            <li> I guess my wife likes it.  She wanted it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and nothing else works well with my skin type as this does.  I use it sparingly as it is difficult to obtain now, but I will continue to use it for as long as I can purchase it.</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t react to it, which is a tough thing to accomplish anyhow.  I am just not terribly fond of the scent.  I&#x27;ve used other &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; products that smell better than this.</li>
            <li> Great freshner- just what I have been looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere, but found it here and very happy&lt;br /&gt;about it!!!!</li>
            <li> Very good purifying freshener. Makes face feel great! Have used for over 15 years. Would not use anything else. Great!</li>
            <li> I have used Mary Kay products for more than 20 years and have always found them to be just right for my skin type.</li>
            <li> This arrived sooner than expected in the mail and in great condition. I have been using this product for over 25 years and was glad it was available on Amazon.  I hope to purchase more in the future from this vendor if available. I have tried other products in the past, but this is the best.</li>
            <li> amazes me that after I&#x27;ve washed my face, showered, i can still wipe my face with this on a cotton ball and find more dirt. Makes me feel really REALLY clean!</li>
            <li> I received a substitute product - not the one that was advertised that I thought I was purchasing.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my mom.  She&#x27;s been a long time Mary Kay user.  She&#x27;s in her 70&#x27;s and has kept her skin looking young and healthy.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t pay $40 plus shipping costs on this item. It was one of my favorite Mary Kay products and I&#x27;m extremely disappointed that they discontinued it. I used it for over 30 years. The replacement products does not work as well. I hope someone from Mary Kay sees these reviews and reconsiders the production of this product. I&#x27;ve resorted to using an over the counter freshener. Seems to work just fine, and it costs a lot less. Good luck on selling at this price.</li>
            <li> Freshner doesn&#x27;t dry skin. Works great  In Concert with cleansers and moisturizers. Mary Kay doesn&#x27;t disappoint. Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I use Mary Kay products. I like them very much.  I was glad to see that Mary Kay was offered.  The product came very fast and this product is hard to get from Mary Kay.</li>
            <li> Mary Kay&#x27;s freshener is the best.  As always the quality is consistently high and it meets the needs of my skin.  What would we do without Mary Kay?</li>
