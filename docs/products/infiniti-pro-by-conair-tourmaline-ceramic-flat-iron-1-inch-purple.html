            <li>Conair Infiniti Pro straightener is amazing!</li>
            <li>this is absolutely amazing !</li>
            <li>Love them works great on course hair !</li>
            <li>Very happy with my purchase and the price :)</li>
            <li>Yesterday, I decided to take a trip to Target for laundry detergent and there award winning Rice Crispy treats at the cafe, (Delicious)</li>
            <li>Loving it!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok not the best</li>
            <li>i love it so much !!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>This is perfect and did a great job getting my hair smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>Received very quickly and awesome product</li>
            <li>The iron heats up very quickly is easy to handle and straightens the hair perfectly.</li>
            <li>and the Argan oil is amazing and smells wonderful. :-)</li>
            <li>and I take good care of it otherwise.</li>
            <li>So I must say it does a good job.</li>
            <li>It straightens hair really good, but it takes forever to curl with.  </li>
            <li>I guess you get what you pay for this is a good value</li>
            <li>I loved this iron.</li>
            <li>I had a friend who said she had one like this and loved it.</li>
            <li>It does as good a job as the one my hair dresser uses, but cost a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>It works really good..</li>
            <li>I use a good amount of product for thermal protection and product creates smoke when it heats up.</li>
            <li>well maybe the straightener isn&#x27;t good</li>
            <li>Its good value for the cost</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good quality straightener at an affordable price.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and the product information and thought I would go ahead and get this one because the price was fair.</li>
            <li>Also, it is good for all hair types.</li>
            <li>loved</li>
            <li>it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;its really good for the price!&lt;br /&gt;better</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a good straightener and a good value</li>
            <li>my hair looks good without burning my hands.</li>
            <li>The mist smells good and it does not leave your hair sticky.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Overall,still a good straightner.</li>
            <li>and I loved it.</li>
            <li>it is a good value.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t going to be GOOD for my hair</li>
            <li>It is works good.</li>
            <li>It gives good shine to hair.</li>
            <li>I loved it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved Conair, and this iron lives up to its reputation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved both of them, but could not justify another $100 on a straightener.  </li>
            <li>I am very impressed with this straightener because it works a lot better than most of the others I have tried.</li>
            <li>It is also safe and has a great tip to use on the end.</li>
            <li>Love them works great, had them for about a month now</li>

            <li>It makes my hair look so smooth, and does a great job straigtening it.</li>
            <li>I works amazingly.</li>
            <li>and I have not used my CHI since then, because THIS straightener is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing</li>
            <li>, for they helped me when making my decision of purchasing this amazing product.</li>
            <li>Worked AMAZINGLY.</li>
            <li>Heats up nicely ...</li>
            <li>(I also own a Conair Mini Pro hair dryer that</li>
            <li>The curls come out nice.</li>
            <li>I liked the oil that came with it, my hair was shiny and bouncy.</li>
            <li>With Amazon Prime, I had my own within one day.  </li>
            <li>I often don&#x27;t even blow-dry my hair, but I really liked this device.</li>
            <li>My daughters both liked the way my hair looked.</li>
            <li>IT DOES GET KIND</li>
            <li>OF WARM</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s superb because I&#x27;m a frugal person (haha).</li>
            <li>But it warms up perfectly and fast.</li>
            <li>My hair stayed straight and shiny perfectly all day.  </li>
            <li>It also made nice glossy defined curls.  </li>
            <li>I have medium textured hair and this straightened it nicely with a shine.</li>
            <li>Arrived very promptly, excellent product at a fraction of the cost!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!!</li>
            <li>and I can take one pass with this iron and its straight as an arrow, and with the help of alil heat therapy spray it looks great all day!!!</li>
            <li>A friend was staying with me and she straightened my hair as well as taught me how to use this to give it a nice flip.</li>
            <li>Maybe a glove for the teens and for curling would be nice.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;floating&amp;#34; plates are a nice touch</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t believe how well this tool works.</li>
            <li>The cord also swivels, which is a nice feature that I wish my own iron had.  </li>
            <li>I also liked the oil that came with it.</li>
            <li>Also, a locking clip for the blades would be nice.</li>
            <li>I guess I was kind of hoping for a miracle straightener, though.</li>
            <li>This was spontaneous.</li>
            <li>It does the job and is effective.  </li>
            <li>Great flat iron, best one I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>perfectly these are great pear of flat irons</li>
            <li>One of the best features is it has a heat setting so you can lower the heat instead of just high heat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very impressed with what can be done now that I&#x27;m trying a new, all-one-length hair style.</li>
            <li>This one works great, and is quick.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and works great.  </li>
            <li>a while, I was surprise how good and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Heats up very very quickly wich is good for a college student in a rush in the mornings.</li>
            <li>After ordering this product it came in the mail after 3 days which was great since I did the super saver shipping.</li>
            <li>The heat setting options are good for fine curly frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>Very good for my medium length very wavy hair.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s well made, it doesn&#x27;t snag my fine hair and because of the heat control settings, doesn&#x27;t burn it either - yah for not having breakage!</li>
            <li>Came in on time, Very comfortable and sleek to use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a Chi before and that was always very smooth when I ran it through my hair.</li>
            <li>The plates are very smooth and they do not grab my hair at all.  </li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly which is nice</li>
            <li>Works great, heats up super quick, and never leaves a piece unstraightened!</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and gives my hair (which is very fine) and great curl or straightening.  </li>
            <li>Pretty awesome right?</li>
            <li>and I hadnt been able to brush the strays out, so they were all coming out at once.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure *</li>
            <li>They were able to get my 4c hair to straighten without any damage.</li>
            <li>I LOVE CONAIR</li>
            <li>THAT I ABSOLUTLY LOVE</li>
            <li>but she likes it better than her existing curling iron.</li>
            <li>So glad I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably return it since I could do a better job with a brush and a blow dryer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad my house didn&#x27;t burn</li>
            <li>One daughter has hair that gets damaged by too much heat, and she was happy with the heat levels on this appliance.</li>
            <li>tourmaline plates makes nice smooth hair without any frizzies, and the smoothness of it means it glides through hair without burning.</li>
            <li>According to my hairdresser it&#x27;s actually better to use a hotter iron (</li>
            <li>within reason - use the correct heat for your hair type) because you won&#x27;t have to go over the hair as many times which can be more damaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I returned the \\&quot;Remmington\\&quot; brand to the store and switched for this, totally better.</li>
            <li>-- some may want to be able to do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li>the oil is jus there to make it look even more healthy.</li>
            <li>They work better on longer hair.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so light!</li>
            <li>While I probably should be using the low or medium setting, I find the best results with the medium or medium-high.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes me about 10 minutes to get through most of the hair on my head with this iron.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t expect it to be any better.</li>
            <li>I bought this mostly because it said it would help fight the effects of humidity.  </li>
            <li>Very happy with it especially at this price.  </li>
            <li>I kept telling him that I needed some more for work</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought many before</li>
            <li>I have been using another straightener for many years now</li>
            <li>IS VERY INEXPENSIVE AND A GREAT DEAL.HOPE THIS HELPS.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a great product and recommend it to anyone who wants to have one on hand for hairstyling.</li>
            <li>This straightener is better than the $150 straightener that broke on me after 6 months.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend to anyone who doesn&#x27;t like bulky straighteners and for those who like being able to set the heat for your hair.</li>
            <li>I love all of Conair products.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s OKAY</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love the ease of this iron.</li>
            <li>Love this straightener</li>
            <li>I really love this straightener -</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love the color.  </li>
            <li>(Plus, I love purple.)  </li>
            <li>It is a great price and works very well.</li>
            <li>and Im glad I deceided to try this.</li>
            <li>Love love love this iron</li>
            <li>I had to run the Conair through my hair more times than I ran the Chi through my hair to straighten it.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know whether this straightener is more damaging than say...</li>
            <li>Heats up real quick.</li>
            <li>I bought 2 more of these for my family.</li>
            <li>this product is ok.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>My hair  feels healthy too.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned so many straighteners before and they lasted longer and performed even better than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was because of our hair type that it wouldn&#x27;t work on that well or what.</li>
            <li>I love it .</li>
            <li>I love to curl my ends too.</li>
            <li>I love the 1&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I like the fact that this iron heats up to 455 degrees, instead of the 350 degrees that most cheaper models go up to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought better straighteners in my life.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>It works ok</li>
            <li>but I was expecting more based on the reviews.  </li>
            <li>I have used others that work better for this purpose</li>
            <li>I LOVE conair products i also have there curler which is also pretty amazing!</li>
            <li>I find it better</li>
            <li>Great product for a really reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It took me a while to realized the more</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it does a better job than my Remington</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t hold it from the top -</li>
            <li>I love the thinness and the color.</li>
            <li>They use the Infiniti Pro more often than I can keep track</li>
            <li>Works better than my CHI which i paid over $100.00 for.</li>
            <li>Love the way it leaves my hair shinny.</li>
            <li>It heats up really fast and does a great job straightening and curling my hair.  </li>
            <li>The iron surface is better than any iron I have used.</li>
            <li>PLEASED</li>
            <li>, none of which have been more than $40, has had floating plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like this better than the Chi I had.</li>
            <li>glad I got this one.</li>
            <li>It was cheaper but does a great job getting straight hair without burning.</li>
            <li>and I just love it.</li>
            <li>and frankly I think this may work a bit better at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great bang for your buck!</li>
            <li>Like I said, in my opinion it works better than my friend&#x27;s CHI</li>
            <li>I have tried many straighteners on my wavy hair.</li>
            <li>Would definately buy more and suggest to friends too.</li>
            <li>Is a cute purple color.</li>
            <li>Cute but not too girly.</li>
            <li>OK</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely satisfied and it even straightens my biracial daughters&#x27; hair without a problem. :)</li>
            <li>Love this iron.</li>
            <li>straight lol</li>
            <li>Better than the Sutra and Chi</li>

            <li>Love it, love it</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I just love the iron.</li>
            <li>device, however, addresses most of the problems.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I&#x27;m quite pleased.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I&#x27;m quite pleased.</li>
            <li>, I read so many</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I really love this iron.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t bought one at a store like Fred Meyer or Target in many years.</li>
            <li>I am very impressed especially for the price.</li>
            <li>This iron is okay.  </li>
            <li>Not my favorite straightener.</li>
            <li>I love it is...</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>My mom used it when she was in for a visit and fell in love with it, too.  </li>
            <li>I am overall very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>If you walk away from it and forget you may find your counter top on fire or melted.  </li>
            <li>Better yet have a timer set for &#x27;x&#x27; number of minutes.  </li>
            <li>I think it works better than my CHI ever did.  </li>
            <li>5 Stars! :)</li>
            <li>It has both ceramic and tourmaline which is best for most flat iron qualities.</li>
            <li>The best flat iron I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li>Best flat iron ever.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seriously, I am genuinely impressed with this flat iron.</li>
            <li>This product is the best flat iron i&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li>One Of The Best Flat Irons I&#x27;ve Ever Had.</li>
            <li>One of the best flat irons in the world.</li>
            <li>This flat Iron is great!</li>
            <li>These flat itons smooths the hair from root to end perfectly.  </li>
            <li>One of the best flat iron I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used in my life.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>On the good side, this one is better in the sense that my hair seems sleeker and it works very fast.</li>
            <li>They rave about how soft and silky their hair feels and it truly looks beautiful, and</li>
            <li>the reviews were pretty good.  </li>
            <li>than that it seems to be of good value at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>Pretty good product.</li>
            <li>Love it heats fast and works great, smooth shiny hair just jot</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly, does a nice job on my hair.</li>
            <li>You will burn your fingers by just touching the hair, which is an easy fix for me because I use a comb to hold the hair.</li>
            <li>cause you can return it easily and maybe get better luck than me.</li>
            <li>It gets hot very quickly, which is good, but it felt like it ripped out some of my hair out when I used it.</li>
            <li>Walmart wanted $50 for this where I live, I just love Amazon!!</li>
            <li>It is light and easy to hold, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>I was amazed that after washing and conditioning (with Silicon Mix) I was able to run a quick pass of the Conair Iron through the client&#x27;s hair and end up with silk!</li>
            <li>Smooth gliding, and hair feels really healthy after using.  </li>
            <li>I loved it so much I ordered one for myself.</li>
            <li>I loved it, kept my hair straight &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and quick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased to say that although this new Conair doesn&#x27;t surpass the performance of my Remington, it&#x27;s about as good and has a somewhat cheaper list price as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this so much!!!  </li>
            <li>This flat iron has them on the side &amp; I have yet to accidentally turn it off or change the temp; very good design.</li>
            <li>When I first bought this iron a month ago, for $40, I really loved it and how smooth, frizz free and shiny it made my hair.  </li>
            <li>Although not the exact one my daughter requested it looks like it may be better than she wanted!</li>
            <li>, I will admit that it does heat up very quickly.</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly (about 15-20 seconds) and the temperature stays even while she&#x27;s using it.</li>
            <li>the hair doesnt stick on the iron, it glides easily, creating wonderfull curls just as a curling iron would do.</li>
            <li>The cord is on a swivel, so it&#x27;s easy to use on either side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>EASY TO HANDLE.</li>
            <li>Easy grip.</li>
            <li>Use it on mens hair and it is easy.</li>
            <li>I have used cheap ones and the $100 salon kinds and honestly this one is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It also heats up very quickly and has a lot of heat options.</li>
            <li>and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I love that it is light weight so that my arm and wrist are comfortable while straightening.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and I can adjust the heat.</li>
            <li>I like the size as it allows you to easily straighten a chunk of hair and then twist to curl up the ends a bit.</li>
            <li>the&lt;br /&gt;product looks great and the service was wonderful sadly</li>
            <li>It did straighten my hair although it didn&#x27;t glide easily</li>
            <li>, I have really strong hair</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good flatiron.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice product very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Ok for this price it is amazing, it really does the job tremendously well!</li>
            <li>It has the option to get super hot, which is good for my course hair.</li>
            <li>The ceramic plates would not heat and I found that my mini-conair travel straightener was working better then this full sized straightener.</li>
            <li>Gets nice and hot and straightens well</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m happy to report that both girls love this flat iron!  </li>
            <li>It is really good to curl your hair, specially if you have a strong hair it is really powerfull.</li>
            <li>The lightness of the iron, along with the swivel cord, makes it very easy for my 11 year old to use to straighten her own</li>
            <li>This is the best flat iron and the price is just right.</li>
            <li>but it works perfectly fine</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that needs just a touch with a straightener.</li>
            <li>I like the precise heat settings and it does get nice and hot, though I&#x27;ve never burned my hands or hair.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length, fine hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Hispanic, I have fine curly hair and have used this a couple of times now to try to give it a chance.</li>
            <li>The product is fine.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just fine with one time .</li>
            <li>I would not recommend it if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li>FWIW, I won&#x27;t be using it on my hair either because it&#x27;s just too fine--</li>
            <li>I have fine, color treated hair</li>
            <li>Light weight and easy to work with</li>
            <li>It gets hot fast and does a great job if if I&#x27;m straightening or flipping my hair under.</li>
            <li>I also like that it heats up so quickly -- like many of us</li>
            <li>Many heat settings and it heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li>i cant really describe how much I LOVE this straightener!</li>
            <li>Once again, my hair came out perfectly as it did the first time I used a Chi flat iron</li>
            <li>I love the temperature control, and the tourmaline technolgy made my hair very light and straight.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this hot iron!  </li>
            <li>This heats up fast and the multiple heat settings are perfect for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>It works very good on natural curly to straight.  </li>
            <li>This is a great Flat iron, I would strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This was an excellent purchase, smoothes nicely and really does heat up and cool down as quickly as it claims!</li>
            <li>keeps my hair smooth all</li>
            <li>no grease &amp; made my hair shiny &amp; smooth.  </li>
            <li>and I really liked it, but I decided to try something different and purchase the Conair Infiniti Pro, because it had such wonderful reviews.</li>
            <li>It has a light that tells you when it is to its desired temperature, but the temperature is done by a 1-30 scale</li>
            <li>but this was an afterhours rush purchase after doing some research on what was available at the time.</li>
            <li>It gets out all the frizz and keeps it smooth all day.</li>
            <li>Had worked great until last night and now just won&#x27;t stay on.  </li>
            <li>I was using a cheap brand &amp; it was just not preforming like</li>
            <li>I ordered this product last week because of all the great reviews about it.</li>
            <li>I have gotten a lot of compliments on how nice my hair looks straight.</li>
            <li>The power light was on, but never heated.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First, this iron is light.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic straightener.  </li>
            <li>and when I passed my hands through my hair my hand would be filled with bits of my hair.</li>
            <li>Overall it is a great buy at an affordable price.</li>
            <li>cheap price, but does it job.&lt;br</li>
            <li>hair, and after one pass, the heating light is blinking again.</li>
            <li>shiny, smooth hair.</li>
            <li>No snagging or pulling the hair, makes it smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>The purple on top melts and make my hands colorful.</li>
            <li>It does have an indicator light to let you know when it&#x27;s up to temperature.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely worth every centand I paid about $15 more than what it is listed for here.</li>
            <li>If you use it in the bathroom, leave the light on or fan if you decide to walk away.  </li>
            <li>I actually tried it on my mother&#x27;s hair and it worked great.</li>
            <li>My hair comes out smooth, shiny and not frizzy at all.  </li>
            <li>It heats up super fast (15 secs, as described), it gets plenty hot, and it has some great features for the cash.</li>
            <li>, I guess I was just expecting some kind of miracle that would make my hair super straight in one swipe-- a miracle that I guess hasn&#x27;t been invented yet!</li>
            <li>It is perfect for providing the flat shiny look, or it creates fantastic curls that really hold up.</li>
            <li>Heats right up and hair is smooth!</li>
            <li>when it comes to straighteners, you might as well shell out some more money if you&#x27;re looking for a good quality flat iron because you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>I just love this flat iron, was a good deal.</li>
            <li>OK so iI had a flat iron I loved and it lasted about 3 years and just stopped working yesterday,</li>
            <li>this actually works better than the CHI and saved me about $80!!</li>
            <li>, I am in a rush in the morning as I prepare for work and not having to wait longer than 15 seconds for my flat iron is great.  </li>
            <li>This flat iron is great.  </li>
            <li>This pulls my hair out, I am experienced at flat ironing.</li>
            <li>Really great flat iron.  </li>
            <li>Another great feature is the cord which attaches to the flat iron pivots so it does not get tangled when straightening or when storing.</li>
            <li>Works great for a flat iron in this price range.</li>
            <li>this flat iron works great</li>
            <li>This is a great flat iron.  </li>
            <li>This is a great flat iron!</li>
            <li>The grip is easy to hang on to and the iron straightens or curls quickly.</li>
            <li>Beautiful, soft, perfectly straight hair.</li>
            <li>It heats quickly and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Regardless, the Infiniti does a nice job without the argan oil (which, in this formulation, barely contains any argan oil at all--it&#x27;s mostly chemicals).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, does an excellent job and makes a great replacement for a Chi, mall kiosk flat iron or any other higher priced option.</li>
            <li>i made sure i read the reviews first before purchasing it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any significant damage after using it twice in three days.</li>
            <li>MORE LIKE HOT ROLLERS.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this out...</li>
            <li>Okay thoughs of you saying it gets too hot.......</li>
            <li>, I feel like this is an excellent flat iron for the price, and it would especially be a good tool for pre-teens due to its light weight, cool-touch outside, and the results acheived.  </li>

            <li>My favorite thing about this iron is how fast it heats up!</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure</li>
            <li>I love the adjustable settings and don&#x27;t require this to be on the higher settings in order to straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li>Was not the one I originally wanted but</li>
            <li>It has adjustable temperature settings and heats up super quick!</li>
            <li>I bought this iron, originally, six months ago.</li>
            <li>My daughter is able to handle this iron much better than some of our others which weigh more, and don&#x27;t stay cool on the outside..  </li>
            <li>My daughter is able to handle this iron much better than some of our others which weigh more, and don&#x27;t stay cool on the outside.</li>
            <li>Love love love this flat iron &#x27;</li>
            <li>iron is quite large with a very smooth iron surface.</li>
            <li>But it is not too ideal for long hair and it gets way too hot for my liking.</li>
            <li>I just finished straightening my hair and my hair is now super smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>Best flat iron I&#x27;ve tried BY FAR!</li>
            <li>It is light weight and heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li>So far I like this product better than most that I have used.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the longer iron style it really does make a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Good heat settings, feels comfortable in your hand, and I especially like the auto shut off.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 30, and I&#x27;ve never been able to straighten my hair on my own (not for lack of trying the last 15 years).  </li>
            <li>and I mostly wanted this for a smooth straight look.</li>
            <li>/&gt;By far the best feature of this flat iron is the auto shut off.</li>
            <li>, I get it done fast and its super easy!</li>
            <li>I love it so much that I&#x27;ve increased my original 4 star rating to 5 stars</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>My hair stylist told me to ditch it right away!</li>
            <li>Overall great price and very pleased with Conair Infiniti Pro line Ceramic Flat Iron.</li>
            <li>It worked perfectly the first few months but stopped working after that.</li>
            <li>Great for hair that needs minimal straightening as well as on fluffier hair that needs taming.</li>
            <li>The product did well, for the first few days, I was impressed.</li>
            <li>The overall quality is fair but it feels too light to make me confident that it will last more than a year or two.  </li>
            <li>It is the fastest I have experienced (about 15 sec).  </li>
            <li>It heats up as fast as it said it would and the heat settings are pretty effective.</li>
            <li>Its true.</li>
            <li>With winter heat blasting, my hair can get static and this really helps keep it sleek.</li>
            <li>This iron gets hot fast, and does a pretty good job of straightening.</li>
            <li>It even stays straight for a week (if i don&#x27;t work out and sweat it out :).</li>
            <li>Love it and highly recommend !</li>
            <li>I love these , they make my hair bone straight</li>
            <li>I feel like this product isn&#x27;t true Conair Infinity Pro.  </li>
            <li>I love these so much</li>
            <li>I really did love it.</li>
            <li>The plates of this iron are so smooth and it glides right through my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair that tends to get frizzy - this iron works great at straightening my hair...takes a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>I usually burn my head, but somehow the dainty (but powerful) iron shape has kept me burn free.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine that someone needing a flat iron wouldn&#x27;t be delighted with either one</li>
            <li>It doesnt leave ur fair flat</li>
            <li>fair majority of flat irons have a shut off timer built into them.  </li>
            <li>This flat iron is nice and compact and does heat up VERY quickly.</li>
            <li>The second best feature is the 15 second heat up.</li>
            <li>It heats up super quickly, and the heat setting can be adjusted.</li>
            <li>and I love how soft and smooth it makes my hair.  </li>
            <li>Also, the iron is purple - as a purple-lover, I love having something I use on a regular basis in my favorite color.  </li>
            <li>It does not heat up in the 15 seconds as advertised, but I timed it and it was still a quick minute.</li>
            <li>It literally heats up in 15 seconds and cools quickly when done as well.</li>
            <li>It does heat up super quick.</li>
            <li>but it does an adequate job.  </li>
            <li>This is a very well priced straightener, especially considering how compact it is and how great it works.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s super curly.</li>
            <li>Love it, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Iron gets very hot quickly and has given me the results I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I just used my new straightener for the first time and my hair looks amazing.</li>
            <li>Went swimming, which fries my hair ever more so than normal.</li>
            <li>I have really coarse wavy hair and this flat iron is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>This is next best thing to salon grade flat iron.</li>
            <li>I think this is a great ceramic flat iron that works very well for the price.  </li>
            <li>Heats quickly, very hot setting.</li>
            <li>Smooth, hot but doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned 2 other straightening irons and this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>This flat iron is the next best thing to my salon&#x27;s iron.</li>
            <li>I have purchased several Flat Irons and this has been the best.  </li>
            <li>Feels great and works great on my hair my only complaint is that it seems like as soon as I run it through my hair</li>
            <li>This is definitely  the best flat iron I have ever used!</li>
            <li>Not only is this straightener nice to look at with its sleek lines and pretty shade of purple, it&#x27;s also easy to use.</li>
            <li>Unlike other straighteners, this one is perfect for getting your hair silky straight without doing as much damage to it.</li>
            <li>Soooo I&#x27;m new to writing my own reviews, but very fond of reading others; and I must say, this flat iron is possibly -the- best.</li>
            <li>I really love my new straightener.</li>
            <li>Recommended if you want a cool looking flat iron that gets very hot, very quickly. :)</li>
            <li>It heats fast and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>An older and cheaper Conair model that I used to own actually worked better.</li>
            <li>It is very resistant and easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>My hair is wavy/curly and I&#x27;m able to straighten my whole head within 10-15 minutes depending on how OCD I&#x27;m being that day - haha!</li>
            <li>Overall, the Inifiniti Pro is a pretty good ceramic hair straightener.</li>
            <li>It perhaps does not last as long as it should but for the time that it lasts it is absolutely wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I had low expectations of this straightner, but my received one as a gift and we both love it!  </li>
            <li>This iron is HOT!</li>
            <li>and I would like to know exactly what degree that is, not just a number 1-30!</li>
            <li>It is ceramic, and it gets hot!</li>
            <li>but overall, i love!</li>
            <li>Some years later, my neighbor told me she bought a new straightener from Walmart that had great reviews on Amazon</li>
            <li>The flat iron gets really hot and straightens my hair really good</li>
            <li>This flat iron ripped out a good chunk of my hair the first time I used it - the plates have some sort of gap at the ends/edges and they caught my hair as I was sliding it through.</li>
            <li>Came in a timely matter good flat irons but they do not get as hot as they say they do</li>
            <li>This seems to be a great little tool.</li>
            <li>It leaves hair with a great shine if you apply a little bit of the argon oil before blow drying.</li>
            <li>Best flat iron I have used in a long time!</li>
            <li>Well I tried it last night and it was amazing.  </li>
            <li>It heats up fast and leaves my hair feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I had remained shiny, smooth, and straight for 3 days (at the time of this writing)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight and straightens very well.</li>
            <li>This iron gives the hair a really straight smooth and shiny finish.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so smooth and stays straight for days.</li>
            <li>now is only one and the result are amazing everybody is asking me about my hair.</li>
            <li>and I have never been able to get her natural hair smooth and straight.</li>
            <li>I got the Infiniti Pro by Conair flat iron at Target today and I already love it!</li>
            <li>product proves that sometimes hype is for real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>This one is more light weight (not cheap feeling though) and designed better to straighten as well as add some wave if desired.  </li>
            <li>I def got my dollars worth ($10.00)</li>
            <li>I ordered this after reading the reviews and seeing more good than negative.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thin, sleek, and works perfect.</li>
            <li>Seems to hold hair better than my old one which illiminates the need to hold the tip while turning iron.</li>
            <li>I find that I can get a better curl out of this than my old Chi straightener.</li>
            <li>I ended up replacing this a year later because it was catching my hair a lot and didn&#x27;t hold up well.</li>
            <li>Went to get my own the next day!  </li>
            <li>They work better than my old ones.</li>
            <li>Plus, from the point where I started to warm it up to \\&quot;all done!\\&quot; must have been only 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This iron is amazing--- stick straight results that are soft and not frizzy.  </li>
            <li>far as how it works, there is nothing outstanding about it.  </li>
            <li>I have curly hair, not thin or thick, but this iron gets the job done and was a great price!</li>
            <li>much better than my old Chi</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be fair, a flat iron isn&#x27;t called to do much when confronted with my hair.</li>
            <li>Even better then CHI and other top irons.</li>
            <li>HOT QUICK HAS SETTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR EACH HAIR TYPE.</li>
            <li>Gets super hot be cautious</li>
            <li>The handle does seem to get super hot which is a pain.</li>
            <li>for results, I was able to quickly straighten my fine hair, and my hair remained reasonably straight throughout the day, even though it was raining outside.  </li>
            <li>This is great because if I&#x27;m an active and forget it, it wouldn&#x27;t cost me much for my electric bill, etc.</li>
            <li>the super super straight, sleek, shiny look</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly and can be somewhat unruly to straighten but this was quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>This flat iron is amazing.</li>
            <li>Maybe for the price range its good compared to other hair irons.</li>
            <li>If you have the money, go to folica&#x27;s website (where i bought mine) and get a good Sedu or other brand...</li>
            <li>but the price was right.</li>
            <li>The size is just right, you can do bangs or any area with no problem.</li>
            <li>This product was cheap and brand new!</li>
            <li>It made my hair shiny, smooth and straight the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>I usually only buy hot &amp; gold products but these conairs are amazing</li>
            <li>still technically have some hair, so I gave it three stars for that, and because it&#x27;s a really pretty gadget with nice features on it.</li>
            <li>Love the high heat, quick warm up and automatic shut off (things that were missing in the $100 one I bought a year ago).</li>
            <li>I like that there are so many different heat settings and that there is a light that indicates when the straightener is ready for you to use.</li>
            <li>It barely takes more time than brushing.</li>
            <li>But, if you aren&#x27;t the best at using flat irons to curl, feather, etc., expect to see those flat iron lines on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  3 months later, I&#x27;ve grown to LOVE this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great price and it works just as well if not better than the chi</li>
            <li>I have not tried the Argan Oil that comes with it yet, but I used Garnier Fructis Sleek &amp; Shine Flat Iron Protector Straightening Mist with argan oil (less than $5.00) and it was a perfect combination.</li>
            <li>it started out as a great straightener but stopped functioning properly after only a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, this heats up super fast.</li>
            <li>The product delivers on its promise that it heats up quickly and is ready for use in no time.</li>
            <li>Heats up super fast.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and is very well designed.</li>
            <li>I had blow-dried my hair straight and took the straightener to it just to get out the mild kinks.  </li>
            <li>My daughter is just starting to straighten her own hair, and with this iron she does not have to worry as much about burning herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>SOO straight  and silky soft i love it.</li>
            <li>Heats up super fast.</li>
            <li>I use a heat setting of 10 (out of 30) and it gets my hair super straight.</li>
            <li>Hair glides naturally and easily.</li>
            <li>Also the power button is so sensitive on the handle and get turned off quite easily.</li>
            <li>Other than that, the Conair is an excellent flat iron and comes with a five-year warranty as opposed to Remington&#x27;s four-year (both are very generous).</li>
            <li>Best little flat iron for the money.</li>
            <li>This flat iron does wonders I fell in love the first time I used it and not pricey at all!</li>
            <li>The heat up time is super speedy fast, and it gets extremely hot.</li>
            <li>they really make my hair super straight and shinny!</li>
            <li>- I use them mainly to style and shape my already straight, fine</li>
            <li>It came very fast in the mail</li>
            <li>It heats up very fast.  </li>
            <li>It heats up very fast.</li>
            <li>The plates are smooth and aren&#x27;t rough on my hair like my last one.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for sure :)</li>
            <li>THIS IS A GREAT FLAT IRON I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT .IT GETS</li>
            <li>The flat iron heats fast, has a nice swivel cord.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to hold and use for a long period of time.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to buy a new one since they didn&#x27;t have the original one</li>
            <li>I would much rather spend a little more and get a better iron.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an excellent price when compared to other high quality flat irons.  </li>
            <li>It does get really hot</li>
            <li>I figured I&#x27;d give it one more chance with the Aragan oil in and nope, still kept doing the same thing.</li>
            <li>Also, somehow the hot plate of the Conair touched my face or part of my ear twice in the week</li>
            <li>pretty easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than that one flaw I love this thing!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a time saver!  </li>
            <li>It definitely helps with humidity and my hair is much more manageable than it was before.  </li>
            <li>and he was willing to purchase them for me</li>
            <li>Used them for the first time and</li>
            <li>OMG!...instant silky hair on my most coarse haired client.</li>
            <li>It makes for a pretty set up in my styling suite.</li>
            <li>Stays hot for an hour before it automatically shuts off.</li>
            <li>But a month later, the plates on the side of my iron have came off, where its not purple any more and its exposing hot metal.  </li>
            <li>Hair burns at 411 degrees fahrenheit, this goes higher.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on my first straightener</li>
            <li>If you do not hold it in just the right place, you will burn your hand as a large portion of the iron gets hot on the handle.  </li>
            <li>It also frizzed up more than when I used a Chi, which left it smoother.</li>
            <li>For a glorious two months, I found that my hair never looked so straight, shiny, healthy - and it stayed that way for days - barely any touch ups</li>
            <li>reason this straightener works so well is because it gets SO HOT.</li>
            <li>She says I gave myself a \\&quot;heat haircut\\&quot; ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the chi straighteners that claim to have heat-protecting qualities, or if I was just using this one too hot.</li>
            <li>Heats up SO fast, 15 seconds!</li>
            <li>Straight!</li>
            <li>Straight Hair!</li>
            <li>It flashes until it is hot.  </li>
            <li>carefully it comes out really nice.</li>
            <li>Purchased this iron and was pleased with it, but two weeks later it stopped heating up.  </li>
            <li>It is not expensive, but it just does not straighten my hair that well.</li>
            <li>I know this sounds pretty cliche&#x27; but this straightener is...</li>
            <li>I first became aware of this rather spendy condiment in specialty food stores but never bought it because of the price.</li>
            <li>I sparingly use a leave-in conditioner called Hydro Milk that I love; my stylist introduced it to me some years back</li>
            <li>I bought this because it&#x27;s the exact straightener I had that died on me.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair that is fairly coarse and frizzy on the top layer.  </li>
            <li>The heat is consistent and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.  </li>
            <li>Please bring more back in.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t love it enough to replace it.</li>
            <li>and it has done pretty well.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it has so many different settings that allow you to use it on a variety of hair types.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight and a pretty purple color.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an inexpensive gift and is comparable with higher priced products like &amp;#34;Chi&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I told them that I had not yet used the hair iron because the first thing I did was check to make sure the plates were aligned properly (otherwise it will pull out hair).  </li>
            <li>Fast Shipping!  </li>
            <li>I use the iron on \\&quot;25\\&quot;, which is hot, but doesn&#x27;t fry my hair.</li>
            <li>and it gets really hot.</li>
            <li>pretty</li>
            <li>Thanks Conair!</li>
            <li>Works exactly like the Babyliss Nano Titanium</li>
            <li>It still straightens my hair just as good as the one that killed my hair.</li>
            <li>It is very hot (and has heat controls) and has a nice tight grip without damaging your hair.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased many flat irons at a MUCH higher price.</li>
            <li>It fits easily in the hand and slides smoothly and easily through my hair (which is quite thick).  </li>
            <li>Super Straight, Super Hot, Super Flat and Very shiny Hair!</li>
            <li>So then I finish opening the box and take the flat iron out to see: the top part of the case is not attached to the rest of the iron.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve shopped and bought more flat irons than I care to admit.  </li>
            <li>This flat iron is okay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a flat iron on my hair for many years.  </li>
            <li>Fits my hand better than any flat iron that I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to replace too many Chi flat irons to ever buy another.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these flat irons.</li>
            <li>I researched flat irons as my daughter wanted a top name brand</li>
            <li>Love these flat irons.  </li>
            <li>I love this flat iron and it works so well on my frizzy, curly, chemically colored hair.</li>
            <li>Love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>Love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>Love this flat iron and so do my friends...</li>
            <li>After years of using Remington flat irons, I purchased the Conair Infiniti Pro because I have been so pleased with their hairdryer.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t of asked for a better flat iron</li>
            <li>armed with this Conair flat iron, I&#x27;m tempted to do it more</li>
            <li>Love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>I thought maybe silky smooth straight hair just wasn&#x27;t in the cards for me unless I went to the salon because somehow they always managed to make my hair look straight, flat, and fabulous.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s stylish, and as good as any much more expensive flat irons.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this flat iron!</li>
            <li>Just love it flat iorn!</li>
            <li>The package arrived earlier than expected which was great</li>
            <li>and I feel that I don&#x27;t get my hair as straight as when I used my normal pinch of hair which doesn&#x27;t cover the full plate.</li>
            <li>I am an African American with fairly course hair</li>
            <li>I swipe the flat iron through my (straight, fine!)</li>
            <li>Love this flat iron!!</li>
            <li>It heated up fairly quickly and straightened my hair, however, it always left my hair frizzy even when I used special products like [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Heats up very fast and straightens very well.</li>
            <li>and I have heard nothing but positive comments from the three of them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another positive is the 5 year warranty.  </li>
            <li>Based on all the positive reviews here</li>
            <li>However, the first time I used it, it fried the ends of my hair and made the rest of my hair very brittle.</li>
            <li>It heats up hot and fast and glides through your hair like silk.</li>
            <li>The purple color is cute without being too girly, and the cord is plenty long for any outlet-to-mirror distance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also love how long the ceramic planks are.</li>
            <li>I would probably not go higher than 400 degrees because it can really fry your ends.</li>
            <li>This product gets hot fast.  </li>
            <li>This product really does get hot.</li>
            <li>I promised I would treat myself to this Iron very soon because my weave clients keep demanding straight!</li>
            <li>Gets really hot and worked really well.</li>
            <li>but it still is pretty fast</li>
            <li>I also like that the plates are long so that I can do more hair at once.  </li>
            <li>Gets hot fast.</li>
            <li>Iron area is longer than what I&#x27;m use to, and the whole area where irons are gets too hot to touch; but I am getting use to it.</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant at first cause</li>
            <li>I also love how long the plates are.</li>
            <li>This is just as good as the Chi, if not better.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of cowlicks and wave, but it did a fairly good job of defeating most of those, or at least the ones on the outside of my hair.  </li>
            <li>This iron works as good, if not better than the ones you get in salons.</li>
            <li>The temperature setting guide tells you what temperature range for your hair type: low 1-8 for fine hair to maximum 26-30 for very resistant hair (their words!).  </li>
            <li>It leaves less static after each use and heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>I find this flat iron a waste of my money honestly , i have curly hair, this flat iron burned my hair a lot and did not create that healthy shine i was looking for, it probably works better for people with straight hair, but it did not work so well with me.</li>
            <li>My old iron had them right on the top of the grip &amp; I was constantly turning it off or changing the temp by accident.  </li>
            <li>This flat iron is very good for such a low price, and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product if you need a flat iron with true ceramic plates that wont break the bank and are better than other advertised so called #1 products.</li>
            <li>When I was reviewing straighteners, I found this one in the top 5 next to the high end, $100.00 brands...</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron!!!!</li>
            <li>, I haven&#x27;t used it on my hair, because mine is super short and very, very straight!</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly, gets far hotter than my CHI, and I can do my hair a lot faster with the Conair.</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly and recovers lost heat equally well.  </li>
            <li>works fabulous to create curls that last the whole day as well !</li>
            <li>I guess with the stellar reviews I expected more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve previously only owned more expensive straighteners (Chi, corioliss) - and I found that this very inexpensive one was MORE effective at straightening my hair.</li>
            <li>Certainly I know this</li>
            <li>I then run my fingers through the section I had just curled (burned) and large chunks of hair fall out.  </li>
            <li>this certainly does not reach 455 degrees....</li>
            <li>Overall, this is my new favorite toy</li>
            <li>This makes me happy because I&#x27;m a low maintenance type of person so the less time I need to spend on my hair</li>
            <li>This is the first cheap flat iron I have bought, and I will never buy one again.</li>
            <li>I have only tried it at a lower heat (10-15) because I don&#x27;t want to burn my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It was in my frugalista opinion a pretty decent deal, my friend has a CHI</li>
            <li>I have short thick hair that straightens easily, and I had a Chi (which I loved) but it broke.</li>
            <li>, if you like your flat irons really really hot, then this one is good for you, but be careful.</li>
            <li>This is a nice little straightener with one problem.</li>
            <li>Definitely made my hair jet straight and quick!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s short, fine, color-treated, and already fairly straight.</li>
            <li>but then I glanced right next to it and found the New Conair Infinity Oil infused Ceramic Flat Iron that reaches an astonishing 455 degrees!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too easy to turn this flat iron on and off.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the remington keratin therapy iron and it&#x27;s far superior, though a little heavier and doesn&#x27;t heat as quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this also because if you are not careful it is very easy to burn the fingers....it needs to be held at the very tip of the rods only</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest and say I&#x27;ve never used a CHI or comparable brand, but this one sure works well for the little bit of money I spent on it.  </li>
            <li>I have very healthy hair and very little is in the brush after I wash and brush through it.</li>
            <li>This one is much lighter, and also gets much hotter.</li>
            <li>for the straight, shiny look that I&#x27;ve been wanting to achieve, this seems to be the tool.</li>
            <li>I note that by just a flick of the wrist, I can get a bit of a curl at the bottom, which is very nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Depends on the product you put on your hair before you iron it, it irons very well</li>
            <li>My hair is fairly straight (with wave) to begin with and curls</li>
            <li>After a day of sprinkling rain and lots of humidity my hair remained straight as a ruler and still glossy with no flyaways because of the argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s partly because this iron gets hotter &amp; it gets hotter much faster.  </li>
            <li>- Very resistant hair</li>
            <li>The unit heats up REALLY fast-- really fast.</li>
            <li>Ceramic coated tourmaline plates really do reduce frizz and make straightening rather effortless.  </li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>appreciate the temperature controls although I don&#x27;t really adjust the heat  at all</li>
            <li>it doesnt put to much pressure on the ends of the hair.</li>
            <li>She has very course hair</li>
            <li>This iron does a fast a job on both of them.</li>
            <li>very shiny.&lt;br /&gt;In case you wondered</li>
            <li>It looked very shiny to them, and I thought so too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really used it much as yet</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very durable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used both cheap and pricey irons - my last one, a gift, was retailing at over $150, and worked well until it broke after 4 years of devoted use.  </li>
            <li>It really just pulls your hair.  </li>
            <li>It gets my hair supremely straight.</li>
            <li>#34;heat up&amp;#34; after the light shuts off and you have to turn it back on!)</li>
            <li>if you really want to save money, but it makes my hair look greasy and snags my hair all the time.</li>
            <li>It steams very well,  </li>
            <li>This heats up fast and leaves my hair shiny.</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Glides threw really well, hair staightend with one glide.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really glide through my hair as promised--there is a lot of friction.  </li>
            <li>It gets it bone straight on the 20 setting</li>
            <li>Got hair really straight</li>
            <li>I am very upset about this purchase.</li>
            <li>it was very affordable too.</li>
            <li>In fact, it is so light that several times the weight of the cord pulled it off of the bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li>but shipping was fast</li>
            <li>and this gets my hair straight.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li>well really it didn&#x27;t get my hair as straight as i wanted...</li>
            <li>I used it the more my hair became rough, damaged, and brittled.</li>
            <li>(I also figured that I could leave one at my parents&#x27; house and finally really retire my trusty Solano).</li>
            <li>Conair heats fast (maybe a bit faster than the Remington</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s no worse</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and it does not fry or tangle your hair.</li>
            <li>heats up fast.</li>
            <li>I got straight, but frizzy hair after spending 2-3 hours straightening it.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a great buy, and the only thing I&#x27;ve ever gotten from Conair that I actually like!</li>
            <li>I appreciate the longer plates, which makes curling longer hair much easier.  </li>
            <li>It gets my hair so straight</li>
            <li>I am very upset with Conair producing this piece of junk.  </li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t beat $20 dollars and the shipping was fast</li>
            <li>When I use this in addition to the blow dryer I think my hair looks very polished.</li>
            <li>I did not want to spend too much money for a product that I&#x27;m going to use every once&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>The price is extremely reasonable for the item that you&#x27;re getting.  </li>
            <li>The ones ones that cost twice as much as this one don&#x27;t even begin to compare.</li>
            <li>The light flashes while it heats up and then goes solid once it gets to temperature!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I immediately saw that the plates do not meet flush the whole length.  </li>
            <li>It was straight with one pass.</li>
            <li>Gets my hair bone straight.  </li>
            <li>Just once to get it straight</li>
            <li>I felt that this transaction was handled very unprofessionally.</li>
            <li>did I mention that my hair looked REALLY</li>
            <li>I have REALLY curly hair.  </li>
            <li>It heats up lightning fast and is very durable.</li>
            <li>I was very devestated about that.</li>
            <li>My hair is fairly straight to begin with</li>
            <li>My daughter has very curly hair and wanted it straight</li>
            <li>I found this very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>like that it&#x27;s lightweight, heats fast, doesn&#x27;t catch on hair.</li>
            <li>It still leaves hair straight</li>
            <li>but if it does, do NOT use too much on your hair at one time, you don&#x27;t want it to be greasy.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and straightens with no problem.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, the iron has multiple heat settings (30) which makes it easy to adjust the temperature to suit your particular hair needs.  </li>
            <li>I used my cousin&#x27;s flat iron (which happened to be this one) and instantly fell in love!</li>
            <li>Straightens the hair without pulling them, in other words it works very smoothly.</li>
            <li>I have fine Caucasian hair with some stubborn waves, which is why I use a flat iron.</li>
            <li>I had been using a Remington flat iron that worked fine but is no comparison to this one.  </li>
            <li>It easily straightens and smooths my long straight hair.  </li>
            <li>It definitely gets hot really quick, as advertised.  </li>
            <li>However, it was not very expensive, so</li>
            <li>I received my Conair CS710R Infiniti Pro flat iron free from the Amazon Vine program in exchange for writing a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this flat iron makes the hair shinny and smooth.</li>
            <li>AND SHE LOVES  IT BETTER THAN HER OTHER ONE.IT</li>
            <li>Other than that I am so pleased.</li>
            <li>For the first few uses, I liked how it made my hair silky and soft.  </li>
            <li>flat iron heats up pretty quickly, 5-10 sec.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>the color looks exactly like the picture  and leaves my hair soft and straight</li>
            <li>I have long fine curly hair and this iron works well for me.  </li>
            <li>I own the CHI flat iron, but came in need of an additional flat iron when my sister took it to an out of town getaway.</li>
            <li>When I first purchased this flat iron I loved it, but after using it for a few months it is severely damaging my hair.</li>
            <li>It has multiple heat settings, heats up very, very fast, and leaves my hair feeling SUPER soft!</li>
            <li>It heats up super fast and heats up to 455 degrees as apposed to the Chi which only heats up to 397 degrees.</li>
            <li>It heats up fairly quickly, depending on the temp you have it set on, so coming back to an iron that has turned off isn&#x27;t that much of a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it gives me the same amazing results every single time.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a straightener that was hot enough to keep my thinner hair straight and give it a thickness.</li>
            <li>I like this flat iron much better than the first flat iron I bought around 4 years ago.  </li>
            <li>First let me say that I&#x27;m a professional hairstylist....</li>
            <li>Another plus for this iron is that the outside of the iron stays relatively cool to the touch.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just that it doesn&#x27;t look too hot after it has been slept on and unless it has been ironed, can get a tad frizzy near the scalp closest to parts of my face if the weather&#x27;s humid.</li>
            <li>I put mine at hottest setting, though, so if you turn it down some it should be better.</li>
            <li>Better than the 3 other $50 to $100 straighteners I&#x27;ve owned before it!</li>
            <li>I adore my new product!</li>
            <li>To its benefit, the iron stays relative cool to the touch despite the high temperatures of the plates.  </li>
            <li>If you have never used a good quality (expensive) flat iron before, you might be OK with it.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m really pleased with such a reasonably priced flat iron working so well!</li>
            <li>The product made a popping sound like something was burning (again, my hair was totally dry</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sending it back and heading to Target to pay ten more dollars for it.</li>
            <li>I have numerous scorch marks on my counters because my current iron doesn&#x27;t have auto shut off so this will save me from adding any more.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better than the most expensive irons out there.</li>
            <li>I noticed though, that when you clamp the iron, it does not fully clamp; there is a tiny gap on the bottom portion of the actual iron that doesn&#x27;t fully close unless you add more pressure to your hands on the grip portion.</li>
            <li>It is slim, heats up quick and only requires one or two passes max.</li>
            <li>it only gets too hot if you put it too hot</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair, which is much thicker and coarser required two passes through the iron (for each section) but her hair still looked shiny, soft, and straight after a day at school (and being in the rain)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair, which is much thicker and coarser required two passes through the iron (for each section) but her hair still looked shiny, soft, and straight after a day at school (and being in the rain)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was a decent straightner for the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Perhaps I should appreciate my waves, more, but with my layered haircut it can turn into a frizz-bomb once I&#x27;ve brushed it thoroughly on the second day after washing it, even in it&#x27;s-a-dry-heat Arizona.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall a decent iron for a decent price, but</li>
            <li>First of all let me say that this iron has the potential to be a great flat iron, but their are few design flaws.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to receive this flat iron, especially after all the great reviews I read and the fact that I found it for ten dollars less than at Target.</li>
            <li>Both the plates and the outside of the iron get very hot</li>
            <li>The color is very pretty too, its a deep plum color.</li>
            <li>I purchased a larger Conair hair straightener over a year ago and was impressed by how well it worked with my thick, long hair.  </li>
            <li>but in any case, the hair stayed flat for a full day, before it was time to shower again.</li>
            <li>Heats quickly, glides through hair easily, makes my thick coarse hair soft, smooth, &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this iron.</li>
            <li>The heat is highly adjustable on this model, but I kept it somewhere in the middle(15), since I don&#x27;t want to fry my hair.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend trying it out.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>We chose this straightener out of all the others because of it&#x27;s high quality and durability.</li>
            <li>Becareful because too high of a setting can burn your hair.</li>
            <li>I burnt end of my hair because I set it up too high.</li>
            <li>HIghly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommended</li>
            <li>It has a range of temperatures, so I could set it at the high end of medium for the relentless frizz.</li>
            <li>thanks to the fact that this leaves hair straight and smooth on the first pass as opposed to others I have tried that take several tries.</li>
            <li>This flat iron and some heat protectant got hair so straight that it looked like she had a fresh relaxer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for several months, and I&#x27;m still pleased with it.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and has a big range of heat settings on a dial which is easy to set and leave at that setting for later use.  </li>
            <li>It heats up way hotter than my last flat iron -which costs way more than this product.</li>
            <li>The Conair CS710R Infiniti Pro 1 Inch Tourmaline Ceramic Flat Iron offers a super sleek design with high quality plates that yield a super shiny and extra straight finish.</li>
            <li>and I got this to get closer to the roots on top of my head and to add a little bit of wave.</li>
            <li>The outside gets ridiculously hot!  </li>
            <li>Save yourself some heartache and spend a little more money on quality.</li>
            <li>flat iron heats rapidly- within 15 seconds, and can reach temperatures up to 455 degrees (F), enabling quick and efficient styling.</li>
            <li>I have had professionals use hair straighteners that work a little better, but for my everyday use, this one is okay.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair, its natural.</li>
            <li>She has naturally wavy hair and likes to keep it straight.</li>
            <li>It leaves my curly hair really straight and soft.</li>
            <li>I NORMALLY WOULD</li>
            <li>Normally even if I like my hair in the bathroom</li>
            <li>iron has multiple heat settings and gets really, really hot...really fast!  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical about this iron at first as it is conair, but I went ahead and got it anyway because it got some really good reviews.</li>
            <li>but my hair is not smooth and it sounds like you need to buy the oil to make the iron work better.  </li>
            <li>it worth for the price, but sometime doesn&#x27;t get enough heat.</li>
            <li>normally take 3 hour to do my hair</li>
            <li>I have 3 daughters with long full hair</li>
            <li>Heats up very quickly and straightens my thick curly hair pretty well!</li>
            <li>It gets hot enough that I can straighten my hair quickly and without going over the same piece of hair for what seems like thousands of times.</li>
            <li>After flat ironing a section of hair, sometimes it will be too hot to touch when you release it!</li>
            <li>If you want to save a few bucks and get a more economical flat iron, this is the one.</li>
            <li>This flat iron gets hot!</li>
            <li>This flat iron is a million times better than my old one by the same company!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this straightener for the budget conscious shopper!</li>
            <li>This flat iron gets hot, fast.</li>
            <li>This flat iron gets so hot, made so much smoke it set off my  smoke detectors.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to curl the ends under, but all the problems involved in getting it that way are not worth it.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a high quality, moderately priced flat iron, this one would do just fine.</li>
            <li>Even on the highest setting, I had to go over the same chunk of hair 2-3 times (and ouch was it hot!), and that COMPLETELY destroyed my hair.</li>
            <li>, I realized that it could be my new iron.</li>
            <li>I had to buy a new straightener after I brought my Chi to Israel and my straighter was fried.</li>
            <li>For this reason  I am now on the hunt to buy a new straightener to replace this one.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try a new look, it has been over 2 years since I have put any type of heat towards my hair.</li>
            <li>The new one I got</li>
            <li>I have had this straightener for about 8 months and it works as new.</li>
            <li>Item was shipped promptly, arrived new in box with all contents as described.</li>
            <li>I can live with that.</li>
            <li>unfortunately as I live in Australia</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t have to buy a new straightener, and after a year of not having one, I went to Fred Meyer, and got the Infiniti Pro Conair.</li>
            <li>What upsets me is: it&#x27;s so easy to just open the box and inspect the flat iron.</li>
            <li>flat iron is easy to use - it heats up almost instantly, and in 6 or 7 passes, I&#x27;ve gone through my hair.</li>
            <li>but it definitely enhanced the performace of the curling iron and left her hair smooth and shiney.</li>
            <li>It heats up in less than a minute, glides through my hair like butter and not only leaves my hair straight but also leaves it shiny and smooth!</li>
            <li>It has 30 heat settings and I used setting 10 for the front and 15 in the back, my hair came out very silk straight.</li>
            <li>only thing I really don&#x27;t like about the Infiniti is the fact that the blades don&#x27;t lock--I really like this feature on my Remington</li>
            <li>It arrived before expected date , it came in a big box with a lot of protection , it does the job same or better than a CHI !</li>
            <li>My hair will stay straight for days after with barely a touch up!  </li>
            <li>I have very straight, Asian/White hair which does not like to hold a curl and my curls literally last for days with this iron!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to have finally found a flat iron that actually straightens my extremely curly hair.</li>
            <li>Very nice and doesn&#x27;t burn my very thin hair.</li>
            <li>The heating element allows for a wide range of heat settings with a rheostat (like a dimmer) that allows you to finely set the temperature rather than the more common hi-lo or hi-med-lo settings.</li>
            <li>Wife says it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to do the job.  </li>
            <li>So background first, I&#x27;m a mixed girl (black/Italian)</li>
            <li>I tried this hair straightener on my hair for the first time last week</li>
            <li>This flat iron works very well and gets my hair straight without frizz or burning.</li>
            <li>The first one I got blew out after a couple of short term usages.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li>I love the small bottle of argan oil that comes with this product.</li>
            <li>I just picked up a second one (my first one broke, I stepped on it)and</li>
            <li>tourmaline platted iron leaves my hair soft silky &amp; shiny !&lt;</li>
            <li>I used to struggle getting my hair straight but thanks to these flat irons</li>
            <li>But I keep this baby on a low setting and it gets my hair bone straight!</li>
            <li>the curls with this iron are so pretty and last all day.</li>
            <li>Professional quality!</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>The outside of the iron is almost as hot as the plates on the inside.</li>
            <li>I put a small dab of oil on it before pressing it and it came out silky and smooth!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Several years ago, I bought an inexpensive flat iron from a local beauty store, and I think I used it precisely three times.</li>
            <li>It gets really hot, which is key.  </li>
            <li>I used it for the first time last night and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li>It works better than expected and it is so much cheaper on here than in other retail locations.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, although the flat iron proclaims \\&quot;15 second heat up,\\&quot; the initial heating time is more than 15 seconds, and it seems like this might apply to the time IN BETWEEN STRAIGHTENING.</li>
            <li>I bought this for less than $30 on Amazon and it is a huge bang for my buck.</li>
            <li>It is cool that the CS710R will automatically recover its heat if unplugged or power is lost...and it is an essential safety feature in my house that the iron will auto shut off if left</li>
            <li>When I used the iron at the \\&quot;21\\&quot; setting, the outside of the plates stayed cool the entire time I used the iron.</li>
            <li>The only positive things I can say about this product?  </li>
            <li>Before using this flat iron I put Avon&#x27;s heat protectant on and try to leave it on a couple minutes as it dries before applying the hot ceramic plates on it.</li>
            <li>This is my first flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about this flat iron is the metal plates don&#x27;t close flush all the way across.</li>
            <li>The flat iron heats REALLY fast!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to a flat iron that stays the correct temperature consistently.</li>
            <li>I think that means the temperature setting is higher, or perhaps my newfound wisdom to NEVER use a flat iron without a conditioner/oil (through Hair Guy advice) made a difference...</li>
            <li>It heats up very quick and the plates are in position so that hair doesn&#x27;t get trapped in the space between the plates and the plastic near the ends of the plates.</li>
            <li>Only the top half meets.  </li>
            <li>have been using the flat iron for about three months now and so far it is still working well consistently.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think you necessarily have to spend a lot on a flat iron to get a good one(the one I had before this was $30 and lasted me several years), but this is a really low quality flat iron even for the price.</li>
            <li>I appreciated this feature in particular because I like my long hair pin-straight except for a soft wave at the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my second one only because a 200lb person stepped on my first one which lasted two years!</li>
            <li>Secondly the outside plastic of the metal plates gets extremely hot when in use!</li>
            <li>When the temp was turned up for my daughter to use, the outside of the iron became warm, but never hot enough to burn my daughter (which is more than I can say for any of our other irons, including a Chi knock-off, a Remington, and two other Conairs)  </li>
            <li>Only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it&#x27;s a little long and the top part gets really hot</li>
            <li>I had to put it to almost thirty to get the desired heat that I was wanting for my hair because it would have a hard time straightening, but I still had to go over the same lock of hair over and over again to make sure it&#x27;s straight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried dozens of flat irons and this is the only one that leaves my hair feeling silky and smooth and not dry and damaged.</li>
            <li>I am currently pregnant and have thick curly hair (even more so due to vitamins).  </li>
            <li>It is pretty long and the plates don&#x27;t completely meet all of the way</li>
            <li>At least I&#x27;ll be able to see it&#x27;s condition before taking it home.</li>
            <li>My old curling iron broke, and</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>And my hair looks soft, silky, and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I gave them my old one</li>
            <li>It actually worked really well,</li>
            <li>but so far this one is working</li>
            <li>And when used with the Argon oil that comes with it, it leaves my hair soft and shiny, always a plus.</li>
            <li>It did not over heat or anything, it just unexpectedly shut off.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and has several heat settings to choose from.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it once and am pleasantly surprised -</li>
            <li>I need it to flatten the kinks in my naturally wavy hair, and it does the trick.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I really like it and would recommend it to anyone with untamable hair</li>
            <li>It works perfectly on my natural hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly</li>
            <li>far exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li>Hair is soft afer using.  </li>
            <li>I realized my hair was suddenly really damaged, compared to how it was two months earlier, before I bought the Infiniti pro.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for natural and weave.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft</li>
            <li>Then the paint started chipping completely.</li>
            <li>Since I have gone natural</li>
            <li>I ordered this with my 11 year old in mind.  </li>
            <li>It is about the same size as my iron, but it is much lighter.  </li>
            <li>The plates don;t even come completely together.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely heartbroken.</li>
            <li>I had a busy week and used it about 4x that week</li>
            <li>There is nothing that pinches my hair either, like on an old iron I have.  </li>
            <li>It has always straightened my hair like a stylist leaving it silky smooth and never &#x27;overcooked&#x27; or dried out.  </li>
            <li>I actually don&#x27;t straighten my hair with it, because my hair is mostly straight.</li>
            <li>I only need to curl my hair once and it lasts for the whole day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was also surprised to find out that the plates weren&#x27;t \\&quot;floating\\&quot; -</li>
            <li>She has used it for a couple months so far</li>
            <li>Wow...</li>
            <li>There was a loud snap, a visible spark, and the iron tripped my breaker.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d much prefer actual temps.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like my old chi</li>
            <li>So excited, in fact, that I did next day delivery, which I normally do not do.</li>
            <li>Not perfect, but good value for the price.</li>
            <li>I knew the price was too good to b true :(</li>
            <li>One in particular I remembered that was highly reviewed was the Remington Ceramic Tourmaline Flat Iron!</li>
            <li>Heats Up Quickly, And Allows The Hair To Become Completely Straight Without Doing Excessive Passes Through Each Strand.</li>
            <li>as for the heat, well it definitely gets hot enough but I had to constantly go over my thick (Asian&amp;African American) hair, so I feel like the quality of the plates wasn&#x27;t that good.</li>
            <li>It heats up correctly but once you start straightening your hair the light starts flashing, indicating that it&#x27;s not hot enough again.</li>
            <li>My hair looks so much nicer with flat ironing than having it natural.</li>
            <li>As long as I&#x27;m careful not to hit that button, everything works fine</li>
            <li>(I have very fine, but thick blonde hair  that doesn&#x27;t take much heat to get it to totally straighten or curl.)</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am just a little concerned about how fast it heats up and how hot it does get.</li>
            <li>This flat iron heats up really fast; they claim 15 seconds</li>
            <li>I am not one to use a flat iron very often.</li>
            <li>NEVER BEEN MUCH OF A CURLING IRON OR FLAT IRON PERSON</li>
            <li>This flat iron is the real deal.</li>
            <li>This flat iron is very well made.</li>
            <li>When flat ironing my hair, I also noticed that it one takes 1-2 glides for the hair to be straight and shiny</li>
            <li>The flat iron works very well.  </li>
            <li>I have had several other flat irons and this is my favorite yet.</li>
            <li>I am mixed (black, white, Indian and more)</li>
            <li>and this gets hot enough to straighten my hair and last up to 2 days without needing a touch up.</li>
            <li>It blinks until it&#x27;s hot and stays on solid red.</li>
            <li>the light blinks indicating it has cooled down and needs time to get back to the max temp.</li>
            <li>I would recommend trying a very small amount the first time (you really don&#x27;t need much for \\&quot;normal\\&quot; hair).  </li>
            <li>Only downfall I can say is that there is no cool spot on it to hold such as at the top</li>
            <li>Thought the longer iron would be nice, but it actually make it a little harder to have control of the iron.  </li>
            <li>The only Issue I have is that, while using the flat iron the on/off button is located in a position where you can easily press it, so be careful.</li>
            <li>For the first couple months it had worked amazingly, turning my frizzy hair to glassy straight hair but recently, when I plug it in to use, the straightener can&#x27;t seem to heat to the said 455 degrease and have trouble straightening even the smallest piece of hair (I could tough the plates without burning myself when I put it on the hottest setting).</li>
            <li>My hair stays straight all day long.  </li>
            <li>I have REALLY puffy curly/wavy LONG hair nd its a pain to get it straightened but with this straightener</li>
            <li>The plastic shell is not thick enough to protect your fingers from the heat of the plates, so they burn.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>The handle does get a bit hot, if I&#x27;m not careful, and grab outside of a very specific &#x27;handle&#x27; zone.  </li>
            <li>This iron doesn&#x27;t seem to heat up as hot as I expected, and my hair gets stuck between the plates, causing breakage.  </li>
            <li>This flat iron is the only one that I&#x27;ve found that does exactly what it says that it will.  </li>
            <li>was using a cheap 2-inch non-ceramic flat iron, and was concerned about going down to the 1-inch iron</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair straight hair so</li>
            <li>I have very fine and thin hair.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin hair</li>
            <li>and you would think even the crappiest of flat irons would straighten my hair in a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li>I needed a smaller straightener to accommodate a new shorter hair style.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this flat iron.</li>
            <li>I purchased this flat iron with high hopes based on the reviews.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have tremendously high expectations for my flat irons</li>
            <li>Only buy if you have short hair and need to fix hair fast.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to reflat after the first initial ironing (as long as you straighten with a bristle brush proceeding the iron).</li>
            <li>So, I spent a few bucks on this cheapy one and LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this, but I guess since I used a Sedu for the last 4 years I shouldn&#x27;t have expected much.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this flat iron to anyone!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a month now, and no broken or otherwise damaged tresses yet, probably because a single application maintains my preferred style until my hair needs washing again.</li>
            <li>I have never done that with the Corioliss or even the cheap little flat irons I order from a Hong Kong dealer to keep in my desk drawer at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have left my old one on all day!  </li>
            <li>When they work at all, they usually dry out my hair, and since I&#x27;m a bottle blonde, that&#x27;s the first step toward damage-induced</li>
            <li>so it comes down to whether or not locking blades are important enough to merit paying a bit extra.</li>
            <li>i have to go over my hair with this flat iron several times before it even looks decently straight.</li>
            <li>Recently, it&#x27;s been turning off on its own either when I&#x27;m running the item through my hair or having it try to heat up and usually when that happens it won&#x27;t turn back on again after pressing the power button several times (then I would have to unplug and plug back in again).</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, so I can&#x27;t speak for anyone with thick hair.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re in the market for a new flat iron and don&#x27;t want to spend hundreds of dollars for a high-end salon quality hair straightener</li>
            <li>But after my Chi iron&#x27;s plug broke I had to get a new flat iron.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I decided to take a detour through the Hair care section to see what&#x27;s new and check out their Flat Irons.</li>
            <li>I bought this flat iron because I was just in the market for a new one.</li>
            <li>I have long fine hair that is wavy and this straightener tames everything in a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Clean cut at last, I have used other flat irons and none work this well.</li>
            <li>I tried to pawn it off as an early Christmas present but she wasn&#x27;t buying that.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t marked by the burn, but I definitely felt it.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this 1 inch Conair straightener and have had no regrets.  </li>
            <li>This is a definite upgrade from my last iron and appears comparable to the higher end more expensive straighteners.</li>
            <li>My last professional model was 1 year and it stopped working in 6 months.  </li>
            <li>The power button is constantly being turned off and on if you hold this where you&#x27;d  naturally want to, ei the handle</li>
            <li>some* people will like it if they have never experienced better (I have used a Chi, so</li>
            <li>and i was so afraid to get a different brand because my old one worked so good</li>
            <li>I set the temperature at 15 (only half as hot as this iron gets) and voila!</li>
            <li>I am a caucasian female with very fine, thin, wavy hair...</li>
            <li>I had been using an older style Conair flat iron, that looks very similar to this one.  </li>
            <li>I like how it&#x27;s thin and doesn&#x27;t take very long to warm up.</li>
            <li>This straightener heats up hotter than my previous straighteners (Chi &amp; Hot Tools).</li>
            <li>i owned previously and much cheaper!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an African american woman with natural hair and it does wonders!</li>
            <li>This straightener is extremely light-weight and makes my hair sleek and straight.</li>
            <li>I bought it to replace my old flat iron, and this one one works</li>
            <li>This leaves my hair considerably smoother and flat instead of puffy.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy, fuzzy hair and this flat iron</li>
            <li>The only con I have to say is that whoever packed my argan oil must not of closed the lid because the whole bottle was inside the bag it came in.</li>
            <li>Lastly, it leaves crimps in my hair from where I first close the iron down on my hair.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of very thin wavy hair and can get a decent straightening out of most flat irons</li>
            <li>I own over 10 flat irons ranging from random walmart buys to expensive \\&quot;high end\\&quot; flat irons, and this one works better</li>
            <li>I have returned the 2nd one and am starting my search for a new flat iron anew.  </li>
            <li>I had a yellow and black straightener from Conair and it did absolutely nothing!</li>
            <li>the ends are touching each other, you would have to press hard</li>
            <li>so my hair is very hard to do anything with and this made it seem so easy.</li>
            <li>Anyway, back to hair, I have medium course hair below shoulder length the mid torso depending on the time of year and when I get around to cutting it and this flat iron is amazing!</li>
            <li>My boyfriend loves playing with my hair in general, but when I use this iron he can&#x27;t keep his hands off my hair and constantly compliments the softness.</li>
            <li>I had an old Conair flat iron and  stop working last weekend after 6 years</li>
            <li>I have thick full bouncy curly hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little smoother as it glides over my hair, and I think it flattens my wavy hair a bit faster than the first model, due to the high heat.  </li>
            <li>I have gone back to my natural hair curl pattern a couple times after straightening with these flat irons!</li>
            <li>but it does not champ down very well</li>
            <li>I exchanged for a new one anyway, hoping at least the outside would not get so hot to the touch.  </li>
            <li>The plates are my main problem other than that it was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s difficult to find a flat iron that heats up warm enough.  </li>
            <li>Stays straight as long as you don&#x27;t get it wet.</li>
            <li>I have been flat ironing since college (9 years ago) and my old flat iron was retired this weekend.  </li>
            <li>My hair is thin, semi straight with a slight wave to it and easily straightens at 370.</li>
            <li>It gets too hot and it is not easy to handle.</li>
            <li>and I will likely get another Remington, as I have done in the past and always had success with.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to flat-ironing, but it really can&#x27;t be that hard.  </li>
            <li>My hair is always silky smooth after I am done using it and it doesn&#x27;t damage it as much as other straighteners have in the past.</li>
            <li>That evening I tried the iron on one of my African American Client who has quite a bit of long thick fantastic bushy coarse Un-relaxed hair!</li>
            <li>Decent price but not worth the consequences.</li>
            <li>In addition, whether I try to curl or straighten, this iron creates little crimps in my hair from the edges (and it doesn&#x27;t glide over very well which might be the issue).</li>
            <li>DOES TAKE OUT THE FRIZZ AND MAKES IT STRAIGHT AND WILL EVEN GIVE A LITTLE</li>
            <li>Bought this for my daughter, who has straight hair but needs a little touch up in the mornings before school to get rid of that bedhead look.  </li>
            <li>these little babies work like a charm you really don&#x27;t need to crank them all the way up just a bit and your hair will go from wavy to sraight .</li>
            <li>Perhaps if your hair is very thick and can fill the huge amount of space between the plates this might work for you... for everyone else, I would pass.</li>
            <li>I have course curly hair and for 10 years I used a $150 Paul Mitchell iron (the original green and black one).</li>
            <li>while in Walmart I pulled it up to check out reviews and seen some good some bad.</li>

            <li> this is absolutely amazing !</li>
            <li> Love them works great on course hair !</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase and the price :)</li>
            <li> Yesterday, I decided to take a trip to Target for laundry detergent and there award winning Rice Crispy treats at the cafe, (Delicious)</li>
            <li> Loving it!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok not the best</li>
            <li> i love it so much !!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is perfect and did a great job getting my hair smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li> Received very quickly and awesome product</li>
            <li> The iron heats up very quickly is easy to handle and straightens the hair perfectly.</li>
            <li> and the Argan oil is amazing and smells wonderful. :-)</li>
            <li> and I take good care of it otherwise.</li>
            <li> So I must say it does a good job.</li>
            <li> It straightens hair really good, but it takes forever to curl with.  </li>
            <li> I guess you get what you pay for this is a good value</li>
            <li> I loved this iron.</li>
            <li> I had a friend who said she had one like this and loved it.</li>
            <li> It does as good a job as the one my hair dresser uses, but cost a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> It works really good..</li>
            <li> I use a good amount of product for thermal protection and product creates smoke when it heats up.</li>
            <li> well maybe the straightener isn&#x27;t good</li>
            <li> Its good value for the cost</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good quality straightener at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and the product information and thought I would go ahead and get this one because the price was fair.</li>
            <li> Also, it is good for all hair types.</li>
            <li> loved</li>
            <li> it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;its really good for the price!&lt;br /&gt;better</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a good straightener and a good value</li>
            <li> my hair looks good without burning my hands.</li>
            <li> The mist smells good and it does not leave your hair sticky.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Overall,still a good straightner.</li>
            <li> and I loved it.</li>
            <li> it is a good value.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t going to be GOOD for my hair</li>
            <li> It is works good.</li>
            <li> It gives good shine to hair.</li>
            <li> I loved it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Conair, and this iron lives up to its reputation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I loved both of them, but could not justify another $100 on a straightener.  </li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this straightener because it works a lot better than most of the others I have tried.</li>
            <li> It is also safe and has a great tip to use on the end.</li>

            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Great for fine hair</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing tool!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes my hair look so smooth, and does a great job straigtening it.</li>
            <li> I works amazingly.</li>
            <li> and I have not used my CHI since then, because THIS straightener is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing</li>
            <li> , for they helped me when making my decision of purchasing this amazing product.</li>
            <li> Worked AMAZINGLY.</li>
            <li> Heats up nicely ...</li>
            <li> (I also own a Conair Mini Pro hair dryer that</li>
            <li> The curls come out nice.</li>
            <li> I liked the oil that came with it, my hair was shiny and bouncy.</li>
            <li> With Amazon Prime, I had my own within one day.  </li>
            <li> I often don&#x27;t even blow-dry my hair, but I really liked this device.</li>
            <li> My daughters both liked the way my hair looked.</li>
            <li> IT DOES GET KIND</li>
            <li> OF WARM</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s superb because I&#x27;m a frugal person (haha).</li>
            <li> But it warms up perfectly and fast.</li>
            <li> My hair stayed straight and shiny perfectly all day.  </li>
            <li> It also made nice glossy defined curls.  </li>
            <li> I have medium textured hair and this straightened it nicely with a shine.</li>
            <li> Arrived very promptly, excellent product at a fraction of the cost!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!!</li>
            <li> and I can take one pass with this iron and its straight as an arrow, and with the help of alil heat therapy spray it looks great all day!!!</li>
            <li> A friend was staying with me and she straightened my hair as well as taught me how to use this to give it a nice flip.</li>
            <li> Maybe a glove for the teens and for curling would be nice.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;floating&amp;#34; plates are a nice touch</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t believe how well this tool works.</li>
            <li> The cord also swivels, which is a nice feature that I wish my own iron had.  </li>
            <li> I also liked the oil that came with it.</li>
            <li> Also, a locking clip for the blades would be nice.</li>
            <li> I guess I was kind of hoping for a miracle straightener, though.</li>
            <li> This was spontaneous.</li>
            <li> It does the job and is effective.  </li>
            <li> Great flat iron, best one I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> perfectly these are great pear of flat irons</li>
            <li> One of the best features is it has a heat setting so you can lower the heat instead of just high heat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with what can be done now that I&#x27;m trying a new, all-one-length hair style.</li>
            <li> This one works great, and is quick.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and works great.  </li>
            <li> a while, I was surprise how good and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Heats up very very quickly wich is good for a college student in a rush in the mornings.</li>
            <li> After ordering this product it came in the mail after 3 days which was great since I did the super saver shipping.</li>
            <li> The heat setting options are good for fine curly frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Very good for my medium length very wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> Great buy, worth every penny.</li>
            <li> so I gambled and so far its been great!</li>
            <li> this by far is the best one I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> It looks awesome, leaves my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> ands its an amazing price :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shiny and the right color; has great grip.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair with a bit of a wave.</li>
            <li> Heats up really quick and works amazing!  </li>
            <li> I have very fine hair</li>
            <li> It heated up very fast and did a great a job straightening my hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great straightener for the price and heats very fast.</li>
            <li> great at first</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well made, it doesn&#x27;t snag my fine hair and because of the heat control settings, doesn&#x27;t burn it either - yah for not having breakage!</li>
            <li> Came in on time, Very comfortable and sleek to use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Chi before and that was always very smooth when I ran it through my hair.</li>
            <li> The plates are very smooth and they do not grab my hair at all.  </li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly which is nice</li>
            <li> Works great, heats up super quick, and never leaves a piece unstraightened!</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and gives my hair (which is very fine) and great curl or straightening.  </li>
            <li> Pretty awesome right?</li>
            <li> and I hadnt been able to brush the strays out, so they were all coming out at once.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure *</li>
            <li> They were able to get my 4c hair to straighten without any damage.</li>
            <li> I LOVE CONAIR</li>
            <li> THAT I ABSOLUTLY LOVE</li>
            <li> but she likes it better than her existing curling iron.</li>
            <li> So glad I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably return it since I could do a better job with a brush and a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad my house didn&#x27;t burn</li>
            <li> One daughter has hair that gets damaged by too much heat, and she was happy with the heat levels on this appliance.</li>
            <li> tourmaline plates makes nice smooth hair without any frizzies, and the smoothness of it means it glides through hair without burning.</li>
            <li> According to my hairdresser it&#x27;s actually better to use a hotter iron (</li>
            <li> within reason - use the correct heat for your hair type) because you won&#x27;t have to go over the hair as many times which can be more damaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I returned the \\&quot;Remmington\\&quot; brand to the store and switched for this, totally better.</li>
            <li> -- some may want to be able to do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li> the oil is jus there to make it look even more healthy.</li>
            <li> They work better on longer hair.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so light!</li>
            <li> While I probably should be using the low or medium setting, I find the best results with the medium or medium-high.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes me about 10 minutes to get through most of the hair on my head with this iron.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t expect it to be any better.</li>
            <li> I bought this mostly because it said it would help fight the effects of humidity.  </li>
            <li> Very happy with it especially at this price.  </li>
            <li> I kept telling him that I needed some more for work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought many before</li>
            <li> I have been using another straightener for many years now</li>
            <li> IS VERY INEXPENSIVE AND A GREAT DEAL.HOPE THIS HELPS.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a great product and recommend it to anyone who wants to have one on hand for hairstyling.</li>
            <li> This straightener is better than the $150 straightener that broke on me after 6 months.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone who doesn&#x27;t like bulky straighteners and for those who like being able to set the heat for your hair.</li>
            <li> I love all of Conair products.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s OKAY</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love the ease of this iron.</li>
            <li> Love this straightener</li>
            <li> I really love this straightener -</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love the color.  </li>
            <li> (Plus, I love purple.)  </li>
            <li> It is a great price and works very well.</li>
            <li> and Im glad I deceided to try this.</li>
            <li> Love love love this iron</li>
            <li> I had to run the Conair through my hair more times than I ran the Chi through my hair to straighten it.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know whether this straightener is more damaging than say...</li>
            <li> Heats up real quick.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 more of these for my family.</li>
            <li> this product is ok.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> My hair  feels healthy too.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned so many straighteners before and they lasted longer and performed even better than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was because of our hair type that it wouldn&#x27;t work on that well or what.</li>
            <li> I love it .</li>
            <li> I love to curl my ends too.</li>
            <li> I love the 1&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this iron heats up to 455 degrees, instead of the 350 degrees that most cheaper models go up to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought better straighteners in my life.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> It works ok</li>
            <li> but I was expecting more based on the reviews.  </li>
            <li> I have used others that work better for this purpose</li>
            <li> I LOVE conair products i also have there curler which is also pretty amazing!</li>
            <li> I find it better</li>
            <li> Great product for a really reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It took me a while to realized the more</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it does a better job than my Remington</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t hold it from the top -</li>
            <li> I love the thinness and the color.</li>
            <li> They use the Infiniti Pro more often than I can keep track</li>
            <li> Works better than my CHI which i paid over $100.00 for.</li>
            <li> Love the way it leaves my hair shinny.</li>
            <li> It heats up really fast and does a great job straightening and curling my hair.  </li>
            <li> The iron surface is better than any iron I have used.</li>
            <li> PLEASED</li>
            <li> , none of which have been more than $40, has had floating plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like this better than the Chi I had.</li>
            <li> glad I got this one.</li>
            <li> It was cheaper but does a great job getting straight hair without burning.</li>
            <li> and I just love it.</li>
            <li> and frankly I think this may work a bit better at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great bang for your buck!</li>
            <li> Like I said, in my opinion it works better than my friend&#x27;s CHI</li>
            <li> I have tried many straighteners on my wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Would definately buy more and suggest to friends too.</li>
            <li> Is a cute purple color.</li>
            <li> Cute but not too girly.</li>
            <li> OK</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely satisfied and it even straightens my biracial daughters&#x27; hair without a problem. :)</li>
            <li> Love this iron.</li>
            <li> straight lol</li>
            <li> Better than the Sutra and Chi</li>
            <li> I love the color purple too.  </li>
            <li> Love it, love it</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I just love the iron.</li>
            <li> device, however, addresses most of the problems.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m quite pleased.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m quite pleased.</li>
            <li> , I read so many</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I really love this iron.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bought one at a store like Fred Meyer or Target in many years.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed especially for the price.</li>
            <li> This iron is okay.  </li>
            <li> Not my favorite straightener.</li>
            <li> I love it is...</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> My mom used it when she was in for a visit and fell in love with it, too.  </li>
            <li> I am overall very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> If you walk away from it and forget you may find your counter top on fire or melted.  </li>
            <li> Better yet have a timer set for &#x27;x&#x27; number of minutes.  </li>
            <li> I think it works better than my CHI ever did.  </li>
            <li> 5 Stars! :)</li>
            <li> It has both ceramic and tourmaline which is best for most flat iron qualities.</li>
            <li> The best flat iron I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li> Best flat iron ever.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seriously, I am genuinely impressed with this flat iron.</li>
            <li> This product is the best flat iron i&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> One Of The Best Flat Irons I&#x27;ve Ever Had.</li>
            <li> One of the best flat irons in the world.</li>
            <li> This flat Iron is great!</li>
            <li> These flat itons smooths the hair from root to end perfectly.  </li>
            <li> One of the best flat iron I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used in my life.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> On the good side, this one is better in the sense that my hair seems sleeker and it works very fast.</li>
            <li> They rave about how soft and silky their hair feels and it truly looks beautiful, and</li>
            <li> the reviews were pretty good.  </li>
            <li> than that it seems to be of good value at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> Pretty good product.</li>
            <li> Love it heats fast and works great, smooth shiny hair just jot</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly, does a nice job on my hair.</li>
            <li> You will burn your fingers by just touching the hair, which is an easy fix for me because I use a comb to hold the hair.</li>
            <li> cause you can return it easily and maybe get better luck than me.</li>
            <li> It gets hot very quickly, which is good, but it felt like it ripped out some of my hair out when I used it.</li>
            <li> Walmart wanted $50 for this where I live, I just love Amazon!!</li>
            <li> It is light and easy to hold, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> I was amazed that after washing and conditioning (with Silicon Mix) I was able to run a quick pass of the Conair Iron through the client&#x27;s hair and end up with silk!</li>
            <li> Smooth gliding, and hair feels really healthy after using.  </li>
            <li> I loved it so much I ordered one for myself.</li>
            <li> I loved it, kept my hair straight &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and quick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased to say that although this new Conair doesn&#x27;t surpass the performance of my Remington, it&#x27;s about as good and has a somewhat cheaper list price as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this so much!!!  </li>
            <li> This flat iron has them on the side &amp; I have yet to accidentally turn it off or change the temp; very good design.</li>
            <li> When I first bought this iron a month ago, for $40, I really loved it and how smooth, frizz free and shiny it made my hair.  </li>
            <li> Although not the exact one my daughter requested it looks like it may be better than she wanted!</li>
            <li> , I will admit that it does heat up very quickly.</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly (about 15-20 seconds) and the temperature stays even while she&#x27;s using it.</li>
            <li> the hair doesnt stick on the iron, it glides easily, creating wonderfull curls just as a curling iron would do.</li>
            <li> The cord is on a swivel, so it&#x27;s easy to use on either side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> EASY TO HANDLE.</li>
            <li> Easy grip.</li>
            <li> Use it on mens hair and it is easy.</li>
            <li> I have used cheap ones and the $100 salon kinds and honestly this one is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It also heats up very quickly and has a lot of heat options.</li>
            <li> and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love that it is light weight so that my arm and wrist are comfortable while straightening.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and I can adjust the heat.</li>
            <li> I like the size as it allows you to easily straighten a chunk of hair and then twist to curl up the ends a bit.</li>
            <li> the&lt;br /&gt;product looks great and the service was wonderful sadly</li>
            <li> It did straighten my hair although it didn&#x27;t glide easily</li>
            <li> , I have really strong hair</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good flatiron.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice product very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Ok for this price it is amazing, it really does the job tremendously well!</li>
            <li> It has the option to get super hot, which is good for my course hair.</li>
            <li> The ceramic plates would not heat and I found that my mini-conair travel straightener was working better then this full sized straightener.</li>
            <li> Gets nice and hot and straightens well</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to report that both girls love this flat iron!  </li>
            <li> It is really good to curl your hair, specially if you have a strong hair it is really powerfull.</li>
            <li> The lightness of the iron, along with the swivel cord, makes it very easy for my 11 year old to use to straighten her own</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron and the price is just right.</li>
            <li> but it works perfectly fine</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that needs just a touch with a straightener.</li>
            <li> I like the precise heat settings and it does get nice and hot, though I&#x27;ve never burned my hands or hair.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, fine hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Hispanic, I have fine curly hair and have used this a couple of times now to try to give it a chance.</li>
            <li> The product is fine.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just fine with one time .</li>
            <li> I would not recommend it if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li> FWIW, I won&#x27;t be using it on my hair either because it&#x27;s just too fine--</li>
            <li> I have fine, color treated hair</li>
            <li> Light weight and easy to work with</li>
            <li> It gets hot fast and does a great job if if I&#x27;m straightening or flipping my hair under.</li>
            <li> I also like that it heats up so quickly -- like many of us</li>
            <li> Many heat settings and it heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li> i cant really describe how much I LOVE this straightener!</li>
            <li> Once again, my hair came out perfectly as it did the first time I used a Chi flat iron</li>
            <li> I love the temperature control, and the tourmaline technolgy made my hair very light and straight.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hot iron!  </li>
            <li> This heats up fast and the multiple heat settings are perfect for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> It works very good on natural curly to straight.  </li>
            <li> This is a great Flat iron, I would strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This was an excellent purchase, smoothes nicely and really does heat up and cool down as quickly as it claims!</li>
            <li> keeps my hair smooth all</li>
            <li> no grease &amp; made my hair shiny &amp; smooth.  </li>
            <li> and I really liked it, but I decided to try something different and purchase the Conair Infiniti Pro, because it had such wonderful reviews.</li>
            <li> It has a light that tells you when it is to its desired temperature, but the temperature is done by a 1-30 scale</li>
            <li> but this was an afterhours rush purchase after doing some research on what was available at the time.</li>
            <li> It gets out all the frizz and keeps it smooth all day.</li>
            <li> Had worked great until last night and now just won&#x27;t stay on.  </li>
            <li> I was using a cheap brand &amp; it was just not preforming like</li>
            <li> I ordered this product last week because of all the great reviews about it.</li>
            <li> I have gotten a lot of compliments on how nice my hair looks straight.</li>
            <li> The power light was on, but never heated.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First, this iron is light.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic straightener.  </li>
            <li> and when I passed my hands through my hair my hand would be filled with bits of my hair.</li>
            <li> Overall it is a great buy at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> cheap price, but does it job.&lt;br</li>
            <li> hair, and after one pass, the heating light is blinking again.</li>
            <li> shiny, smooth hair.</li>
            <li> No snagging or pulling the hair, makes it smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> The purple on top melts and make my hands colorful.</li>
            <li> It does have an indicator light to let you know when it&#x27;s up to temperature.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely worth every centand I paid about $15 more than what it is listed for here.</li>
            <li> If you use it in the bathroom, leave the light on or fan if you decide to walk away.  </li>
            <li> I actually tried it on my mother&#x27;s hair and it worked great.</li>
            <li> My hair comes out smooth, shiny and not frizzy at all.  </li>
            <li> It heats up super fast (15 secs, as described), it gets plenty hot, and it has some great features for the cash.</li>
            <li> , I guess I was just expecting some kind of miracle that would make my hair super straight in one swipe-- a miracle that I guess hasn&#x27;t been invented yet!</li>
            <li> It is perfect for providing the flat shiny look, or it creates fantastic curls that really hold up.</li>
            <li> Heats right up and hair is smooth!</li>
            <li> when it comes to straighteners, you might as well shell out some more money if you&#x27;re looking for a good quality flat iron because you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I just love this flat iron, was a good deal.</li>
            <li> OK so iI had a flat iron I loved and it lasted about 3 years and just stopped working yesterday,</li>
            <li> this actually works better than the CHI and saved me about $80!!</li>
            <li> , I am in a rush in the morning as I prepare for work and not having to wait longer than 15 seconds for my flat iron is great.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron is great.  </li>
            <li> This pulls my hair out, I am experienced at flat ironing.</li>
            <li> Really great flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Another great feature is the cord which attaches to the flat iron pivots so it does not get tangled when straightening or when storing.</li>
            <li> Works great for a flat iron in this price range.</li>
            <li> this flat iron works great</li>
            <li> This is a great flat iron.  </li>
            <li> This is a great flat iron!</li>
            <li> The grip is easy to hang on to and the iron straightens or curls quickly.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, soft, perfectly straight hair.</li>
            <li> It heats quickly and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Regardless, the Infiniti does a nice job without the argan oil (which, in this formulation, barely contains any argan oil at all--it&#x27;s mostly chemicals).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, does an excellent job and makes a great replacement for a Chi, mall kiosk flat iron or any other higher priced option.</li>
            <li> i made sure i read the reviews first before purchasing it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any significant damage after using it twice in three days.</li>
            <li> MORE LIKE HOT ROLLERS.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this out...</li>
            <li> Okay thoughs of you saying it gets too hot.......</li>
            <li> , I feel like this is an excellent flat iron for the price, and it would especially be a good tool for pre-teens due to its light weight, cool-touch outside, and the results acheived.  </li>
            <li> , I feel like this is an excellent flat iron for the price, and it would especially be a good tool for pre-teens due to its light weight, cool-touch outside, and the results acheived.  </li>
            <li> My favorite thing about this iron is how fast it heats up!</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure</li>
            <li> I love the adjustable settings and don&#x27;t require this to be on the higher settings in order to straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li> Was not the one I originally wanted but</li>
            <li> It has adjustable temperature settings and heats up super quick!</li>
            <li> I bought this iron, originally, six months ago.</li>
            <li> My daughter is able to handle this iron much better than some of our others which weigh more, and don&#x27;t stay cool on the outside..  </li>
            <li> My daughter is able to handle this iron much better than some of our others which weigh more, and don&#x27;t stay cool on the outside.</li>
            <li> Love love love this flat iron &#x27;</li>
            <li> iron is quite large with a very smooth iron surface.</li>
            <li> But it is not too ideal for long hair and it gets way too hot for my liking.</li>
            <li> I just finished straightening my hair and my hair is now super smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> Best flat iron I&#x27;ve tried BY FAR!</li>
            <li> It is light weight and heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li> So far I like this product better than most that I have used.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love the longer iron style it really does make a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Good heat settings, feels comfortable in your hand, and I especially like the auto shut off.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30, and I&#x27;ve never been able to straighten my hair on my own (not for lack of trying the last 15 years).  </li>
            <li> and I mostly wanted this for a smooth straight look.</li>
            <li> /&gt;By far the best feature of this flat iron is the auto shut off.</li>
            <li> , I get it done fast and its super easy!</li>
            <li> I love it so much that I&#x27;ve increased my original 4 star rating to 5 stars</li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist told me to ditch it right away!</li>
            <li> Overall great price and very pleased with Conair Infiniti Pro line Ceramic Flat Iron.</li>
            <li> It worked perfectly the first few months but stopped working after that.</li>
            <li> Great for hair that needs minimal straightening as well as on fluffier hair that needs taming.</li>
            <li> The product did well, for the first few days, I was impressed.</li>
            <li> The overall quality is fair but it feels too light to make me confident that it will last more than a year or two.  </li>
            <li> It is the fastest I have experienced (about 15 sec).  </li>
            <li> It heats up as fast as it said it would and the heat settings are pretty effective.</li>
            <li> Its true.</li>
            <li> With winter heat blasting, my hair can get static and this really helps keep it sleek.</li>
            <li> This iron gets hot fast, and does a pretty good job of straightening.</li>
            <li> It even stays straight for a week (if i don&#x27;t work out and sweat it out :).</li>
            <li> Love it and highly recommend !</li>
            <li> I love these , they make my hair bone straight</li>
            <li> I feel like this product isn&#x27;t true Conair Infinity Pro.  </li>
            <li> I love these so much</li>
            <li> I really did love it.</li>
            <li> The plates of this iron are so smooth and it glides right through my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair that tends to get frizzy - this iron works great at straightening my hair...takes a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> I usually burn my head, but somehow the dainty (but powerful) iron shape has kept me burn free.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine that someone needing a flat iron wouldn&#x27;t be delighted with either one</li>
            <li> It doesnt leave ur fair flat</li>
            <li> fair majority of flat irons have a shut off timer built into them.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron is nice and compact and does heat up VERY quickly.</li>
            <li> The second best feature is the 15 second heat up.</li>
            <li> It heats up super quickly, and the heat setting can be adjusted.</li>
            <li> and I love how soft and smooth it makes my hair.  </li>
            <li> Also, the iron is purple - as a purple-lover, I love having something I use on a regular basis in my favorite color.  </li>
            <li> It does not heat up in the 15 seconds as advertised, but I timed it and it was still a quick minute.</li>
            <li> It literally heats up in 15 seconds and cools quickly when done as well.</li>
            <li> It does heat up super quick.</li>
            <li> but it does an adequate job.  </li>
            <li> This is a very well priced straightener, especially considering how compact it is and how great it works.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s super curly.</li>
            <li> Love it, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Iron gets very hot quickly and has given me the results I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I just used my new straightener for the first time and my hair looks amazing.</li>
            <li> Went swimming, which fries my hair ever more so than normal.</li>
            <li> I have really coarse wavy hair and this flat iron is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> This is next best thing to salon grade flat iron.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great ceramic flat iron that works very well for the price.  </li>
            <li> Heats quickly, very hot setting.</li>
            <li> Smooth, hot but doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned 2 other straightening irons and this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron is the next best thing to my salon&#x27;s iron.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several Flat Irons and this has been the best.  </li>
            <li> Feels great and works great on my hair my only complaint is that it seems like as soon as I run it through my hair</li>
            <li> This is definitely  the best flat iron I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Not only is this straightener nice to look at with its sleek lines and pretty shade of purple, it&#x27;s also easy to use.</li>
            <li> Unlike other straighteners, this one is perfect for getting your hair silky straight without doing as much damage to it.</li>
            <li> Soooo I&#x27;m new to writing my own reviews, but very fond of reading others; and I must say, this flat iron is possibly -the- best.</li>
            <li> I really love my new straightener.</li>
            <li> Recommended if you want a cool looking flat iron that gets very hot, very quickly. :)</li>
            <li> It heats fast and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> An older and cheaper Conair model that I used to own actually worked better.</li>
            <li> It is very resistant and easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> My hair is wavy/curly and I&#x27;m able to straighten my whole head within 10-15 minutes depending on how OCD I&#x27;m being that day - haha!</li>
            <li> Overall, the Inifiniti Pro is a pretty good ceramic hair straightener.</li>
            <li> It perhaps does not last as long as it should but for the time that it lasts it is absolutely wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I had low expectations of this straightner, but my received one as a gift and we both love it!  </li>
            <li> This iron is HOT!</li>
            <li> and I would like to know exactly what degree that is, not just a number 1-30!</li>
            <li> It is ceramic, and it gets hot!</li>
            <li> but overall, i love!</li>
            <li> Some years later, my neighbor told me she bought a new straightener from Walmart that had great reviews on Amazon</li>
            <li> The flat iron gets really hot and straightens my hair really good</li>
            <li> This flat iron ripped out a good chunk of my hair the first time I used it - the plates have some sort of gap at the ends/edges and they caught my hair as I was sliding it through.</li>
            <li> Came in a timely matter good flat irons but they do not get as hot as they say they do</li>
            <li> This seems to be a great little tool.</li>
            <li> It leaves hair with a great shine if you apply a little bit of the argon oil before blow drying.</li>
            <li> Best flat iron I have used in a long time!</li>
            <li> Well I tried it last night and it was amazing.  </li>
            <li> It heats up fast and leaves my hair feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I had remained shiny, smooth, and straight for 3 days (at the time of this writing)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight and straightens very well.</li>
            <li> This iron gives the hair a really straight smooth and shiny finish.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so smooth and stays straight for days.</li>
            <li> now is only one and the result are amazing everybody is asking me about my hair.</li>
            <li> and I have never been able to get her natural hair smooth and straight.</li>
            <li> I got the Infiniti Pro by Conair flat iron at Target today and I already love it!</li>
            <li> product proves that sometimes hype is for real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well worth it.</li>
            <li> This one is more light weight (not cheap feeling though) and designed better to straighten as well as add some wave if desired.  </li>
            <li> I def got my dollars worth ($10.00)</li>
            <li> I ordered this after reading the reviews and seeing more good than negative.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin, sleek, and works perfect.</li>
            <li> Seems to hold hair better than my old one which illiminates the need to hold the tip while turning iron.</li>
            <li> I find that I can get a better curl out of this than my old Chi straightener.</li>
            <li> I ended up replacing this a year later because it was catching my hair a lot and didn&#x27;t hold up well.</li>
            <li> Went to get my own the next day!  </li>
            <li> They work better than my old ones.</li>
            <li> Plus, from the point where I started to warm it up to \\&quot;all done!\\&quot; must have been only 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This iron is amazing--- stick straight results that are soft and not frizzy.  </li>
            <li> far as how it works, there is nothing outstanding about it.  </li>
            <li> I have curly hair, not thin or thick, but this iron gets the job done and was a great price!</li>
            <li> much better than my old Chi</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be fair, a flat iron isn&#x27;t called to do much when confronted with my hair.</li>
            <li> Even better then CHI and other top irons.</li>
            <li> HOT QUICK HAS SETTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR EACH HAIR TYPE.</li>
            <li> Gets super hot be cautious</li>
            <li> The handle does seem to get super hot which is a pain.</li>
            <li> for results, I was able to quickly straighten my fine hair, and my hair remained reasonably straight throughout the day, even though it was raining outside.  </li>
            <li> This is great because if I&#x27;m an active and forget it, it wouldn&#x27;t cost me much for my electric bill, etc.</li>
            <li> the super super straight, sleek, shiny look</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly and can be somewhat unruly to straighten but this was quick and easy.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron is amazing.</li>
            <li> Maybe for the price range its good compared to other hair irons.</li>
            <li> If you have the money, go to folica&#x27;s website (where i bought mine) and get a good Sedu or other brand...</li>
            <li> but the price was right.</li>
            <li> The size is just right, you can do bangs or any area with no problem.</li>
            <li> This product was cheap and brand new!</li>
            <li> It made my hair shiny, smooth and straight the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> I usually only buy hot &amp; gold products but these conairs are amazing</li>
            <li> still technically have some hair, so I gave it three stars for that, and because it&#x27;s a really pretty gadget with nice features on it.</li>
            <li> Love the high heat, quick warm up and automatic shut off (things that were missing in the $100 one I bought a year ago).</li>
            <li> I like that there are so many different heat settings and that there is a light that indicates when the straightener is ready for you to use.</li>
            <li> It barely takes more time than brushing.</li>
            <li> But, if you aren&#x27;t the best at using flat irons to curl, feather, etc., expect to see those flat iron lines on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  3 months later, I&#x27;ve grown to LOVE this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great price and it works just as well if not better than the chi</li>
            <li> I have not tried the Argan Oil that comes with it yet, but I used Garnier Fructis Sleek &amp; Shine Flat Iron Protector Straightening Mist with argan oil (less than $5.00) and it was a perfect combination.</li>
            <li> it started out as a great straightener but stopped functioning properly after only a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, this heats up super fast.</li>
            <li> The product delivers on its promise that it heats up quickly and is ready for use in no time.</li>
            <li> Heats up super fast.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and is very well designed.</li>
            <li> I had blow-dried my hair straight and took the straightener to it just to get out the mild kinks.  </li>
            <li> My daughter is just starting to straighten her own hair, and with this iron she does not have to worry as much about burning herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> SOO straight  and silky soft i love it.</li>
            <li> Heats up super fast.</li>
            <li> I use a heat setting of 10 (out of 30) and it gets my hair super straight.</li>
            <li> Hair glides naturally and easily.</li>
            <li> Also the power button is so sensitive on the handle and get turned off quite easily.</li>
            <li> Other than that, the Conair is an excellent flat iron and comes with a five-year warranty as opposed to Remington&#x27;s four-year (both are very generous).</li>
            <li> Best little flat iron for the money.</li>
            <li> This flat iron does wonders I fell in love the first time I used it and not pricey at all!</li>
            <li> The heat up time is super speedy fast, and it gets extremely hot.</li>
            <li> they really make my hair super straight and shinny!</li>
            <li> - I use them mainly to style and shape my already straight, fine</li>
            <li> It came very fast in the mail</li>
            <li> It heats up very fast.  </li>
            <li> It heats up very fast.</li>
            <li> The plates are smooth and aren&#x27;t rough on my hair like my last one.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for sure :)</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GREAT FLAT IRON I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT .IT GETS</li>
            <li> The flat iron heats fast, has a nice swivel cord.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to hold and use for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy a new one since they didn&#x27;t have the original one</li>
            <li> I would much rather spend a little more and get a better iron.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is an excellent price when compared to other high quality flat irons.  </li>
            <li> It does get really hot</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d give it one more chance with the Aragan oil in and nope, still kept doing the same thing.</li>
            <li> Also, somehow the hot plate of the Conair touched my face or part of my ear twice in the week</li>
            <li> pretty easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that one flaw I love this thing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a time saver!  </li>
            <li> It definitely helps with humidity and my hair is much more manageable than it was before.  </li>
            <li> and he was willing to purchase them for me</li>
            <li> Used them for the first time and</li>
            <li> OMG!...instant silky hair on my most coarse haired client.</li>
            <li> It makes for a pretty set up in my styling suite.</li>
            <li> Stays hot for an hour before it automatically shuts off.</li>
            <li> But a month later, the plates on the side of my iron have came off, where its not purple any more and its exposing hot metal.  </li>
            <li> Hair burns at 411 degrees fahrenheit, this goes higher.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on my first straightener</li>
            <li> If you do not hold it in just the right place, you will burn your hand as a large portion of the iron gets hot on the handle.  </li>
            <li> It also frizzed up more than when I used a Chi, which left it smoother.</li>
            <li> For a glorious two months, I found that my hair never looked so straight, shiny, healthy - and it stayed that way for days - barely any touch ups</li>
            <li> reason this straightener works so well is because it gets SO HOT.</li>
            <li> She says I gave myself a \\&quot;heat haircut\\&quot; ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the chi straighteners that claim to have heat-protecting qualities, or if I was just using this one too hot.</li>
            <li> Heats up SO fast, 15 seconds!</li>
            <li> Straight!</li>
            <li> Straight Hair!</li>
            <li> It flashes until it is hot.  </li>
            <li> carefully it comes out really nice.</li>
            <li> Purchased this iron and was pleased with it, but two weeks later it stopped heating up.  </li>
            <li> It is not expensive, but it just does not straighten my hair that well.</li>
            <li> I know this sounds pretty cliche&#x27; but this straightener is...</li>
            <li> I first became aware of this rather spendy condiment in specialty food stores but never bought it because of the price.</li>
            <li> I sparingly use a leave-in conditioner called Hydro Milk that I love; my stylist introduced it to me some years back</li>
            <li> I bought this because it&#x27;s the exact straightener I had that died on me.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair that is fairly coarse and frizzy on the top layer.  </li>
            <li> The heat is consistent and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.  </li>
            <li> Please bring more back in.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t love it enough to replace it.</li>
            <li> and it has done pretty well.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it has so many different settings that allow you to use it on a variety of hair types.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and a pretty purple color.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an inexpensive gift and is comparable with higher priced products like &amp;#34;Chi&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I told them that I had not yet used the hair iron because the first thing I did was check to make sure the plates were aligned properly (otherwise it will pull out hair).  </li>
            <li> Fast Shipping!  </li>
            <li> I use the iron on \\&quot;25\\&quot;, which is hot, but doesn&#x27;t fry my hair.</li>
            <li> and it gets really hot.</li>
            <li> pretty</li>
            <li> Thanks Conair!</li>
            <li> Works exactly like the Babyliss Nano Titanium</li>
            <li> It still straightens my hair just as good as the one that killed my hair.</li>
            <li> It is very hot (and has heat controls) and has a nice tight grip without damaging your hair.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased many flat irons at a MUCH higher price.</li>
            <li> It fits easily in the hand and slides smoothly and easily through my hair (which is quite thick).  </li>
            <li> Super Straight, Super Hot, Super Flat and Very shiny Hair!</li>
            <li> So then I finish opening the box and take the flat iron out to see: the top part of the case is not attached to the rest of the iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shopped and bought more flat irons than I care to admit.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron is okay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a flat iron on my hair for many years.  </li>
            <li> Fits my hand better than any flat iron that I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to replace too many Chi flat irons to ever buy another.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these flat irons.</li>
            <li> I researched flat irons as my daughter wanted a top name brand</li>
            <li> Love these flat irons.  </li>
            <li> I love this flat iron and it works so well on my frizzy, curly, chemically colored hair.</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron and so do my friends...</li>
            <li> After years of using Remington flat irons, I purchased the Conair Infiniti Pro because I have been so pleased with their hairdryer.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t of asked for a better flat iron</li>
            <li> armed with this Conair flat iron, I&#x27;m tempted to do it more</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe silky smooth straight hair just wasn&#x27;t in the cards for me unless I went to the salon because somehow they always managed to make my hair look straight, flat, and fabulous.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stylish, and as good as any much more expensive flat irons.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this flat iron!</li>
            <li> Just love it flat iorn!</li>
            <li> The package arrived earlier than expected which was great</li>
            <li> and I feel that I don&#x27;t get my hair as straight as when I used my normal pinch of hair which doesn&#x27;t cover the full plate.</li>
            <li> I am an African American with fairly course hair</li>
            <li> I swipe the flat iron through my (straight, fine!)</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron!!</li>
            <li> It heated up fairly quickly and straightened my hair, however, it always left my hair frizzy even when I used special products like [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Heats up very fast and straightens very well.</li>
            <li> and I have heard nothing but positive comments from the three of them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another positive is the 5 year warranty.  </li>
            <li> Based on all the positive reviews here</li>
            <li> However, the first time I used it, it fried the ends of my hair and made the rest of my hair very brittle.</li>
            <li> It heats up hot and fast and glides through your hair like silk.</li>
            <li> The purple color is cute without being too girly, and the cord is plenty long for any outlet-to-mirror distance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also love how long the ceramic planks are.</li>
            <li> I would probably not go higher than 400 degrees because it can really fry your ends.</li>
            <li> This product gets hot fast.  </li>
            <li> This product really does get hot.</li>
            <li> I promised I would treat myself to this Iron very soon because my weave clients keep demanding straight!</li>
            <li> Gets really hot and worked really well.</li>
            <li> but it still is pretty fast</li>
            <li> I also like that the plates are long so that I can do more hair at once.  </li>
            <li> Gets hot fast.</li>
            <li> Iron area is longer than what I&#x27;m use to, and the whole area where irons are gets too hot to touch; but I am getting use to it.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant at first cause</li>
            <li> I also love how long the plates are.</li>
            <li> This is just as good as the Chi, if not better.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of cowlicks and wave, but it did a fairly good job of defeating most of those, or at least the ones on the outside of my hair.  </li>
            <li> This iron works as good, if not better than the ones you get in salons.</li>
            <li> The temperature setting guide tells you what temperature range for your hair type: low 1-8 for fine hair to maximum 26-30 for very resistant hair (their words!).  </li>
            <li> It leaves less static after each use and heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> I find this flat iron a waste of my money honestly , i have curly hair, this flat iron burned my hair a lot and did not create that healthy shine i was looking for, it probably works better for people with straight hair, but it did not work so well with me.</li>
            <li> My old iron had them right on the top of the grip &amp; I was constantly turning it off or changing the temp by accident.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron is very good for such a low price, and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product if you need a flat iron with true ceramic plates that wont break the bank and are better than other advertised so called #1 products.</li>
            <li> When I was reviewing straighteners, I found this one in the top 5 next to the high end, $100.00 brands...</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron!!!!</li>
            <li> , I haven&#x27;t used it on my hair, because mine is super short and very, very straight!</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly, gets far hotter than my CHI, and I can do my hair a lot faster with the Conair.</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly and recovers lost heat equally well.  </li>
            <li> works fabulous to create curls that last the whole day as well !</li>
            <li> I guess with the stellar reviews I expected more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously only owned more expensive straighteners (Chi, corioliss) - and I found that this very inexpensive one was MORE effective at straightening my hair.</li>
            <li> Certainly I know this</li>
            <li> I then run my fingers through the section I had just curled (burned) and large chunks of hair fall out.  </li>
            <li> this certainly does not reach 455 degrees....</li>
            <li> Overall, this is my new favorite toy</li>
            <li> This makes me happy because I&#x27;m a low maintenance type of person so the less time I need to spend on my hair</li>
            <li> This is the first cheap flat iron I have bought, and I will never buy one again.</li>
            <li> I have only tried it at a lower heat (10-15) because I don&#x27;t want to burn my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> It was in my frugalista opinion a pretty decent deal, my friend has a CHI</li>
            <li> I have short thick hair that straightens easily, and I had a Chi (which I loved) but it broke.</li>
            <li> , if you like your flat irons really really hot, then this one is good for you, but be careful.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little straightener with one problem.</li>
            <li> Definitely made my hair jet straight and quick!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s short, fine, color-treated, and already fairly straight.</li>
            <li> but then I glanced right next to it and found the New Conair Infinity Oil infused Ceramic Flat Iron that reaches an astonishing 455 degrees!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too easy to turn this flat iron on and off.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the remington keratin therapy iron and it&#x27;s far superior, though a little heavier and doesn&#x27;t heat as quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this also because if you are not careful it is very easy to burn the fingers....it needs to be held at the very tip of the rods only</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest and say I&#x27;ve never used a CHI or comparable brand, but this one sure works well for the little bit of money I spent on it.  </li>
            <li> I have very healthy hair and very little is in the brush after I wash and brush through it.</li>
            <li> This one is much lighter, and also gets much hotter.</li>
            <li> for the straight, shiny look that I&#x27;ve been wanting to achieve, this seems to be the tool.</li>
            <li> I note that by just a flick of the wrist, I can get a bit of a curl at the bottom, which is very nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Depends on the product you put on your hair before you iron it, it irons very well</li>
            <li> My hair is fairly straight (with wave) to begin with and curls</li>
            <li> After a day of sprinkling rain and lots of humidity my hair remained straight as a ruler and still glossy with no flyaways because of the argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s partly because this iron gets hotter &amp; it gets hotter much faster.  </li>
            <li> - Very resistant hair</li>
            <li> The unit heats up REALLY fast-- really fast.</li>
            <li> Ceramic coated tourmaline plates really do reduce frizz and make straightening rather effortless.  </li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> appreciate the temperature controls although I don&#x27;t really adjust the heat  at all</li>
            <li> it doesnt put to much pressure on the ends of the hair.</li>
            <li> She has very course hair</li>
            <li> This iron does a fast a job on both of them.</li>
            <li> very shiny.&lt;br /&gt;In case you wondered</li>
            <li> It looked very shiny to them, and I thought so too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really used it much as yet</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very durable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both cheap and pricey irons - my last one, a gift, was retailing at over $150, and worked well until it broke after 4 years of devoted use.  </li>
            <li> It really just pulls your hair.  </li>
            <li> It gets my hair supremely straight.</li>
            <li> #34;heat up&amp;#34; after the light shuts off and you have to turn it back on!)</li>
            <li> if you really want to save money, but it makes my hair look greasy and snags my hair all the time.</li>
            <li> It steams very well,  </li>
            <li> This heats up fast and leaves my hair shiny.</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Glides threw really well, hair staightend with one glide.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really glide through my hair as promised--there is a lot of friction.  </li>
            <li> It gets it bone straight on the 20 setting</li>
            <li> Got hair really straight</li>
            <li> I am very upset about this purchase.</li>
            <li> it was very affordable too.</li>
            <li> In fact, it is so light that several times the weight of the cord pulled it off of the bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li> but shipping was fast</li>
            <li> and this gets my hair straight.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li> well really it didn&#x27;t get my hair as straight as i wanted...</li>
            <li> I used it the more my hair became rough, damaged, and brittled.</li>
            <li> (I also figured that I could leave one at my parents&#x27; house and finally really retire my trusty Solano).</li>
            <li> Conair heats fast (maybe a bit faster than the Remington</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s no worse</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and it does not fry or tangle your hair.</li>
            <li> heats up fast.</li>
            <li> I got straight, but frizzy hair after spending 2-3 hours straightening it.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a great buy, and the only thing I&#x27;ve ever gotten from Conair that I actually like!</li>
            <li> I appreciate the longer plates, which makes curling longer hair much easier.  </li>
            <li> It gets my hair so straight</li>
            <li> I am very upset with Conair producing this piece of junk.  </li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t beat $20 dollars and the shipping was fast</li>
            <li> When I use this in addition to the blow dryer I think my hair looks very polished.</li>
            <li> I did not want to spend too much money for a product that I&#x27;m going to use every once&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> The price is extremely reasonable for the item that you&#x27;re getting.  </li>
            <li> The ones ones that cost twice as much as this one don&#x27;t even begin to compare.</li>
            <li> The light flashes while it heats up and then goes solid once it gets to temperature!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I immediately saw that the plates do not meet flush the whole length.  </li>
            <li> It was straight with one pass.</li>
            <li> Gets my hair bone straight.  </li>
            <li> Just once to get it straight</li>
            <li> I felt that this transaction was handled very unprofessionally.</li>
            <li> did I mention that my hair looked REALLY</li>
            <li> I have REALLY curly hair.  </li>
            <li> It heats up lightning fast and is very durable.</li>
            <li> I was very devestated about that.</li>
            <li> My hair is fairly straight to begin with</li>
            <li> My daughter has very curly hair and wanted it straight</li>
            <li> I found this very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> like that it&#x27;s lightweight, heats fast, doesn&#x27;t catch on hair.</li>
            <li> It still leaves hair straight</li>
            <li> but if it does, do NOT use too much on your hair at one time, you don&#x27;t want it to be greasy.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and straightens with no problem.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, the iron has multiple heat settings (30) which makes it easy to adjust the temperature to suit your particular hair needs.  </li>
            <li> I used my cousin&#x27;s flat iron (which happened to be this one) and instantly fell in love!</li>
            <li> Straightens the hair without pulling them, in other words it works very smoothly.</li>
            <li> I have fine Caucasian hair with some stubborn waves, which is why I use a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I had been using a Remington flat iron that worked fine but is no comparison to this one.  </li>
            <li> It easily straightens and smooths my long straight hair.  </li>
            <li> It definitely gets hot really quick, as advertised.  </li>
            <li> However, it was not very expensive, so</li>
            <li> I received my Conair CS710R Infiniti Pro flat iron free from the Amazon Vine program in exchange for writing a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this flat iron makes the hair shinny and smooth.</li>
            <li> AND SHE LOVES  IT BETTER THAN HER OTHER ONE.IT</li>
            <li> Other than that I am so pleased.</li>
            <li> For the first few uses, I liked how it made my hair silky and soft.  </li>
            <li> flat iron heats up pretty quickly, 5-10 sec.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> the color looks exactly like the picture  and leaves my hair soft and straight</li>
            <li> I have long fine curly hair and this iron works well for me.  </li>
            <li> I own the CHI flat iron, but came in need of an additional flat iron when my sister took it to an out of town getaway.</li>
            <li> When I first purchased this flat iron I loved it, but after using it for a few months it is severely damaging my hair.</li>
            <li> It has multiple heat settings, heats up very, very fast, and leaves my hair feeling SUPER soft!</li>
            <li> It heats up super fast and heats up to 455 degrees as apposed to the Chi which only heats up to 397 degrees.</li>
            <li> It heats up fairly quickly, depending on the temp you have it set on, so coming back to an iron that has turned off isn&#x27;t that much of a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it gives me the same amazing results every single time.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a straightener that was hot enough to keep my thinner hair straight and give it a thickness.</li>
            <li> I like this flat iron much better than the first flat iron I bought around 4 years ago.  </li>
            <li> First let me say that I&#x27;m a professional hairstylist....</li>
            <li> Another plus for this iron is that the outside of the iron stays relatively cool to the touch.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just that it doesn&#x27;t look too hot after it has been slept on and unless it has been ironed, can get a tad frizzy near the scalp closest to parts of my face if the weather&#x27;s humid.</li>
            <li> I put mine at hottest setting, though, so if you turn it down some it should be better.</li>
            <li> Better than the 3 other $50 to $100 straighteners I&#x27;ve owned before it!</li>
            <li> I adore my new product!</li>
            <li> To its benefit, the iron stays relative cool to the touch despite the high temperatures of the plates.  </li>
            <li> If you have never used a good quality (expensive) flat iron before, you might be OK with it.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m really pleased with such a reasonably priced flat iron working so well!</li>
            <li> The product made a popping sound like something was burning (again, my hair was totally dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sending it back and heading to Target to pay ten more dollars for it.</li>
            <li> I have numerous scorch marks on my counters because my current iron doesn&#x27;t have auto shut off so this will save me from adding any more.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s better than the most expensive irons out there.</li>
            <li> I noticed though, that when you clamp the iron, it does not fully clamp; there is a tiny gap on the bottom portion of the actual iron that doesn&#x27;t fully close unless you add more pressure to your hands on the grip portion.</li>
            <li> It is slim, heats up quick and only requires one or two passes max.</li>
            <li> it only gets too hot if you put it too hot</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair, which is much thicker and coarser required two passes through the iron (for each section) but her hair still looked shiny, soft, and straight after a day at school (and being in the rain)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair, which is much thicker and coarser required two passes through the iron (for each section) but her hair still looked shiny, soft, and straight after a day at school (and being in the rain)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was a decent straightner for the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps I should appreciate my waves, more, but with my layered haircut it can turn into a frizz-bomb once I&#x27;ve brushed it thoroughly on the second day after washing it, even in it&#x27;s-a-dry-heat Arizona.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall a decent iron for a decent price, but</li>
            <li> First of all let me say that this iron has the potential to be a great flat iron, but their are few design flaws.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to receive this flat iron, especially after all the great reviews I read and the fact that I found it for ten dollars less than at Target.</li>
            <li> Both the plates and the outside of the iron get very hot</li>
            <li> The color is very pretty too, its a deep plum color.</li>
            <li> I purchased a larger Conair hair straightener over a year ago and was impressed by how well it worked with my thick, long hair.  </li>
            <li> but in any case, the hair stayed flat for a full day, before it was time to shower again.</li>
            <li> Heats quickly, glides through hair easily, makes my thick coarse hair soft, smooth, &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this iron.</li>
            <li> The heat is highly adjustable on this model, but I kept it somewhere in the middle(15), since I don&#x27;t want to fry my hair.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend trying it out.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> We chose this straightener out of all the others because of it&#x27;s high quality and durability.</li>
            <li> Becareful because too high of a setting can burn your hair.</li>
            <li> I burnt end of my hair because I set it up too high.</li>
            <li> HIghly recommend.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommended</li>
            <li> It has a range of temperatures, so I could set it at the high end of medium for the relentless frizz.</li>
            <li> thanks to the fact that this leaves hair straight and smooth on the first pass as opposed to others I have tried that take several tries.</li>
            <li> This flat iron and some heat protectant got hair so straight that it looked like she had a fresh relaxer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for several months, and I&#x27;m still pleased with it.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and has a big range of heat settings on a dial which is easy to set and leave at that setting for later use.  </li>
            <li> It heats up way hotter than my last flat iron -which costs way more than this product.</li>
            <li> The Conair CS710R Infiniti Pro 1 Inch Tourmaline Ceramic Flat Iron offers a super sleek design with high quality plates that yield a super shiny and extra straight finish.</li>
            <li> and I got this to get closer to the roots on top of my head and to add a little bit of wave.</li>
            <li> The outside gets ridiculously hot!  </li>
            <li> Save yourself some heartache and spend a little more money on quality.</li>
            <li> flat iron heats rapidly- within 15 seconds, and can reach temperatures up to 455 degrees (F), enabling quick and efficient styling.</li>
            <li> I have had professionals use hair straighteners that work a little better, but for my everyday use, this one is okay.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair, its natural.</li>
            <li> She has naturally wavy hair and likes to keep it straight.</li>
            <li> It leaves my curly hair really straight and soft.</li>
            <li> I NORMALLY WOULD</li>
            <li> Normally even if I like my hair in the bathroom</li>
            <li> iron has multiple heat settings and gets really, really hot...really fast!  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this iron at first as it is conair, but I went ahead and got it anyway because it got some really good reviews.</li>
            <li> but my hair is not smooth and it sounds like you need to buy the oil to make the iron work better.  </li>
            <li> it worth for the price, but sometime doesn&#x27;t get enough heat.</li>
            <li> normally take 3 hour to do my hair</li>
            <li> I have 3 daughters with long full hair</li>
            <li> Heats up very quickly and straightens my thick curly hair pretty well!</li>
            <li> It gets hot enough that I can straighten my hair quickly and without going over the same piece of hair for what seems like thousands of times.</li>
            <li> After flat ironing a section of hair, sometimes it will be too hot to touch when you release it!</li>
            <li> If you want to save a few bucks and get a more economical flat iron, this is the one.</li>
            <li> This flat iron gets hot!</li>
            <li> This flat iron is a million times better than my old one by the same company!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this straightener for the budget conscious shopper!</li>
            <li> This flat iron gets hot, fast.</li>
            <li> This flat iron gets so hot, made so much smoke it set off my  smoke detectors.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to curl the ends under, but all the problems involved in getting it that way are not worth it.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a high quality, moderately priced flat iron, this one would do just fine.</li>
            <li> Even on the highest setting, I had to go over the same chunk of hair 2-3 times (and ouch was it hot!), and that COMPLETELY destroyed my hair.</li>
            <li> , I realized that it could be my new iron.</li>
            <li> I had to buy a new straightener after I brought my Chi to Israel and my straighter was fried.</li>
            <li> For this reason  I am now on the hunt to buy a new straightener to replace this one.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a new look, it has been over 2 years since I have put any type of heat towards my hair.</li>
            <li> The new one I got</li>
            <li> I have had this straightener for about 8 months and it works as new.</li>
            <li> Item was shipped promptly, arrived new in box with all contents as described.</li>
            <li> I can live with that.</li>
            <li> unfortunately as I live in Australia</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t have to buy a new straightener, and after a year of not having one, I went to Fred Meyer, and got the Infiniti Pro Conair.</li>
            <li> What upsets me is: it&#x27;s so easy to just open the box and inspect the flat iron.</li>
            <li> flat iron is easy to use - it heats up almost instantly, and in 6 or 7 passes, I&#x27;ve gone through my hair.</li>
            <li> but it definitely enhanced the performace of the curling iron and left her hair smooth and shiney.</li>
            <li> It heats up in less than a minute, glides through my hair like butter and not only leaves my hair straight but also leaves it shiny and smooth!</li>
            <li> It has 30 heat settings and I used setting 10 for the front and 15 in the back, my hair came out very silk straight.</li>
            <li> only thing I really don&#x27;t like about the Infiniti is the fact that the blades don&#x27;t lock--I really like this feature on my Remington</li>
            <li> It arrived before expected date , it came in a big box with a lot of protection , it does the job same or better than a CHI !</li>
            <li> My hair will stay straight for days after with barely a touch up!  </li>
            <li> I have very straight, Asian/White hair which does not like to hold a curl and my curls literally last for days with this iron!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to have finally found a flat iron that actually straightens my extremely curly hair.</li>
            <li> Very nice and doesn&#x27;t burn my very thin hair.</li>
            <li> The heating element allows for a wide range of heat settings with a rheostat (like a dimmer) that allows you to finely set the temperature rather than the more common hi-lo or hi-med-lo settings.</li>
            <li> Wife says it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to do the job.  </li>
            <li> So background first, I&#x27;m a mixed girl (black/Italian)</li>
            <li> I tried this hair straightener on my hair for the first time last week</li>
            <li> This flat iron works very well and gets my hair straight without frizz or burning.</li>
            <li> The first one I got blew out after a couple of short term usages.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li> I love the small bottle of argan oil that comes with this product.</li>
            <li> I just picked up a second one (my first one broke, I stepped on it)and</li>
            <li> tourmaline platted iron leaves my hair soft silky &amp; shiny !&lt;</li>
            <li> I used to struggle getting my hair straight but thanks to these flat irons</li>
            <li> But I keep this baby on a low setting and it gets my hair bone straight!</li>
            <li> the curls with this iron are so pretty and last all day.</li>
            <li> Professional quality!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> The outside of the iron is almost as hot as the plates on the inside.</li>
            <li> I put a small dab of oil on it before pressing it and it came out silky and smooth!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Several years ago, I bought an inexpensive flat iron from a local beauty store, and I think I used it precisely three times.</li>
            <li> It gets really hot, which is key.  </li>
            <li> I used it for the first time last night and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> It works better than expected and it is so much cheaper on here than in other retail locations.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, although the flat iron proclaims \\&quot;15 second heat up,\\&quot; the initial heating time is more than 15 seconds, and it seems like this might apply to the time IN BETWEEN STRAIGHTENING.</li>
            <li> I bought this for less than $30 on Amazon and it is a huge bang for my buck.</li>
            <li> It is cool that the CS710R will automatically recover its heat if unplugged or power is lost...and it is an essential safety feature in my house that the iron will auto shut off if left</li>
            <li> When I used the iron at the \\&quot;21\\&quot; setting, the outside of the plates stayed cool the entire time I used the iron.</li>
            <li> The only positive things I can say about this product?  </li>
            <li> Before using this flat iron I put Avon&#x27;s heat protectant on and try to leave it on a couple minutes as it dries before applying the hot ceramic plates on it.</li>
            <li> This is my first flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this flat iron is the metal plates don&#x27;t close flush all the way across.</li>
            <li> The flat iron heats REALLY fast!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to a flat iron that stays the correct temperature consistently.</li>
            <li> I think that means the temperature setting is higher, or perhaps my newfound wisdom to NEVER use a flat iron without a conditioner/oil (through Hair Guy advice) made a difference...</li>
            <li> It heats up very quick and the plates are in position so that hair doesn&#x27;t get trapped in the space between the plates and the plastic near the ends of the plates.</li>
            <li> Only the top half meets.  </li>
            <li> have been using the flat iron for about three months now and so far it is still working well consistently.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you necessarily have to spend a lot on a flat iron to get a good one(the one I had before this was $30 and lasted me several years), but this is a really low quality flat iron even for the price.</li>
            <li> I appreciated this feature in particular because I like my long hair pin-straight except for a soft wave at the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my second one only because a 200lb person stepped on my first one which lasted two years!</li>
            <li> Secondly the outside plastic of the metal plates gets extremely hot when in use!</li>
            <li> When the temp was turned up for my daughter to use, the outside of the iron became warm, but never hot enough to burn my daughter (which is more than I can say for any of our other irons, including a Chi knock-off, a Remington, and two other Conairs)  </li>
            <li> Only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it&#x27;s a little long and the top part gets really hot</li>
            <li> I had to put it to almost thirty to get the desired heat that I was wanting for my hair because it would have a hard time straightening, but I still had to go over the same lock of hair over and over again to make sure it&#x27;s straight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of flat irons and this is the only one that leaves my hair feeling silky and smooth and not dry and damaged.</li>
            <li> I am currently pregnant and have thick curly hair (even more so due to vitamins).  </li>
            <li> It is pretty long and the plates don&#x27;t completely meet all of the way</li>
            <li> At least I&#x27;ll be able to see it&#x27;s condition before taking it home.</li>
            <li> My old curling iron broke, and</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> And my hair looks soft, silky, and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I gave them my old one</li>
            <li> It actually worked really well,</li>
            <li> but so far this one is working</li>
            <li> And when used with the Argon oil that comes with it, it leaves my hair soft and shiny, always a plus.</li>
            <li> It did not over heat or anything, it just unexpectedly shut off.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and has several heat settings to choose from.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it once and am pleasantly surprised -</li>
            <li> I need it to flatten the kinks in my naturally wavy hair, and it does the trick.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I really like it and would recommend it to anyone with untamable hair</li>
            <li> It works perfectly on my natural hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly</li>
            <li> far exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li> Hair is soft afer using.  </li>
            <li> I realized my hair was suddenly really damaged, compared to how it was two months earlier, before I bought the Infiniti pro.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for natural and weave.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft</li>
            <li> Then the paint started chipping completely.</li>
            <li> Since I have gone natural</li>
            <li> I ordered this with my 11 year old in mind.  </li>
            <li> It is about the same size as my iron, but it is much lighter.  </li>
            <li> The plates don;t even come completely together.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely heartbroken.</li>
            <li> I had a busy week and used it about 4x that week</li>
            <li> There is nothing that pinches my hair either, like on an old iron I have.  </li>
            <li> It has always straightened my hair like a stylist leaving it silky smooth and never &#x27;overcooked&#x27; or dried out.  </li>
            <li> I actually don&#x27;t straighten my hair with it, because my hair is mostly straight.</li>
            <li> I only need to curl my hair once and it lasts for the whole day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was also surprised to find out that the plates weren&#x27;t \\&quot;floating\\&quot; -</li>
            <li> She has used it for a couple months so far</li>
            <li> Wow...</li>
            <li> There was a loud snap, a visible spark, and the iron tripped my breaker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d much prefer actual temps.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like my old chi</li>
            <li> So excited, in fact, that I did next day delivery, which I normally do not do.</li>
            <li> Not perfect, but good value for the price.</li>
            <li> I knew the price was too good to b true :(</li>
            <li> One in particular I remembered that was highly reviewed was the Remington Ceramic Tourmaline Flat Iron!</li>
            <li> Heats Up Quickly, And Allows The Hair To Become Completely Straight Without Doing Excessive Passes Through Each Strand.</li>
            <li> as for the heat, well it definitely gets hot enough but I had to constantly go over my thick (Asian&amp;African American) hair, so I feel like the quality of the plates wasn&#x27;t that good.</li>
            <li> It heats up correctly but once you start straightening your hair the light starts flashing, indicating that it&#x27;s not hot enough again.</li>
            <li> My hair looks so much nicer with flat ironing than having it natural.</li>
            <li> As long as I&#x27;m careful not to hit that button, everything works fine</li>
            <li> (I have very fine, but thick blonde hair  that doesn&#x27;t take much heat to get it to totally straighten or curl.)</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am just a little concerned about how fast it heats up and how hot it does get.</li>
            <li> This flat iron heats up really fast; they claim 15 seconds</li>
            <li> I am not one to use a flat iron very often.</li>
            <li> NEVER BEEN MUCH OF A CURLING IRON OR FLAT IRON PERSON</li>
            <li> This flat iron is the real deal.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is very well made.</li>
            <li> When flat ironing my hair, I also noticed that it one takes 1-2 glides for the hair to be straight and shiny</li>
            <li> The flat iron works very well.  </li>
            <li> I have had several other flat irons and this is my favorite yet.</li>
            <li> I am mixed (black, white, Indian and more)</li>
            <li> and this gets hot enough to straighten my hair and last up to 2 days without needing a touch up.</li>
            <li> It blinks until it&#x27;s hot and stays on solid red.</li>
            <li> the light blinks indicating it has cooled down and needs time to get back to the max temp.</li>
            <li> I would recommend trying a very small amount the first time (you really don&#x27;t need much for \\&quot;normal\\&quot; hair).  </li>
            <li> Only downfall I can say is that there is no cool spot on it to hold such as at the top</li>
            <li> Thought the longer iron would be nice, but it actually make it a little harder to have control of the iron.  </li>
            <li> The only Issue I have is that, while using the flat iron the on/off button is located in a position where you can easily press it, so be careful.</li>
            <li> For the first couple months it had worked amazingly, turning my frizzy hair to glassy straight hair but recently, when I plug it in to use, the straightener can&#x27;t seem to heat to the said 455 degrease and have trouble straightening even the smallest piece of hair (I could tough the plates without burning myself when I put it on the hottest setting).</li>
            <li> My hair stays straight all day long.  </li>
            <li> I have REALLY puffy curly/wavy LONG hair nd its a pain to get it straightened but with this straightener</li>
            <li> The plastic shell is not thick enough to protect your fingers from the heat of the plates, so they burn.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> The handle does get a bit hot, if I&#x27;m not careful, and grab outside of a very specific &#x27;handle&#x27; zone.  </li>
            <li> This iron doesn&#x27;t seem to heat up as hot as I expected, and my hair gets stuck between the plates, causing breakage.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron is the only one that I&#x27;ve found that does exactly what it says that it will.  </li>
            <li> was using a cheap 2-inch non-ceramic flat iron, and was concerned about going down to the 1-inch iron</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair straight hair so</li>
            <li> I have very fine and thin hair.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair</li>
            <li> and you would think even the crappiest of flat irons would straighten my hair in a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> I needed a smaller straightener to accommodate a new shorter hair style.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron with high hopes based on the reviews.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have tremendously high expectations for my flat irons</li>
            <li> Only buy if you have short hair and need to fix hair fast.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to reflat after the first initial ironing (as long as you straighten with a bristle brush proceeding the iron).</li>
            <li> So, I spent a few bucks on this cheapy one and LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this, but I guess since I used a Sedu for the last 4 years I shouldn&#x27;t have expected much.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this flat iron to anyone!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a month now, and no broken or otherwise damaged tresses yet, probably because a single application maintains my preferred style until my hair needs washing again.</li>
            <li> I have never done that with the Corioliss or even the cheap little flat irons I order from a Hong Kong dealer to keep in my desk drawer at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have left my old one on all day!  </li>
            <li> When they work at all, they usually dry out my hair, and since I&#x27;m a bottle blonde, that&#x27;s the first step toward damage-induced</li>
            <li> so it comes down to whether or not locking blades are important enough to merit paying a bit extra.</li>
            <li> i have to go over my hair with this flat iron several times before it even looks decently straight.</li>
            <li> Recently, it&#x27;s been turning off on its own either when I&#x27;m running the item through my hair or having it try to heat up and usually when that happens it won&#x27;t turn back on again after pressing the power button several times (then I would have to unplug and plug back in again).</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, so I can&#x27;t speak for anyone with thick hair.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re in the market for a new flat iron and don&#x27;t want to spend hundreds of dollars for a high-end salon quality hair straightener</li>
            <li> But after my Chi iron&#x27;s plug broke I had to get a new flat iron.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I decided to take a detour through the Hair care section to see what&#x27;s new and check out their Flat Irons.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron because I was just in the market for a new one.</li>
            <li> I have long fine hair that is wavy and this straightener tames everything in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Clean cut at last, I have used other flat irons and none work this well.</li>
            <li> I tried to pawn it off as an early Christmas present but she wasn&#x27;t buying that.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t marked by the burn, but I definitely felt it.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this 1 inch Conair straightener and have had no regrets.  </li>
            <li> This is a definite upgrade from my last iron and appears comparable to the higher end more expensive straighteners.</li>
            <li> My last professional model was 1 year and it stopped working in 6 months.  </li>
            <li> The power button is constantly being turned off and on if you hold this where you&#x27;d  naturally want to, ei the handle</li>
            <li> some* people will like it if they have never experienced better (I have used a Chi, so</li>
            <li> and i was so afraid to get a different brand because my old one worked so good</li>
            <li> I set the temperature at 15 (only half as hot as this iron gets) and voila!</li>
            <li> I am a caucasian female with very fine, thin, wavy hair...</li>
            <li> I had been using an older style Conair flat iron, that looks very similar to this one.  </li>
            <li> I like how it&#x27;s thin and doesn&#x27;t take very long to warm up.</li>
            <li> This straightener heats up hotter than my previous straighteners (Chi &amp; Hot Tools).</li>
            <li> i owned previously and much cheaper!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African american woman with natural hair and it does wonders!</li>
            <li> This straightener is extremely light-weight and makes my hair sleek and straight.</li>
            <li> I bought it to replace my old flat iron, and this one one works</li>
            <li> This leaves my hair considerably smoother and flat instead of puffy.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy, fuzzy hair and this flat iron</li>
            <li> The only con I have to say is that whoever packed my argan oil must not of closed the lid because the whole bottle was inside the bag it came in.</li>
            <li> Lastly, it leaves crimps in my hair from where I first close the iron down on my hair.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of very thin wavy hair and can get a decent straightening out of most flat irons</li>
            <li> I own over 10 flat irons ranging from random walmart buys to expensive \\&quot;high end\\&quot; flat irons, and this one works better</li>
            <li> I have returned the 2nd one and am starting my search for a new flat iron anew.  </li>
            <li> I had a yellow and black straightener from Conair and it did absolutely nothing!</li>
            <li> the ends are touching each other, you would have to press hard</li>
            <li> so my hair is very hard to do anything with and this made it seem so easy.</li>
            <li> Anyway, back to hair, I have medium course hair below shoulder length the mid torso depending on the time of year and when I get around to cutting it and this flat iron is amazing!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves playing with my hair in general, but when I use this iron he can&#x27;t keep his hands off my hair and constantly compliments the softness.</li>
            <li> I had an old Conair flat iron and  stop working last weekend after 6 years</li>
            <li> I have thick full bouncy curly hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little smoother as it glides over my hair, and I think it flattens my wavy hair a bit faster than the first model, due to the high heat.  </li>
            <li> I have gone back to my natural hair curl pattern a couple times after straightening with these flat irons!</li>
            <li> but it does not champ down very well</li>
            <li> I exchanged for a new one anyway, hoping at least the outside would not get so hot to the touch.  </li>
            <li> The plates are my main problem other than that it was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s difficult to find a flat iron that heats up warm enough.  </li>
            <li> Stays straight as long as you don&#x27;t get it wet.</li>
            <li> I have been flat ironing since college (9 years ago) and my old flat iron was retired this weekend.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thin, semi straight with a slight wave to it and easily straightens at 370.</li>
            <li> It gets too hot and it is not easy to handle.</li>
            <li> and I will likely get another Remington, as I have done in the past and always had success with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to flat-ironing, but it really can&#x27;t be that hard.  </li>
            <li> My hair is always silky smooth after I am done using it and it doesn&#x27;t damage it as much as other straighteners have in the past.</li>
            <li> That evening I tried the iron on one of my African American Client who has quite a bit of long thick fantastic bushy coarse Un-relaxed hair!</li>
            <li> Decent price but not worth the consequences.</li>
            <li> In addition, whether I try to curl or straighten, this iron creates little crimps in my hair from the edges (and it doesn&#x27;t glide over very well which might be the issue).</li>
            <li> DOES TAKE OUT THE FRIZZ AND MAKES IT STRAIGHT AND WILL EVEN GIVE A LITTLE</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter, who has straight hair but needs a little touch up in the mornings before school to get rid of that bedhead look.  </li>
            <li> these little babies work like a charm you really don&#x27;t need to crank them all the way up just a bit and your hair will go from wavy to sraight .</li>
            <li> Perhaps if your hair is very thick and can fill the huge amount of space between the plates this might work for you... for everyone else, I would pass.</li>
            <li> I have course curly hair and for 10 years I used a $150 Paul Mitchell iron (the original green and black one).</li>
            <li> while in Walmart I pulled it up to check out reviews and seen some good some bad.</li>
            <li> Also, since it isn&#x27;t very thick it is very useful to make curls.</li>
            <li> So I read some reviews and found the Conair Infiniti Pro came highly recommended and at less than $40</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the on-off button is right where your finger lands, so I keep accidentally hitting it.</li>
            <li> ;) only thing is the paint came off on the flat iron not okay with that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had all the high end, super expensive flat irons and this one beats them all.</li>
            <li> I only need one or two passes through my thick curly mixed race hair to create pure silk!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the same flat iron for over ten years.  </li>
            <li> I give this flat iron four stars because it works perfectly especially with my extra kinky hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried more expensive, salon rated flat irons and still none compare to this tool.</li>
            <li> I have a generic \\&quot;chi\\&quot; flat iron that I bought at a local beauty supply store, and my daughter is always borrowing it.  </li>
            <li> This works as well as my more expensive flat iron.  </li>
            <li> flat iron will definitely be going back</li>
            <li> I use this more than the expensive flat iron my daughter bought me for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I have a very similar flat iron that I bought from Costco, but it&#x27;s red..</li>
            <li> Guess I&#x27;ll just have to buy another one because this was the best flat iron I ever bought. :&#x27;(</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d try to save $ and get a flat iron that could potentially do both jobs.</li>
            <li> I like that the plates are longer than regular sized flat irons.</li>
            <li> Both of my daughters straighten their hair and have had several flat irons over the years.  </li>
            <li> and it always burned my fingers because of its shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ends of the flat iron constantly yank out strands of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This flat iron definitely gives you the bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend trying this flat iron.</li>
            <li> In between passes at my hair, since the flat iron had to recover each time, I would put it back on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> this is my THIRD infinity pro conair flat iron</li>
            <li> I used medium high (15-20), 17, for my thick, shoulder length, African-American, natural hair.  </li>
            <li> I got the Conair CS710R Infiniti Pro 1 Inch Tourmaline Ceramic Flat Iron to replace a no-name flat iron that my stepdaughter got at one of those mall kiosks (at double the price of this iron).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Normally, I buy pricey Corioliss ones that work well enough and feel heavy and substantial in my hand.</li>
            <li> While my other flat irons definitely helped, my hair would still be pretty puffy and not really smooth.  </li>
            <li> and I liked the results that gave me as well, but it was so heavy and made my arms tired to hold it up for so long (I have very long hair).</li>
            <li> and I would definitely recommend this flat iron to anyone on a budget!!!</li>
            <li> I thought maybe it was just excessive because my hair had been in a ponytail for like 2 days straight</li>
            <li> &amp; I would say that&#x27;s pretty close at least at my optimal</li>
            <li> i like the fact that it doesnt close because, it doesnt put to mch pressure on the ends which can make it weak and break off, also it doesnt put to much heat on the ends which doesnt allow much breakage, as other flat irons would.</li>
            <li> It also works much faster than straighteners I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> I discovered this flat iron on a beach trip with my daughter and her friends.  </li>
            <li> I asked one of the girls to use their flat irons</li>
            <li> and once I got it out of the shipping box, I heard some rattling going on inside the box that held the flat iron.</li>
            <li> You can see the rest of the screws floating about in the bag that holds the flat iron.</li>
            <li> B001AQY3PG TIGI S-Factor Flat Iron Spray 4.23 oz.]].</li>
            <li> thing, I don&#x27;t have to fight for the bathroom or the flat iron with my kids.  </li>
            <li> B004INQ65S Conair CS710R Infiniti Pro 1 Inch Tourmaline Ceramic Flat Iron - Purple]]</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another plus with this flat iron is where the on/off &amp; temp control switches are located.  </li>
            <li> I also created curls with it, I used to do that with my flat irons.</li>
            <li> Speaking of the plates, these seem longer than her mall kiosk flat iron.  </li>
            <li> But a downside of the flat iron is that it doesn&#x27;t close, but its an advantage to.</li>
            <li> this flat iron stands out from the rest.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron for my daughters hair.</li>
            <li> My sister-in-law has this flat iron</li>
            <li> ( but I also put heat protective spray on before use because you never want to flat iron without it) and ceramic plates.  </li>
            <li> I have had flat irons that run from $200 to $20</li>
            <li> Also, this flat iron is 25 degrees hotter, going over 400 degrees.  </li>
            <li> Conair CS710R Infiniti Pro Tourmaline flat iron is advertised as being revitalizing and nourishing as well as a high-heat solution to untamable frizz.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are flat irons out there with hefty price tags ($200 and up), but I&#x27;ve never used them, so have no basis for comparison here.</li>
            <li> I have had a lot of flat irons in my life time and</li>
            <li> Reviewer is a long-time user of flat irons with relaxed African-American hair.</li>
            <li> ACCORDING TO MY DAUGHTER WHO HAS THE FLAT IRON</li>
            <li> Just received my flat iron</li>
            <li> A lot of the reviews for this flat iron said that they had to get used to the longer plates</li>
            <li> To start off i&#x27;m a flat iron freak.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron from Target because it was on sale and had Tourmaline.</li>
            <li> Considering I don&#x27;t have a back-up flat iron, I just might have to deal with it or use a cooler setting.</li>
            <li> I had to return this flat iron.</li>
            <li> This flat iron can lay some hair.</li>
            <li> This thing works as well as the Paul Mitchell flat iron that retails at $150 and forget a Chi.</li>
            <li> I like the button indicator when you turn the flat iron on.  </li>
            <li> I received this flat as a gift from a friend.</li>
            <li> However when I take my time and flat iron</li>
            <li> I hoped that this flat iron would keep her from borrowing mine all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I wanted to see what consumers think of all flat irons.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is the truth.</li>
            <li> you are looking to buy a flat iron</li>
            <li> I prefer this over a Paul Mitchell flat iron that I paid over $100 for.  </li>
            <li> Going from a hundred fifty dollar Sedu flat iron to a forty dollar took some getting use to.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron is a slim design.  </li>
            <li> In my search of another flat iron, I was hesitant about this one.  </li>
            <li> would recommend this product for anyone looking to purchase a quality flat iron while saving</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t flat ironed my hair in over a year.</li>
            <li> Although the paint is already coming off I hope they last a long time too.</li>
            <li> so I went to Walmart ( because I couldn&#x27;t spend a 100 on a flat iron at the moment)</li>
            <li> flat irons have a security feature built into them</li>
            <li> I needed to find an affordable flat iron that got the job done.</li>
            <li> It gets my thick and curly hair straight!</li>
            <li> So I picked this one up because of the high heat level, which is needed to tame my hair.</li>
            <li> It takes me about half the time to flat iron my hair with this iron compared to my old one.  </li>
            <li> I am 100% natural &amp; my previous flat iron seemed to torch my ends.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews with negative comments, but overall I&#x27;d say this hair straightener is worth its price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sorry , got to go flat Iron my hair !</li>
            <li> then it will probably take you longer since you are limited to smaller sections at a time.  </li>
            <li> + times because the plates were lose like you needed to snap it back in(still loose)</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and have a hard time finding a flat iron that works well, without frying my hair.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s due to Conair&#x27;s not having gone the extra mile that I give the final nod to the Remington</li>
            <li> I returned it and checked numerous other boxes at 2 stores and all have the same design with the plates not meeting.  </li>
            <li> I just bought my second one after my other just bit the dust after almost two years of daily use.</li>
            <li> Mines very coarse, damaged from years of relaxers, styling products and also very dry.</li>
            <li> but let me tell you this flat iron is AWESOMEE!!!</li>
            <li> I read only the positive reviews before buying, don&#x27;t forget to read the negative too!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really consider that to be a negative, since we don&#x27;t leave our irons plugged up, but it may be an issue if you tend to forget to turn things off.  </li>
            <li> My chi iron died last week and with all of our other expenses could not justify spending $100 on a flat iron.</li>
            <li> Only took 15 minutes to straightener all of my hair, when it normally takes at least an hour.</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish it had was like a carrying case or a function that helped it stay closed.</li>
            <li> I used to have spiral curls, soft, fluffy, and</li>
            <li> Remington S9500 Salon Collection Digital Ceramic Hair Straightener with Pearl Infused Wide Plates, 1 Inch]]</li>
            <li> ( I have long wavy hair with highlights).  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how Conair thinks this is remotely acceptable, because I haven&#x27;t seen a hair appliance that takes this long to recover since a $6 curling iron I bought at Big Lots in college.</li>
            <li> I have thick, mostly straight hair, but straighten because of the sleek style of cut that I have.</li>
            <li> The narrow plate makes it easy to target tough spots.</li>
            <li> First of all, every time I use it I end up turning it off because my hand has to be right where the switch is when I use it-very bad design.</li>
            <li> The plug-in is also a little loose in my plug so between those 2 things it turns off frequently while I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li> I had this same flat iron for a few years and when it was finally time to replace</li>
            <li> , my hair is relatively not hard hair to iron, it took A LOT OF PASSES to get A SMALL AMOUNT OF HAIR straight, and it felt unhealthy, unsmooth, and it will definitely be returned.</li>
            <li> I loveee this flat iron!!!!</li>
            <li> i am an african american woman, with relaxed hair, and i was a little sceptical about this product.</li>
            <li> I judged its quality due to the low price.  </li>
            <li> The only other curling iron that works on my hair is like 400$</li>
            <li> No different than my other straightner.</li>
            <li> It does seem to help with frizziness too, although its hard to tell how that compares with my older model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> in all, I do recommend this product if you are looking for a less expensive and easy to use flat iron.</li>
            <li> ....looks so dry.</li>
            <li> The reason I didn&#x27;t default to that thought initially was because I have ironed and blow dried my hair daily for years and no hair loss</li>
            <li> my main complaint is that when you plug it in, it defaults to OFF.  </li>
            <li> The floating plate helps it glide for a smoother finish at my thick ends, and the rounded edge of the plates helps prevent obvious lines for soft curl or lift.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get my hair super straight like the really expensive ones, but if I take the time to go slow</li>
            <li> Does not live up all they hype.</li>
            <li> It burns my hands very easily and I am scared to use it on my hair anymore as it may damage my hair really bad.  </li>
            <li> Not only that, but the straightening lasts for the next few days, so long as I don&#x27;t get my hair wet or work out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with a 5 year limited warranty so keep your amazon receipt.  </li>
            <li> so I was having a hard time with my old, bulky flat iron.  </li>
            <li> now it&#x27;s all stiff and flat, barely wavey, and rough.</li>
            <li> With my previous flat iron, I frequently had to re-straighten, with predictable results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is NOT NORMAL.  </li>
            <li> I have had my hair get burned in other flat irons.</li>
            <li> Too many are very expensive.  </li>
            <li> Sit it back down.</li>
            <li> However, once I came out of pocket $99 for the Chi, it did the same thing my other straighteners did!</li>
            <li> Im A Black Female.</li>
            <li> I typically am a wash-and-go type of girl, with an occasional spruce and curl for a night out on the town.</li>
            <li> This is my second pair in less then a yr</li>
            <li> only had it for about half a year.</li>
            <li> Ive got extremely thick hair and normally need a wide straightener to get the job done.</li>
            <li> I just bought this over the weekend, used it the next morning during my regular routine to get ready for work and was neither excited nor disappointed, but then!!!</li>
            <li> only negative for me was the extra long plates.</li>
            <li> I did however put it on the 25 setting (just below the max 30) and found that the handle became very hot as well, which became difficult to operate after some time.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s thin and narrow, the iron will get hot if you touch the upper portion.</li>
            <li> I got through Vine for over a year now but wanted to compare it to at least one other current commercial flat iron</li>
            <li> First off, if you&#x27;ve ever purchased a quality flat iron, you know how expensive they can be.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basic, but I&#x27;m not sure what else you need in a flat iron.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;ll cool off and than heat up which is weird, but other than that I like it.</li>
            <li> Only 1 problem, it doesn&#x27;t have a little thing that makes it close for storage...</li>
            <li> the only issues I have are that it&#x27;s a little too skinny and sometimes the heat malfunctions</li>
            <li> but now it only works a little.</li>
            <li> Thirdly, if your hand moves up just a little bit it burns my hand.</li>
            <li> and I can separate and flat iron it in less than 10 minutes</li>
            <li> I wanted the half inch flat iron</li>
            <li> My natural hair is hard to straighten, but this does the trick.</li>
            <li> Too bad it has so many flaws, otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This was a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> four stars instead of five is that it doesn&#x27;t have a locking mechanism to keep the straightener closed for storage.</li>
            <li> I wrap the power cord around the straightener even though I know you&#x27;re not really supposed to do that.</li>
            <li> Not really a downside just my preference.</li>
            <li> The narrow width of it was a hit too, since it works well for bangs and on smaller pieces of hair.  </li>
            <li> and I have big problems with tangled, knotted up, messy hair.  </li>
            <li> so you have to be careful when you use it.</li>
            <li> The outside doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to give you a nasty burn but it definitely hurts and makes this iron difficult to use.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used more expensive irons that don&#x27;t get hot on the outside at all.</li>
            <li> it only took a few seconds to heat up to the highest temperature - 15 - 20 maybe.  </li>
            <li> Wide range of heat options.</li>
            <li> but I told them you have to be careful.</li>
            <li> I like the thin design because it curls really well.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s just wavy enough to require styling everyday.  </li>
            <li> I saw a few comments complaining about the on/off button placement, I personally haven&#x27;t had an issue with it though</li>
            <li> she spent over $100 for.</li>
            <li> For years I have been using the CHI straightener, and my last one stopped working a few months ago.</li>
            <li> you have to be careful not to accidentally turn it off when you are holding it.&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> It hadn&#x27;t been dropped, or wet, or anything else.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s harder on my hair than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> You just have to squeeze the iron harder when straightening.</li>
            <li> have medium length, thick hair that has a lot of natural wave; not really curly.  </li>
            <li> One pass through completely straightens my hair - and I have thick, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I had to buy a different model to replace this after less than a week!</li>
            <li> at the tip, VERY odd), and my hair was constantly getting caught in the edges and getting ripped out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m severely disappointed in this product since I bought numerous cheaper Conair products with those working just fine with me.</li>
            <li> I was unsure how it would work because the one I received, the plates don&#x27;t touch each other when I hold it closed</li>
            <li> If I fried it while I was traveling, my line of thinking was that I&#x27;d still have my expensive and high quality straightener back home.</li>
            <li> The On/Off button is in a bad place as previous reviews described, and I thought I could just flip it in my hand and it would be ok</li>
            <li> and all of a sudden a small something falls out of the box.</li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t come up with any other tool that works as well as this Conair for the Price.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so silky due to the oil</li>
            <li> NOT EXTREMELY HOT</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Also turns of sometimes during use due to the placement of the on/off switch and where you have to hold it.  </li>
            <li> You have to be careful not to touch it while your using it or your burn your fingers!</li>
            <li> Cheaper than other places.</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly hair</li>
            <li> Usually, I leave it to my Hair Guy to do it after he&#x27;s done coloring-and-trimming because it&#x27;s such a time consuming thing to do right.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had that happen with any other straightener.</li>
            <li> the great reviews on this flat iron are really confusing because this is the worst straightener i&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it will and my hair, while not difficult or terribly wavy or unmanageable, does take some work to straighten and this flat iron works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I have thin fairly short hair and this works well with a low setting to straighten or curl.</li>
            <li> I finally found a flat iron to tame my thick curly  hair.</li>
            <li> every flat iron I have had in the past seven years</li>
            <li> This flat iron has caused me short, broken pieces and extremely frizzed out and damaged sections towards the from of my hair.</li>
            <li> and already it has a short in the cord again(not due to me), and the button sucks the littlest tap while pulling it through ur hair and it cuts off.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Low 1-8 - Delicate, thin, easy to damage hair&lt;br /&gt;Medium 9-14 - Average to thick or treated hair</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by how well this less expensive flat iron works.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is the on/off button.  </li>
            <li> It only took a few swipes of the iron to transform small sections of hair into silkiness.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only negative about it.</li>
            <li> (I have medium length, dark brown, semi-thick hair).</li>
            <li> Straitens my thick unruly hair with one pass and in big sections!!</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair and it straightens it on a low setting.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, but it&#x27;s short and this straightener couldn&#x27;t keep up.</li>
            <li> As soon as I turned the heat down to almost the lowest setting, the hair loss stopped.</li>
            <li> and it works wonders on smoothing it down.  </li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t move down the length of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It cuts styling time way down.</li>
            <li> This lasted all day and night, through extra curricular actives if you know what I mean, and I haven&#x27;t even used the argan oil yet.</li>
            <li> Other than that I&#x27;d recommend this!</li>
            <li> I previously owned a Remington hair straightener.</li>
            <li> and I am Black with course curly hair.</li>
            <li> It lasted less than 3 months</li>
            <li> Preferred the previous infiniti pro version.</li>
            <li> I put the heat-safe half glove on my hand and begin to curl a section of hair (again, at the lowest heat)</li>
            <li> I take it off my hair and there is BURNED HAIR stuck to the iron, and also a greasy black mark where the \\&quot;heat-safe glove\\&quot; had touched the wand and MELTED OFF.  </li>
            <li> I had this less than a week.</li>
            <li> hope you find my review helpful and thank those of you who previously posted reviews</li>
            <li> It took me have the time to finish my hair then with my previous straightener.</li>
            <li> The various temps are shown as numbers, which is ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> I have had previously.</li>
            <li> I am black and I have long thick hair</li>
            <li> Therefore, the hair slips through the lower half of the plates without the necessary contact, causing it to be necessary to apply pressure with your fingers near the base of the plates.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention that you have to hold it at an awkward angle because it gets too hot and burns your hands.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair</li>
            <li> I have thick long wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy, and sometimes kinky dry hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair also looks a lot sleeker and less fluffy when I straighten my hair with the Conair.</li>
            <li> However, her hair did feel a little greasy to her by the end of the day although it didn&#x27;t look it.</li>
            <li> I spend a little time looking for it in the carpet, but can&#x27;t find it.</li>
            <li> It sometimes starts to look a little frizzy around the</li>
            <li> so it took a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> Power button is a little too convenient, I&#x27;ve accidentally flipped it off once or twice while using it</li>
            <li> They even give you a little moroccan oil to use with this</li>
            <li> and it broke within a little over a year of purchasing it.  </li>
            <li> Also, mine came with a little bottle of Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> It is also ridiculously  too long.</li>
            <li> The previous flat iron I bought ended up being very thick</li>
            <li> U live this flat irons, the pricing wasn&#x27;t bad at all</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but when you&#x27;re desperate, you&#x27;re a little more susceptible to hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday</li>
            <li> It has a floating plate that allows you to straighten and even curl hair segments of uneven dimensions.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now, everyday.</li>
            <li> All the negatives aside, I&#x27;ve definitely owned worse.  </li>
            <li> I also then noticed a lot of my hair had actually broken off gradually in different parts of my hair -</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never had any trouble with them pulling my hair.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of my money and time.</li>
            <li> The CHI makes my hair fluffy.</li>
            <li> I received my flatiron literally a few days after purchasing.</li>
            <li> and it was uneven.</li>
            <li> Since it was getting cooler and my schedule makes it difficult to maintain my natural hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the iron for a few months now</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used it a few times.</li>
            <li> So dissappointing, I do not recommend this product, it is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> but I always end up pulling a few strands out.</li>
            <li> If it is a problem after only a few days, how frustrating will it be in a couple months?</li>
            <li> Got this at Amazon for about $10 less than Target!</li>
            <li> We have a very small one in the house (my teen daughter&#x27;s), and I&#x27;ve played with it before, but I have thick hair and it took a while to see results with the teeny one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The blades aren&#x27;t very wide, so if you have thick hair like myself</li>
            <li> It was awkward to hold and manipulate, it took quite a while to straighten my shoulder-length hair, and then the hairdo didn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> Apparently I was just using the wrong</li>
            <li> I know sometimes less expensive flat irons tend to stop working faster</li>
            <li> I am buying another now because I am afraid they will no longer be on the market when I need a new one.</li>
            <li> Only adds about an extra 5 minutes to my morning routine, so not too bad at all.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry when I use it and the amount of frizz that appears after is frustrating.</li>
            <li> Its thin enough to hold well and not too thick.</li>
            <li> No need, at least for me, to pay too much for one of the expensive straighteners when this does the job well!</li>
            <li> I do wish the blades were a little wider for my thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I expect you will be, too.op, which I assumed would be used up in one or two sessions, but it takes VERY little to moisturize the hair.</li>
            <li> package included a small container of goop, which I assumed would be used up in one or two sessions, but it takes VERY little to moisturize the hair.</li>
            <li> However, now the darn thing doesn&#x27;t straighten my hair worth a crap.</li>
            <li> Usually go to ULTA</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s supposed to do this or not, but every time I would get done with running the straightener through one lock of hair, it would do this let restart of heating again and that takes close to a minute to do it.</li>
            <li> I was scared to death to buy this because I was afraid to put heat on my natural hair.</li>
            <li> ; small iron size too.</li>
            <li> so my hair usually starts getting wavy the day after I straighten it, but my hair remained straighter after using this iron.</li>
            <li> I am not used to a 1inch straightener I usually go w.</li>
            <li> Also, no more burnt scalp.  </li>
            <li> , I have small hands.</li>
            <li> the connection was not able to be plugged in</li>
            <li> I am not sure what to</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this one does</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t exactly say this is the worst flat iron I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> It has cut my hair routine in half!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a little awkward filling the iron with enough hair to cover all the plates</li>
            <li> Its difficult to flat iron my hair also because it doesn&#x27;t close all the way</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s difficult to find a flat iron that allows me to add some body without damaging it.  </li>
            <li> Of course, like other electrical appliances, it can be dangerous around water, and it should never be used on wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At least five times, I hit the power button while putting it down or picking it up - a needless inconvenience and a waste of time.</li>
            <li> it doesnt make the ends fizz, or dull.</li>
            <li> and it was hard to get any curls.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair to begin with, but I have to press really hard to make the irons meet.  </li>
            <li> It was too late to return.</li>
            <li> (At least it didn&#x27;t in humid San Diego during an outdoor wedding).</li>
            <li> THE PLATES ARE TOOOOOO SKINNY FOR A PERSON WHO HAS THICK HAIR.</li>
            <li> I am constantly forced to wait for it to reheat itself.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Med-High15-20 - Thick or wavy hair</li>
            <li> I have frizzy thick wavy hair</li>
            <li> but they never seem to work with my thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I take it slow</li>
            <li> I do have medium thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair and this works like a charm to straighten it without frying the ends.</li>
            <li> I have really thick, wavy hair</li>
            <li> Right before I bought this, I had purchased a Paul Mitchell straightener from a beauty supply store and hated it.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine,somewhat thin, and frizz prone, so I require a lower temperature than my daughter who has thick, coarse hair that is very difficult to straighten.  </li>
            <li> ... if you&#x27;ve been disappointed by flat irons in the past, give this one a try.  </li>
            <li> but I was a little skeptical about buying it for myself.</li>
            <li> Overall, a badly designed product.</li>
            <li> I am just not good at using it.</li>
            <li> When it nearly shocked me a second time, I had my husband take a look.</li>
            <li> There are 30 settings, and guidelines as to which settings work for what hair types (thick, thin, etc.)</li>
            <li> I have really thick, wavy hair, and found that it was too thin for my hair.</li>
            <li> I tried the straightener attachment first and it was TERRIBLE.  </li>
            <li> Sorry not able to lock it when not in use though.</li>
            <li> other reviewers also mentioned, the power button is placed in the worst location possible.</li>
            <li> - I am afraid it will just weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re like me and you&#x27;re used to flat iron perfection, you will be disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> One has curly hair and one has very thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little afraid of burning myself.  </li>
            <li> i have thin hair</li>
            <li> Worse thing I&#x27;ve ever purchased online.</li>
            <li> Not a happy at all that I have to spend money on another one.</li>
            <li> The part that I can not get over is the fact that the plates are too thin and you burn your fingers just by holding the iron together.</li>
            <li> I was not happy at all and would end up just throwing it up in a bun.</li>
            <li> just not happy with it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the ppl that say this flat iron is crap</li>
            <li> but it is probably the worst I&#x27;ve used in the past ten years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Disappointed and not willing to get another.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of flat irons, and been both disappointed and frustrated.</li>
            <li> WRONG.</li>
            <li> but i order the wrong size</li>
            <li> I like to curl my hair with the straightener, this model of straightener made that difficult.</li>
            <li> Skeptical...</li>
            <li> I was going to order another Chi from amazon but after reading a lot of the reviews saying that their Chi stop working after a couple of months and that some were fake</li>
            <li> or it wrong straighten their hair.  </li>
            <li> Both orders have been wrong, it is not the one that is shown.</li>
            <li> They unfortunately have burnt themselves on it</li>
            <li> I tried to be vigilant about how I was holding the iron and the power would turn on and off randomly.</li>
            <li> This was a rather difficult item to review.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately after a night of partying,  my hair turned into a curly afro.</li>
            <li> I chose wrong??</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about to leave to return this hair straightener, I decided to go out of my way to write a review to explain to other buyers why this product is just horrible!</li>
            <li> The design is terrible, I had it for about a week and a half</li>
            <li> Sometimes I accidentally turn it off while I&#x27;m using it and wonder why it&#x27;s getting cold.  </li>
            <li> and I was afraid to take my CHI to Europe in case I accidentally fried it while abroad.</li>
            <li> the better!&lt;br /&gt;The power button is in an inconvenient spot...</li>
            <li> But I was wrong!</li>
            <li> Very sad.</li>
            <li> The on/off button is located in a bad spot...where you hold the iron and can be shut off without even realizing.  </li>
            <li> Over all I don&#x27;t think this is a bad tool for $35.</li>
            <li> Just as bad.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely disappointed in conair.</li>
            <li> Does the job but the plates don&#x27;t touch :(</li>
            <li> I would be afraid to use this without a product on my hair to protect it!  </li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I doubt you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Stupid, I know.</li>
            <li> and if you don&#x27;t have the highest heat, they are worthless.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed...</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is terrible for making flat-ironed curls.  </li>
            <li> I have hated straighteners for triple the price of this one!</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE PRODUCT AND TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great iron! Heats up nicely ... Does the job !</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
            <li> Yes. Its true. VERY shortly after using this product, I was in the shower, combing the conditioner through my hair ... and globs of it came out! I thought maybe it was just excessive because my hair had been in a ponytail for like 2 days straight and I hadnt been able to brush the strays out, so they were all coming out at once. WRONG. It kept happening! I then thought it was from a medication I was taking but I stopped that and it still came out in globs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, I realized that it could be my new iron. The reason I didn&#x27;t default to that thought initially was because I have ironed and blow dried my hair daily for years and no hair loss, I have really strong hair and I take good care of it otherwise. As soon as I turned the heat down to almost the lowest setting, the hair loss stopped. However, now the darn thing doesn&#x27;t straighten my hair worth a crap. So ... yeah. Very sad. I&#x27;m sure *some* people will like it if they have never experienced better (I have used a Chi, so this pales in comparison, regardless of all the reviews that say they are comparable, they are NOT. U get what u pay for!!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still technically have some hair, so I gave it three stars for that, and because it&#x27;s a really pretty gadget with nice features on it.</li>
            <li> These exceeded my expectations. They were able to get my 4c hair to straighten without any damage. I have gone back to my natural hair curl pattern a couple times after straightening with these flat irons! I am completely satisfied!</li>
            <li> Soooo I&#x27;m new to writing my own reviews, but very fond of reading others; and I must say, this flat iron is possibly -the- best. I would say 99.9% close to CHI quality.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is amazing. It curls your hair perfectly. I have long thick hair and I got this to get closer to the roots on top of my head and to add a little bit of wave. I highly recommend this iron. It does get really hot so I keep it on the 20 setting.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t close all the way. By the time I used it. It was too late to return.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about to leave to return this hair straightener, I decided to go out of my way to write a review to explain to other buyers why this product is just horrible! I purchased it yesterday and when I got home I took it out of the box and turned it on, I will admit that it does heat up very quickly. However, the first time I used it, it fried the ends of my hair and made the rest of my hair very brittle. I figured I&#x27;d give it one more chance with the Aragan oil in and nope, still kept doing the same thing. Not to mention that you have to hold it at an awkward angle because it gets too hot and burns your hands. It is also ridiculously  too long. I&#x27;m extremely disappointed in conair. I read only the positive reviews before buying, don&#x27;t forget to read the negative too!</li>
            <li> I discovered this flat iron on a beach trip with my daughter and her friends.  We all went swimming and playing in the sand.  I have coarse hair, especially four weeks after a relaxer.  I asked one of the girls to use their flat irons and this is the one she had and I fell in love with it! I immediately went to the store and purchased me one. I don&#x27;t use it everyday but when I do it gets the job done. I recommend this to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> I LOVE CONAIR I CURRENTLY HAVE A CONAIR STRAIGHTENER THAT I ABSOLUTLY LOVE BUT IT IS GOING OUT SO I THOUGHT I&#x27;D TRY THIS ONE. I DONT LIKE IT AT ALL I STRAIGHTENED MY HAIR LIKE I NORMALLY WOULD AND IT JUST LOOKED SO GREESY. I DID NOT PUT ANYTHING IN MY HAIR AND I JUST DIDNT LIKE IT. THE PLATES ARE TOOOOOO SKINNY FOR A PERSON WHO HAS THICK HAIR.</li>
            <li> My wife tested this for me but she likes it better than her existing curling iron. It heats up very quickly (about 15-20 seconds) and the temperature stays even while she&#x27;s using it. The grip is easy to hang on to and the iron straightens or curls quickly. A bottle of Argan Oil is included with the iron. She had never used this before but it definitely enhanced the performace of the curling iron and left her hair smooth and shiney. However, her hair did feel a little greasy to her by the end of the day although it didn&#x27;t look it. She is very happy with this product and will continue to use it going forward. I tried to pawn it off as an early Christmas present but she wasn&#x27;t buying that. Oh well.</li>
            <li> I have fine Caucasian hair with some stubborn waves, which is why I use a flat iron. Normally, I buy pricey Corioliss ones that work well enough and feel heavy and substantial in my hand. This one is much lighter, and also gets much hotter. And that&#x27;s the problem. After flat ironing a section of hair, sometimes it will be too hot to touch when you release it! I have never had that happen with the Corioliss. Also, somehow the hot plate of the Conair touched my face or part of my ear twice in the week I used it. I wasn&#x27;t marked by the burn, but I definitely felt it. I have never done that with the Corioliss or even the cheap little flat irons I order from a Hong Kong dealer to keep in my desk drawer at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you like your flat irons really really hot, then this one is good for you, but be careful.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a great little tool. I&#x27;m very impressed with what can be done now that I&#x27;m trying a new, all-one-length hair style. Of course, like other electrical appliances, it can be dangerous around water, and it should never be used on wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for the straight, shiny look that I&#x27;ve been wanting to achieve, this seems to be the tool. I note that by just a flick of the wrist, I can get a bit of a curl at the bottom, which is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am just a little concerned about how fast it heats up and how hot it does get. I think one will have to watch out for that and not get burned.</li>
            <li> For the first couple months it had worked amazingly, turning my frizzy hair to glassy straight hair but recently, when I plug it in to use, the straightener can&#x27;t seem to heat to the said 455 degrease and have trouble straightening even the smallest piece of hair (I could tough the plates without burning myself when I put it on the hottest setting). All in all, I would not recommend this product. It worked perfectly the first few months but stopped working after that. The ceramic plates would not heat and I found that my mini-conair travel straightener was working better then this full sized straightener.</li>
            <li> Love them works great on course hair !</li>
            <li> Great flat iron, best one I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> Wife says it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to do the job.  Does not live up all they hype.</li>
            <li> Makes beautiful hair! Only 1 problem, it doesn&#x27;t have a little thing that makes it close for storage...</li>
            <li> Great product...love the slimness of the blades</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. It works better than expected and it is so much cheaper on here than in other retail locations. I am an ecstatic costumer.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed...the plates only touch at the tips which cause grabbing...returned them and buying something else.....</li>
            <li> Great product for the price!</li>
            <li> I had low expectations of this straightner, but my received one as a gift and we both love it!  This one is for me!</li>
            <li> Not perfect, but good value for the price.</li>
            <li> I just bought this over the weekend, used it the next morning during my regular routine to get ready for work and was neither excited nor disappointed, but then!!! So background first, I&#x27;m a mixed girl (black/Italian) I do not have that &amp;#34;good hair&amp;#34;. Mines very coarse, damaged from years of relaxers, styling products and also very dry. I&#x27;ve been debating for a month one whether to spend the money on a Chi or baby bliss, whatever. So glad I didn&#x27;t. Went swimming, which fries my hair ever more so than normal. After my wash and condition used the conair and boom!! Beautiful, soft, perfectly straight hair. Normally even if I like my hair in the bathroom 15 minutes later it&#x27;s puffed back up, u can see every split end, the curl is gone etc... This lasted all day and night, through extra curricular actives if you know what I mean, and I haven&#x27;t even used the argan oil yet. Great buy, worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to receive this flat iron, especially after all the great reviews I read and the fact that I found it for ten dollars less than at Target. So excited, in fact, that I did next day delivery, which I normally do not do. Well, it came this morning and once I got it out of the shipping box, I heard some rattling going on inside the box that held the flat iron. So I start to open it and all of a sudden a small something falls out of the box. I spend a little time looking for it in the carpet, but can&#x27;t find it. So then I finish opening the box and take the flat iron out to see: the top part of the case is not attached to the rest of the iron. At all. You can see the rest of the screws floating about in the bag that holds the flat iron. It&#x27;s as if the people who put it together just forgot to screw them in all the way or were just like \\&quot;meh\\&quot; and tossed them in the bag. What upsets me is: it&#x27;s so easy to just open the box and inspect the flat iron. There&#x27;s no tabs to rip off or tape to cut through, plastic housing to cut through. You can just open the box, pull it out and see what condition it&#x27;s in. Why couldn&#x27;t they have done that before shipping? I&#x27;m sending it back and heading to Target to pay ten more dollars for it. At least I&#x27;ll be able to see it&#x27;s condition before taking it home.</li>
            <li> I had to buy a new straightener after I brought my Chi to Israel and my straighter was fried. I went a month without a straightener and then I caved. So I bought this...I love it! I could not be happier! This is just as good as the Chi, if not better.</li>
            <li> Depends on the product you put on your hair before you iron it, it irons very well, i have frizzy hair and it fuzzles up with humid weather and i didnt have that issue this time.</li>
            <li> I bought this to both straighten and curl my hair. My old curling iron broke, and I figured I&#x27;d try to save $ and get a flat iron that could potentially do both jobs. My hair is fairly straight (with wave) to begin with and curls pretty easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, as another reviewer pointed out, the plates (on the inside rather than toward the end) don&#x27;t meet  without extra squeezing. In addition, whether I try to curl or straighten, this iron creates little crimps in my hair from the edges (and it doesn&#x27;t glide over very well which might be the issue). I&#x27;ll probably return it since I could do a better job with a brush and a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Definitely comparable to my Chi</li>
            <li> it started out as a great straightener but stopped functioning properly after only a couple of weeks. It heats up correctly but once you start straightening your hair the light starts flashing, indicating that it&#x27;s not hot enough again. I am constantly forced to wait for it to reheat itself. For this reason  I am now on the hunt to buy a new straightener to replace this one.</li>
            <li> I previously owned a Remington hair straightener. It worked well enough. It heated up fairly quickly and straightened my hair, however, it always left my hair frizzy even when I used special products like [[ASIN:B001AQY3PG TIGI S-Factor Flat Iron Spray 4.23 oz.]]. I thought maybe silky smooth straight hair just wasn&#x27;t in the cards for me unless I went to the salon because somehow they always managed to make my hair look straight, flat, and fabulous. But I was wrong! Apparently I was just using the wrong tools!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Conair Infiniti Pro straightener is amazing! It heats up in less than a minute, glides through my hair like butter and not only leaves my hair straight but also leaves it shiny and smooth! No frizz! I cannot rave about this hair straightener enough. (I also own a Conair Mini Pro hair dryer that I love.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that made me give this hair straightener four stars instead of five is that it doesn&#x27;t have a locking mechanism to keep the straightener closed for storage. I wrap the power cord around the straightener even though I know you&#x27;re not really supposed to do that. Other than that one flaw I love this thing! It does exactly what it says it will and my hair, while not difficult or terribly wavy or unmanageable, does take some work to straighten and this flat iron works like a charm. One pass on each section and it&#x27;s done so it&#x27;s a definite time saver. If you&#x27;re in the market for a new flat iron and don&#x27;t want to spend hundreds of dollars for a high-end salon quality hair straightener this is the perfect pick for a girl on a budget.</li>
            <li> First off, if you&#x27;ve ever purchased a quality flat iron, you know how expensive they can be.  The last one I bought was $75 and that was discounted, so the price of this one is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one works just as well as the more expensive one I purchased.  I have naturally curly hair, that can get quite frizzy, but you&#x27;d never know after I use this straightener.  And my hair looks soft, silky, and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only takes 15 seconds to heat up.  15 SECONDS!!!  So no waiting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has an auto-off feature in case it&#x27;s accidentally left on, which I worry about when I&#x27;m in a hurry.  I have left my old one on all day!  I&#x27;m glad my house didn&#x27;t burn down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argan Oil Fusion that came with the product is very nice too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best thing, I don&#x27;t have to fight for the bathroom or the flat iron with my kids.  I gave them my old one and I use the Conair.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of very thin wavy hair and can get a decent straightening out of most flat irons but once I walk outside into the humidity...POOF!! I look like a chow. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of heat protection products and serums but nothing stops the flyaways and nothing keeps my hair smooth all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this [[ASIN:B004INQ65S Conair CS710R Infiniti Pro 1 Inch Tourmaline Ceramic Flat Iron - Purple]] my hair behaved for once. After a day of sprinkling rain and lots of humidity my hair remained straight as a ruler and still glossy with no flyaways because of the argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By far the best feature of this flat iron is the auto shut off. I have numerous scorch marks on my counters because my current iron doesn&#x27;t have auto shut off so this will save me from adding any more. The second best feature is the 15 second heat up. Perfect for those mornings when I&#x27;m running late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative for me was the extra long plates. It&#x27;s been a little awkward filling the iron with enough hair to cover all the plates and I feel that I don&#x27;t get my hair as straight as when I used my normal pinch of hair which doesn&#x27;t cover the full plate. Not really a downside just my preference.</li>
            <li> Not only is this straightener nice to look at with its sleek lines and pretty shade of purple, it&#x27;s also easy to use. It heats up hot and fast and glides through your hair like silk. I was unsure how it would work because the one I received, the plates don&#x27;t touch each other when I hold it closed (there&#x27;s a gap between them). I like that the plates are longer than regular sized flat irons. This is a very nice product and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I received my Conair CS710R Infiniti Pro flat iron free from the Amazon Vine program in exchange for writing a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our household has three females, so there are always lots of hair styling accessories around.  Both of my daughters straighten their hair and have had several flat irons over the years.  I thought this one would be like the others when I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to report that both girls love this flat iron!  It heats up super quickly, and the heat setting can be adjusted. One daughter has hair that gets damaged by too much heat, and she was happy with the heat levels on this appliance. The narrow width of it was a hit too, since it works well for bangs and on smaller pieces of hair.  The purple color is cute without being too girly, and the cord is plenty long for any outlet-to-mirror distance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tourmaline plates makes nice smooth hair without any frizzies, and the smoothness of it means it glides through hair without burning. This is a great appliance for the price, and my daughters are telling all their friends to try it.</li>
            <li> I had been using a Remington flat iron that worked fine but is no comparison to this one.  This flat iron heats up really fast; they claim 15 seconds &amp; I would say that&#x27;s pretty close at least at my optimal temp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have medium length, thick hair that has a lot of natural wave; not really curly.  My optimal temp is 20 which is considered Med-High according to the instruction manual.  It takes me about half the time to flat iron my hair with this iron compared to my old one.  I think it&#x27;s partly because this iron gets hotter &amp; it gets hotter much faster.  It&#x27;s really a time saver!  According to my hairdresser it&#x27;s actually better to use a hotter iron (within reason - use the correct heat for your hair type) because you won&#x27;t have to go over the hair as many times which can be more damaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always use straightening gel to protect the hair cuticle &amp; give that extra gloss.  A tiny bottle of Argan oil is included w/this iron.  I thought it might make my hair greasy so I used it on a weekend.  It actually worked really well, no grease &amp; made my hair shiny &amp; smooth.  I would recommend trying a very small amount the first time (you really don&#x27;t need much for \\&quot;normal\\&quot; hair).  This is an oil pressed from the kernels of the argan tree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The temp is adjusted by a turn dial that goes from 1 to 30.  The included temp guide:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Low 1-8 - Delicate, thin, easy to damage hair&lt;br /&gt;Medium 9-14 - Average to thick or treated hair&lt;br /&gt;Med-High15-20 - Thick or wavy hair&lt;br /&gt;High 21-25 - Hard-to-straighten hair&lt;br /&gt;Maximum 26-30 - Very resistant hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another plus with this flat iron is where the on/off &amp; temp control switches are located.  My old iron had them right on the top of the grip &amp; I was constantly turning it off or changing the temp by accident.  This flat iron has them on the side &amp; I have yet to accidentally turn it off or change the temp; very good design.</li>
            <li> Heats up very quickly and straightens my thick curly hair pretty well!</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair, its natural. Im A Black Female. I wanted to try a new look, it has been over 2 years since I have put any type of heat towards my hair. So I picked this one up because of the high heat level, which is needed to tame my hair. So I must say it does a good job. I simply blew my hair out with a dryer and comb technique then I used this. I also created curls with it, I used to do that with my flat irons. The curls come out nice. The only Issue I have is that, while using the flat iron the on/off button is located in a position where you can easily press it, so be careful. I returned the \\&quot;Remmington\\&quot; brand to the store and switched for this, totally better.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a straightener that was hot enough to keep my thinner hair straight and give it a thickness. The unit heats up REALLY fast-- really fast. It is also safe and has a great tip to use on the end. It has an automatic shut off is great as well. I liked the oil that came with it, my hair was shiny and bouncy. With winter heat blasting, my hair can get static and this really helps keep it sleek.</li>
            <li> I got the Conair CS710R Infiniti Pro 1 Inch Tourmaline Ceramic Flat Iron to replace a no-name flat iron that my stepdaughter got at one of those mall kiosks (at double the price of this iron).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This iron has multiple heat settings and gets really, really hot...really fast!  To its benefit, the iron stays relative cool to the touch despite the high temperatures of the plates.  Speaking of the plates, these seem longer than her mall kiosk flat iron.  Ceramic coated tourmaline plates really do reduce frizz and make straightening rather effortless.  It is cool that the CS710R will automatically recover its heat if unplugged or power is lost...and it is an essential safety feature in my house that the iron will auto shut off if left unattended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, does an excellent job and makes a great replacement for a Chi, mall kiosk flat iron or any other higher priced option.</li>
            <li> Love them works great, had them for about a month now</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair iron after reading the reviews especially abt it being compared to the chi, my hair is relatively not hard hair to iron, it took A LOT OF PASSES to get A SMALL AMOUNT OF HAIR straight, and it felt unhealthy, unsmooth, and it will definitely be returned. Maybe for the price range its good compared to other hair irons. I&#x27;ll probably be buying  the chi or sedu.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by how well this less expensive flat iron works.  It fits easily in the hand and slides smoothly and easily through my hair (which is quite thick).  I also like that it heats up so quickly -- like many of us, I am in a rush in the morning as I prepare for work and not having to wait longer than 15 seconds for my flat iron is great.  I have, on occasion, forgotten to turn it off so knowing that it turns off automatically has been a big bonus as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the flat iron for about three months now and so far it is still working well consistently.  I know sometimes less expensive flat irons tend to stop working faster but so far this one is working very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate the temperature controls although I don&#x27;t really adjust the heat  at all -- some may want to be able to do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I do recommend this product if you are looking for a less expensive and easy to use flat iron.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing tool!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using a cheap 2-inch non-ceramic flat iron, and was concerned about going down to the 1-inch iron but the price was right. I am so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, this heats up super fast. Plus the heat is consistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have mid-back length hair and I can separate and flat iron it in less than 10 minutes thanks to the fact that this leaves hair straight and smooth on the first pass as opposed to others I have tried that take several tries. It is light and easy to hold, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> I tried this hair straightener on my hair for the first time last week and I was impressed with the results. I had been using the [[ASIN:B00132TISE Infiniti by Conair SS9 1 1/2\\&quot; Nano Silver Steam Straightner, Red]] and I liked the results that gave me as well, but it was so heavy and made my arms tired to hold it up for so long (I have very long hair). This straightener is extremely light-weight and makes my hair sleek and straight. I like that there are so many different heat settings and that there is a light that indicates when the straightener is ready for you to use. The purple color is a plus also!</li>
            <li> i am an african american woman, with relaxed hair, and i was a little sceptical about this product. i made sure i read the reviews first before purchasing it. and plus a wanted to save some money. but let me tell you this flat iron is AWESOMEE!!! mavelous and you don&#x27;t even need the oil. the oil is jus there to make it look even more healthy. the hair doesnt stick on the iron, it glides easily, creating wonderfull curls just as a curling iron would do. it doesnt make the ends fizz, or dull. it doesnt put to much pressure on the ends of the hair. But a downside of the flat iron is that it doesn&#x27;t close, but its an advantage to. this flat iron stands out from the rest. i like the fact that it doesnt close because, it doesnt put to mch pressure on the ends which can make it weak and break off, also it doesnt put to much heat on the ends which doesnt allow much breakage, as other flat irons would. so some people might think thats a disadvantage, but its actually an advantage to help strengthen the hair. this flat iron makes the hair shinny and smooth. and the end result is great.. i would definatly recommend this. it&#x27;s better than the most expensive irons out there.</li>
            <li> This is terrible for making flat-ironed curls.  I&#x27;m new to flat-ironing, but it really can&#x27;t be that hard.  Perhaps I got a defective product?  But it did not create curls.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron for my daughters hair. She has very course hair and I have never been able to get her natural hair smooth and straight. Relaxers are out of the question. This flat iron and some heat protectant got hair so straight that it looked like she had a fresh relaxer. She was sooo happy. Her hair lasted all week with no frizz. I highly recommend this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I had this same flat iron for a few years and when it was finally time to replace I looked around considering the Chi, etc. . I just couldn&#x27;t come up with any other tool that works as well as this Conair for the Price. I have frizzy thick wavy hair and this gets hot enough to straighten my hair and last up to 2 days without needing a touch up. I also love how long the ceramic planks are. They work better on longer hair. Def. recommend.</li>
            <li> My hair looks so much nicer with flat ironing than having it natural. My hair is thin, semi straight with a slight wave to it and easily straightens at 370. I would probably not go higher than 400 degrees because it can really fry your ends. Before using this flat iron I put Avon&#x27;s heat protectant on and try to leave it on a couple minutes as it dries before applying the hot ceramic plates on it. On draw back is that I have the 1 inch, and would&#x27;ve preferred the 1.5 inch size since it flattens out quicker for longer hair. Overall great price and very pleased with Conair Infiniti Pro line Ceramic Flat Iron.</li>
            <li> The best flat iron I&#x27;ve owned.  I&#x27;ve shopped and bought more flat irons than I care to admit.  Too many are very expensive.  My sister-in-law has this flat iron and I borrowed it.  With Amazon Prime, I had my own within one day.  LOVE IT!  Heats well, straightens my hair perfectly!</li>
            <li> I am currently pregnant and have thick curly hair (even more so due to vitamins).  I have been flat ironing since college (9 years ago) and my old flat iron was retired this weekend.  After using my cousin&#x27;s infiniti I decided to go out and buy it at target.  Well I tried it last night and it was amazing.  My hair feels so silky due to the oil ( but I also put heat protective spray on before use because you never want to flat iron without it) and ceramic plates.  I was leaning for the Chi but I couldn&#x27;t justify the $99 for the same type of plating so I gambled and so far its been great!</li>
            <li> This iron is HOT! 445 degrees! My teenage granddaughters are using it here in the mornings One has curly hair and one has very thick wavy hair. This iron does a fast a job on both of them. They rave about how soft and silky their hair feels and it truly looks beautiful, and very shiny.&lt;br /&gt;In case you wondered, I haven&#x27;t used it on my hair, because mine is super short and very, very straight! LOL!</li>
            <li> I wanted the half inch flat iron but i order the wrong size but it works perfectly fine</li>
            <li> Perfect. It&#x27;s exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> Great product at great price.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that needs just a touch with a straightener. This heats up fast and the multiple heat settings are perfect for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Better than the 3 other $50 to $100 straighteners I&#x27;ve owned before it!</li>
            <li> Best flat iron ever. I have had flat irons that run from $200 to $20 and this has been the best straighter.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly and it&#x27;s so light!</li>
            <li> I find this flat iron a waste of my money honestly , i have curly hair, this flat iron burned my hair a lot and did not create that healthy shine i was looking for, it probably works better for people with straight hair, but it did not work so well with me. Its difficult to flat iron my hair also because it doesn&#x27;t close all the way while Im trying to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> This is an awesom product fir the price.</li>
            <li> Heats up very fast and straightens very well. I would not trade it for anything.....</li>
            <li> Perfect.. just what i was looking for.</li>
            <li> It straightens hair really good, but it takes forever to curl with.  When heated to highest point curling hair still took longer than with a traditional metal curling iron.</li>
            <li> Does the job but the plates don&#x27;t touch :(</li>
            <li> This flat iron is okay. But it is not too ideal for long hair and it gets way too hot for my liking. Only buy if you have short hair and need to fix hair fast.</li>
            <li> Unlike other straighteners, this one is perfect for getting your hair silky straight without doing as much damage to it. It also works much faster than straighteners I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> I had been using an older style Conair flat iron, that looks very similar to this one.  I was happy with it, but I wanted to see if this would make my hair smoother and straighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a difference.  It does heat up in seconds, as advertised.  Also, this flat iron is 25 degrees hotter, going over 400 degrees.  I would be afraid to use this without a product on my hair to protect it!  It&#x27;s a little smoother as it glides over my hair, and I think it flattens my wavy hair a bit faster than the first model, due to the high heat.  It does seem to help with frizziness too, although its hard to tell how that compares with my older model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m impressed with it.  And I have to admit, I just LOVE the purple color!  Recommended if you want a cool looking flat iron that gets very hot, very quickly. :)</li>
            <li> I almost couldn&#x27;t stop stroking my hair to write this review, it looks so shiny and straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, I am genuinely impressed with this flat iron. I typically am a wash-and-go type of girl, with an occasional spruce and curl for a night out on the town. I often don&#x27;t even blow-dry my hair, but I really liked this device. I have very fine hair with a bit of a wave. It sometimes starts to look a little frizzy around the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product through Amazon Vine, and didn&#x27;t expect that it would make any difference. However, days that I use it, people ask me if I got a hair cut/color, and compliment my hair. It definitely makes my hair look healthier, straighter, and it brings out a shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flat iron is easy to use - it heats up almost instantly, and in 6 or 7 passes, I&#x27;ve gone through my hair. It barely takes more time than brushing. It has adjustable temperatures for different hair types. While I probably should be using the low or medium setting, I find the best results with the medium or medium-high. The cord is on a swivel, so it&#x27;s easy to use on either side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the end result is that I&#x27;m unexpectedly happy with the product and wish I&#x27;d tried one sooner!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for several months, and I&#x27;m still pleased with it. I&#x27;ve read other reviews with negative comments, but overall I&#x27;d say this hair straightener is worth its price. I like the precise heat settings and it does get nice and hot, though I&#x27;ve never burned my hands or hair. The floating plate helps it glide for a smoother finish at my thick ends, and the rounded edge of the plates helps prevent obvious lines for soft curl or lift. I have had professionals use hair straighteners that work a little better, but for my everyday use, this one is okay. And when used with the Argon oil that comes with it, it leaves my hair soft and shiny, always a plus. www.amazon.com/author/karenmcwhirt</li>
            <li> This flat iron works very well and gets my hair straight without frizz or burning. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good flatiron.</li>
            <li> I am not one to use a flat iron very often. We have a very small one in the house (my teen daughter&#x27;s), and I&#x27;ve played with it before, but I have thick hair and it took a while to see results with the teeny one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This iron is quite large with a very smooth iron surface. The heat is highly adjustable on this model, but I kept it somewhere in the middle(15), since I don&#x27;t want to fry my hair. It has almost instantaneous heating up time, I&#x27;d say maybe 10-15 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes me about 10 minutes to get through most of the hair on my head with this iron. I have a lot of cowlicks and wave, but it did a fairly good job of defeating most of those, or at least the ones on the outside of my hair.  I didn&#x27;t see any significant damage after using it twice in three days. My daughters both liked the way my hair looked. It looked very shiny to them, and I thought so too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, not too heavy and fast heating time. If you are looking for a high quality, moderately priced flat iron, this one would do just fine. It&#x27;s basic, but I&#x27;m not sure what else you need in a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I got the Infiniti Pro by Conair flat iron at Target today and I already love it! I just finished straightening my hair and my hair is now super smooth and shiny. It only cost $39.99, but since Target had a sale today, I got a $10 gift card for buying it. Pretty awesome right? I have really coarse wavy hair and this flat iron is perfect for me. I&#x27;d totally recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of flat irons, and been both disappointed and frustrated. When they work at all, they usually dry out my hair, and since I&#x27;m a bottle blonde, that&#x27;s the first step toward damage-induced baldness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Conair CS710R Infiniti Pro Tourmaline flat iron is advertised as being revitalizing and nourishing as well as a high-heat solution to untamable frizz. I was skeptical, but when you&#x27;re desperate, you&#x27;re a little more susceptible to hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product proves that sometimes hype is for real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This flat iron heats rapidly- within 15 seconds, and can reach temperatures up to 455 degrees (F), enabling quick and efficient styling. It has a floating plate that allows you to straighten and even curl hair segments of uneven dimensions. I appreciated this feature in particular because I like my long hair pin-straight except for a soft wave at the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a month now, and no broken or otherwise damaged tresses yet, probably because a single application maintains my preferred style until my hair needs washing again. With my previous flat iron, I frequently had to re-straighten, with predictable results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are flat irons out there with hefty price tags ($200 and up), but I&#x27;ve never used them, so have no basis for comparison here. But judging from how well this $30 model works, I&#x27;ll probably never have to find out.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this from bed bath and beyond, just to try it out. I&#x27;m an African american woman with natural hair and it does wonders! I have had a lot of flat irons in my life time and this by far is the best one I&#x27;ve had. Ordering the bigger ones soon!</li>
            <li> The first one I got blew out after a couple of short term usages. It literally turned off and stopped working, I waited a couple days to try it again and it still did not work. It did not over heat or anything, it just unexpectedly shut off. The new one I got I haven&#x27;t really used it much as yet but I don&#x27;t expect it to be any better. Do not buy. Buy in store as opposed to Amazon.</li>
            <li> I like to curl my hair with the straightener, this model of straightener made that difficult.</li>
            <li> Reviewer is a long-time user of flat irons with relaxed African-American hair. The Conair CS710R Infiniti Pro 1 Inch Tourmaline Ceramic Flat Iron offers a super sleek design with high quality plates that yield a super shiny and extra straight finish. The heating element allows for a wide range of heat settings with a rheostat (like a dimmer) that allows you to finely set the temperature rather than the more common hi-lo or hi-med-lo settings. The product delivers on its promise that it heats up quickly and is ready for use in no time. This is next best thing to salon grade flat iron. Super good value for superior performance!</li>
            <li> This is my first flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I have shoulder length, fine hair and I have big problems with tangled, knotted up, messy hair.  I bought this mostly because it said it would help fight the effects of humidity.  I&#x27;ve used it a couple of days now and I love how soft and smooth it makes my hair.  It definitely helps with humidity and my hair is much more manageable than it was before.  Very happy with it especially at this price.  Only adds about an extra 5 minutes to my morning routine, so not too bad at all.</li>
            <li> the great reviews on this flat iron are really confusing because this is the worst straightener i&#x27;ve ever had. i have thin hair and you would think even the crappiest of flat irons would straighten my hair in a decent amount of time. this one doesn&#x27;t though. i have to go over my hair with this flat iron several times before it even looks decently straight. not to mention it does snag and tug on my hair a lot. when it comes to straighteners, you might as well shell out some more money if you&#x27;re looking for a good quality flat iron because you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I really love my new straightener. It heats up fast and leaves my hair feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Great straightner. Our daughters all have different types of hair and it works on all of them. Great price.</li>
            <li> I ordered these with the Amazon gift card my hubby gave me for Christmas.  I kept telling him that I needed some more for work and he was willing to purchase them for me (I&#x27;m a stylist of over 20 years). Skeptical...yes. Used them for the first time and OMG!...instant silky hair on my most coarse haired client. It doesn&#x27;t snag or pull the hair. It glides effortlessly and to use with silkening products is an added bonus. If you want to save a few bucks and get a more economical flat iron, this is the one. BTW, I also purchased just about all the sizes. It makes for a pretty set up in my styling suite. Well worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the same flat iron for over ten years.  I&#x27;ve bought many before but they never seem to work with my thick hair.  This one works great, and is quick.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li> Best flat iron I&#x27;ve tried BY FAR! It has multiple heat settings, heats up very, very fast, and leaves my hair feeling SUPER soft! It&#x27;s also very durable. This is my second one only because a 200lb person stepped on my first one which lasted two years! Beware of using it without heat protectant, however!</li>
            <li> I have been using another straightener for many years now and I really liked it, but I decided to try something different and purchase the Conair Infiniti Pro, because it had such wonderful reviews. I am so glad that I did!! This is an amazing straightener!! It makes my hair look so smooth, and does a great job straigtening it. I would highly recommend trying it out.</li>
            <li> I give this flat iron four stars because it works perfectly especially with my extra kinky hair. I love the small bottle of argan oil that comes with this product. This product is the best flat iron i&#x27;ve ever purchased. The only thing I wish it had was like a carrying case or a function that helped it stay closed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried more expensive, salon rated flat irons and still none compare to this tool.</li>
            <li> Was given to me as a gift, had a CHi $100+ one and I use this one over it any day. Also, have bought two for my friends</li>
            <li> Both the plates and the outside of the iron get very hot so you have to be careful when you use it. The outside doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to give you a nasty burn but it definitely hurts and makes this iron difficult to use.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used more expensive irons that don&#x27;t get hot on the outside at all. I guess you get what you pay for this is a good value but I don&#x27;t recommend it you have kids around</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GREAT FLAT IRON I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT .IT GETS HOT QUICK HAS SETTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR EACH HAIR TYPE. EASY TO HANDLE. NOW AFTER READING SOME OF THE REVIEWS BEFORE I BOUGHT IT IT DOES GET KIND OF WARM ON THE HANDLE PART BUT NOT EXTREMELY HOT ACCORDING TO MY DAUGHTER WHO HAS THE FLAT IRON NOW AND SHE LOVES  IT BETTER THAN HER OTHER ONE.IT JUST WOULDN&#x27;T WORK ON MY HAIR THE WAY I WANTED NEVER BEEN MUCH OF A CURLING IRON OR FLAT IRON PERSON MORE LIKE HOT ROLLERS. IT HEATS TO 455 DEGREES.IT DOES TAKE OUT THE FRIZZ AND MAKES IT STRAIGHT AND WILL EVEN GIVE A LITTLE CURL.SHE SAYS IT IS THE PERFECT ONE FOR HER.IT IS VERY INEXPENSIVE AND A GREAT DEAL.HOPE THIS HELPS.</li>
            <li> I purchased a larger Conair hair straightener over a year ago and was impressed by how well it worked with my thick, long hair.  I needed a smaller straightener to accommodate a new shorter hair style.  I decided to try this 1 inch Conair straightener and have had no regrets.  It heats up fast and has several heat settings to choose from.  My hair stays straight all day long.  Great styling tool value for the price.</li>
            <li> I like this flat iron much better than the first flat iron I bought around 4 years ago.  This one is more light weight (not cheap feeling though) and designed better to straighten as well as add some wave if desired.  It heats up fast and has a big range of heat settings on a dial which is easy to set and leave at that setting for later use.  I have fine hair that tends to get frizzy - this iron works great at straightening my hair...takes a few minutes.  I don&#x27;t have any problems with my hair getting caught in the iron.  Also, no problems with burning my hair because I use a low to medium setting for my hair type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the on/off button.  It&#x27;s too easy to turn this flat iron on and off.  Sometimes I accidentally turn it off while I&#x27;m using it and wonder why it&#x27;s getting cold.  As long as I&#x27;m careful not to hit that button, everything works fine so I plan to keep it.</li>
            <li> This is the second one if have bought from Amazon! It gets my thick and curly hair straight!</li>
            <li> I got this on sale at target but eventually ended up returning it.  The design is terrible, I had it for about a week and a half and it always burned my fingers because of its shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ends of the flat iron constantly yank out strands of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as for the heat, well it definitely gets hot enough but I had to constantly go over my thick (Asian&amp;African American) hair, so I feel like the quality of the plates wasn&#x27;t that good.</li>
            <li> Just received my flat iron it works great On my hair!!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the on-off button is right where your finger lands, so I keep accidentally hitting it. Otherwise, this does a great job. The narrow plate makes it easy to target tough spots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a flat iron on my hair for many years.  I&#x27;ve used both cheap and pricey irons - my last one, a gift, was retailing at over $150, and worked well until it broke after 4 years of devoted use.  I bought the Conair CS710R Infiniti Pro as a replacement.  I&#x27;ve used it once and am pleasantly surprised - it only took a few seconds to heat up to the highest temperature - 15 - 20 maybe.  I have thick, wavy, and sometimes kinky dry hair.  It only took a few swipes of the iron to transform small sections of hair into silkiness.  Not only that, but the straightening lasts for the next few days, so long as I don&#x27;t get my hair wet or work out.  Also, the iron is purple - as a purple-lover, I love having something I use on a regular basis in my favorite color.  The handle does get a bit hot, if I&#x27;m not careful, and grab outside of a very specific &#x27;handle&#x27; zone.  Other than that, I&#x27;m really pleased with such a reasonably priced flat iron working so well!</li>
            <li> Returned this the next day.  Iron does not make contact evenly across plates.  So it hits your hair on one side (closest to end) &amp; doesn&#x27;t touch your hair on the rest.  So its not flattening it at all.  It really just pulls your hair.  I only did my bangs &amp; I couldn&#x27;t believe the hair pulls. Had several strands of hair tugged out from the rubber tip. Worse thing I&#x27;ve ever purchased online.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Hispanic, I have fine curly hair and have used this a couple of times now to try to give it a chance. I cannot recommend this to anyone with my hair type. The heat plates do not make contact all the way across(only at the tip, VERY odd), and my hair was constantly getting caught in the edges and getting ripped out. I had to pass over each section of hair 5-7 times to get the curl out(my hair is not THAT curly) and my hair was still a bit frizzy by the time I was done. Perhaps if your hair is very thick and can fill the huge amount of space between the plates this might work for you... for everyone else, I would pass. I don&#x27;t think you necessarily have to spend a lot on a flat iron to get a good one(the one I had before this was $30 and lasted me several years), but this is a really low quality flat iron even for the price.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great ceramic flat iron that works very well for the price.  I need it to flatten the kinks in my naturally wavy hair, and it does the trick.  Plus the purple color is attractive and and it&#x27;s not as bulky as some I&#x27;ve seen.  I think it&#x27;s a great product and recommend it to anyone who wants to have one on hand for hairstyling.</li>
            <li> This straightener is better than the $150 straightener that broke on me after 6 months.  I bought this for less than $30 on Amazon and it is a huge bang for my buck. Heats quickly, very hot setting. Perfect size. Easy grip. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little afraid of burning myself.  Never out of the box.  Will return.</li>
            <li> I adore my new product! It heats up way hotter than my last flat iron -which costs way more than this product. I could also reach my roots and it automatically shuts off after an hour. This is great because if I&#x27;m an active and forget it, it wouldn&#x27;t cost me much for my electric bill, etc. This product was cheap and brand new! That&#x27;s superb because I&#x27;m a frugal person (haha). I would definitely recommend this to anyone to purchase from this supplier.</li>
            <li> This flat iron gets hot! I def got my dollars worth ($10.00) im a mixed chick; at times my curls are quite unruly... This appliance gets the job doneðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> I loved this iron. It gets my hair supremely straight. I would recommend this to my friends. I believe it&#x27;s salon quality.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after reading the reviews and seeing more good than negative. I had a friend who said she had one like this and loved it. I can see why! It&#x27;s thin, sleek, and works perfect. I gave it 4 stars because the plates on it do pull at your hair once in a while. That&#x27;s the only negative about it. Thank goodness I take it slow otherwise I may rip a hair out lol. But it warms up perfectly and fast. Stays hot for an hour before it automatically shuts off. (It only takes a minute to &amp;#34;heat up&amp;#34; after the light shuts off and you have to turn it back on!) I didn&#x27;t want purple but that&#x27;s all that was left. I would recommend to anyone who doesn&#x27;t like bulky straighteners and for those who like being able to set the heat for your hair. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and have a hard time finding a flat iron that works well, without frying my hair.  This is perfect and did a great job getting my hair smooth and silky.  It does as good a job as the one my hair dresser uses, but cost a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> We chose this straightener out of all the others because of it&#x27;s high quality and durability. It never disappoints! Will look for a similar product next time one is needed.</li>
            <li> When I first bought this iron a month ago, for $40, I really loved it and how smooth, frizz free and shiny it made my hair.  My hair stayed straight and shiny perfectly all day.  It also made nice glossy defined curls.  But a month later, the plates on the side of my iron have came off, where its not purple any more and its exposing hot metal.  It burns my hands very easily and I am scared to use it on my hair anymore as it may damage my hair really bad.  Guess I&#x27;ll just have to buy another one because this was the best flat iron I ever bought. :&#x27;(</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this iron at first as it is conair, but I went ahead and got it anyway because it got some really good reviews. Overall, I really like it and would recommend it to anyone with untamable hair lol (:</li>
            <li> This straightener heats up hotter than my previous straighteners (Chi &amp; Hot Tools). It does not heat up in the 15 seconds as advertised, but I timed it and it was still a quick minute. The On/Off button is in a bad place as previous reviews described, and I thought I could just flip it in my hand and it would be ok but it was still a problem. The plug-in is also a little loose in my plug so between those 2 things it turns off frequently while I&#x27;m using it. It does straighten just as well as my Chi/Hot Tools straightener when it IS on though. Sometimes it pulls my hair when it gets caught in the plates. It has a light that tells you when it is to its desired temperature, but the temperature is done by a 1-30 scale and I would like to know exactly what degree that is, not just a number 1-30! I recently purchased this straightener and I am tempted to take it back just because of the on/off button problem. If it is a problem after only a few days, how frustrating will it be in a couple months? I use my straighteners daily and I need something I can depend on. Purchased for $40 with tax at a local Walgreens. Usually go to ULTA but this was an afterhours rush purchase after doing some research on what was available at the time.</li>
            <li> I love all of Conair products. But after my Chi iron&#x27;s plug broke I had to get a new flat iron. I was going to order another Chi from amazon but after reading a lot of the reviews saying that their Chi stop working after a couple of months and that some were fake, I decide to order this one based on it&#x27;s reviews. I works amazingly. It did have my hair shiner than when I used my Chi. A lot of the reviews for this flat iron said that they had to get used to the longer plates but I didn&#x27;t notice a difference. I used it on a 25-27. Didn&#x27;t want to turn it all the way to a 30 since that&#x27;s hotter than the temperature of the Chi. I am AA with relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> One Of The Best Flat Irons I&#x27;ve Ever Had. Heats Up Quickly, And Allows The Hair To Become Completely Straight Without Doing Excessive Passes Through Each Strand.</li>
            <li> This is the first cheap flat iron I have bought, and I will never buy one again. I guess it&#x27;s OKAY if you really want to save money, but it makes my hair look greasy and snags my hair all the time. I would much rather spend a little more and get a better iron. This was a waste of money to me.</li>
            <li> Love it. Have had others, but this is great for the price.</li>
            <li> Heats up super fast. Love the ease of this iron. Doesn&#x27;t fringe my hair or burn it.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this straightener and loves it! She has naturally wavy hair and likes to keep it straight. She uses the Conair Infiniti every time she washes her hair. Her hair looks great after a treatment with the Infiniti!</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair straight hair so, I use this on the lowest setting.  It easily straightens and smooths my long straight hair.  It gets out all the frizz and keeps it smooth all day.</li>
            <li> It heated up very fast and did a great a job straightening my hair I do have medium thick hair.</li>
            <li> Very good for my medium length very wavy hair.  Gets to desired temperature quickly(under 20 seconds).</li>
            <li> Hair burns at 411 degrees fahrenheit, this goes higher. So it will probably burn your hair, like it did mine.</li>
            <li> I have very fine and thin hair. I have been looking for a hair straightner that doesn&#x27;t burn my hair. Based on the reviews, I purchased the Infiniti Pro by Conair. It has up to 30 heat settings which is perfect. I set mine in between 5 - 10 for my hair. It still straightens my hair just as good as the one that killed my hair. No smoke or burning smell either. I hope that this straightner continues to impress me.</li>
            <li> Excellent - great color!</li>
            <li> Works great. Love this straightener</li>
            <li> This product gets hot fast.  It steams very well,  but it does not champ down very well so I can&#x27;t connect with my hair.  You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I really love this straightener - I bought the 1&amp;#34; specifically for curling, as I wanted to create smaller curls than my 1.5&amp;#34; Sedu straightener makes. This heats up fast and leaves my hair shiny. Also, the curls lasted 2 days, even after sleeping on them. It heats up very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone looking for a good straightener to create waves/curls!</li>
            <li> The product is fine. It arrived as ordered. I am just not good at using it. I guess I need another hand.</li>
            <li> This flat iron definitely gives you the bang for your buck. It works perfectly on my natural hair.</li>
            <li> My chi iron died last week and with all of our other expenses could not justify spending $100 on a flat iron. I purchased Conair Infiniti Pro based on the reviews and am happy I did. Iron gets very hot quickly and has given me the results I was looking for. I have medium textured hair and this straightened it nicely with a shine. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love it. It heats fast and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> Came in on time, Very comfortable and sleek to use.  Fits my hand better than any flat iron that I&#x27;ve used.  Love the color.  Came just as described.</li>
            <li> Arrived very promptly, excellent product at a fraction of the cost!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!! My hair is naturally curly and I can take one pass with this iron and its straight as an arrow, and with the help of alil heat therapy spray it looks great all day!!!</li>
            <li> This flat iron is the real deal. My natural hair is hard to straighten, but this does the trick. It heats up quickly and is very well designed. I give it an A+</li>
            <li> I have thin fairly short hair and this works well with a low setting to straighten or curl. Great value for the price!</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron. It heats up in under a minute.It made my hair shiny, smooth and straight the first time I used it.  It did my entire head in 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a 5 year limited warranty so keep your amazon receipt.  The temperature setting guide tells you what temperature range for your hair type: low 1-8 for fine hair to maximum 26-30 for very resistant hair (their words!).  I used medium high (15-20), 17, for my thick, shoulder length, African-American, natural hair.  I had remained shiny, smooth, and straight for 3 days (at the time of this writing) No frizz!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent price when compared to other high quality flat irons.  It has both ceramic and tourmaline which is best for most flat iron qualities.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on my first straightener so bought this one only to discover it far exceeded my expectations.  It heats quickly and is easy to use.  No need, at least for me, to pay too much for one of the expensive straighteners when this does the job well!</li>
            <li> To start off i&#x27;m a flat iron freak. I own over 10 flat irons ranging from random walmart buys to expensive \\&quot;high end\\&quot; flat irons, and this one works better then any I&#x27;ve tried before.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now, everyday. The heat up time is super speedy fast, and it gets extremely hot. Glides threw really well, hair staightend with one glide. It has cut my hair routine in half!!</li>
            <li> When I was reviewing straighteners, I found this one in the top 5 next to the high end, $100.00 brands...The Conair works great!  Gets over 400* which is what my stylist recommended, auto turn off (because sometimes we are in a rush) and it heats up in minutes.  I highly recommend this straightener for the budget conscious shopper!</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron from Target because it was on sale and had Tourmaline. (Plus, I love purple.)  For the first few uses, I liked how it made my hair silky and soft.  However, I have several issues with it.  If you do not hold it in just the right place, you will burn your hand as a large portion of the iron gets hot on the handle.  Also, the plates are starting to fade after only about 3 months.  It doesn&#x27;t really glide through my hair as promised--there is a lot of friction.  I also feel like it severely damages my ends (as all straighteners do, but even when using product this seems extra-damaging.)  All the negatives aside, I&#x27;ve definitely owned worse.  This iron gets hot fast, and does a pretty good job of straightening.</li>
            <li> One of the best flat irons in the world. It is a great price and works very well. I use it regularly.</li>
            <li> This heated within the time frame specified... I tested it on 2-day-old hair, and it worked great! I did however put it on the 25 setting (just below the max 30) and found that the handle became very hot as well, which became difficult to operate after some time. Considering I don&#x27;t have a back-up flat iron, I just might have to deal with it or use a cooler setting.</li>
            <li> Got this at Amazon for about $10 less than Target! It heats up quickly, does a nice job on my hair. There are 30 settings, and guidelines as to which settings work for what hair types (thick, thin, etc.) It&#x27;s a nice product very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> A friend was staying with me and she straightened my hair as well as taught me how to use this to give it a nice flip. It&#x27;s well made, it doesn&#x27;t snag my fine hair and because of the heat control settings, doesn&#x27;t burn it either - yah for not having breakage!</li>
            <li> This is the best iron, I&#x27;ve ever had. I&#x27;ve owned the Chi for years and Im glad I deceided to try this. I have had it for over a year or maybe two years, but it straightens my hair and I am Black with course curly hair. It gets it bone straight on the 20 setting and I don&#x27;t have to reflat after the first initial ironing (as long as you straighten with a bristle brush proceeding the iron). Becareful because too high of a setting can burn your hair. It even stays straight for a week (if i don&#x27;t work out and sweat it out :). It literally heats up in 15 seconds and cools quickly when done as well. Love love love this iron, I recommend it to everyone</li>
            <li> Wide range of heat options. Great for hair that needs minimal straightening as well as on fluffier hair that needs taming. Beautiful in purple color. Love it and highly recommend !</li>
            <li> I bought this item in December for my daughter as a Christmas present.  It lasted less than 3 months and she only uses it 2-3 times a week. Had worked great until last night and now just won&#x27;t stay on.  it&#x27;s a shame I don&#x27;t seem to have any recourse for return.  I don&#x27;t by a product like for it to last me 3 months. Not a happy at all that I have to spend money on another one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the ppl that say this flat iron is crap or it wrong straighten their hair.  This flat iron is great.  Maybe they are just unlucky and got a defective iron. Love love love this flat iron &#x27;</li>
            <li> Hair is soft afer using.  Thought the longer iron would be nice, but it actually make it a little harder to have control of the iron.  Also turns of sometimes during use due to the placement of the on/off switch and where you have to hold it.  Preferred the previous infiniti pro version.</li>
            <li> Once again this was a gift for my daughter and she is very happy with it.  It was a recommend from Consumer Reports which is why I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I just love this flat iron, was a good deal. It leaves my curly hair really straight and soft.</li>
            <li> I love these , they make my hair bone straight and the price was great. I would def recommend them</li>
            <li> 2.5 stars. I had to return this flat iron. It gets hot very quickly, which is good, but it felt like it ripped out some of my hair out when I used it. It&#x27;s like the plates were coated with something that caused friction. I&#x27;ve used a Chi before and that was always very smooth when I ran it through my hair. I had to run the Conair through my hair more times than I ran the Chi through my hair to straighten it. It also frizzed up more than when I used a Chi, which left it smoother.</li>
            <li> Love it! Gets super hot be cautious</li>
            <li> It works really good..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously only owned more expensive straighteners (Chi, corioliss) - and I found that this very inexpensive one was MORE effective at straightening my hair. For a glorious two months, I found that my hair never looked so straight, shiny, healthy - and it stayed that way for days - barely any touch ups needed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER - after two months of using it on the highest heat setting, a chunk of my hair broke off in the front. I also then noticed a lot of my hair had actually broken off gradually in different parts of my hair - I realized my hair was suddenly really damaged, compared to how it was two months earlier, before I bought the Infiniti pro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After talking to a hair stylist friend of mine I learned this:&lt;br /&gt;The reason this straightener works so well is because it gets SO HOT. I am a caucasian female with very fine, thin, wavy hair... I never should have used it at the highest heat setting. THE LOWEST or second lowest is intended for me. She says I gave myself a \\&quot;heat haircut\\&quot; ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know whether this straightener is more damaging than say... the chi straighteners that claim to have heat-protecting qualities, or if I was just using this one too hot. Regardless, I like the price and the fact that it works... I just picked up a second one (my first one broke, I stepped on it)and I use it on the second lowest heat setting.</li>
            <li> The flat iron gets really hot and straightens my hair really good the only issues I have are that it&#x27;s a little too skinny and sometimes the heat malfunctions so it&#x27;ll cool off and than heat up which is weird, but other than that I like it.</li>
            <li> Love this straightener!  Heats up really quick and works amazing!  Very happy with my purchase and the price :)</li>
            <li> This straightener is awesome. Heats up real quick. Its thin enough to hold well and not too thick. Use it on mens hair and it is easy. I bought 2 more of these for my family.</li>
            <li> this product is ok. not much different to me tho, than others.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed. I got this twice, once as the one I bought, and the next as a replacement. Both orders have been wrong, it is not the one that is shown. Mine was pinkish red, not purple like I ordered, the plates didn&#x27;t even match up! How I know this wasn&#x27;t what I ordered was that the metal colored plate that is suppose to be on the handle wasn&#x27;t anywhere to be found. On the bright side, customer service was awesome!</li>
            <li> This flat iron can lay some hair. I love it. I would recommend this for natural and weave. Works wonders.</li>
            <li> I love it ! It makes my hair so soft and I don&#x27;t have to go over my hair a lot of times it&#x27;s just fine with one time . It arrived before expected date , it came in a big box with a lot of protection , it does the job same or better than a CHI !</li>
            <li> Straightens hairs perfectly. Does not burn or crimp your hair. Great product.</li>
            <li> I finally found a flat iron to tame my thick curly  hair. It makes it so slick and straight! So shiny! I love it! It heats up in 15 seconds, and does my hair in no time. It makes awesome curls also. My teens are begging for one now instead of what they have.They unfortunately have burnt themselves on it but I told them you have to be careful. Maybe a glove for the teens and for curling would be nice. The only con I have to say is that whoever packed my argan oil must not of closed the lid because the whole bottle was inside the bag it came in. Other than that I am so pleased.</li>
            <li> This flat iron ripped out a good chunk of my hair the first time I used it - the plates have some sort of gap at the ends/edges and they caught my hair as I was sliding it through. Sent it back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight and straightens very well. My hair  feels healthy too.  I only  wish it had an automatic turnoff.</li>
            <li> I love this straightener! I have used cheap ones and the $100 salon kinds and honestly this one is worth every penny. I have thick wavy hair and this works like a charm to straighten it without frying the ends. Heats up SO fast, 15 seconds!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m severely disappointed in this product since I bought numerous cheaper Conair products with those working just fine with me. I&#x27;ve only owned this for about several weeks, give or take 5 - 7 weeks. I had to put it to almost thirty to get the desired heat that I was wanting for my hair because it would have a hard time straightening, but I still had to go over the same lock of hair over and over again to make sure it&#x27;s straight. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s supposed to do this or not, but every time I would get done with running the straightener through one lock of hair, it would do this let restart of heating again and that takes close to a minute to do it. Recently, it&#x27;s been turning off on its own either when I&#x27;m running the item through my hair or having it try to heat up and usually when that happens it won&#x27;t turn back on again after pressing the power button several times (then I would have to unplug and plug back in again). I&#x27;ve owned so many straighteners before and they lasted longer and performed even better than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read in another review of a lady who was Hispanic and had some of the same problems as me (and I&#x27;m Hispanic as well) and I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was because of our hair type that it wouldn&#x27;t work on that well or what. Certainly I know this, I&#x27;m kicking this one out and would advise my friends not to purchase it because the lot of inconvenience it&#x27;s brought to me.</li>
            <li> Great straightener.  I am so thankful that I didn&#x27;t spend a fortune on a more expensive model.  Many heat settings and it heats up quickly.  The &amp;#34;floating&amp;#34; plates are a nice touch and I&#x27;ve never had any trouble with them pulling my hair.</li>
            <li> This was an excellent purchase, smoothes nicely and really does heat up and cool down as quickly as it claims!</li>
            <li> This product really does get hot. You will burn your fingers by just touching the hair, which is an easy fix for me because I use a comb to hold the hair. The part that I can not get over is the fact that the plates are too thin and you burn your fingers just by holding the iron together. Another thing about this iron is the power kept going out. I was not sure if it was set to turn off whenever it got too hot or if I was pushing the power button. I tried to be vigilant about how I was holding the iron and the power would turn on and off randomly. This was a waste of my money and time.</li>
            <li> I loveee this flat iron!!!!</li>
            <li> I love it . I was using a cheap brand &amp; it was just not preforming like I would like .&lt;br /&gt;This tourmaline platted iron leaves my hair soft silky &amp; shiny !&lt;br /&gt;Sorry , got to go flat Iron my hair !</li>
            <li> First let me say that I&#x27;m a professional hairstylist.... I honestly can&#x27;t believe how well this tool works. This thing works as well as the Paul Mitchell flat iron that retails at $150 and forget a Chi. I&#x27;ve had to replace too many Chi flat irons to ever buy another. This flat iron gets hot, fast. Straitens my thick unruly hair with one pass and in big sections!! So happy with this tool! Side story: I use a good amount of product for thermal protection and product creates smoke when it heats up. This flat iron gets so hot, made so much smoke it set off my  smoke detectors. Hahaa!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hair stylist. Yesterday, I decided to take a trip to Target for laundry detergent and there award winning Rice Crispy treats at the cafe, (Delicious) Anyway, I decided to take a detour through the Hair care section to see what&#x27;s new and check out their Flat Irons. One in particular I remembered that was highly reviewed was the Remington Ceramic Tourmaline Flat Iron! I promised I would treat myself to this Iron very soon because my weave clients keep demanding straight! Straight! Straight Hair! A great price at $49.99, but then I glanced right next to it and found the New Conair Infinity Oil infused Ceramic Flat Iron that reaches an astonishing 455 degrees! At $39.99 I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot. Plus I&#x27;d use the extra ten dollars for bleach and softener! That evening I tried the iron on one of my African American Client who has quite a bit of long thick fantastic bushy coarse Un-relaxed hair! I was amazed that after washing and conditioning (with Silicon Mix) I was able to run a quick pass of the Conair Iron through the client&#x27;s hair and end up with silk! Super Straight, Super Hot, Super Flat and Very shiny Hair! I&#x27;m sold!</li>
            <li> The product did well, for the first few days, I was impressed. Until I ran my hand along the back of it, after it was cooled, to discover that the paint was rubbing off on my hand. Then the paint started chipping completely. I feel like this product isn&#x27;t true Conair Infinity Pro.  I will not be purchasing from this seller again. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I like the button indicator when you turn the flat iron on.  It flashes until it is hot.  It is light weight and heats up quickly.  I purchased this item so that I can use it for traveling however I find myself using it daily.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s thin and narrow, the iron will get hot if you touch the upper portion. It does heat up super quick. I noticed though, that when you clamp the iron, it does not fully clamp; there is a tiny gap on the bottom portion of the actual iron that doesn&#x27;t fully close unless you add more pressure to your hands on the grip portion.</li>
            <li> Got hair really straight ;) only thing is the paint came off on the flat iron not okay with that.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from Amazon and received promptly in the mail the next day.  I was excited to try this out...the reviews were pretty good.  I have recently cut my hair into an inverted bop and have some shorter pieces in the back so I was having a hard time with my old, bulky flat iron.  This iron doesn&#x27;t seem to heat up as hot as I expected, and my hair gets stuck between the plates, causing breakage.  The on/off button is located in a bad spot...where you hold the iron and can be shut off without even realizing.  Overall, it did straighten my hair, but not the way some of the reviews said it would.</li>
            <li> This is my second pair in less then a yr and already it has a short in the cord again(not due to me), and the button sucks the littlest tap while pulling it through ur hair and it cuts off.  I purchased them a second  time bc they really make my hair super straight and shinny!</li>
            <li> Right before I bought this, I had purchased a Paul Mitchell straightener from a beauty supply store and hated it. So, I spent a few bucks on this cheapy one and LOVE it. It is slim, heats up quick and only requires one or two passes max. I can dig it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these flat irons. While using this specific brand I only have to use one pass through my hair. Since I have gone natural I used to struggle getting my hair straight but thanks to these flat irons I no longer have that problem</li>
            <li> I ordered this product last week because of all the great reviews about it. It came very fast in the mail and I was pumped to try it out! I tried the straightener attachment first and it was TERRIBLE.  (I have very fine, but thick blonde hair  that doesn&#x27;t take much heat to get it to totally straighten or curl.) I had blow-dried my hair straight and took the straightener to it just to get out the mild kinks.  This product ATE MY HAIR UP.  It looked like a mangled cat had gotten ahold of my hair. The ends were all of a sudden frizzy and smelled like burning hair! I had it on the lowest heat setting.  I throught, well maybe the straightener isn&#x27;t good but I can still use the curling iron attachment.  I put the heat-safe half glove on my hand and begin to curl a section of hair (again, at the lowest heat) The product made a popping sound like something was burning (again, my hair was totally dry and I did not use any sort of product on it)  I take it off my hair and there is BURNED HAIR stuck to the iron, and also a greasy black mark where the \\&quot;heat-safe glove\\&quot; had touched the wand and MELTED OFF.  I then run my fingers through the section I had just curled (burned) and large chunks of hair fall out.  This thing literally burned strands of my hair off.  My hair smells like burned plastic on the one section I used it.  I have very healthy hair and very little is in the brush after I wash and brush through it. This is NOT NORMAL.  I am very upset about this purchase.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Use it almost daily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost a &amp;#34;single pass&amp;#34; and you&#x27;re done! Loving it!</li>
            <li> I received this flat as a gift from a friend. First of all let me say that this iron has the potential to be a great flat iron, but their are few design flaws. The first thing I noticed about this flat iron is the metal plates don&#x27;t close flush all the way across. It really only close at the tip of the iron and there&#x27;s a gap throughout the rest of the iron causeing you to have to squeeze it together when you use it. Secondly the outside plastic of the metal plates gets extremely hot when in use! You have to be careful not to touch it while your using it or your burn your fingers! Lastly it pulls out some hair during use because hair gets caught between the plastic and the metal plates. However when I take my time and flat iron my hair carefully it comes out really nice. This iron gives the hair a really straight smooth and shiny finish. Too bad it has so many flaws, otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I was scared to death to buy this because I was afraid to put heat on my natural hair. But I keep this baby on a low setting and it gets my hair bone straight!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a flatiron to curl my hair along with straightening my hair once and a while. This product does just that and the curls with this iron are so pretty and last all day. I have very straight, Asian/White hair which does not like to hold a curl and my curls literally last for days with this iron!</li>
            <li> It heats up very fast.  So far I like this product better than most that I have used.  I like this product.</li>
            <li> CHI is the only straightener brand that I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve had 3 of them in the course of my life. However, I was going traveling and I was afraid to take my CHI to Europe in case I accidentally fried it while abroad. I bought this as just a cheapy to do the job while I was traveling. If I fried it while I was traveling, my line of thinking was that I&#x27;d still have my expensive and high quality straightener back home. I got back from Europe 5 months ago and I have not used my CHI since then, because THIS straightener is AMAZING. It heats up quickly, gets far hotter than my CHI, and I can do my hair a lot faster with the Conair. My hair also looks a lot sleeker and less fluffy when I straighten my hair with the Conair. The CHI makes my hair fluffy. I love this Conair straightener!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to have finally found a flat iron that actually straightens my extremely curly hair. It looks awesome, leaves my hair soft and silky. I love to curl my ends too. I have gotten a lot of compliments on how nice my hair looks straight. Clean cut at last, I have used other flat irons and none work this well. Bonus it was very affordable too. Happy I bought this!!!</li>
            <li> Purchased this iron and was pleased with it, but two weeks later it stopped heating up.  The power light was on, but never heated.  Disappointed and not willing to get another.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron!!!! I have course curly hair and for 10 years I used a $150 Paul Mitchell iron (the original green and black one). I was hesitant to buy a new one since they didn&#x27;t have the original one so I purchased this one for $35. It makes my hair so smooth and stays straight for days. I love the 1&amp;#34; small iron size too.</li>
            <li> Okay thoughs of you saying it gets too hot....... it only gets too hot if you put it too hot -_-.... the temp is perfect for my hair. Stays straight as long as you don&#x27;t get it wet.</li>
            <li> I ordered this with my 11 year old in mind.  I have a generic \\&quot;chi\\&quot; flat iron that I bought at a local beauty supply store, and my daughter is always borrowing it.  I hoped that this flat iron would keep her from borrowing mine all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, this iron is light.  It is about the same size as my iron, but it is much lighter.  In fact, it is so light that several times the weight of the cord pulled it off of the bathroom counter.  I don&#x27;t really consider that to be a negative, since we don&#x27;t leave our irons plugged up, but it may be an issue if you tend to forget to turn things off.  The cord also swivels, which is a nice feature that I wish my own iron had.  The lightness of the iron, along with the swivel cord, makes it very easy for my 11 year old to use to straighten her own hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the iron has multiple heat settings (30) which makes it easy to adjust the temperature to suit your particular hair needs.  My hair is fine,somewhat thin, and frizz prone, so I require a lower temperature than my daughter who has thick, coarse hair that is very difficult to straighten.  I like the fact that this iron heats up to 455 degrees, instead of the 350 degrees that most cheaper models go up to. Another plus for this iron is that the outside of the iron stays relatively cool to the touch.  When I used the iron at the \\&quot;21\\&quot; setting, the outside of the plates stayed cool the entire time I used the iron. When the temp was turned up for my daughter to use, the outside of the iron became warm, but never hot enough to burn my daughter (which is more than I can say for any of our other irons, including a Chi knock-off, a Remington, and two other Conairs)  My daughter is just starting to straighten her own hair, and with this iron she does not have to worry as much about burning herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for results, I was able to quickly straighten my fine hair, and my hair remained reasonably straight throughout the day, even though it was raining outside.  My daughter&#x27;s hair, which is much thicker and coarser required two passes through the iron (for each section) but her hair still looked shiny, soft, and straight after a day at school (and being in the rain)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I feel like this is an excellent flat iron for the price, and it would especially be a good tool for pre-teens due to its light weight, cool-touch outside, and the results acheived.  My daughter is able to handle this iron much better than some of our others which weigh more, and don&#x27;t stay cool on the outside..

            <li> Bought this for my daughter, who has straight hair but needs a little touch up in the mornings before school to get rid of that bedhead look.  It&#x27;s no CHI, but it works well and you can&#x27;t argue with the price.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> these little babies work like a charm you really don&#x27;t need to crank them all the way up just a bit and your hair will go from wavy to sraight . when i got them they didn&#x27;t look like the picture but shipping was fast and they were the same ones just in the color red</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought better straighteners in my life. it&#x27;s ok not the best</li>
            <li> It gets too hot and it is not easy to handle.</li>
            <li> This flat Iron is great! I have had one of these for about four years and it still works wonders! I have curly hair with no relaxer. The infiniti pro straightens my hair with ease. If you follow the cleaning directions this product can really last. I am buying another now because I am afraid they will no longer be on the market when I need a new one.</li>
            <li> I bought it to replace my old flat iron, and this one one works okay. It is not expensive, but it just does not straighten my hair that well.</li>
            <li> This works as well as my more expensive flat iron.  I am black and I have long thick hair and this gets my hair straight. No compliants.</li>
            <li> It is really good to curl your hair, specially if you have a strong hair it is really powerfull.</li>
            <li> This pulls my hair out, I am experienced at flat ironing. The plates don;t even come completely together. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it had great reviews, but it leaves my hair looking unnatural and fried. An older and cheaper Conair model that I used to own actually worked better.</li>
            <li> Fantastic straightener.  Definitely made my hair jet straight and quick! I have curly hair so my hair usually starts getting wavy the day after I straighten it, but my hair remained straighter after using this iron. It also heats up very quickly and has a lot of heat options. This is a definite upgrade from my last iron and appears comparable to the higher end more expensive straighteners.</li>
            <li> I love these so much I usually only buy hot &amp; gold products but these conairs are amazing It&#x27;s worth the money everything is perfect!!! Get these</li>
            <li> I researched flat irons as my daughter wanted a top name brand and I wanted to see what consumers think of all flat irons. This iron came in #1 and I can see why. It is perfect for providing the flat shiny look, or it creates fantastic curls that really hold up. I loved it so much I ordered one for myself. Fantastic product if you need a flat iron with true ceramic plates that wont break the bank and are better than other advertised so called #1 products.</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron with high hopes based on the reviews. It heats up very quickly which is nice and it is easy to use. I have straigh hair and like to use it to manage the fly aways and frizzy&#x27;s in the summer.  It works ok but I was expecting more based on the reviews.  I have used others that work better for this purpose but it does an adequate job.  The price is reasonable.  I also liked the oil that came with it.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing it gets my hair SOO straight  and silky soft i love it. I&#x27;ve had it for about a month now! NO problems. I have REALLY puffy curly/wavy LONG hair nd its a pain to get it straightened but with this straightener, I get it done fast and its super easy! Best thing I&#x27;ve gotten this year!  I LOVE conair products i also have there curler which is also pretty amazing! I would recommend it to anyone! I know this sounds pretty cliche&#x27; but this straightener is... i cant really describe how much I LOVE this straightener! I find it better then my sisters chi which... well really it didn&#x27;t get my hair as straight as i wanted... Anyways yea this product is awesome nd amazing it works wonders on my hair ands its an amazing price :)</li>
            <li> This flat iron is the truth. I am very pleased and impressed. I love the temperature control, and the tourmaline technolgy made my hair very light and straight. It has 30 heat settings and I used setting 10 for the front and 15 in the back, my hair came out very silk straight. I&#x27;m relaxed with texture btw. Love it, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I had this less than a week. I used it twice to straighten my hair. Even on the highest setting, I had to go over the same chunk of hair 2-3 times (and ouch was it hot!), and that COMPLETELY destroyed my hair. Even after showering my hair still smells burnt. I put curling cream in it, but my hair will not curl at all. I used to have spiral curls, soft, fluffy, and now it&#x27;s all stiff and flat, barely wavey, and rough. I had to get a trim because the ends were so fried. I returned this product today. Unless you never want your hair to curl ever again, do not get this product. I&#x27;m completely heartbroken.</li>
            <li> Great product for a really reasonable price. Heats right up and hair is smooth!</li>
            <li> Gets really hot and worked really well. Then after a while the paint on the straightener started chipping and started making my hair smell like burned so I threw it away.</li>
            <li> I knew the price was too good to b true :( this certainly does not reach 455 degrees.... And it pulls hair..</li>
            <li> Works as claimed, curly hair is tamed and it didn&#x27;t cost an arm and leg.</li>
            <li> Best iron ever! Smooth, hot but doesn&#x27;t burn. Great curls too! LOVE IT! and the Argan oil is amazing and smells wonderful. :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got short mixed hair and after my andis stopped working, I picked up this flatiron at target. It severely damaged my hair. It took me a while to realized the more I used it the more my hair became rough, damaged, and brittled. I had a busy week and used it about 4x that week and when I passed my hands through my hair my hand would be filled with bits of my hair. I would not recommend it if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been happily using the [[ASIN:B003V249L0 Remington S9500 Salon Collection Digital Ceramic Hair Straightener with Pearl Infused Wide Plates, 1 Inch]] I got through Vine for over a year now but wanted to compare it to at least one other current commercial flat iron (I also figured that I could leave one at my parents&#x27; house and finally really retire my trusty Solano). I&#x27;m pleased to say that although this new Conair doesn&#x27;t surpass the performance of my Remington, it&#x27;s about as good and has a somewhat cheaper list price as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, a flat iron isn&#x27;t called to do much when confronted with my hair. It&#x27;s short, fine, color-treated, and already fairly straight. It&#x27;s just that it doesn&#x27;t look too hot after it has been slept on and unless it has been ironed, can get a tad frizzy near the scalp closest to parts of my face if the weather&#x27;s humid. So just about anything will do for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Conair heats fast (maybe a bit faster than the Remington but I use both at a low temperature) and utilizes tourmaline, rather than pearl, to boost the effectiveness of its ceramic plates. Included is a bottle of argan oil for conditioning. I first became aware of this rather spendy condiment in specialty food stores but never bought it because of the price. FWIW, I won&#x27;t be using it on my hair either because it&#x27;s just too fine--I sparingly use a leave-in conditioner called Hydro Milk that I love; my stylist introduced it to me some years back and I&#x27;ve had no reason to switch. Regardless, the Infiniti does a nice job without the argan oil (which, in this formulation, barely contains any argan oil at all--it&#x27;s mostly chemicals). I don&#x27;t think it does a better job than my Remington but it&#x27;s no worse either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I really don&#x27;t like about the Infiniti is the fact that the blades don&#x27;t lock--I really like this feature on my Remington and it&#x27;s due to Conair&#x27;s not having gone the extra mile that I give the final nod to the Remington (and thereason why I nicked a star). Other than that, the Conair is an excellent flat iron and comes with a five-year warranty as opposed to Remington&#x27;s four-year (both are very generous). Both have an automatic shut-off feature for added safety and swivel-cords that make life easier while you&#x27;re ironing. I can&#x27;t imagine that someone needing a flat iron wouldn&#x27;t be delighted with either one so it comes down to whether or not locking blades are important enough to merit paying a bit extra. If it&#x27;s not a priority, by all means, add a Conair Infiniti to your cart--you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I do like this iron. It heats up very fast. and gets the job done. Sorry not able to lock it when not in use though. Would recommend. Its good value for the cost</li>
            <li> I gave this straightener a 4/5 stars becasue for $35 I it works quite well. I have yet to curl my hair w. it but have heard awesome things about using it as a curling iron. I am not used to a 1inch straightener I usually go w. a 1 1/2inch straightenter so it took a little getting used to. The handle does seem to get super hot which is a pain. Over all I don&#x27;t think this is a bad tool for $35. I wanted to buy a chi but I just can&#x27;t see spening $100+ one.</li>
            <li> This item is really great. It heats up fast and it does not fry or tangle your hair. I recommend it. The heat setting options are good for fine curly frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this flat iron!</li>
            <li> love it. works great on my hair. heats up fast. still have to wait in between strands for it to heat back up but it still is pretty fast</li>
            <li> Works great, heats up super quick, and never leaves a piece unstraightened! Only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it&#x27;s a little long and the top part gets really hot so I can&#x27;t hold it from the top - has led to a hand cramp a time or two.</li>
            <li> Love these flat irons.  They do the job without burning my hair</li>
            <li> I bought this because it&#x27;s the exact straightener I had that died on me. It&#x27;s a great straightener for the price and heats very fast. I love it and highly recommend it. I have fine hair, so I can&#x27;t speak for anyone with thick hair.</li>
            <li> I am 100% natural &amp; my previous flat iron seemed to torch my ends.  These flat itons smooths the hair from root to end perfectly.  I would recommend to anyone especially my naturalistas!</li>
            <li> Very good product. Straightens the hair without pulling them, in other words it works very smoothly. I burnt end of my hair because I set it up too high. Other than that I&#x27;d recommend this!</li>
            <li> Not the best one out there.  I sent it back and bought one by CHI.  Much better!</li>
            <li> I am African American and have been straightening my hair for about 5 years now. Every straightener I&#x27;ve had has never given my hair the super super straight, sleek, shiny look I&#x27;ve always wanted to accomplish at home. It seems I would always have to go get my hair done to get my desired results! Anyway, my best friend used her Chi straightener on my hair once and it came out perfect. However, once I came out of pocket $99 for the Chi, it did the same thing my other straighteners did! I got straight, but frizzy hair after spending 2-3 hours straightening it. I was not happy at all and would end up just throwing it up in a bun. Some years later, my neighbor told me she bought a new straightener from Walmart that had great reviews on Amazon and she tried it on my hair. Once again, my hair came out perfectly as it did the first time I used a Chi flat iron but I was a little skeptical about buying it for myself. Once she told me it was only $40, I decided to take a risk. I&#x27;ve had this straightener for about a month now and it gives me the same amazing results every single time. It heats up super fast and heats up to 455 degrees as apposed to the Chi which only heats up to 397 degrees. I love this flat iron and it works so well on my frizzy, curly, chemically colored hair. I would definitely recommend this product to any woman but especially African American women who want that salon finished style without stepping foot into the salon.</li>
            <li> Perfect for straightening unruly hair!</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for!! Heat settings go all the way up to 30!!</li>
            <li> Great Product. I have had this straightener for about 8 months and it works as new. I love the thinness and the color. Overall it is a great buy at an affordable price. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good quality straightener at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great flatiron, the best I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron because I was just in the market for a new one. I read the reviews and the product information and thought I would go ahead and get this one because the price was fair. This is definitely  the best flat iron I have ever used! Even better then CHI and other top irons. I absolutely love the longer iron style it really does make a huge difference. My favorite thing about this iron is how fast it heats up! Oh my gosh its incredible. It takes about 10 seconds to reach the highest setting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one and only thing I wish they could change would be that there isnt any sort of clip or way of closing the plates when its not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to buy a flat iron get this one! You won&#x27;t regret it the price is great and so is the quality.</li>
            <li> cheap price, but does it job.&lt;br /&gt;This flat iron heats up pretty quickly, 5-10 sec.&lt;br /&gt;Only thing i don&#x27;t like is when u clamp down,&lt;br /&gt;only the ends are touching each other, you would have to press hard</li>
            <li> Really great flat iron.  Smooth gliding, and hair feels really healthy after using.  It definitely gets hot really quick, as advertised.  Having the variety of temperature settings is great, too -- from 0 to 30.  It&#x27;s stylish, and as good as any much more expensive flat irons.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t give 5 starts often.  I&#x27;ve owned 2 other straightening irons and this one is by far the best.  I have a lot of hair that is fairly coarse and frizzy on the top layer.  While my other flat irons definitely helped, my hair would still be pretty puffy and not really smooth.  This flat iron is the next best thing to my salon&#x27;s iron. This leaves my hair considerably smoother and flat instead of puffy.  I think the Moroccan oil helps too.  The plates of this iron are so smooth and it glides right through my hair.  There is nothing that pinches my hair either, like on an old iron I have.  This is a very well priced straightener, especially considering how compact it is and how great it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightener for over two years and it still works perfectly. It doesn&#x27;t get my hair super straight like the really expensive ones, but if I take the time to go slow it gets my hair to where I&#x27;m happy with it. Overall it&#x27;s a great buy, and the only thing I&#x27;ve ever gotten from Conair that I actually like! I had a yellow and black straightener from Conair and it did absolutely nothing!</li>
            <li> Good heat settings, feels comfortable in your hand, and I especially like the auto shut off.  But, if you aren&#x27;t the best at using flat irons to curl, feather, etc., expect to see those flat iron lines on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  3 months later, I&#x27;ve grown to LOVE this flat iron.  I appreciate the longer plates, which makes curling longer hair much easier.  The heat is consistent and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.  I prefer this over a Paul Mitchell flat iron that I paid over $100 for.  I love it so much that I&#x27;ve increased my original 4 star rating to 5 stars and I&#x27;m ordering the next size up.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this hair straightener.  It heats up very quickly and recovers lost heat equally well.  I love that it is light weight so that my arm and wrist are comfortable while straightening.  I also like that the plates are long so that I can do more hair at once.  I have long fine hair that is wavy and this straightener tames everything in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! It is the perfect width and doesn&#x27;t damage your hair. It is very resistant and easy to travel with. Also, since it isn&#x27;t very thick it is very useful to make curls.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and daughters.  They use the Infiniti Pro more often than I can keep track and I have heard nothing but positive comments from the three of them.</li>
            <li> I am a hair stylist and I use it on a daily basis. Gets hot fast.</li>
            <li> I love this so much!!!  It gets my hair so straight and it works SO great !</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron.  I have very fine, thin hair and it works great to straighten and curl it.  Great for bangs.  Also, no more burnt scalp.  Tried to order a second one as a spare but they are out of stock.  Please bring more back in.</li>
            <li> This was a rather difficult item to review.  Going from a hundred fifty dollar Sedu flat iron to a forty dollar took some getting use to.  I will admit that you do get what you pay for.  My Sedu has survived many years and still works great.  It has always straightened my hair like a stylist leaving it silky smooth and never &#x27;overcooked&#x27; or dried out.  This Conair works well but my hair is not smooth and it sounds like you need to buy the oil to make the iron work better.  I have never needed to purchase this oil for my Sedu.  The overall quality is fair but it feels too light to make me confident that it will last more than a year or two.  If you have the money, go to folica&#x27;s website (where i bought mine) and get a good Sedu or other brand...spend over a hundred and you will see and feel the difference.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and works great.  My wife loved it! Bought at a local store but saw cheaper on amazon. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> this is absolutely amazing ! i totally recommend this to anyone ! works fabulous to create curls that last the whole day as well !</li>
            <li> This is an excellent hair straightener!  I have really thick, wavy hair and it works wonders on smoothing it down.  The blades aren&#x27;t very wide, so if you have thick hair like myself then it will probably take you longer since you are limited to smaller sections at a time.  I haven&#x27;t used the oil because - quite frankly - I am afraid it will just weigh my hair down.  My daughter used the oil and found that it just coated the strands of hair that the blades initially touched....it didn&#x27;t move down the length of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is an excellent straightener. I do wish the blades were a little wider for my thick hair.  Also, a locking clip for the blades would be nice.</li>
            <li> The only straightener I will use. I&#x27;ve tried dozens of flat irons and this is the only one that leaves my hair feeling silky and smooth and not dry and damaged. Heats up super fast. My hair is wavy/curly and I&#x27;m able to straighten my whole head within 10-15 minutes depending on how OCD I&#x27;m being that day - haha! I definitely recommend trying this flat iron.</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron. Works better than my CHI which i paid over $100.00 for. HIghly recommend.  Great buy for the price.</li>
            <li> Love the way it leaves my hair shinny. Heat up in about 10 seconds.</li>
            <li> I love this iron! It suits my hair perfectly (I have medium length, dark brown, semi-thick hair). I actually don&#x27;t straighten my hair with it, because my hair is mostly straight. Instead, I use it as a curling iron, and it works wonderfully. I only need to curl my hair once and it lasts for the whole day. If I don&#x27;t shower, it lasts even until the next day. I don&#x27;t need to use spray either.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several Flat Irons and this has been the best.  I have recommended it to several of my friends.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is a slim design.  It heats up really fast and does a great job straightening and curling my hair.  I like the thin design because it curls really well.  The previous flat iron I bought ended up being very thick and it was hard to get any curls.  This iron is about 1 1/2 inches longer than another Conair Infiniti Pro I have used.  The plates are actually longer, not the handle.  The plates are very smooth and they do not grab my hair at all.  It glides over my hair and with one pass I am finished. I love it!!  Couldn&#x27;t be happier!&lt;br /&gt;Another positive is the 5 year warranty.  My last professional model was 1 year and it stopped working in 6 months.  I didn&#x27;t love it enough to replace it.</li>
            <li> great at first but now it only works a little. only had it for about half a year. would recommend a chi instead</li>
            <li> it worth for the price, but sometime doesn&#x27;t get enough heat. And it can&#x27;t lock it , u get what you paid</li>
            <li> I am very upset with Conair producing this piece of junk.  If the iron is on, you will burn your fingers.  The plastic shell is not thick enough to protect your fingers from the heat of the plates, so they burn.  I have returned this item and warn all to stay away unless you have no feeling in your fingers and won&#x27;t mind the burn.</li>
            <li> One of the best flat iron I&#x27;ve used. It works very good on natural curly to straight.  Would definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> Iron area is longer than what I&#x27;m use to, and the whole area where irons are gets too hot to touch; but I am getting use to it. Seems to hold hair better than my old one which illiminates the need to hold the tip while turning iron. The iron surface is better than any iron I have used.</li>
            <li> U live this flat irons, the pricing wasn&#x27;t bad at all you can&#x27;t beat $20 dollars and the shipping was fast like I&#x27;m all around PLEASED (:</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron and so do my friends...</li>
            <li> Very nice straightener.  Works great!</li>
            <li> I definitely like it a lot. Not as great as my Chi (that died on me) but still does the trick. I find that I can get a better curl out of this than my old Chi straightener.</li>
            <li> After years of using Remington flat irons, I purchased the Conair Infiniti Pro because I have been so pleased with their hairdryer. I don&#x27;t have tremendously high expectations for my flat irons - I use them mainly to style and shape my already straight, fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t exactly say this is the worst flat iron I&#x27;ve used (that honor would probably go to a $12 off brand model circa 2002) but it is probably the worst I&#x27;ve used in the past ten years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, although the flat iron proclaims \\&quot;15 second heat up,\\&quot; the initial heating time is more than 15 seconds, and it seems like this might apply to the time IN BETWEEN STRAIGHTENING. I don&#x27;t know how Conair thinks this is remotely acceptable, because I haven&#x27;t seen a hair appliance that takes this long to recover since a $6 curling iron I bought at Big Lots in college. I swipe the flat iron through my (straight, fine!) hair, and after one pass, the heating light is blinking again. Sit it back down. Wait. Conair, AIN&#x27;T NOBODY GOT TIME FOR THAT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers also mentioned, the power button is placed in the worst location possible. In between passes at my hair, since the flat iron had to recover each time, I would put it back on the bathroom counter. At least five times, I hit the power button while putting it down or picking it up - a needless inconvenience and a waste of time. There&#x27;s no reason I should be turning the iron on and off multiple times by accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also surprised to find out that the plates weren&#x27;t \\&quot;floating\\&quot; - I am pretty sure every flat iron I have had in the past seven years, none of which have been more than $40, has had floating plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This flat iron will definitely be going back and I will likely get another Remington, as I have done in the past and always had success with. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightener for over a year now and it has done pretty well. I wouldn&#x27;t say it is the best straightener I have ever had, but it does what it needs to do. For as cheep as it is, it is a great product.</li>
            <li> I like this better than the Chi I had.</li>
            <li> It was a decent straightner for the price. I ended up replacing this a year later because it was catching my hair a lot and didn&#x27;t hold up well. However, it was not very expensive, so I guess I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> I have fine, color treated hair that&#x27;s just wavy enough to require styling everyday.  I love the adjustable settings and don&#x27;t require this to be on the higher settings in order to straighten my hair.  When I use this in addition to the blow dryer I think my hair looks very polished.</li>
            <li> Got this as a Christmas gift. Was not the one I originally wanted but glad I got this one. It was cheaper but does a great job getting straight hair without burning. Hair does not get tangled or stuck in the iron. The size is just right, you can do bangs or any area with no problem. Also, it is good for all hair types. One of the best features is it has a heat setting so you can lower the heat instead of just high heat. Great value and I just love it.</li>
            <li> I have tried this a couple times a I love it!  It heats up fast and gives my hair (which is very fine) and great curl or straightening.  Yay!</li>
            <li> I did not want to spend too much money for a product that I&#x27;m going to use every once&lt;br /&gt;In a while, I was surprise how good and easy to use.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> it works really  really really great love the color looks exactly like the picture  and leaves my hair soft and straight</li>
            <li> This flat iron is a million times better than my old one by the same company! I only need one or two passes through my thick curly mixed race hair to create pure silk! My boyfriend loves playing with my hair in general, but when I use this iron he can&#x27;t keep his hands off my hair and constantly compliments the softness. It was in my frugalista opinion a pretty decent deal, my friend has a CHI and frankly I think this may work a bit better at a fraction of the cost. The color is very pretty too, its a deep plum color. I saw a few comments complaining about the on/off button placement, I personally haven&#x27;t had an issue with it though so I suppose its all in how you hold it. Overall, this is a great bang for your buck! Like I said, in my opinion it works better than my friend&#x27;s CHI she spent over $100 for.</li>
            <li> Ordered it for the wife and she loved it!!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this works beautifully.  I set the temperature at 15 (only half as hot as this iron gets) and voila! shiny, smooth hair.</li>
            <li> Walmart wanted $50 for this where I live, I just love Amazon!! Item was shipped promptly, arrived new in box with all contents as described. The flat iron heats fast, has a nice swivel cord. Power button is a little too convenient, I&#x27;ve accidentally flipped it off once or twice while using it lol. I can live with that. All in all, I&#x27;m quite happy!</li>
            <li> This flat iron is very well made. It is ceramic, and it gets hot! I like the fact that it has so many different settings that allow you to use it on a variety of hair types. It is very easy to hold and use for a long period of time. It also has a swivel cord, which helps keep the electric cable out of the way when you are using it. It heats up very quick and the plates are in position so that hair doesn&#x27;t get trapped in the space between the plates and the plastic near the ends of the plates. They even give you a little moroccan oil to use with this and it smells and works great too! I wish they would tell you where to get more of that oil! This flat iron is very good for such a low price, and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> loved it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;its really good for the price!&lt;br /&gt;better than CHI brand!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hot iron!  I works so well!  The price is extremely reasonable for the item that you&#x27;re getting.  Professional quality!</li>
            <li> I have tried many straighteners on my wavy hair. The ones ones that cost twice as much as this one don&#x27;t even begin to compare. It is easy to use and I can adjust the heat. Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron!! It has adjustable temperature settings and heats up super quick! The light flashes while it heats up and then goes solid once it gets to temperature! I use a heat setting of 10 (out of 30) and it gets my hair super straight. Another great feature is the cord which attaches to the flat iron pivots so it does not get tangled when straightening or when storing. Best flat iron I have used in a long time!</li>
            <li> Received very quickly and awesome product</li>
            <li> Just love it flat iorn! Very easy to use and quick. Would definately buy more and suggest to friends too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had all the high end, super expensive flat irons and this one beats them all. No snagging or pulling the hair, makes it smooth and shiny. One pass through completely straightens my hair - and I have thick, frizzy hair. Love the high heat, quick warm up and automatic shut off (things that were missing in the $100 one I bought a year ago). Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Overall, the Inifiniti Pro is a pretty good ceramic hair straightener. I like the size as it allows you to easily straighten a chunk of hair and then twist to curl up the ends a bit. It has the option to get super hot, which is good for my course hair. I guess I was kind of hoping for a miracle straightener, though. I still have to struggle with my curly hair, re-straightening each chunk over and over to get the kinks out. It&#x27;s definitely a good straightener and a good value, I guess I was just expecting some kind of miracle that would make my hair super straight in one swipe-- a miracle that I guess hasn&#x27;t been invented yet!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this flat iron.  Based on all the positive reviews here, I cannot believe we are talking about the same one!  I immediately saw that the plates do not meet flush the whole length.  Only the top half meets.  Therefore, the hair slips through the lower half of the plates without the necessary contact, causing it to be necessary to apply pressure with your fingers near the base of the plates.  Therein lies the next problem with this product.  The outside gets ridiculously hot!  This seemed so flawed that I was sure I purchased a defective one.  I returned it and checked numerous other boxes at 2 stores and all have the same design with the plates not meeting.  I exchanged for a new one anyway, hoping at least the outside would not get so hot to the touch.  Nope.  Just as bad.  I have returned the 2nd one and am starting my search for a new flat iron anew.  The only positive things I can say about this product?  It is lightweight and a pretty purple color.  So if you are looking to accentuate your purple home decor, this is the one for you.  Me?  I&#x27;d rather my hair looks good without burning my hands.</li>
            <li> I own the CHI flat iron, but came in need of an additional flat iron when my sister took it to an out of town getaway. In my search of another flat iron, I was hesitant about this one.  I judged its quality due to the low price.  However, after reading the reviews and reviewing the specs, I gave it a shot. I was pleasantly surprised! The flat iron heats REALLY fast! It is the fastest I have experienced (about 15 sec).  When flat ironing my hair, I also noticed that it one takes 1-2 glides for the hair to be straight and shiny ( I have long wavy hair with highlights).  The longer plates prevent your hair from \\&quot;slipping\\&quot; as you glide your hair through it. I have not tried the Argan Oil that comes with it yet, but I used Garnier Fructis Sleek &amp; Shine Flat Iron Protector Straightening Mist with argan oil (less than $5.00) and it was a perfect combination. The mist smells good and it does not leave your hair sticky.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product for anyone looking to purchase a quality flat iron while saving money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you find my review helpful and thank those of you who previously posted reviews, for they helped me when making my decision of purchasing this amazing product.</li>
            <li> I wanted an affordable straightener that I could use to straighten my bangs in the morning and curl my hair when wanted. I also wanted something that would work on my hair because it doesn&#x27;t hold curls at all!! The only other curling iron that works on my hair is like 400$ I don&#x27;t know the name but it&#x27;s made by a Spanish man. Anyway, back to hair, I have medium course hair below shoulder length the mid torso depending on the time of year and when I get around to cutting it and this flat iron is amazing! Heats up very very quickly wich is good for a college student in a rush in the mornings. Has customary dual to set at 30 different heat levels. Is a cute purple color. Cute but not too girly. Light weight and easy to work with, I have small hands. Hair glides naturally and easily. And sturdy! Overall, this is my new favorite toy and I would buy it for friends !</li>
            <li> Worked AMAZINGLY. I&#x27;ve never found a straightener that would actually straighten my hair, but this one does. I have African American hair and it&#x27;s super curly. This straightener completly straightened it. I love it!</li>
            <li> unfortunately as I live in Australia the connection was not able to be plugged in so hence I havent used it however, the&lt;br /&gt;product looks great and the service was wonderful sadly I am not sure what to do.&lt;br /&gt;regards&lt;br /&gt;Leanne Temessl</li>
            <li> Feels great and works great on my hair my only complaint is that it seems like as soon as I run it through my hair the light blinks indicating it has cooled down and needs time to get back to the max temp. I&#x27;m used to a flat iron that stays the correct temperature consistently. But it&#x27;s a great buy for the price!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this, but I guess since I used a Sedu for the last 4 years I shouldn&#x27;t have expected much. My Sedu was PERFECT until it broke so, trying to save money, I bought this one from Target hoping the reviews I read lived up to its claim. I have used it twice and I have decided to return it and shell out money for another Sedu. First of all, every time I use it I end up turning it off because my hand has to be right where the switch is when I use it-very bad design. Secondly, every time I pull it through my hair, it actually pulls some of my hair out with it, leaving strands of hair all over the iron when I&#x27;m finished. Thirdly, if your hand moves up just a little bit it burns my hand. The outside of the iron is almost as hot as the plates on the inside. Lastly, it leaves crimps in my hair from where I first close the iron down on my hair. I have had none of these issues with my Sedu. I will say it does straighten my hair OK and it&#x27;s easy to curl the ends under, but all the problems involved in getting it that way are not worth it. If you have never used a good quality (expensive) flat iron before, you might be OK with it. But if you&#x27;re like me and you&#x27;re used to flat iron perfection, you will be disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Again, a Christmas gift.  Although not the exact one my daughter requested it looks like it may be better than she wanted!</li>
            <li> I love my straightener! The minute i got it i tried it out. The plates are smooth and aren&#x27;t rough on my hair like my last one.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for sure :)</li>
            <li> I received my flatiron literally a few days after purchasing. I did not like the fact that it didn&#x27;t come in a box being that it was &amp;#34;brand new&amp;#34;. Once I finally used the flatiron I loved it, kept my hair straight &amp; shiny. I just hope my flatiron does not fall apart with time.</li>
            <li> Is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used in my life.&lt;br /&gt;I normally take 3 hour to do my hair now is only one and the result are amazing everybody is asking me about my hair. I highly recommended</li>
            <li> This is a great flat iron!</li>
            <li> It did straighten my hair although it didn&#x27;t glide easily plus I needed it to go through a section 3+ times because the plates were lose like you needed to snap it back in(still loose) and it was uneven. The plates are my main problem other than that it was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it but try to get it in a local store cause you can return it easily and maybe get better luck than me.</li>
            <li> these conair are amazeing they curl my hair perfectly these are great pear of flat irons just amazeing curls make my hair stright</li>
            <li> I love it. It works wondering my hair. It was straight with one pass. I couldn&#x27;t of asked for a better flat iron</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend as a birthday gift. She has used it for a couple months so far and it works great. It leaves less static after each use and heats up quickly. It&#x27;s an inexpensive gift and is comparable with higher priced products like &amp;#34;Chi&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> For years I have been using the CHI straightener, and my last one stopped working a few months ago. I bought this Conair straightener, thinking I would just try it out before buying another CHI. Wow...this actually works better than the CHI and saved me about $80!! Buy this and try before buying a $100 and up straightener</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest and say I&#x27;ve never used a CHI or comparable brand, but this one sure works well for the little bit of money I spent on it.  I&#x27;m extremely satisfied and it even straightens my biracial daughters&#x27; hair without a problem. :)</li>
            <li> Love this iron. I haven&#x27;t flat ironed my hair in over a year. Since it was getting cooler and my schedule makes it difficult to maintain my natural hair,  i got a organic silk out and loved it!  Unfortunately after a night of partying,  my hair turned into a curly afro. I used my cousin&#x27;s flat iron (which happened to be this one) and instantly fell in love! I don&#x27;t use heat protectant or anything. I put a small dab of oil on it before pressing it and it came out silky and smooth!  Went to get my own the next day!  Only issue i have is that i press the on/off button while pressing my hair and I don&#x27;t realize it until my hair stops getting straight lol but overall, i love! Better than the Sutra and Chi i owned previously and much cheaper!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. I&#x27;ve had the iron for a few months now and I&#x27;ve used it a few times. I have long fine curly hair and this iron works well for me.  I have only tried it at a lower heat (10-15) because I don&#x27;t want to burn my fine hair.  My hair will stay straight for days after with barely a touch up!  This makes me happy because I&#x27;m a low maintenance type of person so the less time I need to spend on my hair the better!&lt;br /&gt;The power button is in an inconvenient spot...you have to be careful not to accidentally turn it off when you are holding it.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it seems to be of good value at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> Gets my hair bone straight.  Great price as well</li>
            <li> I did not want to find a bulky straightner and with summer coming up I thought this would be a perfect item.  I have not tried it out before but never had an issues with Conair products.  I love the color purple too.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I just bought my second one after my other just bit the dust after almost two years of daily use. I even use it to curl my hair. My hair is always silky smooth after I am done using it and it doesn&#x27;t damage it as much as other straighteners have in the past. It gets hot enough that I can straighten my hair quickly and without going over the same piece of hair for what seems like thousands of times. Also love the price! I have hated straighteners for triple the price of this one! Way cheaper on Amazon though.</li>
            <li> Best bumpers i ever had. One pass through on my daughters 4b-c hair. Just once to get it straight and it was on a medium heat settings.</li>
            <li> My hair cant resist this....looks so dry.</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE PRODUCT AND TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.  Once I received the hair iron I opened it and noticed that the plates were not aligned.  I contacted the seller and they stated that they do not take returns on hygiene products.  I told them that I had not yet used the hair iron because the first thing I did was check to make sure the plates were aligned properly (otherwise it will pull out hair).  The seller then replied telling me to contact Conair because they would provide me with an exchange faster than they could.  Of course Conair would not exchange this hair iron under warranty because I bought it from a 3rd party.  Once I explained this to the seller in my FOURTH e-mail to them they stated I should have &amp;#34;told Conair that it was a gift.&amp;#34;  I was then told that I could return the straightener and when it was received they would deal with the issue when they had the chance.  I felt that this transaction was handled very unprofessionally.</li>
            <li> I had an old Conair flat iron and  stop working last weekend after 6 years and i was so afraid to get a different brand because my old one worked so good, i purshased two others and I had to take them back, got this one un Target and OMG, .. Love it, love it</li>
            <li> Love it.  Cheaper than other places.</li>
            <li> They work better than my old ones. Although the paint is already coming off I hope they last a long time too.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping!  Great Quality!  The flat iron works very well.  I would recommend to others any time.  I may purchase as a gift for my sister.</li>
            <li> The purple on top melts and make my hands colorful. Also the power button is so sensitive on the handle and get turned off quite easily. Overall,still a good straightner.</li>
            <li> I bought this iron and I loved it. It heats up super fast (15 secs, as described), it gets plenty hot, and it has some great features for the cash. It does have an indicator light to let you know when it&#x27;s up to temperature. It blinks until it&#x27;s hot and stays on solid red. It has a 2-hour shut-off, which is great. I have thick, mostly straight hair, but straighten because of the sleek style of cut that I have. I use the iron on \\&quot;25\\&quot;, which is hot, but doesn&#x27;t fry my hair. I know a lot of people complain about that. I didn&#x27;t have that problem, but the temperature can be lowered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s where things get dicey. I bought this iron, originally, six months ago. It&#x27;s been consistently great until a couple of days ago when it shorted out my outlet. There was a loud snap, a visible spark, and the iron tripped my breaker. I had heard something making a crackling noise in the handle, now that I think about it. It hadn&#x27;t been dropped, or wet, or anything else. This was spontaneous. I reset the breaker and the next day, tried again. Stupid, I know. I just love the iron. When it nearly shocked me a second time, I had my husband take a look. I wasn&#x27;t going to use it again, but I wanted to know what had happened. He found some internal damage that indicated the problem was where the wires meet the swivel cord. I&#x27;m going to hope this was a fluke and am ordering this iron again. I really did love it.</li>
            <li> the best I really liked !!</li>
            <li> I got this product for my daughter. I have one just like it and for the price it is a good value.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many flat irons at a MUCH higher price. I have extremely curly hair and if you don&#x27;t have the highest heat, they are worthless. This iron works as good, if not better than the ones you get in salons. I am a licensed hairstylist for 30 years so I would know!</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair and it straightens it on a low setting. Pretty good product.</li>
            <li> A friend once complimented me on my curly hair, which I suppose had looked especially nice that day. I apologized, \\&quot;It just came out of the shower that way.\\&quot; She pointed to her not-quite-so-curly head and replied, \\&quot;It came out of a box.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps I should appreciate my waves, more, but with my layered haircut it can turn into a frizz-bomb once I&#x27;ve brushed it thoroughly on the second day after washing it, even in it&#x27;s-a-dry-heat Arizona. So on occasion, I like to straighten my hair... especially since my friends are all so astonished (\\&quot;I don&#x27;t recognize you!\\&quot;) when I do. Usually, I leave it to my Hair Guy to do it after he&#x27;s done coloring-and-trimming because it&#x27;s such a time consuming thing to do right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But armed with this Conair flat iron, I&#x27;m tempted to do it more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several years ago, I bought an inexpensive flat iron from a local beauty store, and I think I used it precisely three times. It was awkward to hold and manipulate, it took quite a while to straighten my shoulder-length hair, and then the hairdo didn&#x27;t last that long. (At least it didn&#x27;t in humid San Diego during an outdoor wedding). It wasn&#x27;t going to be GOOD for my hair even it it didn&#x27;t hurt it. The device got pushed to the back of my bathroom drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device, however, addresses most of the problems. It&#x27;s a lot lighter, and easier to hold; this actually fits in my hand. It has a range of temperatures, so I could set it at the high end of medium for the relentless frizz. I think that means the temperature setting is higher, or perhaps my newfound wisdom to NEVER use a flat iron without a conditioner/oil (through Hair Guy advice) made a difference... but in any case, the hair stayed flat for a full day, before it was time to shower again. Plus, from the point where I started to warm it up to \\&quot;all done!\\&quot; must have been only 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And did I mention that my hair looked REALLY GOOD?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package included a small container of goop, which I assumed would be used up in one or two sessions, but it takes VERY little to moisturize the hair. This will probably last four or five hair-flattening and friend-astounding sessions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m quite pleased. I expect you will be, too.op, which I assumed would be used up in one or two sessions, but it takes VERY little to moisturize the hair. This will probably last four or five hair-flattening and friend-astounding sessions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m quite pleased. I expect you will be, too.</li>
            <li> I just used my new straightener for the first time and my hair looks amazing. I have hair to about the middle of my back. It&#x27;s very thick and frizzy. It took me have the time to finish my hair then with my previous straightener.</li>
            <li> i love it so much !!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It is works good. we can adjust the temperature as required which helps in avoiding over damage of our hair. It gives good shine to hair.</li>
            <li> OK so iI had a flat iron I loved and it lasted about 3 years and just stopped working yesterday, well I&#x27;m the kinda girl that uses it EVERY day. So I immediately started reading reviews to pick out my next straightener, I read so many I couldn&#x27;t just pick one so I went to Walmart ( because I couldn&#x27;t spend a 100 on a flat iron at the moment) and I found this!!!! I was very hesitant at first cause while in Walmart I pulled it up to check out reviews and seen some good some bad. Well I bought it and it works great on my hair. I have thick long wavy hair. Anyhow... Hope this helps y&#x27;all â™¥</li>
            <li> this is my THIRD infinity pro conair flat iron and I love it.  It perhaps does not last as long as it should but for the time that it lasts it is absolutely wonderful.  It is very hot (and has heat controls) and has a nice tight grip without damaging your hair.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I really love this iron. I searched reviews to see what was the best one in this price range and this was the one and I agree. Only downfall I can say is that there is no cool spot on it to hold such as at the top and it gets really hot. I put mine at hottest setting, though, so if you turn it down some it should be better. But works great and I really love it!</li>
            <li> I have REALLY curly hair.  I&#x27;m 30, and I&#x27;ve never been able to straighten my hair on my own (not for lack of trying the last 15 years).  This iron is amazing--- stick straight results that are soft and not frizzy.  Wahoooo!  It gets really hot, which is key.  Plus, it is goof-proof for girls who are accident prone.  I usually burn my head, but somehow the dainty (but powerful) iron shape has kept me burn free.</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron and the price is just right. It doesnt leave ur fair flat it makes it bouncy and beautiful.</li>
            <li> The straightener broke after 1 month... So dissappointing, I do not recommend this product, it is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I didnt buy mine here but had to write a review. LOVE this thing! I have naturally wavy, fuzzy hair and this flat iron makes my hair feel like silk. I also love how long the plates are. It cuts styling time way down. It heats up lightning fast and is very durable. This is absolutely worth every centand I paid about $15 more than what it is listed for here.</li>
            <li> I have always had Chi, GHD, and Paul Mitchel straighteners. I haven&#x27;t bought one at a store like Fred Meyer or Target in many years. My last straightener I had was a Paul Mitchel, and I paid $99 for it. I was very devestated about that. I got a perm so I wouldn&#x27;t have to buy a new straightener, and after a year of not having one, I went to Fred Meyer, and got the Infiniti Pro Conair. It works perfect for my hair. I am very impressed especially for the price. I would reccomend this straightener to anyone on a budget looking for a great straightener!</li>
            <li> This was a huge disappointment. The irons do not close properly unledd I fill them with ahuge amount of hair...I have thick hair to begin with, but I have to press really hard to make the irons meet.  This does not work if you are trying to achieve a sleek do.  My hair is fairly straight to begin with and I mostly wanted this for a smooth straight look. I chose wrong?? I would not recommend this also because if you are not careful it is very easy to burn the fingers....it needs to be held at the very tip of the rods only</li>
            <li> Nothing special. Breaks pieces of my hair off. No different than my other straightner. just not happy with it. return</li>
            <li> Best little flat iron for the money. Works as well as the $100 Hai I bought for my daughter. That one broke, she uses this one now.</li>
            <li> Love it! Gets nice and hot and straightens well</li>
            <li> This iron is okay.  I guess with the stellar reviews I expected more.  For years I&#x27;ve used an Ozon that cost $90, but decided to try a cheaper one this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as how it works, there is nothing outstanding about it.  The various temps are shown as numbers, which is ridiculous.  I&#x27;d much prefer actual temps.  There is some part of this iron toward the cord end that pinches me sometimes, pretty hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my main complaint is that when you plug it in, it defaults to OFF.  I&#x27;m not used to that, and it doesn&#x27;t make sense.  Obviously, if you plug the thing in, you plan to use it.  Why add a second step to the process?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like that it turns off after about an hour.  That way you never have to worry about whether you left it plugged in.  It heats up fairly quickly, depending on the temp you have it set on, so coming back to an iron that has turned off isn&#x27;t that much of a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a decent iron for a decent price, but I might try a different brand next time.</li>
            <li> Love it heats fast and works great, smooth shiny hair just jot I want it!</li>
            <li> Ok for this price it is amazing, it really does the job tremendously well! I&#x27;m very impressed with this iron it&#x27;s like my old chi</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this for over a month and loves it. If she&#x27;s happy I&#x27;m happy. Thanks Conair!</li>
            <li> I loved it. I bought it to make my hair curly. It works for it perfectly.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite straightener. I have really thick, wavy hair, and found that it was too thin for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair, not thin or thick, but this iron gets the job done and was a great price! I use this more than the expensive flat iron my daughter bought me for Christmas. I like how it&#x27;s thin and doesn&#x27;t take very long to warm up.</li>
            <li> I like the product but came without box and the paint was peeling in some places</li>
            <li> Heats quickly, glides through hair easily, makes my thick coarse hair soft, smooth, &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s harder on my hair than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I love it is... my hair is beautiful..</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron. It&#x27;s a great price and it works just as well if not better than the chi I have had previously. I have had several other flat irons and this is my favorite yet.</li>
            <li> I have a very similar flat iron that I bought from Costco, but it&#x27;s red.. this is almost the same, except that the on/off button is now concave which prevents the unit turning off when you accidentally touch the button.  An excellent improvement on an already great product.</li>
            <li> Very nice and doesn&#x27;t burn my very thin hair. I set the temperature to 15 and it is perfect. I have had my hair get burned in other flat irons. I love this one!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter, but have used it, too.  She loves it and I love it, too!  Great!</li>
            <li> much better than my old Chi</li>
            <li> GREAT iron!! I have 3 daughters with long full hair and i have bought 1 for each of them.. plus mine!</li>
            <li> This thing is a piece of junk. Save yourself some heartache and spend a little more money on quality. I have thick hair, but it&#x27;s short and this straightener couldn&#x27;t keep up. My hair is dry when I use it and the amount of frizz that appears after is frustrating. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little straightener with one problem. My hair is always getting pulled out where the iron part ends by the front. My daughter has the same problem with it. I&#x27;ve never had that happen with any other straightener. I try to keep my hair away from that end but I always end up pulling a few strands out. On the good side, this one is better in the sense that my hair seems sleeker and it works very fast.</li>
            <li> Works great for a flat iron in this price range. I love it.</li>
            <li> This flat iron does wonders I fell in love the first time I used it and not pricey at all! Highly recommend this flat iron to anyone!</li>
            <li> My daughter has very curly hair and wanted it straight this flat iron works great I want to get another one to have a spare when this one dies.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and it&#x27;s difficult to find a flat iron that allows me to add some body without damaging it.  This flat iron is the only one that I&#x27;ve found that does exactly what it says that it will.  It gets hot fast and does a great job if if I&#x27;m straightening or flipping my hair under. My mom used it when she was in for a visit and fell in love with it, too.  Great for fine hair... if you&#x27;ve been disappointed by flat irons in the past, give this one a try.  I doubt you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this straightener because it works a lot better than most of the others I have tried. I am mixed (black, white, Indian and more) so my hair is very hard to do anything with and this made it seem so easy. The package arrived earlier than expected which was great and it was in perfect condition. I am overall very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is nice and compact and does heat up VERY quickly. However, there are a couple of design flaws that are so unacceptable I had to buy a different model to replace this after less than a week! The power button is constantly being turned off and on if you hold this where you&#x27;d  naturally want to, ei the handle and if you move your hand up so that you don&#x27;t hit the power button, the heat plates (which are way to close to the edge) burn your hand. Also there is a gap between the heating plate and the plastic that catches in your hair and rips strands. Overall, a badly designed product. I purchased the remington keratin therapy iron and it&#x27;s far superior, though a little heavier and doesn&#x27;t heat as quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Remington-S8590-Keratin-Therapy-Straightener/dp/B007E0FQ1W/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1346366866&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;remington+keratin+therapy+flat+iron</li>
            <li> I have thick full bouncy curly hair and it&#x27;s difficult to find a flat iron that heats up warm enough.  This is a great flat iron.  It does the job and is effective.  I just wish they would implement some safety features.  Say for example:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most flat irons have a security feature built into them so if they&#x27;re exposed to water they shut off.  This does not have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A fair majority of flat irons have a shut off timer built into them.  This one does not have it.  If you walk away from it and forget you may find your counter top on fire or melted.  If you use it in the bathroom, leave the light on or fan if you decide to walk away.  Better yet have a timer set for &#x27;x&#x27; number of minutes.  I found this very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to a friend but with some warnings.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Conair, and this iron lives up to its reputation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it&#x27;s lightweight, heats fast, doesn&#x27;t catch on hair. It&#x27;s your basic, no frills iron.</li>
            <li> I needed to find an affordable flat iron that got the job done. I researched tourmaline and found that irons having this gets hair straighter for a longer period of time than just ceramic alone. I typed \\&quot;tourmaline\\&quot; into the search engine and this product came up. After ordering this product it came in the mail after 3 days which was great since I did the super saver shipping. It&#x27;s shiny and the right color; has great grip. I am an African American with fairly course hair so I can&#x27;t wait to see how this product straightens my hair. I actually tried it on my mother&#x27;s hair and it worked great. It straightens well and it can also curl!!! It leaves hair with a great shine if you apply a little bit of the argon oil before blow drying. It heats up as fast as it said it would and the heat settings are pretty effective. It is pretty long and the plates don&#x27;t completely meet all of the way but this would be the only downfall. You just have to squeeze the iron harder when straightening. It still leaves hair straight and I put the temp. on 21 when it goes up to 30. Overall this product is a 4 out of 5 and I would definitely recommend this flat iron to anyone on a budget!!!</li>
            <li> When I first purchased this flat iron I loved it, but after using it for a few months it is severely damaging my hair. I have short thick hair that straightens easily, and I had a Chi (which I loved) but it broke. This flat iron has caused me short, broken pieces and extremely frizzed out and damaged sections towards the from of my hair. My hair stylist told me to ditch it right away! Decent price but not worth the consequences.</li>
            <li> Ive got extremely thick hair and normally need a wide straightener to get the job done. Well a friend had this exact straightener and told me it was awesome, so instead of spending the $45 in stores I ordered it offline. I used it for the first time last night and couldn&#x27;t be happier. Only took 15 minutes to straightener all of my hair, when it normally takes at least an hour. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Came in a timely matter good flat irons but they do not get as hot as they say they do</li>
            <li> This is a great Flat iron, I would strongly recommend this product. The iron heats up very quickly is easy to handle and straightens the hair perfectly.</li>
            <li> I had a CHI and it broke within a little over a year of purchasing it.  CHI would not cover it with their warranttee b/c it was purchased here on Amazon and not through an authorized retailer.  That was the second CHI I have owned.  I loved both of them, but could not justify another $100 on a straightener.  So I read some reviews and found the Conair Infiniti Pro came highly recommended and at less than $40 I figured I would give it a try.  I LOVE IT!  I think it works better than my CHI ever did.  My hair is naturally curly and can be somewhat unruly to straighten but this was quick and easy.  My hair comes out smooth, shiny and not frizzy at all.  I would recommend this over a CHI or I borrowed a friend&#x27;s T3 from Sephora and I would recommend this over that any day!!</li>
            <li> I just bought this at a local CVS because I didn&#x27;t want to wait to receive mine. I love it! Works exactly like the Babyliss Nano Titanium that&#x27;s over one hundred dollars! Don&#x27;t listen to the people saying it burns your hair off, all straighteners damage your hair and that&#x27;s what heat protection sprays are for. This product receives 5 stars from me! Also, mine came with a little bottle of Argan Oil. I&#x27;m not sure if this one does but if it does, do NOT use too much on your hair at one time, you don&#x27;t want it to be greasy. 5 Stars! :)</li>
            <li> Works great!  Heats up fast and straightens with no problem.</li>
