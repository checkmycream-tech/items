            <li>This blush color is nice</li>
            <li>I also think this product would look good on most skin tones/types.</li>
            <li>This shows nicely, and it compliments my skin tone.</li>
            <li>so I just use my own make-up brush.</li>
            <li>The color is perfect for my super-pale skin (I purchased the soft rose color).</li>
            <li>Ordering off the internet, I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would be an appropriate color for my fair complexion</li>
            <li>This is the best blush I have encountered thus far.</li>
            <li>Very light on skin.</li>
            <li>LOVE L&#x27;OREAL PRODUCTS.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting it to be much more compact.  </li>
            <li>The blush that this replaced for me was in a much more compact container.  </li>
            <li>, I suppose it is OK.</li>
            <li>I really love this because it does not get &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34; and obvious.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li>Love the built-</li>
            <li>I just have to apply it more than twice.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it here.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>LOVE the color</li>
            <li>Love it otherwise.</li>
            <li>I could just build up on it and with a couple swipes more</li>
            <li>Gives even the most anemic skin (mine)</li>
            <li>a healthy, rosy glow.  </li>
            <li>I love the design of the packaging and how it allows me to keep the brush and blush all in one place.  </li>
            <li>I actually really love this blush, my issue is with the product that was sent to me.</li>
            <li>love the way it looks.</li>
            <li>Sheer, healthy glow!!!</li>
            <li>Easy application, love the brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite blush and the best I&#x27;ve had so far</li>
            <li>Easily to apply.</li>
            <li>how it applies so easily.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily, stays on all day.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and blends well.</li>
            <li>very easy to use and gives just the right amount of color.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant about the brush, but it works fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not ever worth the very cheap price.  </li>
            <li>THIS IS FANTASTIC</li>
            <li>light and natural.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like my blushes light, but this one is almost not even noticeable.  </li>
            <li>looks fabulous.</li>
            <li>It feels light and does not go on heavy!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Last forever and goes on smooth!!!</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m not completely disappointed in my purchase.  </li>
            <li>The packaging does not match the picture and I am pretty sure I was sent a knock off brand.</li>
            <li>Still, the color is very natural and nice.  </li>
            <li>The brush&#x27;s bristles are so soft it feels really nice on the face.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Soft Rose in this blush.</li>
            <li>I was using the true match blush that comes in a compact, and even though that colour was lighter I&#x27;d had to apply it a couple times for it to show.</li>
            <li>Which is fine, because then I don&#x27;t need to use a whole lot.</li>
            <li>Blends very well, applies light or darker if you choose.</li>
            <li>I used to buy this brand all the time (I rarely use makeup), but needed some blush for an event.</li>
            <li>Worth the struggle to use it, but I will probably not buy I gain.</li>
            <li>I love the L&#x27;Oreal mineral makeup because it does not cause my sensitive skin to break out.</li>
            <li>Whoever designed it honestly must have been drinking on the job, and they definitely didn&#x27;t test the packaging before production.</li>
            <li>So this whole process of using a litte powder, than applying and then trying to get more powder takes alot to apply to my whole face.</li>
            <li>just right .I</li>
            <li>I am very fair and the soft pink is a nice touch of color- natural and not harsh.</li>
            <li>The quality is just the same, but this one is better priced.</li>
            <li>and once again most of the excess powder would fall off outside the container.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m happy with the product, and it should last me a long time.</li>
            <li>Gone on easy Be sure and shake the brush so it does not go on too heavy.</li>
            <li>only thing I don&#x27;t like much is the brush that comes with the blush (though truthfully because it came with the blush i didn&#x27;t have too much hope for it)</li>
            <li>I used Bare Minerals for years and decided to try this line to save some money and have been very happily surprised and satisfied.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>the rings under my eyes become very pronounced.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s one of the only brushes that can fit in the blush container and get the powder and the moment you need to tap it to remove the excess powder</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the brush</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for have this product.</li>
            <li>This is a fine blush and the brush is ok too; however, I&#x27;d rather use my other blush brush with a longer handle and think next time I&#x27;ll probably return to a compact holder of blush.</li>
            <li>and how long it lasts- even better than the Bare Minerals line</li>
            <li>You also have to pack an entirely different brush because some of the powder inevitably gets stuck on the top of the lid.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot of work and kind of a pain, but I&#x27;ll do it because it&#x27;s a good product and much less expensive.</li>
            <li>I bought this to hold me off on the expensive blush I was originally using (\\&quot;glee\\&quot; by Bare minerals) and I really like this one way better!</li>
            <li>I use a large blush brush that is long enough to fit in the cap, but I need to shake the blush into the cap.  </li>
            <li>It goes on light and smooth - a little goes a long way for us pale-skinned girls.  </li>
            <li>it came with because it is harder to clean</li>
            <li>It works nicely and is quite subtle</li>
            <li>It is a very soft pink/rose color with no peach or purple tones in it.</li>
            <li>Very natural looking.</li>
            <li>This blush is a really pretty color; however, it is extremely sheer.  </li>
            <li>It stays on all day and it looks so  natural!</li>
            <li>When you&#x27;re pressed for space in an apartment bathroom with only the medicine cabinet at your storage disposal, having something so compact is appreciated!</li>
            <li>The color and weight of the blush are great, but I&#x27;ve found similar colors for cheaper, as they don&#x27;t have the complicated packaging.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nowhere to pour it into except the clear plastic lid.</li>
            <li>If you try to swirl in the sifter/container, you will inevitably wind up with too much on your brush and product falling over the sides.</li>
            <li>I have two of these so far (one for back-up)</li>
            <li>I could swipe it on the apple of my cheeks and get a soft glow without looking like a clown or a rag doll.</li>
            <li>When I ordered it I loved how subtle it was!!</li>
            <li>Plus, on the few occasions I needed to get a full makeup</li>
            <li>Actually just removed the brush and used a separate (light and fluffy) blush brush.</li>
            <li>look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to order this blush and try it, but didn&#x27;t expect much because usually blushes are so strong that if i&#x27;d just swipe it on my cheeks softly i&#x27;d end up like a clown, because of how pale I am.</li>
            <li>Goes on just like Bare Minerals, but for less than half the price, so I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s hard for it to fall back INSIDE the container, most of it just falls outside and on the floor and trying to use a blush brush that wasn&#x27;t the one that came with the product</li>
            <li>I am 61 years old and have been trying different kinds of makeup for years.</li>
            <li>The pinched pink shade looks very god on me.</li>
            <li>I just use my Bare Minerals brush to apply it, which is a small-medium size, long-handled brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Gives a very subtle, but healthy looking glow~</li>
            <li>The color of the blush was great, but the brush applicator is stiff and unbending, making blush exceedingly difficult to apply.</li>
            <li>You cannot use the lid (like you do with Bare Minerals) to swirl and tap because it is too deep and the brush won&#x27;t reach inside.</li>
            <li>I bought my first one when I was 13, and only had to use a little every day.  </li>

            <li> I have two of these so far (one for back-up)</li>
            <li> I could swipe it on the apple of my cheeks and get a soft glow without looking like a clown or a rag doll.</li>
            <li> When I ordered it I loved how subtle it was!!</li>
            <li> Plus, on the few occasions I needed to get a full makeup</li>
            <li> Actually just removed the brush and used a separate (light and fluffy) blush brush.</li>
            <li> look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to order this blush and try it, but didn&#x27;t expect much because usually blushes are so strong that if i&#x27;d just swipe it on my cheeks softly i&#x27;d end up like a clown, because of how pale I am.</li>
            <li> Goes on just like Bare Minerals, but for less than half the price, so I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard for it to fall back INSIDE the container, most of it just falls outside and on the floor and trying to use a blush brush that wasn&#x27;t the one that came with the product</li>
            <li> I am 61 years old and have been trying different kinds of makeup for years.</li>
            <li> The pinched pink shade looks very god on me.</li>
            <li> I just use my Bare Minerals brush to apply it, which is a small-medium size, long-handled brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Gives a very subtle, but healthy looking glow~</li>
            <li> The color of the blush was great, but the brush applicator is stiff and unbending, making blush exceedingly difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> You cannot use the lid (like you do with Bare Minerals) to swirl and tap because it is too deep and the brush won&#x27;t reach inside.</li>
            <li> I bought my first one when I was 13, and only had to use a little every day.  </li>
            <li> Even using very little it looks very defined.</li>
            <li> so if you try to tap out some powder you&#x27;ll either lose half on the counter or lose some into this clear lid.</li>
            <li> was so hard because the container was too small for the brush to fit properly</li>
            <li> I have always had trouble with blush looking natural, until I bought this.  </li>
            <li> With this type of applicator, I&#x27;ve never had trouble with the blush looking natural...</li>
            <li> So, it&#x27;s really not that big of a deal.</li>
            <li> However, the application process takes so long</li>
            <li> however I would opt for the conventional flat blush next time</li>
            <li> Other than that, I would definitely recommend and I will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> I saved my Bare Minerals containers and I dump the contents from the L&#x27;Oreal products into them, a little at a time.</li>
            <li> Price was less than I usually pay and arrived very timely.</li>
            <li> I have always used loose powder</li>
            <li> so I thoughtI would like loose blush.</li>
            <li> This little jar can last you YEARS.  </li>
            <li> but I would look kind of sickly because of how pale</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> It needs a second small cover to contain the blush so you can use the brush.</li>
            <li> Will probably work well for winter time but will not show up on me during the other 3/4 time of the year.</li>
            <li> Thus unless you use an entirely other brush, that powder on the lid just falls out all over your counter-top while you attempt to use the stubby brush</li>
            <li> AGAIN not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Color is too dark and not like it shows.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is with the containers these items come in.</li>
            <li> I can bring it with me everywhere even if I only carry a very small bag or pouch.</li>
            <li> I am a person that has always believed that too much make up looks fake and thus I wear little to no make up</li>
            <li> I have wasted so much money on all of the expensive types of makeup which includes all of those infomercials that I watched in the wee hours of the morning.</li>
            <li> v The powder doesn&#x27;t get on the brush evenly causing a mess.</li>
            <li> Also, the container has those little holes (like a salt shaker) and it&#x27;s a little hard to get the product out without making a mess.</li>
            <li> But there are days when I need some kind of color to my face because as a student I have to pull all nighters and that does horrible things to my complexion because I look very pale and</li>
            <li> I like the texture of this blush, however the container makes it a little hard to use.</li>
            <li> This is a product I like and am unable to purchase it locally.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that the brush that comes with it is too small and awkward to handle.</li>
            <li> It is difficult for me to use this blush without making a small mess.  </li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t for the ridiculous packaging.</li>
            <li> I pour my blush powder into another container since the one it comes in is very frustrating to use if you don&#x27;t want to waste a lot of powder.</li>
            <li> No more broken blush!  </li>
            <li> So dumb.</li>
            <li> This blush is barely visible and the container design is awful.</li>
            <li> Weird system.</li>
            <li> The brush is stubby and useless, but is permanently attached to the lid, so you HAVE to keep it, meaning it just takes up valuable space in my drawer or make-up bag.</li>
            <li> Crazy.</li>
            <li> I am sorry they are going to discontinue them!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The best makeup that I have found that works best for me. I am 61 years old and have been trying different kinds of makeup for years. I have wasted so much money on all of the expensive types of makeup which includes all of those infomercials that I watched in the wee hours of the morning.</li>
            <li> LOVE L&#x27;OREAL PRODUCTS.  THIS IS FANTASTIC JUST AS FACE POWDER WITH OWN BRUSH.  NOT LOOKING FOR APPLICATOR.  GREAT FOR TRAVEL AND OF COURSE HOME</li>
            <li> Gone on easy Be sure and shake the brush so it does not go on too heavy.</li>
            <li> Ordering off the internet, I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would be an appropriate color for my fair complexion but it is perfect.  I also use it as eyeshadow. Blends very well, applies light or darker if you choose. Easy application, love the brush.</li>
            <li> very easy to use and gives just the right amount of color.</li>
            <li> I had read some reviews about &#x27;how compact&#x27; it was ... and &#x27;perfect for my purse&#x27;... I guess everything is relative.  I was expecting it to be much more compact.  The blush that this replaced for me was in a much more compact container.  Other than that, I suppose it is OK.</li>
            <li> I have always had trouble with blush looking natural, until I bought this.  No more broken blush!  With this type of applicator, I&#x27;ve never had trouble with the blush looking natural...and I love the color!</li>
            <li> I really love this because it does not get &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34; and obvious.&lt;br /&gt;Its light and natural.&lt;br /&gt;Gives a very subtle, but healthy looking glow~</li>
            <li> Very light on skin. Easily to apply. Love the built- in brush!</li>
            <li> The color of the blush was great, but the brush applicator is stiff and unbending, making blush exceedingly difficult to apply. Actually just removed the brush and used a separate (light and fluffy) blush brush. The color and weight of the blush are great, but I&#x27;ve found similar colors for cheaper, as they don&#x27;t have the complicated packaging.</li>
            <li> This blush is a really pretty color; however, it is extremely sheer.  I find that I have to apply it four to five times to make it show up.  I like my blushes light, but this one is almost not even noticeable.  However, I&#x27;m not completely disappointed in my purchase.  I just have to apply it more than twice.  So, it&#x27;s really not that big of a deal.</li>
            <li> As a latina user I was hoping for a richer tone, this wasnt it. The quality is good. Too big for a purse.</li>
            <li> I love these products! I am sorry they are going to discontinue them!</li>
            <li> This blush color is nice however I would opt for the conventional flat blush next time v The powder doesn&#x27;t get on the brush evenly causing a mess.</li>
            <li> The pinched pink shade looks very god on me. I like that it&#x27;s so compact and one-piece. I can bring it with me everywhere even if I only carry a very small bag or pouch. The brush&#x27;s bristles are so soft it feels really nice on the face.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Does not stay on all day though.  Still, the color is very natural and nice.  I pour my blush powder into another container since the one it comes in is very frustrating to use if you don&#x27;t want to waste a lot of powder.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, has a great colour, the brush size is ideal for the blush and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this brand all the time (I rarely use makeup), but needed some blush for an event. I&#x27;m glad I bought it here. It is a great product and a good price. The color is perfect for my super-pale skin (I purchased the soft rose color). I like the softness of the brush and how it applies so easily.</li>
            <li> This is the best blush I have encountered thus far. I am and wil be a customer for life for this product</li>
            <li> Have been using this mineral blush for years. Love it.</li>
            <li> It is difficult for me to use this blush without making a small mess.  I use a large blush brush that is long enough to fit in the cap, but I need to shake the blush into the cap.  The product goes on evenly and lasts all day. Worth the struggle to use it, but I will probably not buy I gain.</li>
            <li> This blush is barely visible and the container design is awful. You have to tap the blush into the lid which is the BACK of the brush. It makes no sense. It needs a second small cover to contain the blush so you can use the brush. The blush ends up on the underside of the brush. Crazy.</li>
            <li> What a pain in the a.. to get out of the bottle.  Goes everywhere.  LOVE the color but the container is ridic!</li>
            <li> AGAIN not worth the money.  Color is too dark and not like it shows.  It&#x27;s not ever worth the very cheap price.  You do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Soft Rose in this blush. It is a very soft pink/rose color with no peach or purple tones in it. I am very fair and the soft pink is a nice touch of color- natural and not harsh. I love the L&#x27;Oreal mineral makeup because it does not cause my sensitive skin to break out. I used Bare Minerals for years and decided to try this line to save some money and have been very happily surprised and satisfied. I like the way it goes on and how long it lasts- even better than the Bare Minerals line (and that&#x27;s saying something). My only complaint is with the containers these items come in. It is so NOT user friendly!!! You cannot use the lid (like you do with Bare Minerals) to swirl and tap because it is too deep and the brush won&#x27;t reach inside. If you try to swirl in the sifter/container, you will inevitably wind up with too much on your brush and product falling over the sides. It&#x27;s a nightmare! Who thought of this? Did they even do a trial run??? Weird system. My solution? I saved my Bare Minerals containers and I dump the contents from the L&#x27;Oreal products into them, a little at a time. It&#x27;s a lot of work and kind of a pain, but I&#x27;ll do it because it&#x27;s a good product and much less expensive. The container/dispensing problem is the ONLY reason I deducted one star for my review. Love it otherwise.</li>
            <li> I wear the mineral powder just about every day and it accents my cheeks just right .I love this product!</li>
            <li> I like the texture of this blush, however the container makes it a little hard to use.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal products don&#x27;t disappoint me.  I have discovered I like the mineral brush on products and the cheek blush is just great.</li>
            <li> This is a great color if you are very fair skinned. Wish they had placed that somewhere in the description.  Will probably work well for winter time but will not show up on me during the other 3/4 time of the year.</li>
            <li> The blush is great. Goes on just like Bare Minerals, but for less than half the price, so I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with the product. I would give it 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t for the ridiculous packaging. Whoever designed it honestly must have been drinking on the job, and they definitely didn&#x27;t test the packaging before production. The brush is stubby and useless, but is permanently attached to the lid, so you HAVE to keep it, meaning it just takes up valuable space in my drawer or make-up bag. You also have to pack an entirely different brush because some of the powder inevitably gets stuck on the top of the lid. Thus unless you use an entirely other brush, that powder on the lid just falls out all over your counter-top while you attempt to use the stubby brush it came with. So dumb. But great blush!</li>
            <li> Been using it for years. Very natural looking.</li>
            <li> I have two of these so far (one for back-up) this product is great!! It stays on all day and it looks so  natural! I bought this to hold me off on the expensive blush I was originally using (\\&quot;glee\\&quot; by Bare minerals) and I really like this one way better! The quality is just the same, but this one is better priced. I also think this product would look good on most skin tones/types. I have medium-tan skin and the \\&quot;Rose\\&quot; blush looks fabulous. The only negative is that the brush that comes with it is too small and awkward to handle. I just use my Bare Minerals brush to apply it, which is a small-medium size, long-handled brush. Also, the container has those little holes (like a salt shaker) and it&#x27;s a little hard to get the product out without making a mess. Other than that, I would definitely recommend and I will be purchasing again! It&#x27;s my new favorite blush and the best I&#x27;ve had so far</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I am a person that has always believed that too much make up looks fake and thus I wear little to no make up (I only wear my eyeliner and concealer). But there are days when I need some kind of color to my face because as a student I have to pull all nighters and that does horrible things to my complexion because I look very pale and the rings under my eyes become very pronounced. I usually only wore the concealer and the eyeliner but I would look kind of sickly because of how pale I&#x27;d look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to order this blush and try it, but didn&#x27;t expect much because usually blushes are so strong that if i&#x27;d just swipe it on my cheeks softly i&#x27;d end up like a clown, because of how pale I am. When I ordered it I loved how subtle it was!! I could swipe it on the apple of my cheeks and get a soft glow without looking like a clown or a rag doll. Plus, on the few occasions I needed to get a full makeup (eg. Halloween) I could just build up on it and with a couple swipes more I&#x27;d get a stronger colour. I&#x27;m really happy with the product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like much is the brush that comes with the blush (though truthfully because it came with the blush i didn&#x27;t have too much hope for it) but it&#x27;s one of the only brushes that can fit in the blush container and get the powder and the moment you need to tap it to remove the excess powder it&#x27;s hard for it to fall back INSIDE the container, most of it just falls outside and on the floor and trying to use a blush brush that wasn&#x27;t the one that came with the product was so hard because the container was too small for the brush to fit properly and once again most of the excess powder would fall off outside the container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides that it&#x27;s really awesome!!</li>
            <li> I have always used loose powder so I thoughtI would like loose blush. I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep looking to find one I like.</li>
            <li> 13 bucks at walmart 2-3 bucks on amazon ..Yes please and thank you because this is the only color blush I wear</li>
            <li> Gorgeous color.  It goes on light and smooth - a little goes a long way for us pale-skinned girls.  Gives even the most anemic skin (mine) a healthy, rosy glow.  I love the design of the packaging and how it allows me to keep the brush and blush all in one place.  When you&#x27;re pressed for space in an apartment bathroom with only the medicine cabinet at your storage disposal, having something so compact is appreciated!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;soft rose&amp;#34;, but it&#x27;s darker than I was expecting it. Which is fine, because then I don&#x27;t need to use a whole lot. I was using the true match blush that comes in a compact, and even though that colour was lighter I&#x27;d had to apply it a couple times for it to show. This shows nicely, and it compliments my skin tone. Even using very little it looks very defined. So I&#x27;m happy with the product, and it should last me a long time. I was hesitant about the brush, but it works fine.</li>
            <li> This is a fine blush and the brush is ok too; however, I&#x27;d rather use my other blush brush with a longer handle and think next time I&#x27;ll probably return to a compact holder of blush.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the brush it came with because it is harder to clean so I just use my own make-up brush.</li>
            <li> The item arrived on time. I like it! I like the color. There&#x27;s no instructions on how to use it. It is bulky in my purse.</li>
            <li> Price was less than I usually pay and arrived very timely.</li>
            <li> I actually really love this blush, my issue is with the product that was sent to me. The packaging does not match the picture and I am pretty sure I was sent a knock off brand.</li>
            <li> This is a product I like and am unable to purchase it locally. Seems as though I find makeup I like and I go back to repurchase and the stores no longer carry it. Thanks Amazon for have this product.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves it.</li>
            <li> Lovely blush! Sheer, healthy glow!!! Beautiful color.&lt;br /&gt;I love the way it looks. Goes on easily, stays on all day.</li>
            <li> This is the best blush!!! Last forever and goes on smooth!!! I wear the foundation too!!! It feels light and does not go on heavy!!!&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend!!! A++++++++++</li>
            <li> I like how this looks and the color blends well with my skin. However, the application process takes so long and I end up losing some of the powder. There&#x27;s nowhere to pour it into except the clear plastic lid. But that doesn&#x27;t screw onto the jar (only over the brush) so if you try to tap out some powder you&#x27;ll either lose half on the counter or lose some into this clear lid. Since the lid doesn&#x27;t line up, some will fall out and the lid is so deep that any left inside you can&#x27;t reach with the brush. So this whole process of using a litte powder, than applying and then trying to get more powder takes alot to apply to my whole face.</li>
            <li> This little jar can last you YEARS.  I bought my first one when I was 13, and only had to use a little every day.  I didn&#x27;t have to replace it until around 17!</li>
            <li> It works nicely and is quite subtle</li>
            <li> This powder blush works well with my skin tone. It is easy to apply and blends well. It arrived on time and was in good condition.</li>
