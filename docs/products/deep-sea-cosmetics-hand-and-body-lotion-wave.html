            <li>The fragrance is heavenly, the lotion absorbs quickly, does not leave a sticky or greasy residue and makes skin smooth and supple.</li>
            <li>Its nice to have two lotions rotate in my daily routine.</li>
            <li>brand kept my skin feeling fresh out of the shower feeling.</li>
            <li>This lotion smells nice but doesn&#x27;t absorb like many other high priced lotions.  </li>
            <li>really love this product and plan to continue using for as long as its available.</li>
            <li>Remarkably light and refreshing on winter dry skin.</li>
            <li>Traditionally my sensitive Irish fair skin has been allergic to lotions of all sorts, after trying a friends</li>
            <li>And priced very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and lasts better than other body creams.</li>
            <li>I am going to order more of their products and use them as my signature product for facial care.</li>
            <li>Dead Sea brand is good</li>
            <li>We have tried so many different hand cream products none of which really worked.</li>
            <li>thank you very much!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>It felt like a deep moisturizer, with a clean scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve pretty much thrown out all of my other lotions including the special news formulated for eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>almost instantly it made your hands soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It is gentle and does not irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Its nice not to thick and absorbs well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a typical aveeno kind of girl, but a co-worker of mine bought a bunch of deep sea cosmetics, I tried it</li>
            <li>I LOve the dead sea lotion it keeps my body so soft</li>
            <li>When applied before bedtime my hands are still soft in the morning!</li>
            <li>I work with fabric which makes my hands dry, and my fingers actually peel...since using this product, I have noticed a huge difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>You use a little, rub it in, and it makes your skin feel so smooth.</li>
            <li>and I even in the swimming pool twice a week with chlorine and it keeps my body soft.</li>
            <li>it leaves my skin so soft</li>
            <li>Soft but not sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After using for nearly a month will definitely repurchase and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>My skin didnt react to it which is a plus, and the price on amazon (not the places at the mall) were reasonable to other lotions at any store.</li>
            <li>No harsh fragrance and it soothes and moisturizes my dry skin.</li>
            <li>I find it very interesting that the lowest point of the earth, the Dead Sea, can offer such healing properties to our skin and offer such regenerative agencies against the debilitating influences of too much sun and cold.</li>
